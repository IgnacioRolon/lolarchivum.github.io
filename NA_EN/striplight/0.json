Its not an issue due to \"have you reinstalled your game\" or \"make sure the latest driver is installed\"  Im not sure what exactly causes the issue but im 100% sure it´s due to the patch, maybe something around the new animations? i dont know. wouldnt be the first time a buggy coded animation would crash games like a random graves smokescreen imcoming who halfes your fps for months or years. \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about the 7.22 performance, and ive read this on pretty much all of people posts about it. it´s not spikey. \r\nWe dont have fps-lag spikes or \"drops\" like people usually see in games. Itzs a consistent thing that gets lower over time no matter how many animations are on screen at a given time. \r\n\r\nI could literally start a new game, dont move at all and just look at my fountain for 30minutes and i will start out with 140+fps and will end up at 38fps after said 30minutes while not fighting at all, while not looking at anything else than the fountain.  Its a curve that gradually decreases and it not spiking.  For example at around 30minutes i simply cant go over 40fps anymore no matter what i do, if i m dead, i f look at my fountain zoomed in, if i teamfight. it doesnt matter.  the longer the game gioes the lower the overall fps will be and this needs to be fixed ASAP because this will makle the game pretty much unplayable for so many people.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T05:22:27.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that we just think all of the problems are on the player's side, it's just that we need to do general troubleshooting to get the basics out of the way. It never feels good to rack your brain for hours about a problem only to realize it was the simplest fix that you skipped because \"it couldn't be that\". If we ever suggest something, please don't assume that's the final step, we always have other options to explore and letting us know that X or Y didn't help will point us closer to the answer.\n\nWith that out of the way, I know you're gonna hate me for this, but do make sure you've checked for driver updates as usual. I'm willing to bet this isn't the case with your explanation, but like I said it's good to get this stuff outta the way first. After that, try turning on low-spec mode and test those out in a custom game for me. \n\nIf these options aren't helping at all, that will at least point our tech in the right direction to figure this out. Reach out to them in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some game logs if this doesn't help so they can dig a little deeper with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alimentateur","date":"2017-11-16T14:18:51.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds to be that your graphic card sucks ass. \nstill getting the same fps as before (110-289), but my current connection cant handle rito giving others a bigger piece of the cake so my ping easily ends up around 350ms to 8000ms (3G connection from my phone cant handle rito's shitty setup)\n(3G is normally around 78ms and 4G 35ms for me)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhilipN","date":"2017-11-15T15:55:40.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit Ctrl+Alt+Del to see what's using so much extra memory.
