Which i disagree with - Graves was more fed than the Jhin. Graves had 11950 gold worth of items + baron. Jhin had 11050. \n\nAnd lets look at what happened - Jhin has a horrible build (building only 20% crit? Graves had more crit than Jhin did). Also, Jhin decided to walk into melee range of Graves while reloading. This means 2 things - 1) You get hit by more pellets, so graves does more damage to you than if you stayed at max autoattack range, and 2) you cant attack during those 2.5 seconds anyway so it was free damage. Jhin is not a dualing ADC. Standing there attacking a champion with lifesteal/crit/damage/attack speed isnt the way to play Jhin. He relies on kiting and poking (Which again, goes to build - getting a zeal item allows you to move a large distance between crits so graves cant continuously auto you). \n\nNext Jhin got hit with the second part of Graves Q. That shouldnt happen. \n\nJhin attacked a minion with his 2nd to last bullet. \n\nJhin decided to W (which has a long cast animation) instead of getting his last auto which would have done around 1500 damage. Autoing would have gotten the kill since Graves was at around 500 health. Instead, Jhin decides to cast his W (which he missed anyway). \n\nSkarner played that wrong. Skarner should position himself between the Graves and the Jhin. Grave's autos cant go past units, so Skarner could have blocked every single auto if he was positioned correctly. Skarner went zero damage. Why wasnt he soaking damage?\n________________________________\n\nIf you look at the other side, Graves played that perfectly. He kited away from the Jhin during his reloading, and flash-Auto x2 in melee range.","replies":[{"poster":"ayNigerianPrince","date":"2016-03-30T01:55:24.143+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"No other adc is able to do this, nor should they.
