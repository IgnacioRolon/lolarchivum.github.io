If you behave inappropriately in the group conversations of the Boards the moderators warn you then you can get banned from the Boards. If you behave inappropriately in game, the reason people make accounts in the first place, that's when bans from gameplay come out. Just as you can't be permanently banned for a racist Boards post (barring it being tied to something in game), you can't be banned for private chat outside the game. (Pre and post game lobby counts as part of the game)\n\nRiot's behavior is consistent on the subject. I think with the blocked feature it's acceptable. Then again, I rarely friend people I don't know in real life, so take that for what you will.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-07-19T19:02:09.008+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So OP instigated him for a response?
