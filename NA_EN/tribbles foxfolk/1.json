Sadly Arcade MF isn't gonna be on sale next month, but maybe in October. If you love the skin tho, just get it for the full price (or get the sona one as well while ur at it.) I have DJ sona myself and the bundle costs 675rp for me, cuz I'm only missing Sona~ But I'm not gonna buy it cuz DJ Sona is kinda the same only better xD","replies":[{"poster":"SKOBODO","date":"2015-08-21T20:34:11.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"October would be nice. I already have Mafia Miss Fortune, so I'm in no rush to get another MF skin, but I do like Arcade MIss Fortune. October or November would be okay with me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-20T20:17:12.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're not legacy, so they won't be going away anytime soon. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Tribbles Foxfolk","date":"2015-08-20T21:11:19.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=hxRU7PHR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-20T20:17:12.027+0000)\n>\n> They're not legacy, so they won't be going away anytime soon. :]\n\nGreat news!
