Besides Warden/Snowstorm there aren&#039;t any nontribal skins that let her stand out. I still want a neo-techie modern skin for an adc kinda like Pulsefire EZ, but more like Pax Sivir. .... what options do we have? hmmm\r\n\r\nCan we all just make a huge outcry to Riot to make this amazing skin becoming available again? I&#039;m sure there are other Sivir mains in the closet out there secretly wishing upon a star that Pax returns from neverland and grants us awesome gameplay visuals. Here&#039;s her video and you can see how that skin stands out from most any other in the game. The contrast is palpable. \r\nWe need it back Riot! Please give us Pax! :D\r\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT-vFyICaWo)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-12T19:08:12.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Bobajet! \n\nUnfortunately, we don't have plans to bring back the PAX skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Oerba No Naja","date":"2016-02-12T22:51:23.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"release new PAX skins ?","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-02-12T23:10:29.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would just recreate the problem all over again.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobajet","date":"2016-02-13T01:14:09.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that the skin has been vaulted for 4 years. another opportunity to win or buy it would be welcome.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bobajet","date":"2016-02-12T14:37:14.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True a Sivir Project skin would be amazing!
