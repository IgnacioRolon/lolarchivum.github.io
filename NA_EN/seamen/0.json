I restarted my client and attempted to reconnect multiple times (three times to be exact) and made sure my internet was working and I got the same error message. After three attempts, the after game screen (remake) showed up along with my angry teammates' comments ('report ez pls' etc.) I find it unfair that I am being punished for leaving/AFK due to the client being buggy and I am willing to cooperate and provide as much information as possible if it means fixing the issue. We all know the EUNE server has been extremely buggy for the past few days and players shouldn't be punished because of unfixed bugs\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSeaman","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-31T23:31:55.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [Leaverbuster System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats all leaves equally because regardless of intention, any disconnection impacts 9 other players in the match. \n\nThe guide that *Rineyy* linked is a good starting point in resolving this issue for good. Most situations where you're unable to connect to a game will be caused by an unstable connection to the server. The connection guide that was linked will take you through the most common solutions. \n\nLet me know if you still see connection issues after working through that guide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfman2K14","date":"2016-08-01T14:15:13.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A workaround for the Failed to Connect error after the Champ select is to wait on the black screen until you see the error pop up or hear the sound if it is in the background. Do not press retry or cancel just press Esc to close the error message then on the League window you should see a box with the option to Reconnect. Use this to try to reconnect to the game instead.
