(Windows)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me about 3 days ago, it said Unable To Connect To Chat Service, I did all sorts of things, but I finally got it off my chest. I will tell you how to fix it right now. There are 2 ways to fix it, but if they don't work, there is another solution if you want to play with friends but the bug is in the way.\r\n1) Press the windows key and search up \"cmd\" without the quotation marks of course , run it is an administrator and type in: \"ipconfig /flushdns\" again without the quotation marks. Reload the chat manually and you should have it fixed.\r\n2) Just wait 1 or 2 days, it should go away by itself.\r\n3) If those two did not help but you still want to play with some friends? Go make a party room, and under Invite players you don't see anyone but on the right side you can type in someones name and it will add the invitation list, type in the name of you're friends IGN and make sure you spell it right, after that press invite and it should invite them. If nothing helped I am sorry but you can't find help here. Bye.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-19T15:18:09.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reaching out and trying to help others having a similar issue!  Some players on EUW not being able to connect to chat is currently a known issue, and being worked on!  We'll be providing updates on this in our [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#euw) page.  Some players were also able to workaround this for now by logging off the Friends App.  Hopefully, that might help as well!","replies":[]}]}
