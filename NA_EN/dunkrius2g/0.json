That is mistake #1 because it should be blue. \n\nhere is the picture if you guys have a problem in finding it:\n\n#2: Darius has the ability to get 5 stacks on an opponent. We all know this but what might not seem to make sense is that the 5 Stack bleed Indicator above the enemy&#039;s head is RED not BLUE. In the video, i show you a better alternative. I will post a picture where it shows red and the video will show blue but there is yet another problem.\n\nThis shows the new change.\nhttp://imgur.com/f4dVNpH\n\nThis shows LIVE Woad King Darius\n\nhttp://imgur.com/YViy9wZ\n\n#3: The same picture that shows for #2 has one big problem. The line the crosses between the 5 stack axe bleed indicator has a red color BUT it should be BLUE! And the whole icon is covered in RED when it is supposed to be blue!!\nhttp://imgur.com/f4dVNpH\n\n#4: This is something I would love that Riot would fix so here it goes. In this Image, Darius uses Apprehend but there is some particles that shows it to be red when it should be pure blue ONLY when in Noxian Might. I don't mind that it is red when Darius isn't in Noxian might but why is there both color in Noxian Might? Doesn't makes sense. Also Bioforge Darius has the same problem with this. If this can be changed, ill be happy but that is a long shot.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gtYiYNJ\n\nSo Riot please, this has been my 3rd post on this and i have seen no responses at all. I will link those posts too.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/PQKAlVhw-riot-fix-dariuss-5-stack-bleed-indicator-for-woad-king-skin\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/ZLGwGsVN-woad-king-dariuss-5-stack-bleed-indicator-does-not-match-its-particles","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Phoenix","date":"2016-01-27T21:12:35.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dunkrius2g, sorry for not seeing your posts sooner.
