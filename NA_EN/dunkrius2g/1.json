Remember that this isnt a buff, this is just here for clarity. sometimes i can calculate it easily BUT for clarity issues it wouldnt be a problem right? Mundo&#039;s ULt i believe got this clarity fix. So whoever in the Red Riot group does the clarity fixes.. is there a possibility that my {{champion:122}} gets this plz c=??? Thanks\n\n\nEDIT: While you are at it Rito can you add the potential damage Darius can do with his bleed? I think you can do the same with Twitch's passive (correct me if i am wrong). NEW FIX: Darius will deal e.g 135 magic damage over 5 seconds when you have 5 stacks of hemmorhage on a target. Same thing for Twitch for \"clarity\". it is better than me trying to calculate it (even  though i am fine with that). \n\nOLD: (Assuming Darius starts with 86 AD level 1) **Darius' basic attacks and damaging abilities cause enemies to bleed for 12+ (9) magic damage over 5 seconds**\n\nNEW: (Assuming Darius has 86 AD level 1) **Darius's basic attacks and damaging abilities cause enemies to bleed for 12+(9) magic damage over 5 seconds (105) magic damage in total.**\n\n2nd EDIT: If there are Champions that fit under this category, then by all means, please list them c:","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-27T04:33:39.895+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love how you go so far to make sure people know you aren't proposing a buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-27T15:00:46.331+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have to with Darius, or these children will cry about how OP he is","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-04-27T15:15:50.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ you just took it right out of my mouth.

His entire theme revolves around spreading terror ( which he succesfully does and inherently makes his gameplay somewhat toxic) and he definitely has clear strengths (close range wood chipper) and weaknesses (extremely kitable when pull is on cooldown) but I feel that if you deal damage at close range you just can't deal with him at any stage of the ggame. Numbers wise, I believe his biggest problem is that he does magic and true damage that both scale with AD, on top of free armor pen. Personally I wish they would tone down his passive. One game I was akali and would repeatedly ambush Darius while he was splitpushing for 1v1s. We were both at full build (he built **pure** AD so please don't say tanks beat assassins) and we would burst at each other. I would kill him first, but his passive would always f*cking finish me off, it did so much damage. I checked death report. His passive did more magic damage than his ult did in true damage, by about 200. That's a pretty big problem.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-27T20:43:36.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is not a 1v1 game.

Flank his team and kill his carries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-04-27T20:07:07.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way. They did nerf his bleed before (correct me if I'm wrong) they reduced his ratio from 200% bonus ad to 150% bonus ad. I don't think they will tone down his passive anymore. If they will, I don't mind. One thing is that if he went pure ad, that simply means he had around 400 ad or so, and if you have that much his ult should deal around 1,111~ true damage. So in this case his bleed dealt 1,300 magic damage WHICH SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN. Why is that? Simple..his bleed deals 36 +(86) magic damage over 5 seconds and that is 1 stack 5 stacks and that should be 611 magic damage over 5 seconds. The only way that happened is that you had a longer fight and he \"REFRESHED\" his stacks and thus u had to take 611 magic damage over 5 seconds (BY THE WAY, THIS IS HIS POTENTIAL DAMAGE, ARMOR AND RESISTS ARE NOT APPLIED) again so that will be equivalent to 1222 magic damage over 10 secs. Another things that is not counted is: Did he have {{item:3156}} ? Cuz that is free 35 ad AND he gets a shield for more survivability. Did he have 5 drags? Did he have life steal? Too much info not around. By the way, his armor pen becomes relevant late game. At level 18 he gets 25% armor pen and if he gets 6% armor pen from mastery, that will put him at 30% armor pen. Some people decide to max out his pull 2nd BUT the only damage you will see is from his Q and you will only see a 20% increased damage from his W. Another thing is that Darius loves 1v1 if he can make a fight last long, then you are f*cked cuz the bleed is ticking and IF HE HAS ignite, then there is no point 1v1, u need two guys then. \n\nLast but not least this thread is about \"clarity\" and nothing else. I can say that some champions are pretty problematic to me but my opinions don't matter. His kit gives him damage with THE COST OF DEFENSIVE STERIODS. The only thing Darius has is that his base armor level 1 is 30 and his health is pretty darn good. But that is all he has. His kit loaded with damage that has good ratios WHICH FORCES him to build 1 damage item or two (depends on circumstances). Some tanks don't need to build damage and still be fine e.g. Sion.. His base damage is already good. Buying damage will just make him suffer a bit (again you gotta look at circumstances, there might be times when you can build{{item:3156}} against 3-4 ap champions.) I won't say this \" NO HE DOES NOT NEEDS NERFS STAHP\" you said so yourself,\"and weaknesses (extremely kitable when pull is on cooldown)\". I might've went on a rant and please forgive me, I usually don't do this.\n\nTl;DR \"Clarity\" and there is always another post for another time. Thank you for your time.
