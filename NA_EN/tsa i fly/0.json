An employee represents their employer, and just by using the account to post something as bad as that, they kind of made it seem like it's okay for the community to wish death upon others in the community.\n\nIt definitely doesn't fly when they're using Riot ____ to post under it. I assume, when a Riot member posts on their employee account, they are speaking for the company, and not for themselves. I've been conditioned to thinking like that, which is why I have a personal email and facebook page for my friends and family, while I do my work-related business using my professional email. \n\nIt would have been much better if they never used their Riot account to post something that goes against everything Riot supposedly goes against. Based off of what I saw in the Reddit page, it seems like the community thinks that if it's okay for a Riot employee to be a complete jerk to someone in the community, it's okay for themselves to be a complete jerk to anyone in the community.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-10-02T02:42:06.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Emelie Cauchemar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jkdmELRL,comment-id=000d000000000000,timestamp=2017-10-01T23:25:12.367+0000)\n>\n>Keeping him on staff only escalates the issue since Tyler 1 can actually legally sue Riot Games because he did it on a company username.\n\nYou can't sue somebody for free speech.\n\nNot saying what the rioter said is acceptable and its the company's decision what they want to do with him, but nothing he did externally is illegal and tyler couldn't file a law suit since he agreed to the games terms of service and broke them repeatedly, even if this wasn't the rioter that was banning him.
