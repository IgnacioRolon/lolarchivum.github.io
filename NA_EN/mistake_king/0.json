I immediately noticed a difference in gameplay - my fps was 20-30 when normally I play with 80-120 fps. I also disconnected from the game 4 times. Prior to this patch I have never disconnected from a game. I was disconnecting from LoL servers but not from the internet. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I tried was a complete proper shutdown of my computer and rebooting the household internet. Then I opened up LoLclient while running some security programs. I disconnected from LoL servers while idle in the client lobby after a few minutes. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this riot. \r\n\r\nAfter dling the new patch I\r\n- have significantly lower fps (20-30... which is pretty frustrating)\r\n-disconnect randomly from your servers\r\n\r\nI'm going to try again after finishing running my security programs but I'm feeling doubtful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nA","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T18:04:14.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Restarting was a solid step in case something crashed in the background.  Frame drops like this can be common after a patch update, in case a game file has gone bad.  The culprit could be otehr factors too like an outdated driver.

This isnt a 1/10000000 instance, iv read forums here, and reddit. I myself was running near flawlessly 4-5days ago (prior to patch 7.7)  i was doing great in ranked due to no lag for weeks. now since 7.7 im down to 5 - 7 fps in early game and teamfights. game was running liquid smooth before this patch. I really dont want to hear its problems on users ends, because its not. this patch is messing with alot of users from low to high end pcs. i have a 120mbps connection and 12 upload speed. takes me 2 - 3 minutes to load onto the rift. Iv also done driver updates, fresh install of lol, and defraggler.  Any ETA on when you guys will fix your performance issues with this patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Darkisthena","date":"2017-04-17T22:25:27.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAME","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Scarletmeow","date":"2017-04-05T18:26:31.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having connection issues that never happened before updating to this patch, tried restarting and trying a new game but still not working.

Every so often... approximately once every 7-10 games... my client will completely freeze in champion select. It might happen during bans or during picks... it's happened before, after, and as I've selected a champion. This is a problem that began to occur after a recent move so it's relative to the new network I've been using... or it might be related to a recent system restore I put my computer through. Either way - I know it's an issue that other people have experienced because I've read about it on other forums but I haven't found any solutions. Could you offer up some starting points for us all?\n\nThanks,\n\nA\n\nEdit: I've also updated all of my drivers.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T20:07:48.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This sounds like an unstable connection issue during champion select, and causing hiccups or desyncs.

Not a problem on my end as every other game runs flawlessly, so its a guaranteed riot issue. I'd like to add that it happens more times than none when approaching minion waves, team fights, etc, and is very frustrating. No issues with my FPS however. I did go from 240 to 90 after pre-season 7 though. {{champion:238}} it also seems to effect other applications at the same time. I'll be in discord and not playing, NO ISSUES. Finding a game, champ select, loading in, NO ISSUES. Get in game, maybe 3 minutes in, huge lag spike, and it even causes Discord to lag out and kick me from voice rooms.
