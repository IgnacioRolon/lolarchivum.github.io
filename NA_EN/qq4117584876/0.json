Riots afk punishment system is unfair to some degree, in my opinion. The rundown is that I had charger issues and instead of making matters worse with a 12% battery life, I simply went to base and fixed the problem before it got worse. This took maybe 3 minutes. I then got back into the game and it was followed by 900 ping for maybe 10 seconds and packet loss for about a minute, give or take. Sure I didn&#039;t go balls to the wall with poor connection, I stayed safe, just wasn&#039;t fully functional for about 5 or 6 minutes. Our top laner proceeded to flame me saying &quot;you don&#039;t deserve to play league&quot; and &quot;you are terrible&quot; and what not. My question is, why that I never afk, disconnect, rage quit, or leave, gets low priority, but the person flaming for such a small reason doesn&#039;t get banned or even any punishment at all, but one report says that I need to wait 5 minutes to play? Yes this is a minuscule problem and probably not worth anyone&#039;s time, but it&#039;s just irritating, because I have to wait 5 minutes just to play, and if the game goes bad, it wasn&#039;t worth the ridiculous wait in the slightest, and god forbid you do it again, because the time to wait to play only gets worse eventually causing you not give a shit any more. \r\nTLDR: is this punishment sytem right or wrong because if it&#039;s right I&#039;d like to know how it&#039;s right","replies":[{"poster":"Gimpy89","date":"2016-01-29T05:19:41.067+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"the system is working as intended.  It is YOUR responsibility to have reliable internet and a charged laptop and you gave your team a huge disadvantage since you wern't prepared to play.  If you did this in ranked you should be reported as it hurts the game just as much as feeding/trolling.   And not being able to play for 6 minutes will often loose the entire game so it is not something \"small\".","replies":[{"poster":"QQ4117584876","date":"2016-01-29T05:23:27.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that and the more I think about what happened, the less I care about the low priority, and the more I care about how the person with such a negative attitude from literally start of the game didn't or ever will get punished. It's whatever at this point I'm not saying I don't deserve low priority, just wanted to rant a bit, I suppose. Also to clarify it was charged enough at the time but it just stopped working and got to low, and the times posted are most likely off, regardless it's a let down to the team, and I understand. I just want some opinions, like if it ever did someone wrong to a worse degree.","replies":[{"poster":"Gimpy89","date":"2016-01-29T05:49:52.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't worry to much about the other guy.  If he rages a lot then he will eventually get chat restrictions and bans.  If he is just upset this one time since he was put at a significant disadvantage that he couldn't control then the system wont do anything as he isn't a toxic person and just had a bad game.  It is really frustrating for players to loose ranked games for reasons they cant control and it often makes normally nice people toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"QQ4117584876","date":"2016-01-29T07:43:11.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but in that sense, I never go afk, leave, whatever and in this one instance I get a punishment, but some guy that hypothetically is never toxic but is one game and gets no punishment, what's the difference, other than a team disadvantage? Even though toxicity puts people behind in some cases as well. Trust me I understand that I deserve the punishment, the system is kind of ridiculous at times.

It was a common accident (that a lot of people made, even some professionals on stream) but it wasted other peoples time and its fair to wait 15 min for wasting 8 minutes of 9 peoples time.","replies":[{"poster":"QQ4117584876","date":"2016-01-29T08:53:51.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"True, and I agree it's more of a warning, but it's still considered a punishment of sorts, and I would have liked at least a legit warning instead of straight up low priority for one incident.

I'm pretty sure I apologized to my teammates about it before leaving in a rush. I'm wondering what's the time amount before the Leaverbuster that tagged people resets for these people?","replies":[{"poster":"UmJtuVyqrg","date":"2016-01-30T00:56:13.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also wonder, when does it reset back to clean slate?
