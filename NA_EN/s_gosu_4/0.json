It should be banning people for hate speech, not just for someone saying \"are you stupid\" because someone is spam pinging you for not committing suicide with them. Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. Hate speech is not when you call someone stupid, or tell someone what they are doing is stupid. Or telling someone they suck. Trash talking and toxicity have a pretty fine line. Telling someone 'kys' or using racist/homophobic slurs is what you guys should be looking for. Not for someone saying \"are you stupid\". My friend got banned because he was defending me in a game. Some guy was being super racist spamming n**** word to me and my friend was telling him to shut the f*** up and that he is a dumb a**. Trash talking shouldn't be bannable, at least not in circumstances like this. It's like the saying \"treat others the way you want to be treated\". Nobody wants to just be quiet and report someone like that, we want to stand up for ourselves. I think anyone who simple is just trash talking should be allowed to trash talk and if someone wants to trash talk them back they can. This whole automated system sucks. It's way too soft. I remember back when we had player tribunals. That was so much better. Only REAL toxic people were getting banned. If someone was just defending themselves they wouldn't get banned by the automated system. At least I know I wouldn't ban them (I used to help with tribunal). I think this automated system is way too flawed, at least any account that's been flagged for a 14 day/permanent ban should be manual reviewed by a player/rioter and not just by 1 person, I think it should be by 3-5 people and if all 3/3 or 5/5 agree to ban only then do they get punished. Not just 2/3 or 4/5 a full 5/5 or 3/3 otherwise they get to keep playing. My idea isn't the best, but I know for damn sure it's better than this automated system. This automated system is handing out bans left and right and I've heard multiple stories now of people contacting support and getting unbanned because they didn't deserve the punishment that was given.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-03-24T10:18:09.132+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should seperate your post into paragraphs, it is kinda hard to read (at least on mobile).\n\nThe current punishment system works in tiers, all toxicity can get you banned but hate speech, racism, and encouragement of self harm skip you tiers immediately to 14 day suspension first offense, wheras other forms of toxicity has two tiers of chat restrictions before that.\n\nPeople voting in the tribunal mostly voted to punish toxicity reguardless of context, which is why the current system is built to do so as well.","replies":[{"poster":"S Gosu 4","date":"2018-03-24T19:57:11.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=jEeY5wd2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-24T10:18:09.132+0000)\n>\n> You should seperate your post into paragraphs, it is kinda hard to read (at least on mobile).\n> \n> The current punishment system works in tiers, all toxicity can get you banned but hate speech, racism, and encouragement of self harm skip you tiers immediately to 14 day suspension first offense, wheras other forms of toxicity has two tiers of chat restrictions before that.\n> \n> People voting in the tribunal mostly voted to punish toxicity reguardless of context, which is why the current system is built to do so as well.\n\nMy friend got 14 day banned for 1 single game where he said are you stupid, he has all honor rewards, was honor lvl 5 and never had a ban before so that's wrong lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-24T20:10:25.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> My friend got 14 day banned for 1 single game where he said are you stupid...\n>\n> ...and never had a ban before...\n\nInsert the L.A.

My argument is that system is wrong. If the system did represent what you're saying then yes it makes perfect sense, but it doesn't. It's more like telling someone if you get raped you're not allowed to defend yourself or else you also go to prison. In some countries that's actually true. It has something to do with giving the attacker a fair fight. Which to me is complete bullshit, and the reason I'm happy living in America knowing if someone tries to rape me I got my .45 ready. Riot is just way too soft with punishment system. It should be going for attackers only not defenders.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-24T20:29:13.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freedom of Speech only applies to Government censorship.

Anyone that gets flamed gets no reward from just muting a flamer. In fact if you just mute them they win. They get to feel high and mighty and usually it just makes them troll in game. Which we all know riot doesn't ban people for trolling I see tons of troll never get banned EVER. Only people that doesn't realize this are low elo noobs. Straight up everyone in diamond+ doesn't give a fuck about toxic, we just want TROLLS/Boosted kids to get banned. The opposite always happens. I got 2 accounts in Masters and whenever I play on my D5 smurf always ALWAYS someone on my team or enemy team is clearly boosted and doesn't deserve to be there. And I see people \"flame\" them for ruining the game and they deserve it. They ruined the game for everyone. They give me free win or give my enemies a free win.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-03-24T21:12:43.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would be surprised how effective a method of defense shutting out someone's chat is.
