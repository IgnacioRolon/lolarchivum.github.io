I already turned mouse acceleration off by writing \"defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\" in the terminal but even though there is no mouse acceleration in the general UI, when I enter the client/game the mouse acceleration comes back and is impossible to turn off...at least that's what I think so far. Is there anyone who knows how to get rid of this so that I can kite more accurately? It's really messing with my gameplay and I don't want to switch back to Windows if I don't have to.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-03T06:26:22.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mac client is basically dead; dualbooting windows is going to be mandatory sooner or later, plus the performance is better.","replies":[]}]}
