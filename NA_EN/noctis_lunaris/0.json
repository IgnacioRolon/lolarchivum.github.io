Fiora is not a team player. Her archetype, the arrogant duelist attempting to prove themselves as the very best like no on ever was, and her lore & character, which state that she wants absolute _zero help_ whatsoever, because in order to restore the honor of her household, she went off _by herself_ seeking to face off against the greatest swordsmen the world has to offer _alone _, to prove she&#039;s the best of the best, not _relying anything or anyone_ but her own skill. \n\nYou don&#039;t want Fiora to be a selfish champion, but you forgot that Fiora is an incredibly selfish person. No one would complain that much is Fiora was a gloryhound, \"I do everything alone\" type champion. We would more or less expect Fiora to run up to the enemy nexus alone  without a care in the world for her teammates, and if the enemy team sent one person out to stop her, they&#039;d get annihilated, and she&#039;ll lament how she &#039;Longs for a worthy opponent&#039; as she destroys yet another tower, and pushes closer to base.  These are more or less implied by her VO, her Lore, and her Subtitle: \"The Grand Duelist\"\n\nHer character is the in-game equivalent of \"1v1 me scrub, see what happens.\" Deliver on that.\n\nYou know who could use a skill like that though? Someone with an equally notable disconnect from the lore in their kit. Someone known to inspire their allies when they&#039;re losing, who turns the tides of battle by showing up and being awesome, thus boosting their morale to fight despite their grave wounds. Someone who leads the charge after giving his allies a second wind. Someone who should&#039;ve had this heal on their Ult since Day 1. \n\n{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-07-23T15:49:22.180+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":22,"body":"I really disagree with you here. Her ultimate isn't her asking for help or getting any aid from her teammates. It's her showing her duelist prowess, killing or maiming someone, and then showering in accolades. That perfectly fits her egocentricism. She restores some vestige of her honor through a great show of her own individual skill, and then gets showered with glory.\n\n>No one would complain that much is Fiora was a gloryhound, \n\nHer new kit, including the ultimate, better fits the idea of her as a gloryhound. You can't be a gloryhound if you're completely alone. You need admirers, fans, someone to actually shower glory on you.\n\nHer lore makes a big point of this. \"She will settle for nothing less than the worldâ€™s acknowledgement of her mastery.\" She worries about her reputation, and how her father's crimes affect it. She has to be the best so that her honor and reputation will be restored. She isn't some lone warrior who never sees other people. She's obsessed with proving to other people that she is the best. This ultimate fits that. This ultimate is the culmination of her teammates acknowledging her mastery and showering her with the praise she knows she deserves. \n\nThematically, it's fitting. Gameplay-wise, it's great.\n\nIt could work for Aatrox, and he should get something that goes into that direction, but this particular ultimate wouldn't really fit him that well. He doesn't have any mechanic that really serves as a functional trigger for this ultimate. Thematically, he also doesn't really have anything that suggests that he's inspiring people with some great display of skills like Fiora hitting all the vital points. It's more his presence that inspires. I think he'd do much better both in gameplay and in theme with a variation of Sion's old ultimate, where his allies get stronger (or get healed) when he is fighting.","replies":[{"poster":"Noctis Lunaris","date":"2015-07-23T16:05:40.435+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":13,"body":"The thing is, this would work if it was a self-heal. If it's showering Fiora in admiration and gives her the drive to try an encore performance, it would be a selfish gain. As a team heal, it's giving to her teammates (with benefits to herself) rather than receiving, which goes against the Egocentrism. \n\nIt's supposed to be Fiora receiving the praise, the glory, not her team. She won't say \"We did it!\" as implied by the team heal, She'll say \"I did it!\", which begs the question as to why her team is benefitting from her. If it's the boost of morale of watching their Idol be awesome, It'll still fit Aatrox more than Fiora.\n\nDraven's passive, mechanics aside, is another thematic example of an egocentric gloryhound wanting to show off and be the best. He gets showered with gifts (Extra gold) and lot of cheers & fanfare (The effects) when he gets audience hyped up (Catching axes), and delivers a spectacular perfomance to pay off the hype he generated (On kill).","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-07-23T16:37:52.123+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":6,"body":"That makes a bit more sense, but I still disagree. Healing the teammates works fine from this perspective too. It comes from Fiora's display of skill, the healing field is centered on the target she's killing, it is entirely dependent on her actions, and she's always going to be the beneficiary. She's not saying \"we did it\", she's saying \"I did it, and you are a witness to my glory\". That works fine because her peers (the other champions) are the ones supplying the glory. Acknowledging their praise makes sense if they're the ones actually giving it. She wants to be recognized as being completely and utterly awesome, so her healing effect doesn't have to be completely independent from the people recognizing her. She's not ridiculously selfish to the point where she won't help someone. She's just egotistic.\n\nGiven how great the ult is from a gameplay perspective and how it fits fine thematically, I'm perfectly cool with this ultimate. It's a great addition to the kit, and it's really fun to play with.\n\n>If it's the boost of morale of watching their Idol be awesome, It'll still fit Aatrox more than Fiora.\n\nBut it still fits Fiora just fine. Aatrox can still get something similar, and there are ways to make it different mechanically and thematically. Focus a bit more on the demonic inspiration angle, or link it more or less to Aatrox's performance.\n\nAatrox should get a new ultimate, but this particular mechanic isn't something that works great for him. He should get a new ultimate. That doesn't mean that Fiora shouldn't get this one. There are plenty of ways to make an \"inspiration\" ultimate without crossing ground with Fiora's new ultimate.\n\nDraven is a bit different because he doesn't care in the slightest about his teammates. He couldn't give a single fuck if they loved him or hated him. The audience is what he's here for, and they aren't the audience. He's not trying to prove that he's the best, because as far as he's concerned, there's no actual dispute that he's the best. He's not proving himself to be above his peers, because he has no peers in the first place. Complete and utter greed is the only way Draven's passive could work because it's just the world giving him his due for being Draven. Fiora's has more flexibility because she doesn't have Draven's particular delusions. She's egocentric because she thinks she needs to prove that she's the best. Draven is egocentric because he is the best and it's just a fundamental law of the universe.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-07-23T20:42:38.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I like the detail you put behind the ultimate.\n\nBut gameplay-wise, I see it only hurting her. She still has no real tools to survive after engaging. Her dmg dodge/reflect is .5sec long. It's not really enough to get to a prime target. And if the chosen target is facing you consistently to fight, there's very little chance to hit 4 sides of their model. The heal will keep her alive, but I don't think in practice that it will be easy to land.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-07-23T21:43:46.922+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not amazingly easy to land, but it's not quite as hard as you'd think. I've played with it a bit, and I've used it in teamfights to decent success. You take an enemy frontliner who gets stunned, ult them, get one auto with the E slow for one proc, dash to the side and get another proc, then move to another side and auto them once more. The first 2 procs are almost guaranteed, although the third and fourth are harder. You can get 3 procs in a bit under .75 seconds if you do it right, and that will go a long way towards killing them and popping the heal.\n\nIt's going to be harder to take down carries or \"prime targets\" really quickly due to lower initiation mobility, but you have options outside of just jumping on carries now. She's not nearly so much of an assassin as she was, and she's not so reliant on assassinations either. The higher potential for her to damage tanky targets, along with the more consistent mobility and the ability to avoid telegraphed damage (for .75 seconds, not .5), she can pretty easily do a lot of work without diving deep, and she can afford to buy some defensive items with CDR to enable her (black cleaver is great).\n\nI'm pretty much completely sold on in gameplay-wise. I love using it, and it seems very effective. I think people will find themselves enjoying it when they get to try it out. In combination with her new kit, it will probably give her a very nice boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaToad99","date":"2015-07-24T01:14:19.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Orbv,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jUUVG1zF,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-23T20:42:38.980+0000)\n>\n> I like the detail you put behind the ultimate.\n> \n>And if the chosen target is facing you consistently to fight, there's very little chance to hit 4 sides of their model.\n\nActually, the zones don't rotate with them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AutoreactiveCD4","date":"2015-07-23T20:10:26.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing is as long as the target dies with the ult on them the heal comes through.

Riot calls Aatrox a Duelist and says they want to keep it that way but why? Nothing in his lore says he's a duelist. Give Fiora a massive healing bonus, even up to 100% health (to make her ready for the next duel), fine, but don't make it a supportive utility bonus for her team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IRicochet Runner","date":"2015-07-23T20:34:59.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So support fiora is in the meta?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-07-23T16:06:53.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"the thing is...if your asshole duelist beats up an important champion on the opponent side youÂ´d still cheer and feel a lot more  confident in the fight now that that one threat got beaten to pulp.
