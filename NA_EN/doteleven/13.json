She needed it. 90 health per level on a mainly ranged champion? NO! And the 4 second nerf to her Human E is amazing.\n\nAnyways, the Blitzcrank change is actually more on the slight side of a nerf since the speed up decays and the duration was reduced. It makes Blitzcrank much less obnoxious when chasing you in my opinion since hes not always going 40% increased movement speed with a 0.75 second down time or so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-03-30T19:43:17.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"self slow or not, 70-90% MS is a mega buff and this is so stupid","replies":[{"poster":"DotEleven","date":"2015-03-30T19:46:29.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CynicalGiant,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7Nbr4jEQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-30T19:43:17.608+0000)\n>\n> self slow or not, 70-90% MS is a mega buff and this is so stupid\n\nbut the duration is down to 5 seconds though and the MS decays during it and it sounds like it doesn't give AS anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-03-31T00:36:23.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?????\n\nThis removes the thing that made blitzcrank so annoying.\n\n\"I can perma speed boost.
