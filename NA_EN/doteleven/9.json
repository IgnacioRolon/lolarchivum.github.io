I would do a poll but they don't allow you to set it to choose multiple items. I have been thinking of streaming again (and yes, doing some salty solo queue support streams) but I  was also thinking I'd much rather do a variety than just one thing. Things I'm thinking of are Transmog hunting in WoW, the Weekly One-Shot in Sentinels of the Multiverse as a constant feature, a casual playthrough on the side (would love to play the Assassin's Creed series again), and maybe even start learning how to Speedrun the Portal games.\r\n\r\nI'd ask a different group, but to be honest I'm not very active anywhere else.","replies":[]}
