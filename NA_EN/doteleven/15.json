I tried it one game, realized it wasn&#039;t fucking worth it and moved on. Hooray, you get some summoner spell CD, but you&#039;re missing out on the other big benefit of damage or shield and swapping summoners spells is honestly pretty useless when it&#039;s still on CD. &quot;Well, I used exhaust so I can either wait for exhaust or switch it and then wait for that too.&quot; The only potential use I can see is getting something on cd, switching to smite, letting that cooldown go and switching back. But other than that, completely pointless.\r\n\r\nAnd as for Blue Kayn, I&#039;m just tired of getting &quot;Well, we need a front line, better get another fucking assassin.&quot; It&#039;s reminding me why I started playing support in the first place because no one knows how to fucking tank.","replies":[]}
