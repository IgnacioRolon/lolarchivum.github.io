And don&#039;t tell me he didn&#039;t have enough gold for something good. He bought, Tear, a Control ward, and Refillable potion. That itself is 975 gold. Pickaxe, get a couple more minions and get a sheen. Sheen at 3 1/2 minutes then when you go back next time (which he did at 8 minutes to get pickaxe, boots, and a control ward total of 1250 gold) get the tear then. Waiting an extra 4 1/2 minutes (or even less because at that time he was 500 gold ahead if we split it up about 278 gold per minute which means it would&#039;ve only been about 2 1/2 minutes for the 750) for your Muramana to stack up is well worth the COMPLETE DOMINANCE we could&#039;ve had with a fucking sheen at 3.\r\n\r\nJust so fucking annoyed at this shit. Like, you get a win in lane and then they like to piss it away because &quot;Nope, can&#039;t change my build order at all. Completely impossible&quot;","replies":[]}
