I'm done with Riot and these chat restrictions","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":8,"down_votes":34,"body":"Go ahead riot, show everyone the chat logs from my last 90 games, show them how I barely spoke a word and you are now giving me another 114 chat restricted games. Show them how you gave me at least 5 warnings for verbal abuse when &quot;You only get warnings for constantly getting reported and if they&#039;re false they won&#039;t count against you&quot; Show them how the only time I&#039;ve ever spoken back in post game is when people are calling me retarded, autistic, or I have downs. I&#039;m done with this. You&#039;re system is wrong and you&#039;re just too scared to admit it.\r\n\r\nYou guys have no reason to believe me, but I have no reason to lie. I&#039;ve loved this game for 6 years and it tears my heart that this is the reason I&#039;m leaving. Up until the automated system was put in place I had never so much as seen a warning. Up until about a month ago I had not so much as gotten a single chat restriction. The worst thing I&#039;ve ever said in game is &quot;You&#039;re a shit adc, I&#039;m roaming&quot; But apparently it&#039;s worse to tell someone they&#039;re bad at the game than actually insult them as a person.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m gonna miss this a lot, but there are other MOBAs out there. and I&#039;m just one person so not like you&#039;re ever gonna listen.","replies":[]}
