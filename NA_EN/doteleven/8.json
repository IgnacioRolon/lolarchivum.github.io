It&#039;s nuts, She used one smash after jumping on me with her ult and the tentacles did like 600 to me, test of spirit did 700. WTF is this, I took 1600 damage in 1 second. She had Black Cleaver, Edge of Night, Pickaxe, Caulfield Hammer. Instantly 1600 damage, I built full tank and had the shield from Courage of the Colossus.\n\nOh and it was all under our tower.","replies":[]}
