She was in the fog of war. I pointed it out in all chat and she said she threw her E over the wall but i did not see it or hear it being cast. There was nothing on my screen, i just suddenly died and i didn&#039;t know why lol xD","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-01T16:59:37.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report!
