You don't need a PBE account to use the Alpha client because the Alpha client is for the Live servers, not the PBE server. You're clear to install the Alpha Client and log in with your live account to access it.

They're two different invite systems, and you've been accepted into Alpha Client but not quite PBE just yet. I hope you enjoy the shiny new client.
