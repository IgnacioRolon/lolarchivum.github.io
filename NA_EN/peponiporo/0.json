The most reproducible instance of it is with the nexus explosion, and in fact this is probably the loudest instance as well. I know there were sound changes this patch, and my guess is the new system just isn&#039;t using my settings under SFX for everything considered SFX. I keep the master volume at one-hundred and crank up the Voice setting so that I can hear champions, since that is my favorite part, and that seems unaffected by the changes, as does the Announcer&#039;s voice. The issue is with everything classified as SFX, which I typically set at 50%. I tried moving that down to 25% and it turned down the volume of some stuff, but did nothing to negate the loudest sounds, like the nexus explosion. I have only started experiencing this bug on this patch, but I am fairly certain I encountered it on the PBE as well, although my settings on there are different so I didn&#039;t notice it as much. The bug never happened to SFX for my own champion's spells or abilities, but did for ally and enemy spells and abilities. I ran a Full Repair to see if my files were somehow corrupted and that did nothing for the issue. I also submitted a bug report with the link on the client, which gives a few more details. \n\nAm I alone in this?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2018-03-19T23:29:34.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friends! Thanks for taking the time to post about this. Sorry for the inconvenience on this one! These wonky volume levels are an unfortunate by-product of a really giant under-the-hood audio engine upgrade that caused a couple things to go awry. However! We are totally aware and everything will be back to the correct levels that don't make us want to rip our ears off in 8.6. Sorry about that! The silver lining is that this upgrade unlocks us to be able to bring some really valuable audio clarity opportunities to LoL in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"PeponiPoro","date":"2018-03-20T01:38:00.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response!
