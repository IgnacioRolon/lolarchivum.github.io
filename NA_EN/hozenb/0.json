I love her old lore but it doesn&#039;t matter because Riot had recently drastically changed her into a pacifist spiritual leader of Ionia.\n\nTo conform to the new lore, I tried to adjust my playstyle today.\nI decided not to kill a single minion or harm any of my opponents.\n\n&quot;_Killing would always be easy, but came at the cost of true enlightenment. _&quot; Karma&#039;s voice echoed in my heart.\n\n\nI entered a game as support, with Kai&#039; Sa as my ad carry in the Taiwan server.\nIn the first five minutes, Kai&#039; Sa asked why I didn&#039;t use a single ability (even though I actually shielded her). I told her I only leveled up my shield since I didn&#039;t want to harm others. She died in a duo fight in bot lane and then gone afk, blaming me for not using my Q.\n\n\"Dude, are you Taiwanese? It's impossible to be a vegetarian here, \" my jungler said.\n\"No, I am Ionian,\" I averred.\n\nMy top laner said it&#039;s stupid for me to play a game and don&#039;t want to kill anyone. I replied to him that my spirit told me not to do any harm since I was the soul of Ionia. He said I was crazy and announced to the opponents that he gave up. My mid laner (Yasuo) and jungler (Cho Gath) also seemed to hate this idea no matter how hard I tried to protect them with my shield. They asked the opponent team to end the game quickly.\n\n\"Gangplank, you don't understand how valuable and vulnerable peace is,\" I told the top laner.\n\"We got a dumbass thinking she's a spirit of Ionia,\" Gangplank told the opponent team.\n\nWe lost the match in around 18 minutes.\n\n\nI wasn&#039;t mad because it&#039;s just that they didn&#039;t understand my ideology as a traditional Ionia spirit.\nI also realized how lucky Karma was that Irelia and the others who were fighting for Ionia didn&#039;t give up the fight and finally won the war against the invaders.

Her Q really only serves to power her healing. Her design IS fitting with her bio, as is Iverns. \n\nNothing about Karma reflects her bio. She's an aggressive offensive mage support by design. Which use to reflect her bio. \nThey changed her bio to be completely at odds with her design. \n\nIt would be like giving olaf Ivern's bio and then saying \"welp, no design is ever going to perfectly fit a bio\".

To be more specific, it's not the lore, but what the lore defines the character to be.

Her instructors used to say: \"That girl can not only weather a storm, but calm it.\"\n\n2nd lore:\n>Known for her powerful connection to the spiritual realm and beloved as a just mediator amongst her people, Karma embraced these traditions as an essential aspect of the enlightenment sought by all Ionians.\n\nThen it comes to her first encounter with the Noxian invasion of her village. Both of them wanted to protect their people but through different ways. The first Karma attempted to utilize her eloquence as a mediator and successfully convinced the Noxian commander to release her people, whilst the second Karma used her spiritual force right away after she saw the elders died with the attempt of a peaceful protest.\n\n1st lore:\n>The villages who survived the assault were captured by Noxian forces. It was then that Karma found her calling. By exploiting the insecurities of the Noxian commander, she negotiated the safe release of the villages to the northern lands.\n\n2nd lore:\n>As the Noxians advanced, the villagers prepared to accept death, bound to their peaceful vows. But Karma would not accept death and instead saw another way: sacrificing a single life to spare many others. To save her people, she drew upon the power within and summoned the full force of her will.\n\nOne more point to add is that I won't say there was a substantive difference between the way she chose to solve the challenge. The decision she made was the one that could save the innocent villager in that particular circumstance. In the first one, since the villagers were captured, she employed a diplomatic tactic to win the fight. In the second lore, since all of them were about to die in front of the heartless soldiers, she had to use her power to keep the villagers alive.\n\nThis manifested her assertive and wise leadership quality, which eventually led her to become a well-known leader of Ionia in both stories.\n\n1st lore:\n>For her devotion and charisma, Karma was made the figurehead of the Ionian resistance.\n\n2nd lore:\n> She was present at the Placidium, where the Elders had considered surrender until  Irelia's impassioned last stand renewed the Ionians' hope. Karma used this hope to solidify the Elders' commitment to remain defiant against the Noxian onslaught. While the war raged on, Karma became a formidable leader of the Ionian resistance\n\n\nIn reply to your point of Karma being a pacifist in the first lore, I want to clarify that it's not the case. As we can see from her old lore, she was fighting with the people and she even tried to learn from Janna to improve her combat skills to resist Noxian invasion.\n\n1st lore:\n> She never compromised, and she shared every hardship with her people, even when it came to combat. By tapping into her inner resilience, she discovered that she could bring great force to bear against her foes on the battlefield. She modified her fans into lethal implements, and was tutored by  Janna to enhance their effects.\n\nTo sum up, in both of the versions of her lore, she has been the leader to protect Ionians, fighting together with Ionians and even \"shared every hardship\" with Ionians. She was determined in protecting the lands, never feared and always was the one to persuade the stubborn elders to resist. In addition, she was a sage mediator, who led people make the right move in the defense against Noxians.\n\nI hope this preliminary analysis can clarify some points for you.

I didn't realize I have to attack the enemies in order to upgrade that item as it jsut came up in the recommended items lol\n\nAnd I wanted wards because it provides vision. Providing vision sounds very enlightening to me no matter in the Chinese (Taiwanese) language context or in the English context.\n\nIn Taiwan (plus Hong Kong and Macau) community, we always called the wards as \"eyes\". An unofficial but widely used translation of the wards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2018-04-12T03:21:37.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why'd  you build an aggressive support item if you don't intend to deal dmg\nshould've gone coin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Demented Gag","date":"2018-04-11T23:26:16.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you bought {{item:3098}} than?
