I worked hard to get to Gold and I read the FAQ about getting rewards: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2016-ranked-season-ends-soon (eligibility). \r\n\r\nAnd it say's that if you have a ban or chat restriction active when season ends that you won't get rewards.\r\n\r\nBut the thing is that I also am now ineligible for loot crafting which made me worried if because of that I won't get rewards can somebody help me.?\r\n\r\nBecause I have 4 games left in chat restriction I know for sure that I won't get loot crafting lifted since the reform period takes months: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions\r\n\r\nSo my question is will I still be eligible for ranked rewards if I am ineligible for loot crafting..?","replies":[{"poster":"saintbear","date":"2016-11-07T17:25:16.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this yearâ€™s rewards.\" \n\nMore simply, does that include hextech crafting?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T23:30:21.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, because it isn't a ban or a chat restriction. However, according to [this announcement](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230496748) if you still have an **active** chat restriction when the season ends, you won't qualify. You may want to play those games out without doing anything to cause that restriction to escalate before the ranked season ends in a few hours.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"saintbear","date":"2016-11-07T23:46:27.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!\n\nCheers","replies":[]}]}]}]}
