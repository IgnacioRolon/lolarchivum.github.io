It's possible that you could be running into issues with the Xbox Game Bar that had the game dvr feature enabled in some recent windows updates. To test this, you can [disable the bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) temporarily to see if anything changes.\n\nLet me know the results.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-08-28T22:20:11.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.

I encourage you to take a look at our [FPS issues guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) that covers a lot of the common solutions for this problem.\n \nHit me up with some info on what happened after those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-09-05T16:07:16.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Late reply. Had a really busy week.\n\nOkay. Finally finished the update as well as a Windows 10 update that showed up on Thursday. Was able to run a game yesterday (Ryze Jungle) . Actually played well. I started with everyone at the fountain ( which usually doesn't happen until 30 seconds) , was easily able to press the tab button without it freezing up, and team fights weren't hectic. Plus my mouse didn't spin out of control. Was having high FPS (100, 110) as well as low pings.\n\nSeems to be working but I'ma try a few more games.\n\nAgain, thanks for the assistance. I'ma spread the word to others if I see them.\n\n+1","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-08-28T21:53:51.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]}]}
