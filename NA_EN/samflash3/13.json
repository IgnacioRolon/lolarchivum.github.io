Why? Because for the life of me, I can't keep autoattacking the same target but I have to because I already stacked spears on him.","replies":[{"poster":"llamasx","date":"2015-01-29T05:04:52.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For team fights, you require good positioning and your teammates to peal for you, though this is less of a problem for Vayne and Kalista.  Laning is so different for every match up and with how good/ who your support is that it's hard to say what to do specifically without you giving a specific problem you need help with.  I'll just throw some random things out there.  If your opponent is coming in to cs, landing 3 shots with vayne to win the trade isn't that hard.  Ashe's W poke is pretty good too.  If you have no sustain, giving up a few cs that would require you to be overextended or out of position is fine.  \n\nAlso why do you have trouble auto attacking a single target with Kalista?  Just click on the same target?\n\nI just lolking'd you, I don't understand what you're having problems with.  Your post seems like someone who doesn't know much about the game would ask, not a 4 season veteran question.  There are a lot of adc pro streams out there you can watch.  While the champs you listed have a playstyle a bit different from lucian, graves, or trist, it just comes down to slightly different positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2015-01-29T12:29:54.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you got me there.  It's just that I can't play those 4 well in teamfights for the life of me without getting Fizz ulted/Zed ulted and dying. Spell reliant ADCs like Lucian, Graves, Sivir, MF are geeat because I can do the damage without having to get to the dash range of most assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-01-29T23:29:48.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, assassins like Fizz or Zed are kind of built to counter you, so....\n\nFor Ashe and Jinx, I'd just recommend positioning with your team, like stick really close to someone in the backline that can peel for you, so that if an assassin dives, they seriously have to dive, and you can kite back and your team can collapse on them and kill them. Ashe and Jinx have fairly long range spells they can cast to influence a teamfight without getting into auto attack range (even then they have among the highest auto attack range in the game). You can also use your CC to lock them down for your team to kill them if they dive on you.\n\nFor Vayne...Vayne's generally difficult to play in teamfights unless you're like Uzi/Piglet/Doublelift or something. You need to be smart about how you use your ult stealth and tumbles, also micromanaging your positioning for condemns, etc. This is why Vayne is so hard to play.\n\nThe same is generally true for Kalista imo; she does have the benefit of being able to kite infinitely backwards provided you have enough attack speed. If you can survive/dodge an assassin's initial dash/burst, just kite backwards and they'll never catch you.","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2015-01-30T05:40:10.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm dying more in lane than in teamfights. And I'd face this problem that a lane isn't pushed  but nobody will push the wave. So either I go and leave myself open, or we lose a turret.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-01-30T05:56:13.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just said you can't play them in teamfights...\n\nDon't overextend if you don't have ward coverage. Learn to farm under turret, especially if you're playing Vayne, cause you're going to be doing that a lot since she has no waveclear. If you're about to get ganked/dove on, unless you're really confident you can bait them, back off; it's better they take the turret than kill you *and* take the turret.\n\nAlso learn how to slow push a wave; you can also just statikk shiv and just clear it real quick; you don't have to shove a wave all the way to their turret for it to naturally shove. Heck if you shove it to their turret it'll just reset naturally. Take out the back caster minions and get out; get some wards out, check your minimap, make sure you're not getting collapsed on.\n\nEDIT: Checked your lolking, also don't see why you're having issues. I don't know where to start; I'd say head over to https://www.lol-coaching.com/ and find someone who can watch your gameplay and coach you cause I have no idea","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-01-30T02:43:26.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Small tidbit about Kalista build Hurricane and it solves the only attack one person problem for teamfights as well as instant wave clear","replies":[]},{"poster":"saphirraa","date":"2015-01-29T05:02:38.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok how can you say kalista and vayne lack escapes? Ashe i just plain dont i just hate playing as or with an ashe personally. However kalista and vayne have escapes. Vayne can tumble and E away the enemy and she can kite easily. Kalista can kite even more easily. If you cant click your mouse on a champ then theres nothing anyone can do for you except to tell you to click better. And your building kalista wrong. Not one person have i seen go PD on kalista and not feed. Rush hurricane, to stack her E on multiple champs i dont understand how people dont know how strong that makes her.
