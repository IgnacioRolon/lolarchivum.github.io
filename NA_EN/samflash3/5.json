Yasuo's W destroys projectiles, but Braum redirects them to himself and negates damage only from the first hit, then reduces damage by a percentage for subsequent hits.\n\nBraum's shield should intercept anything Yasuo's W destroys. But other than that, they're different abilities that behave differently.\n\nFor instance, Brand's ult will be redirected to Braum so it hits him dealing 0 damage(but still applying passive), and then gets to bounce again. Yasuo's wall will instead destroy the ult completely. Similarly, Ashe arrow will stun Braum, but not Yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-09-17T04:28:54.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because braum still gets hit by every spell and their cc that comes at his wall.  He just mitigates the damage from the first by 100% and the remainder 3.5s is X% mitigation.","replies":[]}]}
