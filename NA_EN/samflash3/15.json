This item is good to get later if you are going more for a bruiser and against a higher ap team comp, but it is specific to the situations he listed above. I personally don't build that item at all in my endgame vi build unless the enemy team has a lot of magic damage or a mage on the enemy team focuses me near exclusively. Both these situations were laid out by TeemoHunter earlier.\n\nHaving tried out quite a few starts on {{champion:254}}  (who btw happens to be one of my favorite champs to play) I find I easily have to most success with {{item:3134}} . The 10% cdr, 25 ad, and 10 flat armor pen are extremely good on an ad caster with high burst potential like Vi. There is a reason you see this item rushed first on ad assassins like zed and talon, and that's because its just so good as an item, even if you don't upgrade it for a long time. Though you said vi is supposed to be tanky, she doesn't have to be that way until mid game or sometimes later depending on how your team is doing, a jungle Vi with a brutalizer can and will take a laner to half health from full with just one combo ( assuming they don't have a big armor item already), and this can provide a big power swing if your laner is good at zoning. The damage is usually enough to secure a kill early on.\n\n{{item:3057}}  is also a very good item, here my opinion differs just a little from TeemoHunter in that I think it is a great item on vi to get if you for some reason don't have access to your blue buff. The mana becomes invaluable because she's so hungry, and it does provide some extra burst. THAT BEING SAID, generally in one combo you only get one proc because you naturally tie your abilities so closely together and sheen has a cooldown, meaning you will get more benefit from the unique passive in a longer fight, which isn't really vi's style until she has a few more tools in her belt. Generally speaking, you will probably just make more of brutalizer's stats in both a longer fight (remember the cdr) and a shorter fight because of the armor pen and ad.\n\nEDIT: I noticed {{item:1011}}  down in the comments as well so I'll add this to my little speal here. Giants belt is a very good early item if you need to be the one taking the beating instead of giving the beating (Though we all know {{champion:254}} likes to be the one giving beatings) I find as a first item I don't really like giants belt that much because vi is so aggressive and also the offensive items help so much with clear. But also its 300 gold cheaper than the 1300 g items, so there is something to be said there. I do heavily favor this as a second item though, because once you finish it into a randuins you can take a serious beating allowing you to get more kills, which = more gold, which = more punching, and who doesn't like punching?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-10-27T18:11:17.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer Brutalizer. Her teamfight utility is basically proportional to how many Qs she can get off, and whether or not her ultimate is off cooldown. Especially because, as a champions, she generally wants defensive boots and Banshee's over lucidity boots or SV/Locket, CDR is a pretty high priority stat on her.\n\nThat said, both Sheen and Hexdrinker can be very good items - the former if you're ahead, the latter if the enemy team has a lot of ways to proc the passive. But in a situation where you're 0/0/0 with average farm, I think Brutalizer is the best option.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-27T18:16:46.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, Im defeated","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eliswood","date":"2014-10-27T18:23:31.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets be honest, Bildgewater Cutlass on Vi is broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Freljordan","date":"2014-10-27T20:14:07.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} is what is broken on {{champion:254}} , not {{item:3144}} , but that would be necessary to get there anyways","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-27T18:34:43.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always DRAVEN!!!!!!!! {{champion:119}} ","replies":[]}]}
