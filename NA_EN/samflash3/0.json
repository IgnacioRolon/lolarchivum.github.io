It probably won't reveal stealthed units and it could start at 120 seconds into the game to prevent using it during the level 1 skirmish. Also, it could have a \"one every 5-7 minute\" cd use to prevent vision spamming.","replies":[{"poster":"ZenonTheStoic","date":"2014-05-08T21:35:00.239+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think that adding any vision to TT would potentially lead to a very stale game. That map would be so easy to ward for. That's not to say it wouldn't also benefit from vision. It's currently pretty random and snowbally. This is a hard design problem. Adding a single element to a complicated situation we don't fully understand is likely to cause more harm than good. If we wanted to do something here, we'd probably need to attack TT more holistically and find out what we want good gameplay on the map to look like.","replies":[{"poster":"KevinDelMarr","date":"2014-05-08T22:16:39.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not allowing mini wards, like 30 gold for a 30 second ward (one ward per person).\n\nIt's weird going from a SR mentality of warding saves lives to not being able to ward at all. By putting it on a trinket you could make it free but give it a short duration and a long CD. Wards would be used as a calculated tactic. You can ward a part of the jungle when you want to push up but then you can't ward the next time you push up 3 minutes later. Or intead of vision they are an invisible trap that only alert you if someone walks over them. It could encourage the sweeper item purchases, but maybe too much\n\nBy not having wards I feel like I can't be as aggressive, like once I push up I have to recall. Ever since the remake I haven't had an urge to play TT anymore. I had a lot of fun playing it with my two friends but the lack of tension over Dragon/Vile control and no wards just doesn't do it for me anymore. Nt saying it's bad, as I like how jungling is an option now, but the game feels a little too limited","replies":[{"poster":"2dsystem","date":"2014-05-09T01:15:00.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From that description of the ward, I feel like a blue trinket might be cool on TT.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fomorian27","date":"2014-05-08T23:02:36.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not something like xelnaga watch towers that you capture and reveal a location?","replies":[{"poster":"Bloodseek","date":"2014-05-09T02:54:58.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think vision for TTL would actually take away from the map. Although I think a trinket that would allow you to reveal a bush temporarily would be nice or even just the blue trinket.\nAlthough I think it would be fun to have some unique trinkets for TTL. Maybe one that helps capture altars slightly faster.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2014-05-11T11:58:21.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While i Agree that wards would probably lead to an stall game, i don't see why a blue trinket (or something along those lines) would be bad?\nIt would help to avoid fatal facechecking, playing TT without a champ that can reveal brushes via skillshot or something is suicide, and it wouldn't realy help vs invades/ganks so it wouldn't lead to stale games.","replies":[]}]}]}
