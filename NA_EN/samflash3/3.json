Right now though, it is too strong. 40% damage reduction late game is HUGE. That's literally a tank steroid on a burst mage/support champion. She has no need for that kind of free mitigation, especially since it's easy to build both damage and defense (without sacrificing anything)  with AP builds.

Did you know Tibbers' latent burn will proc it, as should his basics? Not to mention Annie has a low-CD single-target for maximum slow effect as well.\n\nThere are a few things you want to check out when running down Annie.\n\n1) Is her stun up? Recently they added a bar to her, below her resource bar, but she's also always had little white swirls surrounding her when her stun is geared to go. When her stun is up, you should be trying to force her into an unfavorable ult-- and if you're not sure her flash is down, then it might be better to ask for a gank, perhaps.\n\n2) What's her build? The more HP items Annie has within, the more like a tank she's going to feel; her shield is prepped to take large burst, offering a substantial 40% damage reduction. While it won't be the worst if you don't have consistent damage coming out, someone who relies on a stream of damage will be suffering from having it up. It also returns damage, which can start to smart on said champions at Annie's higher AP builds. Conversely, if she's full-bore AP and has very little HP, you'll have to play duck-and-dodge where you just fake out her shots as best as you can.\n\n3) Lastly, what's your record like? If you're consistently losing out in fights to Annie, you need to call for help. If your team won't help, you're basically hooped, but you'll want someone strong to take the stun. Always fight Annie on two fronts; her W means she can regularly punish tightly-knit formations and it deals more damage than her Q, incidentally. It can stun any enemies it hits-- but! It can also whiff completely unlike her Q, and it will burn up her stun if she does miss with it.\n\nAnnie suffers when opponents have high-burst kits or strong CC (who doesn't tho) and struggles against anyone who can keep range on her. Rylai's is a good option and always be aware that Annie, unlike most mages, flourishes in close-quarters due to having CC and strong AoE in close range. Always try to keep picks that won't need to enter too close to her range, and try to stick to picks with pursuant-denying CC-- Xerath, LeBlanc, Karma and Zyra come to mind (where Zyra can hit through minions).\n\nI know this is all just loose theorycraft and probably stands out as obvious but I figured I'd just try to point out a few things. Make no mistake, Annie is powerful and for all the reasons you think she is. It's pretty hard to underperform as Annie and easy to underperform against. But when all else fails, the last thing I'd suggest is play the HELL outta her. Nothing learns you a champ like knowing them inside and out, ranges and all.\n\nDo you play with Quickcast on?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-09-25T02:31:30.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"fyi they have nerfed annie quite a bit since she became a main stay support .... they lowered her early game damage... made it easier to see her stun passive etc and yea flash has 5 min cd","replies":[{"poster":"Samflash3","date":"2016-09-25T03:42:52.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just have issue with the protobelt Annie.
