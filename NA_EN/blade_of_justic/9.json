I wouldn't rely too much on his E since I would be able to just run down someone anyways.\n\nBut doesn't this change mean that if you want to stun multiple people that you would need to hit them all in a line? \n\nSkarner's Q would just apply in an AoE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-08-05T21:44:56.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3025}}  and {{item:3071}} Can solve this problem both offer more stick power.\n\nAlso the new Skarner have more AD in his moveset (40% AD ratio unchaeged Q and 40% AD ratio in his charged Q, 80% AD ratio).\n\nAlso the Armor shred helps a lot to make more dmg, I'm Skarner main, and these changes are not bad at all.\n\nI'll miss all his MS buff, but now he have a more oriented AD pattern and items like Black Cleaver and IBG are amazing on hIM.\n\n{{item:3025}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3709}} {{item:3111}}\n\nAnd some of the new items like Sterak's Gage or Titanic Hydra's can be a good items on him too.
