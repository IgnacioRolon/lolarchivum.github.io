It may have also happened during his R, but as I am new to him, I cannot completely confirm, as I may be casting it wrong sometimes. But his Q definitely does channel but not fire when Q is let go, after holding.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2019-02-16T07:12:20.099+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!
