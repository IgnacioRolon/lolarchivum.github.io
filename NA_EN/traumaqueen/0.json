Riot chose a system where when you're the victim of a slient troll for instance, ruining your duo bot lane by stealing every farm and this rendering you completly useless since you're farm dependent, you have no tool to handle it. You can't vent, or you et reported for being negative, you can't farm, can't really go jungle unless you want your own jungler to get mad, and you have very little chance to get a win in the end.\nYou can report it, sure, but for what ? there's not even a corresponding category. So i you ever try to stand for yourself, well then you're the annoyance and the bad guy and you can't really leave either. \n\nIt happened so often lately, can't seem to remember it happening so often previous seasons but i could be wrong. I tried contacted the support team, asked them what were their plans or if they were acutally planning to work something the player could to use to work around this kind of behaviour. Their only answer was basically telling me to suck it and reminding me anymore negativity on my account could end in a ban.

Cya! {{champion:222}}\n\nIf only you would lose your honor for being a toxic person in the forums. Many MANY people are having this same exact issue where they play the game for years and have 1 chat ban and poof all of their work is gone. BS if you're telling me that you've said nothing like what the OP said in the chat logs in a game before. I refuse to believe that you've not been just as toxic (probably worse) you just didn't get reported so you think that you're innocent. Nearly every single game there is someone yelling at someone but I am supposed to believe that 80% of the community is good? lol\n\nI to was chat banned and lost all of my honor, I won't be able to get it back to honor level 2 I will be able to get it to checkpoint 3 of 3 but that's it. You actually don't get much honor points for being honored but you do get honor for being positive in game, I just would only say things like good job or something that cannot be taken negatively. Riot support told me that if you're negative at all you will lose honor. If you ask for someone to be reported you lose honor. The system is broken I understand losing my honor for the chat ban and while i feel going all the way down from 4 is harsh it's way to much to also take that persons ranked rewards away. If I was suspended or had my account banned then yes by all means I agree but a 10 game chat ban? seriously?\n\nMy offense was defending myself from a duo when the Draven would run in to a zilean bomb to catch his axes, he got mad at me for not saving him as bard.....I never curse in game but I did tell him that I wasnt going to lane with him if he was going to keep being a toxic jerk. Anyways, this isn't going to change, the only thing that will change is less and less people with either be playing the game or playing ranked in general. It would be really interesting to see how big of a drop riot gets in player base once awards are handed out and the large number of players who got screwed just quit.","replies":[{"poster":"TraumaQueen","date":"2018-11-07T15:58:02.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The revocation of honor rewards only works against people that did put in the time in ranked.

I only tell you that many people who have been punished do complain about that.\n\nInstead, I tell you that the first chat restriction you get is pretty much Riots way of telling you to start behaving, or risk losing your account. Since it was your first ever punishment, you now have up to two more chances left before the final punishment (Permanent suspension). It is now up to you if you start behaving, or lose your investment to your account (money, time, friends, etc). I wish you learn to control your behavior and avoid any further punishments. That way you should be able to earn the rewards the next season.\n\nPS: I did glance over your chat logs and found some parts which can (and did) get you punished (For example rank shaming, giving up mentality and insults towards your team). You need to get rid of that behavior if you wish to keep your account. Ah, and I didn't like your camouflaged KYS message there.","replies":[{"poster":"TraumaQueen","date":"2018-11-07T14:03:07.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love that getting baited (the guys literally said in chat this is what they wanted) By a troll and riot is protecting them/their game...... the people that were disgusting and awful in the game, they ruined 40 minutes of my life and riot destroys my game/honor to protect that community.... \n\nthis is as bad as I lose my temper .... and I lose all my season rewards....and labeled dishonorable... yea.... :( Not my best moments, yeah - but this wasn’t an innocent person I randomly started beating up.... this was a duo berating me and another Laner up and got me to react by being gross. This feels like the opposite of protected from them?\n\n\nAnd I told the actual to troll keep himself safe because he kept 1v5ing, but ya... it had the same letters and Im not gunna lie it was a happy coincidence for me...  I was so stinking mad I couldn’t leave that game.  Why can’t i leave.... when someone’s making you that mad you should be allowed to walk away!!! I shouldn’t have to mute and watch them dance around me. Held hostage in a game where your team is being so mean to eachother and youre like 5-35 in kills and they just wont let you ff, cause theyre having fun making you miserable. \n\n there is no way I was as bad as I see on twitch every Single day from streamers or compared to what I put up with in games 5x a day.... but i know thats not the point.  \n\nAnd no I’m not going to go on a report streak making sure everyone meets the same demise as me. Because ultimately... I do not think I should lose an entire season over this, one PG rated bad game.","replies":[]}]}]}
