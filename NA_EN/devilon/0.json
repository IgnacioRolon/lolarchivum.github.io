For some reason my height was changed to 1200 instead of 1080.

For me the case was that sometimes i'm playing on external screen (Full HD), sometimes i play on laptops screen (1600x900). Before it was switching properly, but after 7.9 was implemented this setting is not changing dynamically. I see that you are relating to custom resolution but it's not true for everyone, so I hope it helps you guys.
