I'm currently in the new beta client V7.3-3845603.3845421. This problem just started after the most recent patch. I seriously need help because I can't take the risk of potentially not being able to accept too many games that come up then get a penalty, it's already happened once where I got the time. and I'm not going to lose LP over this issue cause I know Riot won't give it back.\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T04:57:50.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be happening if your connection to the matchmaking servers is unstable.
