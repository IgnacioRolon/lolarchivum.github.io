For some reason when i hold down the ability key, it waits until i let go of the key to cast the ability, i was playing taliyah and i would press w and the ability would not go off until i let go of the key, so i missed almost every w by a mile. Is anyone else having this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-08T21:56:05.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah's W is just a weird ability.  I've mostly gotten used to it now, but it works differently from every other ability in the game for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Figment","date":"2016-06-08T23:55:02.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NEVERMIND IM AN IDIOT theres an option in the menu that says \"replace quickcast with ability indicator\" and i had it clicked on\nim sorry.","replies":[]}]}]}
