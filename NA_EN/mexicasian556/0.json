I feel like there should be an option to opt to be in queue longer to guarantee the role you want rather than have to wait hours to play a champ. In this case i wanted to play Lux mid, and had Bot as my second role,  and twice in a row i got bot instead of mid, and i don't want to ask to switch because i don't want to feed and make it awkward. What is everyone else's thoughts on this matter? Should we have to be content with a role we really don't want, or should be allowed to opt to have only one role if we choose, at the cost of higher queue times?","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T01:31:48.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a main support, I have no idea what you are talking about..  :P {{champion:497}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"FNC kcal12","date":"2017-09-09T01:32:14.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But joke aside, yes i agree with you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-08T00:17:13.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think this could actually be a fairly good idea. Too many times have I heard \"well I got support and didn't want it, guess Imma feed/int/afk\". With so many people intentionally ruining games, and so many people willing to wait longer queue times for a match for their preferred role, I could definitely get on board with this. \n\nI can't really make this change myself, but you could get the community together to see how everyone feels by posting this over in Client Discussion!","replies":[]}]}
