As they complain about any ranged toplaner since Teemo.\n\n> Jinx was so overloaded that she remained a top champion pick for years, and was only finally out of the spot light when they completely reworked half the adc's and their itemization.\n\nNothing is wrong with being top champion. Jinx kit is fun to play as, and fun to play against, as she has very clear and pronounced weaknesses.\n\n> Vi is basically warwick 2.0 and just like him is only considered good when her ult is busted\n\nWhich is still way better than Azir's kit, that is completely cockblocking for any enemy that has no range advantage on him, or an unstoppable dash, and who's only cool part was made not by design, but by accident.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2016-07-29T13:44:07.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a salty (ex) chickenmain, and I agree he needs some reworking.

Garbage warmed up. I just don't have the motivation to put in the work for a champion that has been kneecapped so many times... I mean first they take the CDR to ASPD, and that seems fine, and then they nerf his ultimate, okay, fine, utility nerfs are fine, and then the soldier damage changes and...\n\nHe just feels really bad to me. I wish they'd rework him - I feel like they've made it so that you HAVE to utilize E and position yourself dangerously to make plays, and I wish they'd gone the other direction and made his shurima shuffle less effective and prioritized the other parts of his kit. His ultimate should be a defensive skill anyway, I don't really know why Riot is favoring this shurima shuffle gameplay aside from LC$BIGPLAYS.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-07-29T18:46:13.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh they just made his mid game sooooo bad that he's almost unplayable\n\nbut his kit is a lot of fun. so I hope whatever they do they find a way to make him still the fun champ I enjoy while not either pick/ban or garbage depending on numbers","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Liberal","date":"2016-07-29T14:28:45.247+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, you are completely right. Kalista was a product of an overloaded kit (She should have really been split into two champions, one who focuses on low damage auto attacks with an activated ability for burst, and another one that focuses on the black oath passives.), while Azir needs to either be a hypermobile battle mage, or an extra long siege mage, he can't be both.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-07-29T13:34:20.316+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've said the passive on her W, as well as a few other bonuses for her and her Soulbound (think Zeke's Herald) need to replace Martial Poise.\nWith that done, Q should receive a version of Martial Poise that ONLY applies to Q to let her retain some mobility and kiting, except then it would be bound to a cooldown and Mana cost.\nPeople keep arguing that Martial Poise is the unique, defining characteristic of her and her kit, and this I disagree with.
