Inbound packets are tiny packages of information that tell your client what's happening server-side and then your client displays it. If these packets get heavily delayed or lost along the way, your client can miss displaying actions exactly as they happen and will catch up when the next set of packets finally arrive. This would be seen as erratic jumps in actions or actions missing completely, as you've described. \n\nPacket loss can often be caused by local network configurations that prevent your connection from remaining steady during the game. It can also be caused by issues along your route to the server. The guide that Rineyy provided will take you through the first layer of troubleshooting, but if you still see issues I definitely recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our tech specialists as suggested. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-21T08:21:05.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly; [Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj\n\nIf you continue to experience packet loss;\n\nDrop a line with Riot’s [Technical Support Centre](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=34190)\n\n\n* The primary category has already been chosen. \n\n\n* For the secondary category, select **I’m lagging more than normal**\n\n\n\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCCc9VGLMBs/VvGim_HT2MI/AAAAAAAA5EU/CQi6aIgFrm0rtxw5hZl4Al3mMP3k3JAyg/s1600/Lissandra_Splash_3.jpg\n\n\n\n[Need help obtaining logs?
