Were they using voice chat? These stuff unless you ask you probably don't know, in bronze any strategy is better than no strategy that's just how it is. My problems is this more noobs now play because riot did a poll and found out that the reason some people don't play rank is simply because they couldn't play with their friends, and they didn't like that, they still played the game they just didn't play rank riot wanted them to rank, they didn't think about how much solo players wouldn't want to play in this system, now it's true in a 2 man group they will try their best and mostly succeed in placing you against another 2 man group and because of that new system the penalty they had for being part of a duo que no longer exist riot didn't feel it was necessary, okay now there's this this new system does not try to match a 2 man with a 3 man and so forth so most games a pre-made group unless it's a 5 man group will have a solo que player in their group, more commonly 2 mans and 3 mans are the most common where the 3 man normally is jungle support and bot, they'll face another 3 man group most likely or at the very least another 2 man group, but then their's the solo quers where the 2 man at bot are solo quers while they're trying to lane they have a jungler camping bot lane with their duo partners sup and adc, making it near impossible for bot lane to even push most of the time. That's the issue with dynamic que this happens too often especially in bronze and these players stay in bronze because most of them aren't core gamers, they are casual players that don't even play this game that much, the others that do are bronze noobs that simply couldn't rank up by themselves before season 6 because they sucked, with the introduction of dynamic que, it's now a lot easier to get out of bronze for groups, but for solo quers it's now more of a grind, we gotta deal with afkers, smurfs, noobs and now at all levels up to plat, trollers, flamers, and now with dynamic que pre-mades with voice chat. In bronze every little advantage you can have is super effective, any advantage, it's pretty much like this giving a team 10 kills or so in the first 20 minutes who's going to win this match, usually the better group will win regardless of the other players, solo que players now have less control over the game progression where before if we coudln't get out of bronze it was our fault we sucked, but now if we get out we got a nice asterisk above our rank, and if we can't usually pre-mades are usually a big reason the statistics of being with a 2 man group is extremely high whether against or for with this argument here you are more likely to face a 2 man or 3 man group than you are to have one on your team, very slightly they are 5 you guys only have 4 which means you'll more often face a 2 man group with you all being solo quers, than having a 2 man group on your team facing 5 solo quers. Really makes the game one sided now! It effects me more because I'm a solo quer that loves top and bot, so this means I take up 2 positions that pre-mades like the most 2 mans like top and jungler because they can play with each other more on the otherhand, 2 man even 3 man love jungler, support, and adc. You see the issue with mid, solo quers won't be effected as much but with me I can't play my favorite 2 roles because I'll often be force to play against a duo que whether top or bot sometimes even a 3 man group.","replies":[{"poster":"SirSmokeysAlot","date":"2016-05-11T19:37:33.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was solo.

Communication is better in this game than the lack of it, when you are a solo player you are playing at a disadvantage now because more often than not there is going to be a pre-made on your team either 2 man or 3 man if the pre-made is not better than the enemy's you are probably going to lose that game. As a solo que player we have zero to no influence on how this game is going to play out if your bot against a 3 man team and the jungler is camping that lane you aren't going to get a lot of kills same with top lane and with pre-mades they'll generally camp the lane that their partner is playing in trying to snowball their teammate, since I play top bot i take up 2 positions that are sought after by pre-mades, do you understand my point on why dynamic que is not fair for solo que players at all?","replies":[{"poster":"SirSmokeysAlot","date":"2016-05-11T20:22:44.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that you do not think it is fair.
