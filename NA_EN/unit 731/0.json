Create something extremely creative, then send it to riot, whether it be an online drawing, or anything you want it to be.  Send it in a support ticket to Riot and tell them you just need a few Riot Points, and if it is creative enough, they will give it to you.

Good luck and be creative","replies":[{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-06-04T19:10:36.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs about 364 RP which is a lot more than I think drawings with get him","replies":[]}]}]}
