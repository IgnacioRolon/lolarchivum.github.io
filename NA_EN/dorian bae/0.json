I mean, I&#039;d consider him an assassin since he can deal 1,900 damage to me in 2.1 seconds. Shouldn&#039;t I get the opportunity to have some window of counter play? Shouldn&#039;t me, as Ekko, do more damage to him, as he only has spirit visage for MR, than he does to me, since I built full-damage and am actually an assassin? \r\n\r\nHe can build full tank, like Ekko could, and still dominate. \r\n\r\n:( pls help rito pls help\r\n\r\n(btw I&#039;m silver, so feel free to tell me how boosted I am and that I can&#039;t kite) \r\n\r\n(p.s. twitch.tv/icantkite)\r\n(p.s. I know he&#039;s not an assassin, that&#039;s the joke)\r\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, does Darius really need a heal on his spinning axe ability? Just seems way too strong early on &amp; pretty unnecessary... \r\nI mean, sometimes, I consider taking ignite to cut his healing, but then I can&#039;t use TP to aid my team in times of distress. \r\npls giv much thots ty in advan","replies":[{"poster":"Alex h8721","date":"2017-04-03T23:35:21.263+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is a juggernaut, so a low mobility, high base damage, fairly tanky melee champ.

With only really {{champion:86}} fitting the bill on mechanics being highly easy to pull kite measures against him as long as you are aware of his position and have enough tools to even kite him even if he were to negate a slow effect with his Q's slow break effect. Though once Garen gets on you, he is going to smack you down hard thanks to the E spin's shred and his W's 'burst damage reduction' which {{champion:11}} has proven time and again, a sizable damage reduction can do much more ridiculous wonders then popping a {{summoner:21}} (or similar shield effect unless its brokenly retardedly high) in a team fight that lasts more then a single combo of abilities.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nPlus lets be honest, Riot isn't doing a good job at properly setting up weaknesses that some could easily be done such as:\n\nA. Champions who are able to do high damage, especially in early game should be forcibly tied with high mana costs that even with higher mana regen and mana 'base' should require grabbing items that give mana.\n\nB. Champions who deal low damage on their abilites, but they get the boon of low mana costs so they are able to persist in fights longer and not get 'screwed up' as early on that usually results in them being massacred by the low dmg/low mana type champions who can easily melt the A. type champions because all they mostly can do is auto attacks at most.\n\nLets not even talk about the mess pool that champions like {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:64}} create by screwing the 'rule of balance' and can just massacre plenty of champions in plenty types of match ups against them in the lanes they play within and practically suffer not a single bit on 'downsides' that some white knight that they do 'exist'.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2017-04-04T00:31:44.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius has some real weakness.\n\n1. He gets destroyed by ranged champions if he is equal gold. Like even AD Kennen can destroy him and take 0 damage.\n\n2. He gets destroyed by fast autoattack or true damage skirmishers if he is equal gold late game. Yi for example destroys Darius without serious outplay on the part of the Darius players.\n\nThe problem is that if Darius gets even a tiny lead - sometimes as initially small as a 10 cs and a level, not even a single kill - none of that matters and he will snowball out of control. That is to say, if Darius is not 0-5, he will always have the potential to take over the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-04-03T23:45:06.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"only shitters complain about illaoi","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"l Dárius l","date":"2017-04-04T01:43:19.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, darius does need the heal on his q.\nand no, darius wouldnt be viable without it","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-04-03T23:42:28.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why was darius ever an assassin ? \n\ni thought he got a update during the JUGGERNAUT UPDATE","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-03T23:54:31.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He took a bunch of ranks in stealth.
