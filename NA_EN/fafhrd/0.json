We have a Taunt animation, a laugh animation, a dance animation, and a joke animation. WHERE IS THE HONOR animation. It would be awesome if I had a special gesture to tell an opponent that their skills are stuff of legend. Like at the end of a match where instead of FF at 20 minutes i stick it out because i was soundly beat and my opponent deserves to watch my nexus blow to smithereens. It would be cool if i could have Braum say something like &quot;I underestimated you, you are stronger than you look.&quot;  or something as simple as a bow. We currently have 4 ways to insult an opponent but none to congratulate them. Wont cure toxicity but it might help. Not all of us are trying to be salty haters. \n\nIf you think this is a good idea upvote it and leave a comment! Let's make them notice!\n\nPS Just in response to the comments about a bow or compliment emote begin used as an insult. A bow would be less insulting than Talon grabbing his crotch at my dead body after he eviscerated me with his millions of sharp pokey...things. Haters will hate and arrogance will still be around, but for us people who want to not be toxic at least give us an option in game.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-11-21T21:53:04.572+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just a Narrative type bloke, but I personally think that's a really cool idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-11-20T21:13:17.098+0000","up_votes":70,"down_votes":2,"body":"It would take a while to get it worked in for all the old champions (new voice lines, animations, etc), but that would be awesome.
