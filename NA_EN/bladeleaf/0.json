Also, showing you know the gameplay patterns and strengths/weaknesses of the champion you're asking about and giving a well-reasoned post about them is likely to get a response.\n\nAlso, asking questions that the rioter in question is in a position to know things about helps. In the case of Meddler and Sona, you could ask him if there are planned changes (she actually just got a Q buff which is pretty relevant), if there aren't, and even asking if he knows which Rioter/thread/post you can go to for your best chance at an answer that is more in-depth could work.

Quinn right now has the problem of, when she is picked, she takes the place of what is usually a tank. Allowing her to have a faster clear in the jungle would help with this issue, letting her be picked while the top laner still picks someone more durable. This also would be good for game health, getting a frustrating champion into a less frustrating role. Even her ult and vision makes more sense in the jungle, allowing for more pressure across the entire map and safety of vision.\n\nCurrently Quinn can jungle, but it is weaker and more risky then most other junglers due to the kiting she requires and her slower clear speed. My proposed change is to add some additional damage to monsters onto her passive. This would reward her for making proper use of her passive in the jungle, rewarding her for kiting the monster properly, while keeping her damage to champions the same. \n\nPlease.

Karma was first and foremost a mage with interactive abilities on allies. Since Karma's disaster of a VGU many years ago, you continued to take more abilities from Karma's kit to solidify her as nothing but a bland shield bot that builds shield enhancing items, to be somewhat relevant in the game mid to late game. What skill expression, fun and solo lane presence Karma had before her VGU was taken away and you continued to take more away from her as the years continued.\n\nWhat can any part of the Development team and you tell me now and promise to do that, you haven't already said and haven't done for the past 5 years? No one cares. No one listens. No one wants to do actual work on your team. Stop kidding yourself if you want to sit here and say, **_\"The difference now, I think, is that we're actively seeking out more opportunities for champions to branch out into other positions, and see if we can support those more. So we're prioritizing those opportunities with the goal of opening up some healthy alternative playstyles.\"_** Stop kidding yourself. If you actually took the time listen to feedback and the dedication form players who ACTUALLY play these champions and not when they are abused because of some shield enhancing item, you would know what we really want.\n\nKarma - Bring back the shield bomb you removed from her and gave to Ivern. Bring back the mage identity that made her more interesting to play and didn't solidify her role as a shield bot support.\n\nLulu - If the problem with solo lane Lulu was her damage with her insane utility, why did you just nerf the damage and bottleneck her as a support? If a champion has too much of something in their kit it outshines them and really doesn't bring the champion's potential to the forefront. This is especially the case with Lulu since a lot of people enjoyed playing her in the top lane and mid, but you completely took that away because you wanted her to remain as a support.\n\n------------------\n\nWhat can you tell me right now that is going to reassure me you are going to look and actually WORK on champions like Lulu and Karma? I'll tell you what you are going to do: Work on ways to make Ezreal be able to jungle, go mid and play as ADC. OH WAIT! He can already do that and it has yet to be looked at or addressed.
