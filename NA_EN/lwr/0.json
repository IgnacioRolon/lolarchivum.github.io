This bug occurs whether I try to tab out of the game to wait for others selecting their characters AND occurs if I stay in the game directly looking at the selection. I have tried several times of completely reinstalling the game (clearing ALL League files from my pc) but have come to no avail. Here is an example of the client's chat crash http://i.imgur.com/Bv8axRh.png I would also like to include that my internet speeds are out of the conclusion as I am on a reliable network. http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5622711840 Anyone having similar issues with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T18:33:12.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While your speed and connection to speedtest's servers are good, the League servers are in a completely different geolocation and your connection could run into some issues specifically to them.
