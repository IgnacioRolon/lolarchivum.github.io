However, one of the best games i've ever played is refusing to record anything over 3 seconds past the 15 minutes mark or so.  Every single time i try to record anything beyond a certain point in the replay, it freezes, closes out, and bring up bugsplat (which i reported and filled out several times.)  The clips from before the freezing mark all also have no audio other than loud popping and static, which I've never experienced before, and my cousin who tried to make a replay the other night said he was experiencing the same for the first time with his videos.  I have tried restarting the client and running as administrator multiple times, restarting my computer, deleting the .rofl file and making the client redownload it, and recording a clip from another replay to see if it would help.  \r\n\r\nFor those looking for a quick solution to the same problem I'm having, I myself will probably end up using OBS to record the clips i want while watching the replay, as the problem I'm having only occurs when i try to record, not watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-01T21:54:18.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saw this in another post actually! What's most likely happening is something else on your computer is interfering with the recording. My first suggestion is [**performing a clean boot**](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135) of your system. Once you've done that, make sure that no other programs are running and getting in the way of the highlight by following these steps:\n> Press [Windows Key] + R\n> Type msconfig into the text bar at the bottom of the menu\n> Click on the Services tab\n> Check Hide all Microsoft services so you don't end up accidentally disabling a key process\n> Click the Disable All button\n> Click on the Startup tab\n> Click on the Disable All button\n> Click on the Apply button\n> Click on the OK button\n> Restart your computer\n\nLet me know if trying these steps helps out or not, and we'll go from there.
