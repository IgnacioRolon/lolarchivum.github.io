One of my friends informed me that pretty much all of the Assassins (except Kha&amp;#039;zix) were being widely regarded by the community as way weaker and almost useless now. Opinions?\n\nYou should but I'll express my opinion. \n\nThe assassin class has been heavily changed and I feel Riot is actually changing what assassins are supposed to do in order to find a better balance niche than \"who can kill the carry the quickest without any reaction\" because that playstyle wasn't healthy or fun for anyone but the assassin players. \n\nSo this was more for everyone else than the assassin mains. So I like it because it provides more reactive counterplay (seeing my Ezreal actually be able to escape from a fed Rengar was a blessing) but assassin mains hate it because everyone has more time to react while keeping their 100-0 burst windows (course this is cause everyone except ADC mains hate ADCs and Syndra is still really freaking strong). \n\nIt's a nerf, but it's because the old role wasn't healthy to keep.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-11-10T20:07:10.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:55}} just got a higher skillfloor and is pretty playable, you just need to put time into her.

Also maybe you should try playing them first instead of mindlessly listening to crap when it's not even a week after the update.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HongChongDong","date":"2016-11-10T20:17:01.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ekko hasn't changed, Akali is being buried more or less, Rengar is solid all around but his ult sucks s*** now if you're against anyone who knows anything about map awareness and not being alone, Fizz sucks ass for the moment, Leblanc has a decent amount of delay to her entire kit so she's actually no longer cancer to play against, kat requires more skill to play as, Kha deals less damage, Talon is actually now fun and strong, and zed simply has a bounty mechanic.
