Other than that, a bit more RAM could help, but I'd also check out the steps listed in our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to see if any of those troubleshooting steps can help at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T17:25:30.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might want to increase your RAM to start with, especially if you have multiple processes open simultaneously. Otherwise, close off anything that you're not using and isn't necessary while you're playing.","replies":[{"poster":"lukaserbiantv","date":"2017-12-28T20:32:11.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did it i disabled start up and close everything guy who made my pc said that ram wont help..","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-29T02:56:11.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, even though I can't tell what graphics card you have, it sounds like he built you a cheap computer in the $100-200 range. If he thinks more ram won't help you out even a little bit, he doesn't really know anything. Windows 10 especially is quite heavy on older/cheaper computers. 4 GB of RAM is basically the low end, common amount for cheaper computers to even be able to run smoothly. If possible, getting 8 GB would be even better. Your processor is cheap, and that makes me think your graphics card is also cheap, so really, it depends on your budget/price range that you're able to look at. If possible, I'd upgrade both equally.","replies":[{"poster":"lukaserbiantv","date":"2017-12-29T09:57:09.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will upgrade processor then and ram ?
