Be sure to double check that you aren't missing any Nvidia drivers by checking their website, but I would also take a little time to go through the steps in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as well. Those steps can help a number of different issues and might be able to help get League running smoother for you.","replies":[{"poster":"lukaserbiantv","date":"2018-01-09T01:46:59.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have all drivers.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T01:58:29.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still good to check if you haven't yet, as well as checking the other steps in that [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) I linked. There are a lot of other useful steps in there that can help with a variety of issues. I'd also try checking to see if any background programs might be taking up processing power or something that might be lowering the quality.
