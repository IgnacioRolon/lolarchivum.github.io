So I started thinking, why not let players decide their own experience instead of language/thought policing everything. Why not let players choose between &quot;heavy chat filtration, casual chat filter, no chat filter (except buzzwords like &quot;kys and %%%&quot; because apparently they get through chat filter still, because I&#039;d like to assume that the people who are ACTUALLY getting upset over the things people say are still immature and playing with the filter on..), and vulgar where people can freely say what they want and hear EVERYTHING freely without getting bAnNeD for saying mean things.\r\n\r\nAnd before you people put on your &quot;_I&#039;m a proper high elo player_&quot; hats and snack on your _caviar_, its not about &quot;promoting this type of behavior,&quot; people are going to do what they want and say what they want, you cannot control human nature and sometimes it gets nasty. I&#039;m not saying I agree with the toxic community, but I&#039;m saying why not just let people speak freely if they so **_choose_** instead of banning everybody or punishing players, trying to create a &quot;safe space?&quot; why not let players CHOOSE to create their own safe space if they&#039;re so unstable/immature that they need one. Why not permaban &quot;%%%got, %%%, retard, kys, kill yourself&quot; from every filtration level if you&#039;re just gonna ban/punish people for saying it? Seems almost like you&#039;re putting the cookie jar at child height then waiting to smack them if they try to touch it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nAdd new options so people can make their own safespace and be protected from &quot;triggerwords&quot; instead of banning people who offend these mentally unstable grown children, or permaban these trigger words so players dont slip up and get punished hard for losing their cool.\r\n\r\nyou&#039;re a video game company riot, not college campus thought police.
