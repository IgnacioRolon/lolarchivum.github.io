(there are further details in the page which tells you who qualifies for it) It also notes that once you transfer to the Japan server, you will need to spend RP to transfer out if you choose to.\n\nI hope that clears up any confusion!\n\nNA Blood Moon article: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/blood-moon-calls\n\nJP Account Transfer article: http://jp.leagueoflegends.com/ja/account_transfer","replies":[{"poster":"MashingKeyboard","date":"2016-02-29T14:59:39.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thanks Golin.
