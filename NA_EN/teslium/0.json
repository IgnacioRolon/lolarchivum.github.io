My phone's connection is fine, and everything on my PC that requires internet connection works fine as well. Anyways, what am I supposed to do? I did the hextech repair tool scan and there is a triangle with an exclamation mark right to the right of it. The same applies to game. I did scan it around 3 times and at the last try I forced repatch and is currently download 2 GB worth of data, half of what it required the first time I actually installed League. I will get back to you once the repatch is finished.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T17:32:58.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being able to connect to other venues doesn't mean that your network can't have issues connecting to our servers specifically.  Repatching or repairing won't necessarily resolve this as the issue may be with your network and not game files.  You can use the hextech repair tool to configure your firewall settings, but that's all I would advise with the tool at this time.  Selecting to troubleshoot with the suggestions provided is totally your call, of course.  Best of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Bluy0","date":"2016-08-24T21:25:55.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem here, my game will lauch but i will not get to the champion loading screen as it gets disconnected like in the initial screenshot.\n\nMy girlfriend however, who is using the same network as me, is able to play just fine. As someone else suggested above, it might be due to the fact that eune and euw are not aligned if it comes to patch timings. \n\nI play on both eune and west whereas my girlfriend only plays on eune, perhaps thats the problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HighGrounder","date":"2016-08-24T19:57:02.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I report that i have the same issue as the TS.
