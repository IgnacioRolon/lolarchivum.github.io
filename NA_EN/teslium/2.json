I wasn't experiencing any problems at first, just noticing that the friend I was chatting with didn't appear online in the friend list. I re-logged in, a process which took many, many attempts. I kept getting stuck at \"logging on forever\" (and was put in a queue once). \nI got in, I tried joining a ARAM match. While in queue, I kept receiving \"active game not found\". It found people to match me up with, pressed accept everytime, yet many appeared to have declined. It put me back in queue automatically, then at one point, it just randomly told me that if I decline too many queues, I will receive a penalty.\n\nI'm currently in a 15 minutes queue for ARAM, just as a fun fact.","replies":[{"poster":"Teslium","date":"2016-08-30T09:14:51.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what happened to me as well!
