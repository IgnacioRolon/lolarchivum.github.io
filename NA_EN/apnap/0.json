They're called Noxtoraa, because that's how you say \"Gateway to Noxus\" in their language, Ur-Nox. The Capital itself is referred to as The Immortal Bastion, which is the first citadel that the Noxian tribes conquered when they were beginning to settle down instead of roving the countryside.\n\nLittle FYI as well: Demacia recently had it's lore expanded and updated a bit to reflect the current state of affairs. I don't know for sure, but there's a chance that Noxus could be getting an update at some point!","replies":[]}]}
