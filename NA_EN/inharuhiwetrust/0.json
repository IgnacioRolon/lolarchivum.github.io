Can i opt out of receiving him? please someone from rito reply. the LAST thing i want to do is demote so that i wont get him, since it will be terrible for my teamates in those games. if i could opt out of receiving him it would be great, but at the very least could you de-rank my profile to silver so that i don't have to do it myself and ruin someone else ranked games. i know this is a very wierd request, but not owning champs i hate is very important to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-04T20:17:27.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once the season ends and rewards are sent out, we can look into this for you.
