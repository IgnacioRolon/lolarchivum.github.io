And, maokai isn't one of them. I have 71,400 IP so i could own every champ in the game if i wanted, but i really don't. the reason why i don't own all champs are these:\r\n1. Aside from free week champs i will always get a champ that i like in random select game modes.\r\n2. mystery chests are guaranteed to give me a skin for a champ i like(regardless of whether the skin itself is bad IMO)\r\n3. it's easier to scroll through champs in champ select/ranked. since i only own champs that i will actually play it makes it easier to find the champ i want. It also helps figure out what champ i want since i don't have to sort through all the champs that i don't like to play/will not play.\r\n4. I really just don't want to taint my profile. like i said, I ONLY own champs that i like which is 57 I'm working on getting all of them to at least mastery 5, but having maokai would ruin my perfect profile.\r\n\r\nI know some might think this is a bit silly, but i've kept my profile like this since season 4 for a reason. I have played every champ in the game(except kled) at least once. i give all of them a chance to see if i will like them and i REALLY don't like maokai... like at all... he's a incredibly boring champ IMO and i will never play him unless a random game mode forces me too. So could someone at riot make an exception for my account and not give me victorious maokai pls? i hate to sound ungrateful, but i really don't want it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-04T23:05:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not uncommon for players to reach out in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to request we remove specific content from their account.
