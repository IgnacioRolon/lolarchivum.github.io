Nerf him so hard so he can never be played for the rest of his existance. As a support there is literally shit i can do against nasus in SoloQ and it is super annoying that 1, low elo players try to fight nasus face on, 2, onces it late game, he just automatically wins team fights and the game itself and becomes an unkillable wall.\r\n\r\nwhy is this a thing? If you play nasus I hate you.

I want to play support. thats not fucking hard to understand. I'm not limiting myself A support literally can not do anything to a nasus in low elo. \n\nAnd thats a brand. I don't want toplay an ap carry support. Also blitz crank is slow as fuck until he gets mobi boots. If i miss my hook or the bush is warded, its a waste of time. \n\nI already use the same ward spots bunny fufu does. Low elo players do not have a minimap. They never use it. it does not exist to them. Pings do not exist to them. I never win against a nasus because late game is auto win. There no way around that. He literally becomes a moving wall. And since I'm playing with low elo players they don't know how to kite. Instead they run face first into nasus and don't focus the adc. So fuck the challenger main who literally hasn't been in low elo in ages and probally doesn't know what its actually like in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Sea Slug Menace","date":"2019-05-24T18:41:03.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but I was bronze 1  like 6 days ago, now I have a 77% winrate, as zac support, how the fuck did I make it thru gold???\n\nmust be luck :/ poor you, a victim of circumstance, blame it on society\n\nagain you're saying a bunch of stuff that you DONT/refuse to do to climb, well if you choose to limit yourself, then don't cry.\n\nyou also don't need to go top, you can gank mid, then tell your mid laner to roam top, if that's an impossible task for you, then it's clear to see why I got through gold with flying colors, and you're stuck\n\n\nEdit: bro in the video he legit talks about \"when I'm playing in low elo\" at 3:00 , but you right, he literally hasn't been in low elo in ages, he's just lying, or maybe his \"low elo\" is masters right? yeah must be \n\n\nyou don't want to play brand, you don't want to swap roles, you refuse to roam, you don't want to accept a challengers advice, you choose to limit yourself.
