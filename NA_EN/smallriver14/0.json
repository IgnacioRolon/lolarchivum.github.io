This isnt just a hit piece on ekko , its just being really frustrated against one of those champs i just REALLY hate, and everyone has one of those champs. But i think i do have some valid reasons. {{champion:245}} is a relatively easy champ , but if youre good with him you can really show it by dodging and weaving , 3-5 man stuns , bait them into a position so you can ult to them and just shred them. That being said , a new ekko player doesnt really need to do that , all he has to do is to continue dashing and auto you in laning phase. Yes its nice to hit them with your W but, you _really dont need to_. He has such a safe laning phase with his w being on such a short cooldown , and him being able to just dash to you (its a free range dash , so he doesnt need a ward or a minion to dash), auto you , slow you with his w since its point blank , and blink back. And since his cooldowns are REALLY LOW EARLY GAME for some reason , he gets to do it over , over until 6. Once he hits 6 he can all in you , if you got him low and almost kill him , hes going to face slam his R key , gain a good chunk of hp , and proceed to kill you. Not only that but hes going to push 1-2 waves and get a huge xp lead on you.  Hes a very forgiving champ unlike other assasins like  {{champion:238}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:107}} that if they mess up through out their rotation get killed. Ekko just presses R. Its really frustrating , and ill like to point out that lvl 4 , ekko can trade with you once through his whole rotation , and 7 seconds later he can do it again + {{summoner:14}}  and kill you. Since there is so much dmg in the game this champion has gotten worse for me , i dont know what it is that i hate about this champion so much , but i despise him. If i see an ekko there is a 80-90% chance ill dodge because i want to have fun. I hate the fact that the first time i played him i went 12-3 , the fact that i played 3 more after that and proceeded to get fed and one shot a kassadin.  I hate that hes a different version of {{champion:7}} , low risk , high reward. I liked him better as a tank , but ever since riot FORCED him into being an ap mage assassin , i hate him. As a tank he was so much better , he was a really high mobility cc machine. He would run around slowing your adc (but no one shot the adc because he just slammed his e key and auto&#039;d you with {{item:3100}} ) just being a distraction while the enemy team takes an advantage of that. You can still do that now , but you just go to a squishy , throw out your rotation and R if you need to. Nothing special. Tank ekko was a completely different champ and this ekko makes me want to permaban him. Ekko mains come at me , but the champ is easy to pick up BUT rewarding to master. I just really do hate that he is so easy to pick up and win laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"HATEM1415","date":"2018-12-06T15:47:22.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"ekko is op lol...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vulkus I","date":"2018-12-06T17:05:57.606+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is in my top 3 hated champs so I feel ya","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noor Sakata","date":"2018-12-06T15:46:50.365+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed , he is underrated af","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2018-12-06T15:43:34.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree that his tank version was better because the damage was too fucking high for that level of durability while also being virtually impossible to pin down. Of course, that's why it existed in the first place and why you don't see him building tank much anymore.\n\nI hated Ekko for the longest time before ever actually playing him. Usually when I get around to playing as a champ I despise, I at least develop an appreciation for players who do well with them (Yasuo, Leblanc, Katarina, Camille, Orianna, Kassadin, etc). When I played Ekko I was appalled to discover that every single part of his obnoxious kit is exceptionally easy to use. He's basically the Garen of assassins.\n\nI'm not trying to discount Ekko's skill cap, which is pretty high with his clone and all that. But the only way his skill floor could be lower is if the champ played on auto-pilot. I mean, the fucker has a \"do over\" button, during which the champion literally screams \"DO OVER!\" And W is a good example of a high skill cap ability with a subterranean skill floor. You don't have to get the stun to get huge value out of a massive zoning tool and big shield. Hell, all you really have to do is visibly cast W to get enemies to back off because a gargantuan shield and a slow/stun will usually decide the fight in Ekko's favor.\n\nAs an aside, I remember on game in ARAM where I was Annie with Predator, Relentless Hunter, and Spellbinder. Ekko outran me with a passive proc. Seems legit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bisaknosp","date":"2018-12-06T16:44:27.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yea his scaling kept getting buffed since riot tried really hard to get rid of tank ekko\nimo he needs higher early cd's and some damage nerf on w passive or e","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-12-06T19:10:18.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And where do you come up with this idea? a champion that is right around 50% win rate gold+ (currently sitting at 50.3%) and less than 50% in plat and diamond + ELO.

Let's discuss my man {{champion:245}}. \nyou say Ekko is a low risk/high reward and very forgiving champ, but let's look into that a little bit deeper. \n\nHis passive is great if you are against champions that you can land it on completely, but if you played Ekko you would know that this is not the case most of the time. \nHis Q which is such an easy thing to dodge, and even if you do get hit my the initial part it is pretty easy to dodge the second part.\nHis W is insanely hard to land a stun, but the passive from it makes it easy to kill someone with just an auto attack if they are really low. \nHis E is a decent dash and blink, but if you play against him correctly you should not be hit by this\nYes he has his ult which can get him out of sticky situations, but think about this if he uses his ult to escape he loses a big portion of his damage and at early rank 1 his ult CD is pretty decent. Meaning he only has 2 damaging abilities left and his passive. \n\nEkko has to actually go into melee range to do any meaningful damage whatsoever. He can only capitalize on enemy's mistakes for example Lux misses snare, Ahri Misses Charm, Zed misses WEQ combo, and so on otherwise enemies with CC him or just get away from him without being able to land any damage and an ekko that doesn't proc his passive when he goes is does not usually end well as without his move speed to get away he can be punished. If Ekko uses his E to go in pre-6 he has no escape tools and can be punished for doing so as his E has a 9 second CD for a short dash lvl 1. \n\nLet's look at some of the champs you listed less Forgiving than Ekko \n\nZed - literally can be the safest champ in laning phase as long as you use his W while the minion wave is pushing towards you. He can sit back and throw out his Shadow until he hits his combo + electrocute then swap with his shadow and either AA + Ignite or Ult and kill the target. Zed is a very unforgiving champion to the enemy laner as his Ult is stupidly powerful in 1 v 1's. \n\nTalon - Much better waveclear and his Q is way more reliable and can easily get 2 procs of his passive compared to Ekko's Q. He can escape much easier than Ekko as he can hop over multiple walls and his damage is all frontloaded unlike Ekko who is a Skirmisher and has to work for his kills since he does not have an I KILL YOU NOW BUTTON like Zed or Talon who can use R and say your dead now.\n\nRengar - This champion comparison makes no sense to me. He can blow up a single target pretty quickly which Ekko can only do when extremely fed. Zed Talon, and Rengar are all better \"assassins\" then Ekko is as his damage is not as front loaded as the others.\n\nSaying Ekko is another version of Leblanc is just ludacris as Ekko is not even close to as oppressive as Leblanc is. Ekko can't Poke you out of lane without actually going into melee range, Ekko can't just revert back everytime he goes in (unless he ults, but then he can't do that again very quickly and he loses a huge portion of his damage), Ekko cannot poke you under tower like LB and cant really escape when that over extended like so many of the other champs you tried to compare him to. \n\nLets look at some statistics here as well.\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/overview/middle/gold\nEkko is currently sitting at rank 19 in terms of Win rate in Gold + Elo with a whopping win rate of 50.3%\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/overview/middle/by-winrate\nIn plat plus it is even worse he is ranked 28th with a win rate of 49.2%\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/overview/middle/diamond/by-winrate\nin Diamond + he is still ranked 28th but with a win rate of 49.6%\n\nIf this champion was such a low risk high reward why is his win rate not showing that? Any squishy Melee champion that has to go in to do damage is not low risk something that everyone should understand. \n\nI will tell you what try playing Ekko into a Garen, a Leblanc, a Zoe, a Ryze, or any champ that is really oppressive against melee champs and you will all see... maybe I was wrong about this champion and will respect the players that play him so well. \n\nIf anyone has any questions about Ekko they would like to ask feel free","replies":[]}]}
