What happens if you try on the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nIf it's isolated to the updated client, be sure to report it on the client boards.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
