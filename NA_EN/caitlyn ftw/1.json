Popularized by streamers and twitch chat we have the brand new insult \"Do you have a learning disability?\" A low key insult to call someone a r%%%%% with%%%%%aving to utter the word itself. I just find it amusing how this insult is catching up steam. \n\n*  Your top laner gave first blood and tp'ed back top to get killed again.\n * Hey top do you have a learning disability?\n* Your jungler dies twice trying to solo drake.\n * Hey jungler do you have a learning disability?\n* etc...\n\nPart of me knows it is wrong especially because it is poking fun of disable people but another part of me finds it funny. I don't know honestly. What do you guys think of this stupid insult? Do you think people who say it should be banned or not? \n\nDisclaimer, I don't condone the use of this insult by any mean. Just be nice and don't be a degenerate.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-31T18:27:01.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's a harassment, then it will be punishable.","replies":[{"poster":"Caitlyn FTW","date":"2019-12-31T18:32:48.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Figured as much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jennifer17","date":"2019-12-31T19:05:00.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"this might not be the point of the thread, but this is a question i asked myself MANY times in low elo.\n\nlets just take a generic example that im sure everyone experienced at one point.\n\nyou have a (insert laner here, i'll just pick top as example) renekton vs a nasus.\ntime goes by.\nyou realize the dude is 0/7 alrdy, nasus is 2 level and almost 1,5 items ahead. \nwhat does renekton do? he dashed under the tower and attacks the nasus, doing absolutely no damage and just dying instantly.\n\nwhy? dont you think after losing a 1v1 7 times in a row you'd stop? dont you think the person would realize they started basically ahead cause renekton is stronger, but now they are behind so their chances of winning the 1v1 are even lower?\n\ni never wrote this ingame its just something i always wondered myself, but do these people for real have a learning disability?\nis this considered trolling?\ni mean even for silver standards, in my eyes this behavior is either pure stupidity, or pure trolling. \nif you just refuse to learn and try the same thing over and over and think the result might chance... \n\noh wait no let me quote something.\n\"Albert Einstein is widely credited with saying, “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.”\"\nin this case these people are INSANE!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-31T20:29:31.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are correct that there are stupid people. They might not understand the game, or just might not be paying attention (i.e. mindlessly playing).\n\nCalling them out on it might even help, if you specifically let them know what was dumb. \"Renek, you know you're gonna get wrecked if you try to 1v1 him\"\n\nAnd of course he might tilt because special snowflakes can't take criticism. Then report for negativity. Then get suspended, and mocked for trying to help the team win without using SJW approved terminology.\n\nWow just tilted myself there\n\nPoint is just let stupid \"whee\" simpletons have fun and ask if they want help and if they don't Want criticism let them be like that stupid rich kids son that your parents are watching because they are getting favors for babysitting the spoiled brat that no nanny wants to watch that they have to ask your kiss ass dad to get his yes sir wife to take care of\n\nYeah really wanna play with those people riot, and you tell us you're not a babysitter...\n\nSpeaking of re\n...","replies":[{"poster":"Caitlyn FTW","date":"2019-12-31T23:02:50.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many gems in this thread.
