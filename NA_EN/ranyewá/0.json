And it sucks... i know!\nBut wouldn't it be great to be able to separate those who go bcause they choose to, from those who were just going to play a game to have fun and something wrong happens out of their control that ends up with 100 min lost on queue?! \n\nPlus, if we been there, and waited the all 5x20min ... to get to play a game... isn't it obvious that we didn't do it in purpose, and that we really want to play this game?\n\nA warning at least intead of instant penalty for 1x ou 2x ... then the penaty, for example;\n\nDe \"GG\" counting to reduce the time on the probation if given from non premade teamplayers;\n\nOr having difrent time penalties for the game tipe. Since it is way more sirious if on ranked matches than on the normal or aram;\n\nAdding a report for AFK on purpose/by choice and one for unvoluntairy AFK to difirenciate us;\n\nGet the afk to play with each other for God sake... maybe we will even form afk teams for the ones who do not go afk by choice, and end those toxic coments and all the reporting thing.\nThat way we would be understanding with each other's ... not simply hate and look at our belly buttons ONLY!
