The skill on a tank like Alistar was no to get the W+Q combo right, it was to know when NOT to go for that combo, knowing when to hold back.\n\nAnd right now, or actually since S6, this no longer is the case. CDs are generally so low on new designs and through overabundance on CDR that many things are best used if spammed to max uptime/dps becuase riot wants players to \"have more buttons to press in a fight\" - a fundamentaly stupid reason in a strategic and tactical game, it shouldn't be about pressing many buttons fast, it should be about pressing the right button in the right situation at the right time.  \nThe other big issue is that TTK is so low that you basically have to dumb your entier kit imidiatly, or the fight is over befor you get a chance to use you're shit. Either you go instanly all-out and burst down you're opponent first, or you won't get a chance to go all-out. There is no time to wait for openenings, sneak around for flanks, setup combos, you either take em down in a blazeing flash of madness, or they take you down that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RC cars are life","date":"2018-08-07T02:52:25.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I think league should start to die so another MOBA can grow and learn from RIOT's mistakes and fill the viod in the genre","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustHeatHaze","date":"2018-08-06T03:23:37.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally also don't like the high damage meta where its basically \"cc and focus and blow up\" but whats more important is the stuff he says about community attitude\n\n\"think that there is so much negativity in the community right now\"\n\n\"I think that right now its like its easy for riot to be a punching bag people are like every single day on the subreddit its like 50% negative, its disgusting honestly i hate talking to people about the game because even playing the game with people it feels like when im playing the game with people no one in the game is having fun\"\n\n\"its just been this cesspool of negativity for months and its actually so irritating to play like incredibly irritating to play\"\n\n\"as a person who streams the game a lot and loves to play the game it sucks because every single game i go into pretty much every single game i get flamed used to be i have flame 10% of my games and now its over 50%\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2018-08-05T12:30:23.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tbt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-08-06T05:18:38.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"This video is like 2 weeks old.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-08-05T19:33:14.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"We already had a pretty decent thread on this that went on for almost a full week.
