The main thing I realize about league of legends in general is.. Counter play is important, and when there is no counter play it ruins the experience. \r\n\r\nGlacial for instance has no counter play to it.\r\nThey have an item that counters 100% crit. But they don't have a cleanse item to stop perma frost stuns. This is very frustrating. Especially in a meta where several frost champs have ults that stun for several seconds on top of ones with high attack speed that can proc a stun very very very easily. \r\n\r\nPLEASE create a cleanse item, that either makes the champion invulnerable to being stunned full stop, or have it trigger like hush where once you are stunned you are unable to be stunned for 5 seconds. That seems like such a reasonable item. If you can create an item that allows a champ to be immortal to all crit attacks then you can do the same for stuns.  \r\n\r\nALSO Please just add a button that full levels you. No one just clicks lvl once and waste 4 gold for no reason. You can leave the option there, but it should have a button that is right next to the lvl button that allows for a full level up, when available. It would also help with quick math when things are a little crazy and you poorly add and are off by 2 gold or something, then have to sell a unit unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nPlease \r\nPLEASE \r\nDo something about these gripes. I think they are legitimate and worth looking into. It'll make the game more fun for everyone. \r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\n-Ape","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-15T02:36:51.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There already is one on PBE, made from {{item:1051}} + {{item:1057}} .
