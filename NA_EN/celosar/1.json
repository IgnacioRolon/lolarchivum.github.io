This is the reason I stopped playing TT and Dom several months ago. I&#039;m pretty sure this problem is absurdly rampant. Maybe you guys could call Blizzard and ask for some anti bot software so I and no doubt many others can experience these maps with real live people in non-bot mode.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaelintha","date":"2015-06-15T20:22:27.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had one game that had 1 bot in it, the other four games IN A ROW all had two bots in it and I had to carry the entire game. I am no longer going to bother with Twisted Treeline anymore. I am tired of wasting time fighting against a team by myself and watching the enemy get fed repeatedly by bots. Alas, I don't really think Riot cares as long as people are continuing to buy their stupid skins and champs with dollars. They are still getting their money for now. Frankly I am not spending another cent on this game until they get rid of bots, I may just quit and move to a different game all together.

I've started playing the new TT since the update and really like it but WTF is going on with all the bots on TT and how are they getting in that map so easily.  It's awful  -- RIOT please fix this.
