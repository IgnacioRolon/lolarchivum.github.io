I have played 4 games in the last 3 days in which I was on the receiving end of this. It hasn't happened on my end because I think it's about as douchey as you can get and I always just go end myself. \n\nI started thinking about it though and I recall seeing this several times on a few twitch streams. Not trying to dime anyone out but I've seen Bjergsen do it on several occasions and a few others as well and I can't help but think something along the lines of, \"Us nubcakes are supposed to look up to guys like this?! Are you serious?\" Lol, I also saw several challenger level players, including pros, that like to create a new team on smurfs and play their placements then just delete the team and do it again. That's good stuff RITO, keep paying these guys to play. \n\ni think possibly the best part of this game is that I can't even leave. I literally have to sit through as much as an hour of this because I'll get LeaveBustered if I just bail and do something else for a while. Oh and probably reported by the rest of my team. \n\nHas anyone else encountered this? Recently? The life of the game? I mean I suppose it's possible it's happened before and I just now noticed it because it has happened several times in rapid succession.\n\nEdit: I try to surrender. A large portion of the LoL community is of the \"Never give in, never surrender\" mentality. \n\nI don't understand how some of you are trying to justify extending a game for upwards of 10 minutes because \"it's fun\" to waste someone's play time. Some people can only play for maybe an hour or one game a day and you're intentionally being a dick because \"it's fun\". \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-07-11T18:42:01.707+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i see that i report for assisting enemy team, which is what they are doing.
