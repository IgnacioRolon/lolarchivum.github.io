I pulled the OP.GG stats for the game referenced by the OP to find out how it went.  I'm not trying to insult you OP, I'm just going to state facts and then try to provide an unbiased opinion at the end. This is what I saw:\n\n1. This was a bronze 3 - silver 5 game.  Funny, the last thread I saw like this was too.  Once again I'll ignore this and move on, but I figured it was worth mentioning.\n2. You were Leblanc mid and dealt slightly less than 4k damage over the duration of the game.  You did not get a single kill throughout the entire game, which ended in 24 minutes.  You also only died twice and you did get 2 assists.\n3. You had a (full tank) support Wukong that dealt over twice as much damage as you, the assassin mid, over the course of the game.\n4. Their Ekko dealt 15,778 damage and it wasn't even the most damage dealt in the game. *Your Shen did 18,382 damage to champions despite having 3 thousand less gold than Ekko at the end of the game.*\n5. Your ADC was varus and he died a lot (7 times) but he also dealt considerably more damage than the enemy Ashe who ended with a perfect KDA of 4/0/5\n\nSo here's what I gather from this:\n\nLooks like their bot lane won pretty hard.  Seems you didn't spend much time helping yours out, while the enemy Ekko got a lot of kills from Varus, Wukong, and Fiora.  You had 2 kill participation in a game with 10 kills total for your team on one of the most mobile and safest mids in the game. You also dealt the least amount of damage in the game despite them having 2 extremely squishy and defenseless targets (Ashe and Zyra).  \n\nBased on the small amount of damage you did compared to other players with the same amount of gold as you, I would say you played too safely and didn't give it your all in fights - or you positioned poorly and weren't able to deal damage because you had to go onto the wrong target.  \n\nVarus clearly gave it his all, and he died a lot because he was against a mobile assassin with bad peel (Zyra), but he did his fair share of damage and honestly probably did as well as Ashe given the circumstances.  Ashe should have died as many times as Varus due to your team having both a Fiora and a Leblanc, which she is incapable of dealing with on her own.\n\nYou seem like a pretty reasonable person based on how you write, but what makes you think that this game is an accurate representation that Ekko is overpowered in any way?  You lost lane and proceeded to play very poorly despite having plenty of targets on a very mobile and snowbally champion.  You CSed well enough so you were never stupidly behind in gold to a point of being useless, but you played like you were useless despite this.  A Shen with 6k gold dealt more damage over the course of a 24 minute game than an Ekko with 9k gold, and yet here we are in a thread that calls Ekko overpowered?","replies":[{"poster":"Celosar","date":"2015-05-29T19:37:42.147+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":54,"body":"I appreciate the time you put into this post but you could have called me bad and said the same thing in 1 word without spending 15-ish minutes of your life breaking down why you think so.

They avoid tanks and extended fights for the most part.\n\nBecause this is their goal, assassins always have mobility and often have CC--although instant, targeted hard CC is considered taboo because of their design. They also tend to have some sort of personal defense tool and some AoE.\n\nAll of the archetypes have defined goals in a fight, as well as guaranteed and expected kit tools.

Ekko has a \"Get out of jail free\" card that everyone complains about ({{champion:238}}, {{champion:7}})\n\nAlso, Ekko can 4-shot _FULL BUILD, 400 STACK WITH A TRI-FORCE_ {{champion:75}} .
