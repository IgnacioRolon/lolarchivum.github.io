( and why did they make my game bug out)","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"SOMEONE PLZ HELP!!!! So i was in game as Twisted Fate mid lane and i was typing something in chat when the champion name next to my name didn&#039;t say &quot;Twisted Fate&quot; anymore instead it said &quot;Squill&quot;, this only happened once however and then my name went back to the normal &quot;T. F.&quot;. As soon as i see this my entire game starts to get buggy. First my E was permanently on, but it wasn&#039;t procking  when i auto attacked. Secondly i kep messaging over all chat that i had saw the name &quot;Squill&quot; and not &quot;Twisted Fate&quot; and yet no one responded for the entire game neither on my team or the enemy team. This continued the rest of the game and also into the post game lobby. No &quot;gg&quot; or anything only my text and no one elses. I didn&#039;t understand why the game got so laggy and especially why it all started after this &quot;Squill&quot; name appeared. So IDK if there is a bug with T.F. or if somehow a champ leaked and it ruined my game. But i do know that was the weirdest game of league i ever played........ Can anyone help me understand this cause i feel like im going crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-01-26T16:36:46.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Squill is the animal/cupcake/snowman that Lulu turns people into with Polymorph","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-27T18:18:55.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!
