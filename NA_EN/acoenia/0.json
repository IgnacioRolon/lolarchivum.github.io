This obviously made things much more difficult considering I use smart cast and could not always tell if the ball had already moved or not. Problem seemed to occur consistently when trying to put the ball on myself or teammates. If I moved the ball on it&#039;s own, it worked about half the time. This only happened when I was using the Winter Orianna skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-07T22:16:40.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Acoenia,\n\nThanks for reporting this!

One instance I noticed it happening was when I shielded an ally. I can't remember if they died with it, or simply jumped/dashed out of range and my ball went invisible temporarily.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-09T00:07:27.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the lead - we'll look into it!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MisterHealYoGirl","date":"2016-01-06T04:37:56.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be related to a bug where Orianna gets several of the arrows that point to where the ball is, all pointing in different directions.
