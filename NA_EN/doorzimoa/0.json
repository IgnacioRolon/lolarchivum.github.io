My only problem is... lately, about 1 in 3 times when i click on it, my lol client just closes it out completely. I was wondering if that only happens to me, and if there is a way for me to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T21:45:41.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, is your client simply closing whenever you run hextech crafting?  Is there a specific point that this is happening, such when you select a shard or try to craft something?  Are you receiving any error messages?

That said, the program does seem to still be running, in that if you go to open league again it gives a dialogue box that says theres already an instance of the client running.\n\nI haven't been able to pinpoint any particular activities that lead up to it, and often opening hextech crafting works fine. It just seems that after I've bene playing for awhile and happen to go check to see if I have 3 fragments yet or something like that, the client choke as described above.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThePotatoChamp","date":"2016-07-27T17:00:36.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing just happened to me.
