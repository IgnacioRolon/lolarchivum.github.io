It was like this for a couple months, and I had no problems playing with this ping.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently it's gone up to 135-145 constant ping. I feel like it was because of the patches but I am curious why it has gone up by 30 lately. Also I can feel a big difference between 105 and 135-145, so it is kinda frustrating.
