Riot was saying that she is such a hard champion to create a skin for due to her having three different guns with completely unique characteristics. I have seen some pretty rad fan concept art of Harley Quinn Jinx, Retro Jinx and Cyberpunk Jinx and they all look really amazing. Riot, can you get on this please. This \"Loose Cannon\" is in desperate need of some love.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-01-13T19:32:56.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"We thought she needed a new look, too!

The reason of Jinx being unable to get a new skin because she has too many animations and complicated design seems redundant to me because why would they even create such a champion at the first place if they couldn't cater to its needs in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2014-12-22T03:16:38.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not even sure you could consider that an excuse because they always seem to use it. eg Udyr not getting a skin for the longest time until a rework but ended up getting the Ultimate skin, same with Rumble too outdated, but able to play the Super Galaxy skin. and again with Eve, granted hers was a 750 skin, but if thats the case they should be making more 750 skins especially for champs who havent gotten a skin in their recent years!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Son Olivia Hye","date":"2015-01-13T21:12:10.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firecracker jinx fits her theme so much.
