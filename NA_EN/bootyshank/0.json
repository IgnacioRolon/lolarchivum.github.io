However when trying to recreated this bug against minions I found that the splash damage the minions took was just the normal auto attack red, not the crit orange, but will still do the damage that crit in fishbones would normally do. So maybe this has to do with the fact that Fishbones is actually a spell. There is a similar bug with Yi and Garen who both have abilities that can crit. This could be related but I cannot confirm this.\n\nThis is actually a very stramge bug. Get 100% crit, switch between Fishbones and Pow Pow, then auto attack. You wont critically strike.\nHere is a video. As you can see I have 100% critical strike chance and i do not crit.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2qKyHoJDh8\nFIX IT.
