This happened to mine and my boyfriend's one too.\nWe usually play on fullscreen so I was playing with the game settings (You have to drag the box down to see this part) and in the \"Video\" section, there's \"Windowed Mode\", followed by a drop down box which I changed to 'windowed' instead of 'full screen' and it worked :)\nI hope it works for you guys too\n\nEDIT: I just changed it back to fullscreen settings after setting it to windowed and it's perfectly normal now.
