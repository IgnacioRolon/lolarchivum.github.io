I died while doing Red at lvl2, which is first time ever to die during Eve&#039;s initial clear. I didn&#039;t know why, I thought I picked wrong runes but everything seemed ok with them. After a few camps I started to notice spikes from Q changing direction, without me moving or switching AA target. After next few camps, including Red where I have good view of a camp - Her Q seems to randomly switch targets. Is that something I encountered only, or is there really a bug with her Q? Or maybe I just missunderstood how her Q works .-.","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-08-31T17:53:28.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve's Q is focused towards the current target of your auto attacks or the \"closest\" enemy target. when i play her, i tend to line them up for the first Q then rotate using move + attack move while Q'ing to ensure that my target is my \"auto attack target\" as well. it may help you if you use attack move, but it takes some getting used to since its a really poorly designed mechanic in my opinion. (a case of good intentions, poor outcome sadly.) im not a Eve main though, so this is probably a bit off, but from my experience playing her, it seems to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Dêcoy","date":"2016-09-02T11:46:03.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play Eve a lot and recently I just wanted to get back on her. Got her on ARAM, went well, so I wanted to play normal game on her. Typical, right?\n\nThe things is - I was attacking red buff entire time, while my Q kept switching targets for no reason at all .-. That's the point here, when you autoattack target, that target becomes also target of your Q. So why it keeps switching while I keep attacking same mob? I died twice in my own jungle because of that stuff","replies":[{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-02T18:56:32.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you move click away you stop auto attacking, so it'll hit the closest registered monster (\"registered\") it's easier to kill the little ones first so you don't have the issue. After first back when you get the other component or you get the jungle item, whichever way you prefer, it's pretty easy to E the little one to kill it quickly. You could also try AD eve jg. So you won't be so reliant on Q, it's equally viable. Hextech gunblade, frozen mallet, titanic hydra, swifty boots, deadmans plate, and last item is free depending on what the enemy comp is. I usually grab QSS item if they have any kind of slow or stun or deaths dance.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
