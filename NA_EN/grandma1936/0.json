I should not have used that word or even bothered with any response in the first place.  I feel terrible about it, and it won&#039;t happen again.\r\n\r\nThe context here is that I was playing Xerath in an ARAM match.  I was not having a great game (finished score line of 2/10/28).  I was a stun/CC magnet against a team with a Leona, Kalista, and Veigar.  Players on my team were bickering throughout the match amongst one another.  I was spammed repeatedly with ?s pings, and that&#039;s when I lost my cool and said the above.  The &quot;that&#039;s fine&quot; was in response to being told that I suck.  The rest of my team continued to argue and bicker for the duration of the match, and I said nothing else.  I tried my hardest in the match, but I had a poor game.  \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, I just instantly mute negativity and toxicity, and then I go on my merry way.  We&#039;ve all had frustrating games, and I&#039;ve always just shrugged it off and happily went on to the next game.  I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t do that in this game.  Again, I&#039;m not making excuses.  I was wrong.  I am only providing context for the chat log.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I&#039;m posting here is that I am disappointed at the severity of the penalty.  I have never received any infractions before.  I did reach out to Riot&#039;s support chat, and  I was advised that there is a zero tolerance policy and the penalty would not be reduced.  If that&#039;s the policy, then so be it.  I&#039;m here because I want to express my frustration and disappointment about the harshness of the policy.\r\n\r\nI feel like my case is a good example of what should qualify for a chat restriction.  No previous issues of toxicity and a first time screw up after several years of playing.  Yet, the punishment immediately escalated past any chat restriction or lesser suspension.  Why did my punishment escalate immediately to a 2 week suspension?  Why was a chat restriction not the more appropriate punishment for a first time offense?\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-12-21T05:52:14.472+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hate speech earns a 14-day ban on the first offense to firmly drive home the point that this behavior will not be tolerated.","replies":[{"poster":"Da Giggler","date":"2018-12-22T05:50:01.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then where are my notifications for the bans of the 7-8 people in the last 4 days that have just dropped the n bomb in a game and not gotten punished for it?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-12-22T13:38:50.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Da Giggler,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YisAB448,comment-id=00010003,timestamp=2018-12-22T05:50:01.028+0000)\n>\n> then where are my notifications for the bans of the 7-8 people in the last 4 days that have just dropped the n bomb in a game and not gotten punished for it?\n\nNotifications don't always send (to my knowledge) and, when they do, the inly send to a single player.

I never implied that I didn't know what caused me to be punished. I never implied that I didn't deserve to be punished.  I never implied that I didn't understand why I was punished.  I never implied that I was anything but wrong and contrite.  Maybe you would have understood what my goal here was if you actually hard read the post, rather than climbing on your pulpit to preach.\n\nI censored the word for two reasons.  Firstly, I'm not going to test how the forum's profanity filter works, and therefore risk getting permanently banned.  I now understand how seriously Riot takes this.  Secondly, I censored it for clarity, because that's not the only F word I could have used.  It was for full disclosure.\n\nI disagree that the question of \"Why not a chat restriction?\" being a \"no-brainer.\"  A two week suspension is an arbitrary punishment.  Why not one week? Why not three weeks?  Why not an immediate ban?  Those are fair questions to ask.  Your opinion is that a chat restriction would be far too light; that is certainly not a universal opinion, and it is not beyond reproach.\n\nWe should be able to ask about and discuss the topic.  Is this punishment appropriate? What punishment would best correct the behavior?  It's like pretending that chopping off a hand is the only way to punish shoplifting, and ignoring the many other options such as a fine, a ban from the premises, community service, a jail sentence, etc.\n\nI'm glad that you got to type up your little speech, but it was neither helpful nor insightful.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-12-21T15:35:25.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm going to start with the simplest thing I can respond to:\n\n> I'm glad that you got to type up your little speech, but it was neither helpful nor insightful.\n\nIt's only unhelpful because you chose not to take anything away from it.

Firstly, I'm not going to test how the forum's profanity filter works, and therefore risk getting permanently banned.\n\nI can assure you, you wouldn't be banned for posting your chat log ad verbatim. The Profanity Filter would simply replace the homophobic slur with a series of percent signs.\n\nBesides that, Boards Punishments don't carry over to your account - so, even if you did commit an infraction like trying to evade the chat filter, you'd only receive a short Boards Ban, with nothing extraneous happening to your account.\n\nThat out of the way...\n\n---\n\n> Good grief.

I never implied that I was anything but wrong and contrite. Maybe you would have understood what my goal here was if you actually hard read the post, rather than climbing on your pulpit to preach.\n\nI have difficulty understanding your goal because the idea of the goal conflicts with your apparent understanding of your punishment. You _know_ why you got punished, you _know_ hate speech is bad, and you're still trying to argue that you deserve a lighter punishment, as though you had never used hate speech in the first place.\n\nWhat you're doing is the equivalent of complaining about being sentenced to jailtime for murder, and asking for a modest fine instead. It's only your first time killing a man, so why do you get such a harsh punishment right off the bat? You know its wrong to murder, and yet you're still asking for a punishment that doesn't fit the crime.\n\n> I disagree that the question of \"Why not a chat restriction?\" being a \"no-brainer.\" A two week suspension is an arbitrary punishment. Why not one week? Why not three weeks? Why not an immediate ban? Those are fair questions to ask. Your opinion is that a chat restriction would be far too light; that is certainly not a universal opinion, and it is not beyond reproach.\n\nArbitrary to _you_. But the punishment tiers have been decided on and in place for years now, after a lot of deliberation on Riot's part to ensure that the punishments fit and give players the knowledge that their behavior is not okay.\n\nThe punishment progression goes as follows:\n\n- 10-game Chat Restriction\n- 25-game Chat Restriction\n- 14-day Ban\n- Permanent ban\n\nThere's no three-week, and no one-week ban, so I'm gonna guess those are less of \"fair questions\" and more of an attempt to sidestep the core of the issue.\n\nRather than asking \"why not this made-up punishment\" or \"why not that one\" - you should be asking \"why does this offense _specifically_ call for a 14-day ban?\"\n\nAnd the answer to that is; _Riot doesn't believe that a chat restriction is a sufficient punishment for the use of hate speech. You should **know** better than to use hate speech, which is why the metaphorical hammer comes down so hard on it._\n\nAnd, like I said earlier - attempting to argue that you deserve a 10-game Chat Restriction for hate speech is like attempting to argue that you deserve a modest fine for murder. The punishment has to fit the crime - and a 10-game chat restriction/modest fine do not work for hate speech/murder.\n\nIf people got only Chat Restrictions for hate speech (following the normal progression as though it were flame), they'd start to think that using hate speech is okay and just part of regular flame. That's not what Riot wants, so they punish hate speech _especially_ harshly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-21T05:51:28.894+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"That word is literally never okay in League.

There was a post about a premade in 5v5 typing the n%%%%r-word a letter at a time in the all-chat as soon as the game started. It wasn't targeted at anyone. It was just floating there in the air.

You've used a loophole to say n%%%%r and f%%%%t, do both of us think it, it's just not laying down on a page. It's still less perceivable that reading the word itself, making the language worse. \n\nNice one with that \"FG\" by the way.

Said both of them twice out loud. It was the right thing to do. \n\n> it could not mean harm, but saying that word can mean offense to people.\n\nWhen you discuss anything, especially controversial, you risk offending someone. Someone out there gets offended by the fact thay you breathe and consume resources that dolphins would put to a better use.\n\nNot being offended is not one's right. The concept of offense should not be the basis of a system that sells something as serious as permabans.\n\n> also, as tested (do not ask how or why), the system can&#x27;t pick up letter by letter words.\n> \n> but a human can.\n\nWhich is why actual hateful people create topics and write to support about such stuff. We can only wonder whether it's punishable by Riot, but they leave an impression that it is.\n\n> in general, you shouldn&#x27;t be saying those words, you are using Riots product, and thus you should follow Riots rules.\n\nThey never said that you can't say these specific words though. There is no list. \n\n> Toxicity refers heavy negativity, in giving up, insulting others or etc.\n> flaming refers to the last part of that statement.\n> \n> Toxicity relates to words that are directed at someone (in a negative fashion).\n> \n> ex:\n> &quot;STFU you dumbass&quot;\n> &quot;lmfao bitch learn to play ur champ first&quot;\n> \n> but with the same words in a non-negative fashion.\n> \n> &quot;STFU despacito best song&quot;\n> &quot;lmfao I can&#x27;t hit shit today&quot;\n> .\n> \n> in truth, toxicity relates to how words are used.\n\nThat's one hell of a highconcept for a punishment system that **permabans** people.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-22T18:01:09.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, in context of your Country thing, there are only 2 other major languages other then english in this continent, Spanish and ~~texan~~ French, and most spanish players tend to learn english or simply not talk without another Spaniard. \n\nit is to be noted that each Region treats toxicity differently.","replies":[{"poster":"SonicAF","date":"2018-12-22T18:42:17.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YisAB448,comment-id=00030000000000000001,timestamp=2018-12-22T18:01:09.107+0000)\n>\n> also, in context of your Country thing, there are only 2 other major languages other then english in this continent, Spanish and ~~texan~~ French, and most spanish players tend to learn english or simply not talk without another Spaniard. \n> \n> it is to be noted that each Region treats toxicity differently.\n\nTo an extent.
