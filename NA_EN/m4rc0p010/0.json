I checked the task manager and saw that league of legends is opening but closing immidiatly after 3 seconds. I tried to repair and reinstall it with the hexttech tool already.\r\n\r\nI successfully uninstall the game and its opening and downloading it then again. At the point where league of legends is installed and the client should be opened normally for the patching the same issue comes again. I start it and it closes it self after 3 seconds (No Client is opening i just see the task in the task manager) \r\n\r\nAny ideas to solve this problem? Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nM4RC0P010","replies":[{"poster":"Thanae","date":"2020-02-26T20:32:13.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue at the moment.

Might help us figure out the issue and push out a fix.\n\nRune page bug... is not something I can help out with unfortunately. I checked on the status of that bug for you. Some changes were made recently to try to reduce the frequency and more investigation is being done. It seems like there is a bit of struggle with it because its hard to reproduce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot BlueMonday","date":"2020-02-21T02:28:11.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Is this issue still happening for you?
