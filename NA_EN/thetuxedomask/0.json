There was a Xin Zhao on the other team and every time I used my wall to back him off me, he was able to dash over my wall to kill me. However, Azir&#039;s ult description specifically says it stops all forms of dashes. HE EVEN SNOWBALLED OVER IT! Anyone else having this issue? Please fix. It was awful.{{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2016-04-08T01:24:49.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:32}}  is untargetable when you dash so it ignores everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-04-08T08:34:36.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Azir's R does not effect untargetable units.
