Best thing to do is mute the master volume, its stopped my lagg sadly i hate playing this way because i can&#039;t hear anything witch throws me off a bit i hope riot addresses these problems for mac users.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-05T21:27:40.360+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Heya Ironskull00! \n\nThanks for the report!

At first I thought it was my headphones, then my sound card, then perhaps anything running on the computer. None of these were the case. It wasn't until I searched the issue that I found out other mac users were having the same issue. It's not entirely fair that our games have to suffer because of a mac bug, while windows users are practically unaffected. Honestly, instead of asking for our computer specs, riot should actually apologize and give out free skins or something to affected users. We did nothing to cause this, neither did our computers, and It has effected our game play.
