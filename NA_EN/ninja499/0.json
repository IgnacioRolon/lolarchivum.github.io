I mean a while back, league use to always update on Tuesdays or something and it was good to know which day the new updates always came out.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T20:40:00.726+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally got the details boys!

Keep up the great work Riot!\n\nYeah, I am with you on that schedule idea. I got the pass as soon as it was available and now have been basically waiting for over a week to get any missions whatsoever after completing week 1. \n\nAgreed, those Star Guardian missions were pure pain to do.... There simply was no fun in trying to get them all... but most of that came from the mode itself being pretty annoying to play and having to fulfill some other requirements made that feel grindy as hell.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Palapalo","date":"2017-10-02T12:17:58.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the 2nd Oct and I still don't have missions.
