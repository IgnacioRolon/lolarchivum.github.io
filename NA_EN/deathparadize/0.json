If you're looking to understand the reasoning/rationale behind your permanent suspension, you can submit a ticket to [**Riot Games Player Support**](https://support.riotgames.com/). If it's a behavioral suspension, as I assume it is, chat logs can be provided (although, they would also be readily available in your client). If it's due to 3rd party applications, they may indicate that but not provide any additional information to prevent circumvention of detection systems. If it's due to your account being compromised, they may work with you to reverse some of the punishments (unlikely). \n2. Your experience within League of Legends is governed by the Terms of Use.
