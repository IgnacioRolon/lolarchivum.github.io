She is too op, if you dont think so it&#039;s because you probably don&#039;t know how to play her well. She is overpowered, with tons of damage and that new and stupid ult that heals her! like if all the life steal wasn&#039;t enough. And then the passive, that at the beggining all the people said it was bad but i knew it was going to be a pain in the ass, and here it is. These kind of champs are not fun, like Garen; i used to play him a lot, but now its simply too easy! you dont even have to try hard.  I dont play lol in a competitive way, only for fun, and every time you play against a Fiora you know it&#039;s not going to be fun. The latest changes in Lol are bad in general (all the juggernauts stuff sucks in my opinion, a champ that has tons of life and tons of dmg, wtf?!??!) but, this champ is specially unbalanced, hope Riot will take a look to her gameplays and repair this.","replies":[{"poster":"The Patriachy","date":"2015-11-09T21:04:34.928+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem is she is strong against everything.\n\nMurders full tanks with her % health true damage.\nMurders adcs with her attack speed slow, stickiness and bust from her e.\nMages are scared to use abilities on her because of the threat of her w.

Even though melee AD carries like Olaf, Tryndamere, and Aatrox can deal with her early on, her true damage scaling allows her to beat anyone in the game at 25 or so minutes. Renekton is one of the only tanky champions that can deal with her because of his instant stun, but again, the longer the game goes on, the less counterable she becomes. Renekton can be fed and have more AD and AR than Fiora but she will still win the trade.  She can build a frozen heart and win trades. Other fighters can't because her true damage counters that. Even building hp doesn't work because its %max hp. Her healing is outrageous too. All she needs is a Hydra, Black Cleaver, a few defensive items, and she can do the most damage in teamfights by far while being too difficult to remove. \n\n%max hp true damage is the most toxic mechanic in the game next to invulnerability/untargetable. Couple this with free self-healing, high mobility, and nearly 1 second of invulnerability + hard CC in one ability basically gives her no weaknesses. \n\nVayne is only acceptable with %max hp true damage because she can't deal the same kind of damage as Fiora if she builds defensively and she can reliably be CCd.","replies":[{"poster":"Elindis","date":"2015-11-10T07:48:46.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lissandra completely destroys Fiora at any stage of the game.\n2 unpredictable CC spells, ranged poke spam, double zhonya's, escape... \nDonger?
