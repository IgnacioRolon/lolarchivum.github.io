And the forums in their current state don't have a nifty notifications system; finding responses to your post is just a mess.

However, it is apparently very difficult to customize the system the forums currently run on, particularly with notifications. I'm not the person to ask for details (having little to no experience with formatting web pages, etc) but that's what I've been lead to believe by other people who know more.\n\nAlso, the nesting limit is around 7 or 8 children per response, and while I agree more would be useful for very long discussions, we still have few more responses. Remember, this is a *beta* so maybe they will increase the limit eventually once they find that this is a common problem.
