Her base damages along with that provides no counterplay. its not right that the only counterplay is 3 champions to knock her out of it. The obious counter would be making her ult flashable. Otherwise trying to use range, or trying to ccing her if  shes on a squishy (cant since she will one shot the adc before) doesnt give do enough to counter her.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-12-19T07:41:52.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to the above comment. You take exhaust on the support and you can counterpick from other lanes as well.  Any cc burst mage mid like annie, lux, lissandra (can literally just ult herself), alistar, thresh, blitz, lee sin and gragas all counter her ulti by displacing and ccing her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brutalitops01","date":"2016-12-19T05:37:33.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:13}} Realm Warp + {{item:3157}} . Once she ults you, hit R and Zhonya's and she not only won't be able to touch you, but you will successfully teleport out because the channel will end after her ult ends.\n\n{{champion:223}} W can also get someone out of her ultimate, provided he doesn't spit them out early.\n\nAlso, anyone who can CC her or fight her has an advantage. She doesn't have a lot of power to shred tanks. Fiora and Jax are both hard counters. Fiora can reflect her very telegraphed and obvious stun and Jax can use his E to deny all of her damage. Anyone who can stun her while she's dashing to the wall with her E can also beat her pretty easily. If you stun her while she's dashing to the wall (don't do it while the lines from the E are still flying to the wall, she'll keep going and be able to finish the ability after the stun finishes), the stun stops and goes on cooldown. Her only tank shredding is the % max health damage on her W and the % current health damage on autos on the enemy she ulted (which is very low), so anyone who can tank her autos for a while while dealing constant damage to her can easily kill her. Or anyone who can out burst her, like a Cho'Gath with a bit of AP can knock her up, W, bite and she's pretty much dead.","replies":[]}]}
