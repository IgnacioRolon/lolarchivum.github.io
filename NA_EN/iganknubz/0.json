Anyone can say/do anything to you and you have to take it, you can never defend yourself or respond with the same aggression given to you, and if you do you are banned but he is not because he doesn't have 0 honor. \r\n\r\nI got banned once about 2 years ago for triggering the system with kys (full chat log was :\"kys\"- \"jk, I love you\"- and I received a 2 week ban )- have been 0 honor ever since because there's always 1 in those 50 games that you do bad and everyone reports you/flames you and you go on the defensive. Or you get trolled in game / griefed and you tell the person off but you get banned and he doesn't. \r\n\r\nso imagine someone who is addicted to this game, they have to literally go through the psychological torment of being harassed without being able to say anything. It is honestly extremely frustrating and literally is psychological abuse. \r\n\r\nYour options are to completely remove chat from the game, so ban yourself before you get banned or, quit the game. \r\n\r\nMy friends keep begging me to play but I can't, I honestly can't deal with the fact that someone can tell me to go fuck my mother or kill my brother, but my report has 0 effect and I can't even defend myself. It's stupid. Now the counter argument is someone with 0 honor deserves to be psychologically tormented because they have done it to others. maybe, but if that's the case aren't we just encouraging toxic behavior?\r\n\r\nNot to mention there is no specific guideline that tells you what warrants a chat restriction, so you must live in fear of saying anything moderately offensive, Which is fine IF EVERYONE HAD TO FOLLOW THOSE SAME GUIDELINES- but they don't. Right now If i made a new account and copied the chat logs from the games I got banned on my 0 honor account I would receive no bans.  Thereby indicating that it's not the action itself that gets you banned or chat restricted, but the status of your account. \r\n\r\nthe 0 honor thing lasts way too long, and is literally a basis for psychological torment- I understand staying on your toes for you know 35- 50 games maybe, or you know a month or two... But It takes about a year to get out of honor level 0 and more than 500 games, especially if you don't play 17 times a day. So that means every time I would log onto league I have a legitimate fear of psychological abuse by the \"non-toxic\" community. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's impossible, just saying it's torment, torture and abuse. I can really imagine someone losing their sanity over this, this is the stuff school shootings are made of- no joke- you have a feeling of no power, whilst you are abused for extended periods of time. This literally constitutes a mental breakdown. I think someone could legitimately go insane if they are addicted to league they could potentially snap and this would have real world consequences. \r\n\r\nMaybe i'm overreacting, but I personally feel that league is too stressing on my psyche. Maybe it's because I have experience with being bullied and being powerless in a situation where you are mocked, harassed and abused. For me this feels the same, I am being bullied and anytime I try to stand up for myself I get banned and silenced akin to the bully physically hitting me when I try to verbally fight back. \r\n\r\nLike I said there are multiple solutions to this problem but I don't believe any of them are rational or even normal especially if you like league of legends and have invested money in it.- The options as I understand them are : make a new account, remove all/allied chat, or quit the game of league of legends. \r\n\r\nany other choice results in you being psychologically tormented without an outlet, so you must either take the abuse -and let it build up until you eventually snap and go back to 0 honor, unless you have patience of a saint. (Lord help me) \r\n\r\nThe system is designed to crush your soul, I have no will to play this game. I'm not toxic but having been bullied I know the only way to stop a bully is to stand up to them. Bullies are cowards and Riot this system is definitely encouraging bullying.\r\n\r\nJust permaban the 0 honor players, it's a less brutal process and less psychologically straining . I'm thanking god I'm not addicted to the game so i can quit whenever it gets too intense, not to mention if you started permanently banning people you would be forced to watch their games, pay more attention and take into consideration the feelings of the humans who are playing your game. A machine can't understand context, but a human can. \r\n\r\nImagine being banned, but receiving a message saying \"we understand that you had a bad game, the pyke launched you unto dragons pit and purposely griefed you, but you going afk and griefing the rest of your team was unacceptable, what did they do to deserve that?\" \"So we have given you a 1 week ban as well as given the pyke a 3 day ban for this issue- we hope you this will encourage you to be more tolerant of other situations like this and perhaps handle it in a better way- for example reporting him after the game. \" \r\n\r\nI would totally understand and would be more likely to handle the situation in a better way knowing that the report system is fair and working and that people understand my feelings knowing I'm not just a number but I'm also a customer. \r\n\r\n I also don't believe in letting yourself be bullied, always stand up for yourself- in all the games where I got chat restricted I would be getting harassed by someone throughout the whole game, or I would be getting griefed and would tell them exactly what I thought. When I would respond in a verbally aggressive manner the abuse would stop, this is two humans arguing as opposed to one man brutally beating down another. So why would it make sense that only one person gets banned, that's like someone starting a fight with you and you getting thrown in jail because you were stronger and won the fight. That is not equality and it does not promote a non-toxic environment. It's an imbalance in power that protects the bullies and people who abuse the system. \r\n\r\nThis my 2 cents, having really tried for the past year to avoid toxicity and bring my honor back from 0. Utilizing the /ignore all command as much as possible and trying to tolerate my mother being insulted in every way imaginable. I have to admit defeat, I honestly cannot handle the psychological strain I am too weak to play this game. I cannot relive my experience of being bullied through a video game after I worked so hard to escape that reality. \r\n\r\nI propose  Riot should make a 10 commandments type of thing that completely lists all offenses one can make that would warrant a chat ban or otherwise. ( BE SPECIFIC) This way everyone is equal under the Riot law, and the report system won't feel so one sided as One can refer to the charter and make a ticket so that justice is served. This would remove some of the powerlessness one feels as a 0 honor plebeian. \r\n\r\nAlso one last thing, tilting your opponents by saying stupid but not obscene things shouldn't warrant a ban, making your opponents lose concentration is a valid tactic called \"mind games\". it is used in official sports like basketball, football, hell even Boxing. SO i say if Muhammad Ali can do it, we should be able to do it too.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:   I think the 0 honor system lasts too long, encourages bullying and forces people to go through unnecessary psychological strain/torment. Also think riot should make a 10 commandments type of thing that completely and specifically lists all offenses one can make that would warrant a chat ban or otherwise.\r\n\r\nMuch love from the man who clearly can't control his blood-lust.\r\n\r\n~IGanknubz","replies":[{"poster":"Jhins Girlfriend","date":"2019-10-19T16:33:38.999+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm not saying it's impossible, just saying it's torment, torture and abuse.

You have the mute feature. You simply elect not to use it in favor of...\n\n> ...or respond with the same aggression given to you...\n\nCounterflaming. You're choosing to counterflame, not defend yourself. When you respond to flamers in kind, _you are not defending yourself. You are flaming back, and consequently, no better than the flamer._\n\n> ...and if you do you are banned but he is not because he doesn't have 0 honor.\n\nThis statement looks like it's assuming that the punishment tiers are tied to your Honor Level; they aren't. Someone could be Honor Level 1 and be just as likely to be banned as someone at Honor Level 0; the Honor Levels are not in and of themselves indicative of people's punishment status.\n\nHell, you could be Honor Level 0 and only be on the verge of a 14-day ban. Your Honor Level drops when you get punished, while your punishment status is unaffected by your Honor Level.\n\nSo at the end of the day, you don't know whether or not someone would be banned if punished, and Honor is by no means an indicator to that effect.\n\n> I got banned once about 2 years ago for triggering the system with kys (full chat log was :\"kys\"- \"jk, I love you\"- and I received a 2 week ban )\n\nAnd that was a just punishment; you don't get exemption from the rules just because you say \"JK\". Breaking the rules as a joke is still breaking the rules.\n\n> - have been 0 honor ever since because there's always 1 in those 50 games that you do bad and everyone reports you/flames you and you go on the defensive.\n\nWe've already seen that you're not really going on the defensive. To quote you; you're \"responding with the same aggression given to you\". That's not going on the defensive, that's going on the offensive. _Flaming_.\n\nAnd as it were, you're not going to regain Honor _at all_ if you continually resort to flaming people. It doesn't matter if they flamed first, or if they flamed you harder, _flaming is against the rules, and it's not honorable conduct._\n\n> Or you get trolled in game / griefed and you tell the person off but you get banned and he doesn't.\n\nThey may get punished even without the system telling you; the Instant Feedback Report tries to make sure that the match in question is in recent memory before being sent out, since it could cause confusion if you were told that someone you reported was punished, and the only person you reported recently was a week or so ago.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you know someone is punished, them breaking the rules, again, does not give you a free pass to break the rules yourself.\n\n> so imagine someone who is addicted to this game, they have to literally go through the psychological torment of being harassed without being able to say anything. It is honestly extremely frustrating and literally is psychological abuse.\n\nFirst of all, that is one hell of a mess of hyperbolic statements.\n\nSecond; _**you literally have the mute feature, which can literally block out any further psychological abuse from people flaming you, and you are literally ignoring its existence in favor of the short-lived vindication of counterflaming.**_\n\nDon't act like you don't have the tools to mitigate harm, and _definitely_ don't act like the only way you can stay sane is to flame and rant and rave and shout down anyone and everyone who says \"boo\".\n\nAnd if League of Legends is proving so psychologically torturous, if you're _truly_ addicted to the game; _seek help. Put a stop to your pain and get help to quit._\n\n> ...but my report has 0 effect and I can't even defend myself(sic).\n\nIf someone's flaming you, your report has effect. The issue is that you have no idea how far along towards a punishment they are, so that could be their first instance of flaming and you wouldn't know. Do not confuse your lack of information for the system not working.\n\nAnd, I'll repeat it ad nauseum; _**you're not defending yourself. You're flaming back. Defending yourself is using the mute feature.**_\n\n> Now the counter argument is someone with 0 honor deserves to be psychologically tormented because they have done it to others. maybe, but if that's the case aren't we just encouraging toxic behavior?\n\nExactly _nobody_ is saying that Honor Level 0 players deserve to be treated like shit. You're posing it as an argument of your own to combat without anyone even suggesting it; effectively, you're pulling a strawman argument.\n\n> Not to mention there is no specific guideline that tells you what warrants a chat restriction...\n\nNo specific guideline? None at all? No [Code of Conduct](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse#code-conduct) which you agree to with every patch, no [Summoner's Code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code) that you're encouraged to read and follow when you create your account?\n\nYou not caring to look for behavioral guidelines does not mean there are no guidelines.\n\n> ...Which is fine IF EVERYONE HAD TO FOLLOW THOSE SAME GUIDELINES- but they don't.\n\nThey do. Again; the system works, and people are held to the same rules, you simply don't understand how the system works. Even the regulars here on PB only have a basic grasp of the system; only Riot knows exactly how it works, and we understand largely from what tidbits about the system they share with us.\n\nPerhaps, rather than making sweeping assumptions about how the system works, take a moment to consider how much you actually understand of it and ask others how the system works? You might be surprised about what information you're missing.\n\n> Right now If i made a new account and copied the chat logs from the games I got banned on my 0 honor account I would receive no bans.\n\nIf you're referring to the \"kys\" thing you mentioned earlier, I guarantee you you'd get banned again even on a fresh account. Zero tolerance offenses like that will _always_ result in a 14-day ban on the first verified offense, no matter the status of the account.\n\n> Thereby indicating that it's not the action itself that gets you banned or chat restricted, but the status of your account.\n\nTechnically, the account status does matter, but not in the way you think. You're thinking that it's tied to Honor Level, but it's not. And, believe it or not; _the action itself matters too_. Negativity, flaming, and zero-tolerance offenses all have varying degrees of severity, and how severe the offense is does in fact have an impact on what type of punishment you receive.\n\nFlaming can get you punished quicker, zero-tolerance offenses will always result in a ban, and negativity is treated more leniently by the system than flaming; albeit, it's still ultimately punished all the same.\n\nAs for the status of your account; that does, to a degree, play a part in whether or not you get punished. The severity of your offenses leading up to a punishment create a behavioral history, and that behavioral history is what your actions get weighed against before the IFS decides whether or not to punish you. The actual punishment tiers are something vaguely akin to negative milestones for your behavioral history, and continuously getting punished and reaching higher punishment tiers make the system ever-less lenient when considering whether or not it should punish you based off of your most recent offense.\n\n> ...so you must either take the abuse -and let it build up until you eventually snap and go back to 0 honor, unless you have patience of a saint. (Lord help me)\n\n**_You have the mute feature. You do not have to sit and take abuse, you can effectively silence abusive communications with the press of a button. If you are not using the mute feature, you are not taking the steps you should to prevent harm._**\n\n> Just permaban the 0 honor players...\n\nThis lends credence to your supposition that you might be overreacting. You're basically saying \"I've been stuck at Honor Level 0 because I would rather flame back than mute players, and because it's agonizing I think Riot should simply permaban people who are Honor Level 0 without any real reason.\"\n\nBetween all the hyperbolic fluff about League being psychologically abusive and torturous and addicting, I'm going to be blunt; yes. You're overreacting.\n\n> ...not to mention if you started permanently banning people you would be forced to watch their games, pay more attention and take into consideration the feelings of the humans who are playing your game. A machine can't understand context, but a human can.\n\nIf you're proposing that Riot make a broad sweep and simply permaban all players at HL0, then they wouldn't be watching those players' games; they'd just look at any account below Honor Level 1 and permanently suspend it.\n\nBeyond that, even if Riot _did_ have to watch through people's matches, it doesn't matter what kind of stuff you've had to deal with - Riot and the community both believe that you alone are responsible for your own actions, and that other people misbehaving doesn't give you the freedom to misbehave yourself.\n\nEven if it gives Riot understanding of the situation, it still wouldn't change the fact that those players broke the rules and deserved punishment.\n\n> Imagine being banned, but receiving a message saying \"we understand that you had a bad game, the pyke launched you unto dragons pit and purposely griefed you, but you going afk and griefing the rest of your team was unacceptable, what did they do to deserve that?\" \"So we have given you a 1 week ban as well as given the pyke a 3 day ban for this issue- we hope you this will encourage you to be more tolerant of other situations like this and perhaps handle it in a better way- for example reporting him after the game. \"\n\nRiot can't custom-tailor punishment messages to cover any and every situation that pisses players off. And even if they could, who's to say that doing so would be remotely effective? This entire time, you've been pointedly ignoring the existence of the mute feature for the _whole post_, and insisting that the only way you can reach catharsis under stress is to just flame people back when they start flaming you.\n\nI'll have to continue this in another comment;","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-10-19T17:49:20.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Continuing from the first comment in the string due to lack of space;\n\nGranted, you are one example out of millions upon millions of players, but the odds of habitual flamers being able to consider other options _beyond_ flaming are, unfortunately, low. And no amount of custom-tailoring the punishment messages to sympathize with flamers' situations would really change their proclivity to resort to flaming when they have other options available.\n\nOn top of that, you're also asking for explicit punishment information of other players, which Riot is not allowed to give. They can't tell you that \"x player has been punished\" or where their account stands. It's not your account, and consequently, its standing in the system is not your concern.\n\n> I also don't believe in letting yourself be bullied...\n\nLike reiterating that you are misconstruing counterflaming for defending oneself, I will also do my best to hammer home the fact that _**Riot gives you the tools already to stop yourself from being bullied. You have the mute and report features; mute a player in-game so their flame won't continue to affect you for the whole match, and then report them post-game so that they can be punished for it.**_\n\nIf you don't believe in letting yourself be bullied, then you should readily and easily use the mute feature.\n\n> ...always stand up for yourself...\n\nIn real life, there are situations where a case can be made for standing up for yourself. In League of Legends, though, all you're doing is exacerbating the issue by flaming them back. There's zero value for standing up to people you don't know and who you'll likely never meet again, and all you're accomplishing is taking a bad situation and making it ten times worse for _everyone_ involved.\n\nSo, in League, the best recourse for dealing with flamers and bullies is _**Mute, Report, &amp; Move On.**_ Mute them so that you don't have to deal with their continued harassment throughout the match, Report them post-game so that they can be punished for their misbehavior, and then move on, knowing that in general, the odds of you seeing that person again are close to none.\n\n> When I would respond in a verbally aggressive manner the abuse would stop...\n\nAs stated above, more often than not, flaming back a flamer will just exacerbate the issue and create a flame war. The abuse wouldn't stop, it'd just intensify. It helps nothing to escalate the issue by flaming back.\n\n> So why would it make sense that only one person gets banned, that's like someone starting a fight with you and you getting thrown in jail because you were stronger and won the fight. That is not equality and it does not promote a non-toxic environment. It's an imbalance in power that protects the bullies and people who abuse the system.\n\nAgain; you do not understand the system and assume that misbehavior will automatically resolve to a punishment when reported. It's not an imbalance of power, and it's not that you \"were stronger\" or \"won the fight\". (Besides the obvious fact of **there's no winning a flamewar.**)\n\nYou don't know how close or how far the other party was from a punishment. You getting punished does not automatically mean that everyone else involved will be punished; they have their own punishment history that their behavior is weighed against.\n\nBullies are not protected, and the system is barely abuseable - if you don't break the rules, you won't get punished.\n\n> I propose Riot should make a 10 commandments type of thing that completely lists all offenses one can make that would warrant a chat ban or otherwise.\n\nLike the Code of Conduct I linked in my initial response? The section of the ToU that lists, pretty comprehensively, the majority of behavior that isn't allowed?\n\nAgain, the resources already exist. It doesn't take much effort to look for them.

You are under the impression that the system is  a single sum system, where a single use of toxicity should get someone punished. \n\nThe system actually works based on an accumulation and repeatitve system. It punishes people based in consistency x severity. Meaning one can  be punished for 1 game of extreme toxicity and/or many games of mild toxicity.  \n\nAnother way to look at it, think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well.

Here's them broken down into their most basic, simplest explanations;\n\n> I - Don't impersonate people, businesses, etc., especially not Riot employees.\n>\n> II - Don't share identifying information of yourself or other players.\n>\n> III - Don't use Riot services to stalk, harass, or threaten people.\n>\n> IV - Don't try to tamper with Riot's copyrighted stuff or infringe on other people's rights pertaining to patents, copyrights, etc.\n>\n> V - Don't flame, harass, use vulgar, sexual language, don't use hate speech, etc.\n>\n> VI - Don't spread viruses or other such malware.\n>\n> VII - Don't spam the chat.\n>\n> VIII - Don't scam other players.\n>\n> IX - Don't hack, script, or bot; don't use 3rd-party software in general.\n> \n> X - Don't try to access stuff that Riot hasn't made public yet.\n>\n> XI - Don't break any of the aforementioned applicable rules through your Summoner Name, and don't try to circumvent the rules by using mispellings or character replacements.\n>\n> XII - Don't log out or leave matches in progress.\n>\n> XIII - Don't play on other people's accounts, especially with the intent to illegitimately raise their Rank or standing.\n>\n> XIV - Don't encourage other players to break the rules.\n\nIf the rules were vague, I would not be able to condense them into singular, simple sentences. Following the rules is easy, and if you don't break the rules, _you won't get punished._ Hence, why the system is barely abuseable.\n\n> What defines harmful?\n> \n> What is abusive?\n> \n> What is harassing?\n> \n> IS it harmful to tell someone they are trash and should uninstall?\n> \n> Is it abusive is someone tells you you are shit and you should never play the champion again?\n> \n> Is it harassing to constantly spam ping and constantly say\" our X is trash\",\" omg report X continuously\"?\n\nYour questions here are disingenuous and you already know the answers to them.\n\n> these are not rare behaviors, they are present in every almost game-\n\nAnd people who frequently exhibit such behaviors get punished. There are a good number of examples of people having been punished for those behaviors on this board, you need only browse for a little while and you'll see those same such behaviors in people's chat logs.\n\n> so what riot means when they say its to their \"Exclusive discretion\" what they really are doing is covering their ass when faults within their system are found.\n\nNo, it means that should a certain behavior prove to become problematic (for example, consistently using \"x diff\" to passive-aggressively harass players when they lose), Riot can decide that that behavior can warrant punishment.\n\n> ...it is not followed and applicable to EVERYONE and thus it is not functional.\n\nIt is applicable to everyone. The issue is that not everyone follows it. And that's why the punishment system exists; to punish players who decide not to follow the code of conduct they agreed to.\n\nIt is functional; your insistence otherwise does not change that fact.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IGaNkNuBz","date":"2019-10-19T17:48:25.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"You just said you are no better than the flamer, but then persist to agree that the punishment should be 1 sided. \n\nYou continuously contradict yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-10-19T17:53:01.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ...but then persist to agree that the punishment should be 1 sided.\n\nCare to explain?\n\n'Cause I don't recall positing my own opinions on whether or not the punishment should be one-sided.\n\nI explained that the system handles each player individually and separately, that it won't arbitrarily punish one player for their first offense just because another player was just sacked for their 5th~ offense, but I don't recall ever saying \"the punishment system should be one-sided\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2019-10-19T16:39:22.355+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> there's always 1 in those 50 games that you do bad and everyone reports you/flames you and you go on the defensive.

LMFAO!!! that is a very bias example, his honor wasn't at 0 naturally or from a 2 week suspension and we have no idea what kind of effect that has on the length of time taken to rise up. \n\nIf you’re going to question my methods, I’d start with any other reasonable route to get to honor 0. Either you ask a 5 man premade to report you, or you’re negatively impacting stranger’s game, neither of which I was willing to do. Ethically, my request was the most reasonable route. \n\n> Think for a second, THE ONLY CASE THAT TOOK UNDER 400 games WAS THE ONE WHERE A MOD ASKED RIOT TO LOCK HIS HONOR.I'm done this is utter stupidity, Lmfao!!\n\nI did it to show Folks the *minimal* effort you’d have to put into the game and how fast (or slow) that rise can be. \n\n\nPlease refrain from personal attacks on the forums.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-10-20T02:19:16.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one is allowed to flame back, regardless of Honor level. The advice on encountering a toxic player is the same for everyone: mute the offending player if it's a chat offense, try to focus on the game, don't join in on breaking the rules, and report them after the game. If you feel \"tortured\" by having to behave yourself rather than flaming more than the Human Torch, I do agree that you should find something else to do with your time.\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments.

The real problem here is that you let what other people say affect you so much. Why does it matter? You keep using the word \"defend\", but do you really need to defend anything? Their words only mean something if you let them. You have all the power you need, and it has nothing to do with the nasty things you say back to other people. You can't control other people. You can only control yourself.
