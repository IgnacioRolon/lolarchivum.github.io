If they ever introduced a system that you need mastery 5 to participate in ranked, you would need at least 16 champions with mastery 5.  This will always be true because champions aren't restricted to rolls.  If you only play support and top lane you are immune to autofill.  This doesn't mean that you only need a few of each position though because you can take a support or a top laner at any position.","replies":[{"poster":"Volphi","date":"2017-05-07T13:31:25.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The only f.e.

I almost never see it go right, and I've only ever had to do it once to counter a particular champion.
