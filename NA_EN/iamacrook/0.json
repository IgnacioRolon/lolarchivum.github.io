I live in Northern Arizona and I have suddenlink communications as my ISP. For the past month or so I have been in games where I will have 70-80 ms. Randomly in the middle of the game the ping will spike and hold to 250 for a random amount of time, sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes several games where it is basically unplayable. My speed tests will read 100+ Mbps and my ISP claims they have no control over the issue. At this point I am wondering if it is something on riots end, my isp, or somewhere in the middle, like a backbone or something. I don't understand networks and stuff to a high degree but I have a friend who lives in the same town as me with the same ISP and he is experiencing the exact same issue. \r\n\r\nPLEASE we need help. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nleague is unplayable :(","replies":[{"poster":"Yung FeedIord","date":"2016-08-25T01:29:32.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same isp and the same problem. it always sits around 250ping and my ping is usually 69-80 ms.

I'd be more inclined to believe it was your ISP if this high ping was consistent, but in this case it seems to be random.  No worries, run a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an analysis of these matches to find out what's going wrong.  You'll also get a list of troubleshoot steps to help fix this up.  That should get you squared away!","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T06:23:43.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BTW suddenlink had a similar incident with routing to riot servers through the Dallas pop around 8 months ago. I found it on the boards. If you do a quick search you will see a riot employee talking about it. I dont understand why nothing is being done in our region though. Its the same issue, different area and its been ignored for months.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T18:07:53.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our tech team can help you out with this.  Grab our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to aquire some logs for more context.  We may want to get a routing overview of how your ISP is reaching our game server, so I suggest downloading [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and selecting 104.160.131.1 as the host.  This context can help go a long way, so attach them to your ticket.

I am on a mac so we used HTK v12. If you read my other posts I state specifically which hop it seems to start at. Riot support said it is an issue with my ISP but when I call my ISP they literally don't even know what logs or Tracers are. They are incompetent. This is why I am asking riot to try to reach out to higher ups to get this resolved because everyone I have talked to at suddenlink literally doesnt have the power/knowledge to do anything about it. The only thing that suddenlink support will do is tell us to restart our router/modem which isnt the problem. It is a routing problem.

There was packet loss on the routing from my location to riot servers. Suddenlink does not believe me and constantly blames either riot servers, my apartments wiring or some other BS excuse even though I know others are having this problem. Is there no way for riot to reach out to them? Because they do not listen to the little guys.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yung FeedIord","date":"2016-08-25T01:32:11.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw it only happens on league. every other game has normal ping. sometime's it will sit high all game , or half the game.","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T06:16:51.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you man, exact same problem.
