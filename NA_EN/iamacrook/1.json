Many other suddenlink players have described the same issue in my region on the boards. Has been going on for over a month and a half easily and NOTHING has been done.\nI have spoken to support and they were very helpful. I did ALL the troubleshooting that they asked me to do. NOTHING HELPED. Tracerts and logs showed packet loss particularly at the 5th hop on the way to riot servers. Suddenlink is UNWILLING to listen to myself and many other paying customers. Lag ONLY happens on league. Will Riot stand up for it's players and contact suddenlink and get them to resolve this issue? (BTW I can't switch ISPs cause nothing else is offered above 1.5MBPS in my area. I am currently paying for 100mbps\n\nSincerely,\n\nUNABLE to play League due to crappy ISP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T22:03:30.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ISP's and backbone providers are typically not very keen on working with us, due to us not being directly their customer. I took a look at your ticket and it seems we haven't had you run a set of traceroutes yet, so I suggest getting a set so you'll have more information to provide to your ISP. I would like you to use a program called Ping Plotter, which you can get [here](https://www.pingplotter.com/download/mac/).\n\nIn the Target field, enter the following addresses one at a time.\n\n>104.160.131.1 \n192.64.170.252\n\nBe sure you've set your test parameters to 1-second intervals with a 5-minute focus time. You'll then want to press the Play button on the left side to start the traceroute.\n\nAfter the trace has completed, [take a screenshot](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) of the results in their entirety. Run a test for both IP addresses, then upload the screenshots to an image hosting site such as Imgur, then post the links to them in a reply to this post.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-14T00:20:38.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/DZJBJxE\nhttp://imgur.com/Hj1AlJE\n\nThis is during a time when I wasn't necessarily lagging.

What can you tell me about these?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-14T15:35:43.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This traceroute shows that over 99 sent packets, your connection experiences massive packet loss over the three nodes in hops 5-7. This packet loss reaches a peak of 97.5% and your latency hits a peak of 46.4ms across these three hops along Level3's network. Level 3 is a backbone network provider that your ISP partners with in order to route your connection to our servers. \n\nSince your ISP partners with them, your ISP network technicians will need to be the ones to inquire about this issue on Level3's network. I strongly recommend reaching back out to your ISP with this screenshot so they have full context as to what's going on and where it's happening. Just as a heads-up, this may take your ISP support a bit more time to resolve, as they'll need to coordinate with Level3 on a solution.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-14T18:09:46.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your detailed reply, unfortunately at suddenlink they have no direct access to IT and their technical support people have NO idea what I am talking about and literally don't even know what a backbone is. I now have a technician coming out to my house later today and I am going to show him the tests so that hopefully he can take it back to his supervisor and they can begin fixing it.\n\n I will keep you updated on the situation, but as of right now they have been very resistant in fixing their network. Because of this I have filed an informal complaint with the FCC in hopes that it forces  them to fix their network issues. I appreciate your help very much. Riot has been amazing in this process, however I do not know if my ISP is willing to do anything about this. They are probably the most incompetent company ever. \n\nThanks again, talk soon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T23:02:13.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your reply.
