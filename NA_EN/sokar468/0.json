Myself and ManWolfAxeBoss were the primary Devs on the recent update so I'm happy to discuss the changes. We also worked on the last set of changes about a year ago as well so I can provide some context on those as well if folks are curious. \n\nI'll jump more into some specific subthreads but I'll answer a few of the reoccurring questions first. \n\nDid ARAM players even ask for shorter games?\n- Frankly, yes. The feedback was pretty consistent and overwhelming that the vast majority of ARAM players not only want shorter ARAM games but frequently queue for ARAM when want a shorter game length than other game modes. The average game time for ARAM was reaching just above 25 minutes, with many more games than we'd like going over the 35 and even the 40 minute mark. In short, many ARAM games were longer than many SR games which we felt was not appropriate and didn't match player expectations jumping into the queue. \n\nWere these  changes on PBE? \n- These changes were indeed on PBE before shipping, I know many of you don't have PBE access and the changes were easy to lose in the Xayah / Rakan reveals but they were there. \n\nWill there be a followup patch?\n- We'll be looking at doing another small followup patch, but not until 7.10. Not only are ARAM games incredibly volatile and hard to read data-wise 7.9 is the midseason patch which will once again shake things up. \n\nWhat are the initial results on Game Time?\n- Average Game Time has dropped on ARAM since the patch ~2 minutes but not uniformly, the bell curve did change shape. There are noticeably less games running really long and more in the low to mid 20 minutes territory. Essentially some of the tail of the graph got pushed into the middle \n\nWhat about early snowballing?\n- While there are incredibly snowbally and stompy ARAM games this doesn't appear to have shifted noticeably since the changes. There were snowbally stompy games before and after the patch. This doesn't appear to have changed significantly. \n\nX/Y Champion got way too strong / weak with the changes, what gives?\n- Early data here is pretty unreliable but after going over the initial data there don't seem to be consistent reliable correlations in the changes this patch. There was indeed a lot of movement, but there tends to be a ton of noise unsurprisingly in this data. When looking at trends there are some correlations but they tend to be weak at best and a bit forced. Some champions with strong wave clear went up, some went down. Some targon users went up, others down. Some traditionally OP ARAM champions went up while others went down. \n\nWill you take suggestions / improvement ideas for the follow up?\n- Absolutely, but both myself and ManWolf work entirely within the gameplay space so we won't be looking at anything involving how the queue works, matchmaking, or free champions etc. So any changes would be In game only, sorry. I'll post a small list of our current thoughts as we formulate our plans for 7.10 and suggestions come in.\n\nThis post is already super long so I'll stop there and discuss stuff more in individual threads.

I've been on these forums for a long time, and been playing ARAM even longer. Why do I never hear of these people? Just because you saw a few people demanding shorter games **does not mean that's the popular opinion**. Why not use this thread as evidence that we DO NOT want shorter games? It seems pretty unanimous. A minority made a demand that you ate up, and now the majority has to come out against it.\n\nPlayers **want** to have time to enjoy the fruits of their labor when they build a lead. They don't want the game to simply end. Players also **want** a chance at a comeback when they fall behind. We don't queue up because we want the game to end ASAP. That defeats the purpose.

It's great to have a Rioter address this topic specifically because facing outlier champions (i.e. oppresive, although I know that's a strong word) over and over again *feels horrible* and causes people to find outlets for blame.\n\nI know it's hard to address this problem for a couple reasons. First, I imagine unlocking all champs to all players for ARAM can affect the business model for Riot. Second, making tweaks to individual champions for a game mode with no Pro scene is tedious. Yet, knowing that ARAM smurfs are relatively uncommon is great because it really unlocks the discussion instead of bogging it down with \"I'm pissed because I keep facing (insert champion here).\"\n\nOn the topic, is there hard data that allows us to identify such outlier champs? And if so, would that data suggest realistic changes to them?\n\nMany other players and I are continuing to play ARAM to further sculpt our opinions on the recent changes.

Yes, veteran ARAM players want more even distribution of champs, and that could turn away casuals who don't want to see a lot of them. I'm getting a better idea of the ratio of casual to dedicated ARAM players thanks to your earlier post, so I can see the challenges.\n\nAs for the problem outlier champs, it might vary from player to player, but champs that create a dreadful feeling of \"auto-lose if I face them\" are the culprits. Champs that offer both poke and zone control are considered auto-win excluding situations, for example, where they lack a front line vs. heavy dive (and even that might not work). Ziggs and Lux are the two that immediately come to mind, and they have both been buffed for SR a few times. Zyra is up there as well, although nerfs to her plant AI helped a lot. Jhin, Xerath, and Varus are also quite guilty, although not *quite* at Ziggs/Lux levels.\n\nOther champions that can be oppressive are supports because they play with equal gold income, which really powers up their kits. Sona, though vulnerable to CC and burst, provides perma-shields, heals, single target burst, and an AoE ultimate. In SR, it's manageable, but when she has access to Lich Bane and Rabadon's, it's outright insane. Janna on normal income can shield and peel for days, and Alistar on normal income is nearly unkillable.\n\nI may be missing someone, but beyond those, you will start digging into the personal hit-lists of individual players. For example, I think the number of traps Caitlyn has access to in ARAM is excessive, but whether she is Ziggs/Lux tier is highly debatable.\n\nEDIT: As for low win-rate champs, I'm not worried about them because I think frustration surrounding them is tied to the oppressive playstyles of the above-mentioned champs. Some may disagree, though.","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2017-04-25T04:41:21.028+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure!

But I'm really happy you are open to discussion on things.\n\nThe thoughts I'll share with you aren't well-thought out, just rambling from an avid ARAM fan. :D\n\nCould the mana regen from the passive aura be applied based on class? I'm not sure what kind of flags the League system uses, but, for example, having slightly lower flat mana regen for Mage class champions vs. slightly higher/normal for Fighters champs who need to be more trial-and-error in applying pressure in ARAM.\n\nI think Health Relics are OK.\n\nFor Snowball, it's definitely necessary to keep some champs relevant, but it can be too much on some champs. For example, snowball gives Alistar even more engage potential whereas the benefit for a champ like Tryn is more normalized. One idea would be flagging champions as \"gap closer\" and \"no gap closer\", and then adjusting the missile speed accordingly. Gap closer champs would have slower snowballs, thus requiring more careful use of them.\n\nSome players dislike the vision that Snowball gives. I think this would be less of an issue if the brush in ARAM and Oracles were reworked. Other people suggested removing the damage, and this could be helpful for champs without gap closers. Nothing's worse than snowballing to get into a fight, killing a target (even worse if it's a minion), and then being stuck behind.\n\nGuardian items were a great addition. Resale value is poor, but that's in accordance with the Doran's philosophy, so I can't comment there. I think many players opt out of the Guardian items except for the Horn due to it's necessity vs. poke. With the removal of support items, the actives from Frost Queen, Face of the Mountain, and Talisman are all gone. I would favor reworking ARAM starting items into options that can lead to those active effects (or active effects more suitable for ARAM). They offer depth and options to ARAM that will be missed by many. Of course, there is the risk of too many players with too many overlapping actives.\n\nAs for the main concern of the super minions. Could you imagine a way to make the power of super minions scale better? Starting off with 300 AD and 100 armor from the get-go seems very excessive. I remember when Riot had some more complex scaling for minions in SR based on missing towers. I wonder if you could do the same based on enemy champion kills + team assists, for example. In other words, getting unlucky and losing an inhib early gives you a chance, but if you are losing subsequent team fights, the enemy supers will scale up to reflect your losing position over time (rather than supers dooming you from the start). Kills PLUS total team assists would mitigate the punishment of a couple poke champions picking off enemies without retribution. ARAM is best when teams fight in a brawl, and the super minion scaling could reward that.\n\nI hope that isn't too much rambling, but thank you so much for discussing!\n\n**EDIT:** Do you think the issue of supports having normal income and having their kits being more powerful than intended is something worth discussing?","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2017-04-25T06:42:42.668+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly against changes that are unique to a specific type of character, especially ones that can't be easily ascertained by the opponent. Ex- What defines a tank, despite being somewhat flexible often being based on current tuning, or meta, is pretty subjective and I'd hate to add directly balance implications to our general class names especially since those aren't visible or clearly known to players. I'd consider something melee vs ranged but even that makes me a tad uncomfortable but if it had the right benefits I'd consider it. \n\nAs for Dash/Non-Dash being weaker on \"dash\" champions I have similar thoughts as above, but also I think this actively goes against your balance target. While it would nerf Alistar, the correlation between dash champions and doing well in ARAM is inverted. Champions like Aatrox, Master Yi, Xin Zhao, Braum, Bard, Thresh, Leblanc, Camille, Tryndamere would all get hit by this change and they all are not doing particularly well in the map, and there are many others. \n\nAs for Super Minions, one change we're very likely to do is to increase the respawn of inhibitors to match the increased wave spawn speed. Previously you got 10 super minions per inhib, but now you get usually 12. We'd be looking to reduce this respawn speed to match the previous wave count so they'd respawn nearly a minute faster (250 seconds from 300).\n\nI'm also open to other game ending alternatives, but right now the minions have been pretty successful in actually letting games close out and reducing the number of 35-40 minute games or more which has been a pretty big improvement to the map in our minds. It's tough without additional objectives that help wrap up the game like Baron and Elder, but I'm open to ideas here that are reasonably scoped (ex- I don't have a pile of free artists hanging around).","replies":[{"poster":"Semaj3xt4h","date":"2017-04-25T06:54:46.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think if you disabled/twealed the tower passive on the last 2 towers ( the one where minions have to be in range of it otherwise it has buffed armor ) you would see quicker games, thats been a pretty big problem in the past I've noticed for teams, they get aced mid way but have to wait for minions to get to the towers and most of the time someone respawns before it happens... If you tweaked that passive, maybe cut it in half on the last 2 towers and then bring back in line the super minions damage/armor you would find a better balance then what it is currently... Just my 2 cents, I've seen it happen sooo many times, although its a pretty thin line because i've been on the other end of that and somehow pulled a rabbit out of our hat for a victory.\n\nUltimately, the super minions were just too over powered it seemed the last few times and it literally was very frustrating to play with a 4 melee team knowing very well we wouldn't see a decent late game because they couldn't finish their builds.... Its more punishing now I think because its sink or swim...","replies":[{"poster":"FeralPony","date":"2017-04-25T07:28:25.717+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really interesting idea targeting the backdoor bonus.

I actually just played a game with you - I'm an avid ARAM-only player myself.  I was the Gnar when you went AD Lulu (as our team lacked any real AD - thank you for doing this by the way!).  And thank you for posting this, hopefully it's able to grab some attention and be able to make a more enjoyable experience for everyone!\n\nI'm not sure what exactly the ARAM changes were meant for honestly.  The new AD and Armor on Super Minions combined with the bonus Movement Speed they grant all enemy champions tends to make it a far more snowbally (heh) experience.  The removal of Relic Shield, Ancient Coin, and Spellthief's Edge I feel helped push this along even further, where champions like Nasus who could abuse Relic Shield and attempt to go a stacking build to be relevant faster is now pushed harder into the AP or full tank role, making it far less diverse.\n\nI feel that before these changes there was a much more healthy balance of \"pick-up roles\" and less of the \"You got Ziggs?  Sweet you auto-win once you grab the inhibitor.\"  It's definitely frustrating trying to keep team morale up and even harder with Super Minions rushing into the base at such a rapid rate.  It's almost as if we absolutely have to have a Sivir, Syndra (throwing them into the Nexus), or someone similar just to keep the minions from automatically winning the game at that point.  While I don't mind the minions spawning sooner as well as Health Relics and free minion gold (ayy I can play Janna and get free gold!), I don't exactly enjoy that any champion that relies on SOME form of items feels absolutely useless now, as there will likely never be a time where late game is even remotely reached.\n\nHaving a killer teamfighting comp for late game seems far less appealing now.  Playing Orianna, Kog'Maw, Vladimir, etc. seems rough if the enemy team has any remote form of poke, as they will just kill us under tower at that point.  I've been fortunate enough to play Xayah 2-3 times so far, and nearly every time I have faced the likes of Ziggs, Syndra, Sona, or other \"I guaranteed win against you\" sort of champions.  It sort of ruins the fun, as even the best orbwalking and positioning is quickly displaced by the classic \"I'm walking up and throwing all my abilities, good luck\" tactic.\n\nI definitely feel there are \"ARAM smurfs\" as well, as the number of games where I run into Ziggs, Lux, Varus, Zyra, Ezreal, Sona, etc. seems a bit atrocious.  I personally don't even own them on this account as I find them very un-fun in ARAM and I find it tends to ruin the experience for both parties.  Sure I can sit back and press E on Lux until great victory or roll my face along the keyboard as Sona, but it's not very rewarding and feels that RNGesus blessed us with a free win rather than actually having a fun team fighting map.  I don't have any numbers for the ultra-poke heavy ARAM smurf accounts either, however it's a bit awkward seeing them nearly every game and without having a similar setup on your team it almost forces you to surrender the first turret - inevitably forcing all the Health Relics to be surrendered as well as giving the enemy team a significant amount of breathing room to advance forward.  The amount of dodges compounds this problem as well - especially the 0-1 second dodgers.\n\nI'd love to actually have some responses from other ARAM players (and hopefully Riot) and perhaps work together to develop a healthier system, as currently it doesn't feel very rewarding to play.  I'm almost always expecting the RNG giving one team a clear advantage, however having 1 completed item against a team with 4 isn't even fun at that point.  The Super Minions are quite ridiculous, and if far behind will easily solo a melee non-tank (or an ADC that steps too close).  It feels as if Syndra is the best champion to deal with them now being able to throw them into the Nexus, which just feels wrong as it's sacrificing much-needed Gold at that point in the game and further making that feeling of a guaranteed loss only more reassuring.  I thoroughly enjoy games where it's a slug-fest and both teams feel they accomplish something; I'd much prefer to have 10 Braums whacking at each other in the middle of the map than the current state.  It doesn't feel very healthy for either team, as Tanks never get to the point of being relevant (unless supplemented by free assists from other poke champions) and any non-Tank without a safe form of poke is rendered nearly useless - aside from the exceptions of Master Yi and similar champions that can 1v5 in the right situation.\n\nAgain, thanks for posting this and hopefully it draws the attention of a few eyes that can work towards making a positive experience for everyone.
