I was able to fix that, but now my game keeps giving me a new issue. Every single time I ping, my screen distorts and goes green. It also happens when I spectate a game. Is there anyway to fix this? I have uninstalled and reinstalled my video drivers several times. I have also run the client repair and reinstalled League as well. Any help with this would be great. I had to take these images on my phone of what happens. It only seems to be with this game.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/yj9OFrg\n\nhttp://imgur.com/6uRSyY3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-28T16:26:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have a graphics driver not working properly, or a failing hard drive.  I rather remain hopeful that this is a driver issue, and recommend using our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to rule out that possibility.  Hopefully, updating to correct drivers and the steps there can get this fixed up.  Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
