So you can't lose it or anything.\n\nAlso, if Riot is \"bringing down the hammer for anything\", that's not \"soft\", as \"tough\" or even \"ruthless\" are clearly more valid  as description (assuming the accusation is true, that is); you don't call a government going on an arrest rampage \"soft\" now would you?","replies":[{"poster":"UntimedDemise","date":"2018-05-03T20:38:00.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are going soft by what they are allowing to be said to teammates, etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2018-05-03T10:37:14.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't have the chatlog.\n\nThen you don't have a case.

I say the meanest things about my teammates but have been refraining from typing them. Crazy how much its made my win rate go up. I've literally lost countless games from poking fun at my teammates mistakes only to have them soft int and play worse on purpose to make us lose.\n\nSo yea, I would say to use the chat as minimally as possible. I don't even know why there is a chat box in the first place. Everything can be communicated via pings.
