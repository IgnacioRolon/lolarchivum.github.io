This is because previously when I tried upgrading my desktop to windows 10, League was not able to be executed. So now I am wondering if you lots know by any chance whether League is now 100% compatible / would work with windows 10?\r\n\r\nThank you. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Sensei","date":"2018-03-23T20:03:17.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant play it on windows 10 any solution please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T17:14:19.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty certain League was playable on Windows 10 on release.  Issues can certainly arise as a result of OS changes and features, like the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) with Windows or Mouse Shaker with Macs, but we make it through the obstacles.  Updating your OS is entirely your call, League should be playable either way.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dugora","date":"2017-04-08T13:54:23.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have windows 10 and I play league","replies":[]}]}
