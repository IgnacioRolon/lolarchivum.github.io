Are you referring to the Windowed resolution?  You may adjust this through your in-game interface.  Tap Escape while in-game, and select Video options.  You will be able to change it to Fullscreen mode.  Let me know in detail if you still have an issue!","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-09-13T20:15:35.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue over the weekend with Fullscreen mode.  \n\nIn my case, the solution was the restart \"Windows Explorer\" from the task manager. \n\nThis only began occurring after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and it happened with full-screen Youtube videos too.  It is most likely an issue with Windows 10 itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T20:22:36.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I think I see it now, it was a hard guess without an explanation.  The issue appears to be the red border around the game.  The F9 key will toggle it off.  I think, but not sure, that it was intended for players with multiple monitors that needed to task out.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-09-13T20:25:54.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I had already solved my issue shortly after encountering it. \n\nThe issue was that the Windows task bar would appear over all other windows (including full-screen games and videos).  It occurred after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and shouldn't have anything to do with League of Legends at all.\n\nIt was an issue with Windows Explorer rather than anything to do with League of Legends.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-09-13T20:17:22.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Open Task Manager and restart the \"Windows Explorer\" process.\n\nThat fixed it for me.","replies":[]}]}
