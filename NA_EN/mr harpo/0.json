I accept my punishment and am willing to take it, but instead of getting the usual 5 games, I got 10 low priority queues (20 minutes). I looked it up, and I hadn't seen anybody else get these. Am I experiencing a bug or is this a PBE feature? All help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T16:56:50.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your PBE account and was unable to find any lower priority queues; though, it's possible I'm not looking at the right one.  In general, your [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) can escalate based on constant game leaves and interruptions.  It is also the PBE, so it's possible that it's been placed in this way for testing purposes- and also low tolerance.  Leaving games can hinder testers, so it's crucial to stay in the match.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Harpo","date":"2016-08-31T17:40:16.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My summoner name is Aiyyy Lmaokai if that helps.

If you're still seeing that you do have it, I would recommend reporting it to the [PBE community](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/login).  Unfortunately, there wouldn't be anything I could provide from here.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
