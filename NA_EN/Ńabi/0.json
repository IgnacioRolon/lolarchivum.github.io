Items? PAY WALL. Top tier champion? Fking Pay wall. Best classes? Pay wall.\n\nThe term does not have any meaning when used incorrectly. For example, its not for expansions. Like no ones OMG GUILD WARS WAS PAY TO WIN BECUSE NEW CLASS IN EXPANSION/ NEW SKILLS.  Yea a lot of new builds could be strong. Missing out on a good class combo sucked. But you could wreck folks in PvP with out it.\n\nLeauge having the occasional account power you can get with $?  Sorry that's been a part of the game from season 1.  Remember runes?  Turns out having multiple rune pages made your account better because you could in lobby change them, having presets for multiple matchups across every champion you mained?  That's an edge vs some one who cant.\n\n\nSo shure. Rerolls are an edge. Call it pay for an advantage or edge. Its not pay to win because the games literally not un-winnableif you vs some one with the pass.\n\nUse the term right. Riots got one of the better F2P Models in the industry.\n\nPay for advantages? Leagues always had that. If your skill doesn't back it up your gonna still lose because your bad. If you don't pay for it and your good you still win. Nuff said.\n\nAnd hey if you chose to define Pay to win as any time a game gives an advantage for spending $?  That's 100% all of everything with F2P models that also has a $ currency as well.\nYour welcome to have that as your opinion, how ever we would have low use for the term F2P  because due to overlap all the games would meet the definition for P2W.\n\nSo shure spark outrage. OMG AN ADVANTAGE!  It does not remove your skills impact. Your not seeing a pay wall, they don't get gross in game advantages. For their account? Yea it helps. For any 1 independent game? 0 assurances it will help you at all.\n\nRage about Riot going PAY TO WIN.  When by your definition the games been that way from its first years. Talk about riot selling their soul to china, despite Ten-cent being a 2011 event, well be for most y'all even started playing. Make pointless noise about a RNG game modes balance and how unfair it is for extra rerolls to be purchased.\n\nAny one who has experience with pay to win games is going to laugh at ya. Because some games are literally unwinnable with out $ interaction. You cant make a top list with out paying for special units, high tier buildings, special ability's, speed ups, or even get locked out of playing a stage because you wont spend $.\n\nThat's the definition of pay to win for most of everybody. You have to PAY... or you wont win vs the guys who do.\n\nFeel free to have your own perception and definition. I very clearly don't. We will not see eye to eye on it. Don't waste my or your time trying to argue it.\n\nTldr.

Because the people in your last game who may or may not use rerolls are new so then its a completely different set of folks who may or may not have and or use rerolls.  Comparing it game to game between accounts, Yes. Very clearly an edge and advantage.\n\nDoes it make you magicaly win more games?  No. If your trash at 80% of the champions your still going to be trash in a match. \n\nRNG is not Pay to win.  Buying a special OP champion that only unlocks from RP?  That's Pay to win.  Starting a game with level 18 and full build because there is a rune that cost $ and allows this? Pay to win.\n\nLearn the term. Advantage and win are not the same. Pay to win HAS to make you win. It cant be luck. It cant be accomplished by free players. The $ needs to be the only requirement for victory and it has to remove the ability of others to contest a match.\n\nOr don't. You can define it how ever you want. Just the ones who have been around when it was coined will disagree with your misusage.\n\nRerolls is an advantage but Its not inherently pay to win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-28T21:22:28.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I guess it would be even more painful to realize that a game you like is offering a P2W service than it is to bend over backwards to claim that an extra reroll every match doesn't result in more rerolls.","replies":[{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2019-01-28T21:51:03.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hfEnAr69,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-28T21:22:28.669+0000)\n>\n> I guess it would be even more painful to realize that a game you like is offering a P2W service than it is to bend over backwards to claim that an extra reroll every match doesn&#x27;t result in more rerolls.\n\nWhat prompted this comment?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-01-28T21:58:06.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dnsup,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=hfEnAr69,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-01-28T21:51:03.066+0000)\n>\n> What prompted this comment?\n\nPeople insisting that a pass that provides more rerolls doesn't have any effect on rerolls (because it doesn't alter the outcome of an individual roll, or because it doesn't increase the max number of rerolls, etc.), even though the singular and direct purpose of such a service is to do exactly that. Players who buy the pass are allowed more attempts at rolling a strong champ than players who don't buy the pass. It is P2W.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
