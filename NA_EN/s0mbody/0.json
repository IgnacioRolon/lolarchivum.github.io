I had moments where i was toxic and said some pretty mean thing. Got suspended for it towards the end of season 7 for 2 weeks. First time in all the seasons i had played. I feel it was due to the fact I went from plat 2 and tilted very hard due to many unfortunate events and playing when I was frustrated and or upset. I dropped all the way down to gold 3. I stopped play for maybe 3 and a half weeks total and tried to get back to plat regardless of getting awards because I knew my skills were capable of being in that division. I won a few lost a few in the next couple weeks of playing. In a stretch of what i believe was 6 games, the last 6 of my account i won like 3 of them i believe. and the last 3 here are the chat logs. What im asking is, the fact that I use vulgar language at times or comment at all on others? or use my opinion of the situations that gets me banned? I agree game 1 chat logs there was some bad things. But compared to stuff i use to say way back in season 2, I would say its a big improvement. I would love for my account to be unbanned since i have had it since almost the beginning of League, but i know its highly unlikely. What I would like to know is how can I improve, am I not aloud to really comment on the game at all because people get upset so easy? \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nS0MBODY: jesus lux\r\nS0MBODY: wtf\r\nS0MBODY: u ddint land shit\r\nS0MBODY: first time vayne?\r\nS0MBODY: cuz u keep saving them\r\nS0MBODY: he flashed before\r\nS0MBODY: dont lie\r\nS0MBODY: this team is a bunch of useless fucks\r\nS0MBODY: use your fuckin brain and peel\r\nS0MBODY: dotn fuckin dive\r\nS0MBODY: all lanes are losing so fuck off kenned\r\nS0MBODY: tired of with useless team mates\r\nS0MBODY: was warding\r\nS0MBODY: cuz taric wont\r\nS0MBODY: stun udyr and he dies, he is full squish buiild\r\nS0MBODY: why was taric not fuckin tanking?!\r\nS0MBODY: wtf\r\nS0MBODY: game so free\r\nS0MBODY: bot lane trolling from min 1\r\nS0MBODY: wehn you  make your carries tank barron\r\nS0MBODY: it lowers there dmg\r\nS0MBODY: cuz of a debfuff\r\nS0MBODY: just fuckin die to barron for all i care you bronze cuk\r\nGame 2\r\nS0MBODY: qss is good item this gam e:)\r\nS0MBODY: why did you leave mid fid?\r\nS0MBODY: there is nothing you can get bot..\r\nS0MBODY: sigh\r\nS0MBODY: so depressing\r\nS0MBODY: this fid has yet to land an ult yet..\r\nS0MBODY: so bad\r\nS0MBODY: thx team\r\nS0MBODY: dont help us\r\nS0MBODY: was free fight\r\nS0MBODY: fid hit 5 man ult\r\nS0MBODY: and u were farmin top\r\nS0MBODY: and draven was farming jg\r\nS0MBODY: we wont win with shit plays like that\r\nS0MBODY: damn tyler 1 wanna be stfu\r\nS0MBODY: he is trolling cuz he didnt get a kill\r\nS0MBODY: plz\r\nS0MBODY: keep being afk draven\r\nS0MBODY: and u will get perma banned\r\nS0MBODY: useless tyler 1 wanna be\r\nS0MBODY: cant even farm\r\nS0MBODY: or play his champ\r\nS0MBODY: wont win with this bronze draven\r\nS0MBODY: he is checked out\r\nS0MBODY: cant even catch an axe\r\nGame 3\r\nS0MBODY: all lanes losing we lose game. feels good man\r\nS0MBODY: you are dying 1v1 kid..\r\nS0MBODY: you have no mechanics\r\nS0MBODY: find a new champ to play\r\nS0MBODY: bronze player bad mechanics\r\nS0MBODY: how much you pay for it?\r\nS0MBODY: cuz you dont even know how to auto cancel with your champ\r\nS0MBODY: plz stop playing league riven. go play neo pets or soemthing\r\nS0MBODY: riven is so mad XD keep shitn on her akali. she is flaming non stop\r\nS0MBODY: nah\r\nS0MBODY: sad when the jg has more cs than top lane\r\nS0MBODY: gonna go die again riven?\r\nS0MBODY: wanna learn english?\r\nS0MBODY: their lucian is trollin too so we are fine\r\nS0MBODY: just cc akali and win","replies":[{"poster":"S0MBODY","date":"2017-11-03T03:02:01.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in other words /muteall or risk the chances of being banned if you say something that someone doesn't like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2017-11-03T02:21:19.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are assholes, you have to accept that you aren't allowed to do anything, and suck it up.\n\nTwo options:\nDo the \"right\" thing and mute them\nDo what you want to do\n\nRiot wants you to do the first, so do the first.\n\nPeople in this game are jerks.

That is out of the question.  Commenting on your teammates' performance can be direct, and constructive, without involving toxicity.  Through the chat logs, you seem to critique there performance in the game, but do not help them seek any sort of reform for the issues they are having. I am sure vulgar language adds to the mix, as it only has negative stigma surrounding it. All in all, it comes to down to realizing that this is a team game in which you, your teammates, or the enemy can have a bad game at any time, and putting them down, is not a viable option. Always seek to help, never hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2017-11-03T02:03:37.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Under no circumstances do they remove permanent bans.\n\nFTFY\n\nPunishment tiers go down as you play games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-03T01:57:09.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Several punishable points there, but nothing to escalate over.
