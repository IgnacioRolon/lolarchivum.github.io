All champions. I believe if Riot make all champions free then newbies could also enjoy playing lol","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-10T11:30:00.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still missing a ton of champions, but I don't really want many of them.  There are probably about 3 that I'm still interested in getting.\nPeople don't need every champion in the game.  People need the champions in their main and sub roles.\n\nEdit:  It also helps keep it from overwhelming new players with information.  Rather than having 131x4 (too tired to math) abilities +131 passives to learn, they have 12 and 3 respectively.  They could do this by just unlocking a certain number of champion as you level up, but I feel like leveling up goes by too fast for this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2016-06-10T17:02:54.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing about a year as a support main and just recently ujnlocked the last \"sepport champ.\" I enjoyed the grind to unlock them. I did buy some with RP but for the most part it was IP. It gets old, people asking for more free stuff in a F2P game","replies":[]},{"poster":"177A Bleecker St","date":"2016-06-10T12:36:22.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fernantroll","date":"2016-06-10T12:24:41.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that these is done in order to keep players interested in the game. Think of it as a challenge. I do, how ever see that \"one year\" way off. I've been also playing for 3 weeks and i already got like 5 champions. Although as stated before people don't really need all of the champions unlocked if you are not a collector of some sort.\n\nWhich is why i assume they have free champions every week in order to test them out and if you dig it, get it. And still get some rune pages and runes for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2016-06-10T11:26:17.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played ~4k games and i'm missing ~8 champions.

Not a crazy amount of runes/pages bought either.","replies":[]}]}
