It depends on what you mean by the 'meta.'\n\nIf you mean how champs are played for particular roles, absolutely, yes. Champs can certainly be played with different builds and different lanes, but there's limits to that. AP mid Annie is better than AP mid Garen. \"But it works for me!\" I bet it does, man, but if you can make AP mid Garen work, I bet you'll do godly with top tank Garen. Off-meta is fine if you know a champion really well, and the role makes sense with the kit; support Vel'koz is one of my personal favorites. But don't feel like you have to break the meta for its own sake. You're not a worse player for using a champ in the lane they're made for.\n\nFlavor of the Month (often abbreviated FotM) is another matter. **Fuck that shit.** Don't play what's OP this patch trying hard to win. _Fuck that._ Play what you like and know, and get _godly_ at it. Pick a champ and learn them inside-out. If you main kha'zix jg, and you get flamed for not going Sejuani or whatever, mute that LCS-worshipping trash and make the enemy squishies shit their pants every time they walk into the jungle. \n\nRespect the meta, know the meta, but the meta isn't everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-04-20T22:07:02.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavaresxutris,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=QJmZvg91,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-04-20T21:40:57.457+0000)\n> Pick a champ and learn them inside-out. If you main kha'zix jg, and you get flamed for not going Sejuani or whatever, mute that LCS-worshipping trash and make the enemy squishies shit their pants every time they walk into the jungle. \n\nThis is the one part I'd like to point out on this post as not necessarily being accurate. If you're going kha'zix jungle, and the team is expecting a tanky jungler because that's what the meta is right now... by going kha jungle without first cooridnating it with the team to ensure they can make up for the flaw, you're denying your team one of the keys it will need to be a functional team comp: a tank.\n\nThat isn't to say you have to go the meta champs. Shen jungle, if you're good enough at it, offers a tank but isn't a top pick. Malph jungle, Zac jungle(although he's a bit closer to the top), etc.\n\nBut make sure you understand what is EXPECTED out of the role you're going and make sure that if you are doing anything OTHER than that that your team is able to work around it... because otherwise you may be drastically reducing your team's chances to win.\n\nThe real heart of the meta is not a list of champs that can be played, but rather a set of expectations for each role that shifts over time. If you want to play a champ that isn't a top pick but still fills that expectation, then there's no problem - you shouldn't be concerned. If you want to play a champ that DOESN'T fulfill that expectation, than the responsibility is on you to coordinate with the team, and if your team can't work around it, please... just play a champ that fills the expectations. This is why it is good to learn multiple champs for each role... so you can fit into the meta without just adopting the FotM picks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-04-20T22:22:18.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta matters, but it doesn't mean that you should follow it.\nNew tank items {{item:3709}} {{item:3800}} are really good, so tanks are definitely better than before.

I feel it is most important for people who are NOT yet experiend to follow it because it allows them to actually form teams that work.\n\nWhen you are experienced, it is okay to experiment provided you do so with a reason. Not just \"Oh I want to go malzahar ADC\" but rather \"Against x toplaner, y toplaner works really well and since our jungler is tanky we don't need a tanky top so I can go y without any sacrifice\". Breaking the meta is great, provided it is done with a logical reason AND your team is able to make up for whatever sacrifice you're making by going a non-meta route.\n\nTypically new players won't recognize what fulfills those conditions, so it is most important for them to follow the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-04-20T21:15:48.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh. I think it's important to recognize when a meta changes and see how it effects you, but not necessarily to follow the meta pick for pick. \n\nFor example, I use to main Ziggs. Poke, waveclear, peel, and long range ults all day long. It was fun to me, and I liked the champ. But towards the end of Season 4 I noticed a trend towards assassins that I couldn't handle. It was one of those \"adapt or die\" situations, and so rather than figure out how to make Ziggs work in this shifting mid lane meta, I decided to shop around for a new champion.\n\nI found out that I didn't really love LeBlanc, or Ahri, or any of the other mobile mids that I came across. They didn't feel like a good fit for me. Eventually I stumbled upon AP Ezreal, you know, that \"troll build\". Well, I dove into spreadsheets and builds, changed my runes, and in the end had an AP Ezreal build that I was happy with. To date, I've played over 100 games on AP Ezreal, with a 52.94% win rate over all of those games, and a 60% win rate in my latest 20 games (and no, that doesn't count URF). For comparison, lolking.net puts Ezreal's win rate at <48% in Bronze, <48% in Silver, <48% in Gold (my MMR would probably put me in one of those three, haven't gone back to ranked this season, but ended Silver 4 and could have still climbed last season).\n\nI knew the meta was changing and I adapted to it, but I adapted in a way that wasn't \"meta\". It worked out for me though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimmrock","date":"2015-04-20T20:51:36.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will always be a tank meta.\n-- Me, A Tank Jungle Main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2015-04-20T20:46:38.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't really care tbh\nif it works, i play it, and if people have a problem with it, who fucking cares lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-20T20:41:49.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New meta?
