It's always stuck scanning the files. Re downloading it doesn't help, and I'm always getting the \"unspecified error\" message. \r\nAlso for some reason, i just updated league yesterday and it was fine, but it for some reason updated AGAIN today and it's like this? Last time i checked there was no update today...\r\nI'm really bad with the repairing stuff so can anyone explain how to fix this in an easier way, or just explain it to me more thoroughly?\r\nthanks ;o;","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T23:04:11.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting stuck at this point usually indicates a security setting that's preventing the launcher from properly scanning game files.
