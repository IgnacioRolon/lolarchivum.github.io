Where did the idea come from, why did you pick it over other ideas.\r\n\r\nI make the &quot;A Corporate Matter&quot; stories, that are in the comments of the free rotation posts. In it, i have a character named Corporate Gnar, so i was wondering if my story had anything to do with the skin. It would be pretty cool if something i did influenced the game i love.\r\n\r\nAlso, was there any consideration about making it a legendary skin, or was it always planned to be a 975 range skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T22:09:21.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey King Dellron,\n\nThis was actually one of the early ideas for a Gnar skin before he was even released, buuuut Gnar in a dino onesie won as his launch skin (for obvious reasons. :3) The idea seemed like a natural choice for Gnar, since Mini Gnar and Mega Gnar were similar to the idea of Jekyll and Hyde. \n\nThe skin itself was always planned to be a mid scope skin, and we didn't intend to give him a new set of VO. (Although, looking back, I'm curious what kind of words we could have made up...)","replies":[{"poster":"King Dellron","date":"2015-07-13T22:29:58.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response.\nIts a really awesome skin, been waiting for it since it was on the pbe, good work.\n\nAlso hoping for more Gentleman/Fair Lady(Gentlewomen?) skins in the future. I think most of the void champions would look good with one. Legendary is always best, because we need more British accents in league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-07-13T22:14:07.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we make Lady Rek'Sai to go with gentleman Cho'Gath?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-13T22:11:27.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's obvious!\nThey could be pronounced in a more cultured way.","replies":[]}]}]}
