After the 3 sec's my computer makes this sound like i just plugged in an external device (even though i didn't) and i can move again. Its like i just lose 3 or 4 sec's of in game time a few times a game. I am new to owning a computer so i'm not sure what the problem is or how i can fix it. I have good wired connection, I've tried turning off my bluetooth to fix it, but a NO GO.\r\nAnyone else have this problem before? If not anyone got any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-19T03:15:25.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds an awful lot like packet loss to me, which can be pretty easy to pinpoint but sometimes rather hard to fix if it's happening before your connection reaches our servers.

This could be a problem with drivers or even the motherboard. If you have any usb devices besides your mouse plugged in, it is also worth trying to play with them unplugged to isolate the problem and see if that fixes anything. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
