The whole purpose of prelocking is to show your teammates what you intend to play, SO again, why do I have to physically press &quot;lock-in&quot; if I already pre-locked what I want to play? It&#039;s dumb because here I thought the DEVs were actually smart enough to make it show you didn&#039;t have to lock it, but nope I accidently dodged the game and now have to wait 30 MINS??? before playing, and why is it now that your queue time increases for every time you dodge, why are you punishing us for dodging?","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-26T23:01:08.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an AFK check.
