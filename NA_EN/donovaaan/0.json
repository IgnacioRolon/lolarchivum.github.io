I accepted this offer, and downloaded the beta fully, but when I went to log in, a black screen popped up.  This black screen has continued to pop up everytime I open up leagueoflegends and click play.  I asked my friend how can I reverse it, but he gave me the same response as given when the beta opened up.  My question is, how can I fix this black screen to open up the login menu where I can type in my username and password to then be able to play league?","replies":[{"poster":"Donovaaan","date":"2016-11-20T02:59:34.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the process of where I have to go to chance, but what I was saying or possibly forgot to mention above, was that when I press play on the home league page, the league app disappears and if i try to re-open it up, a black screen appears.  I cannot access the logic screen, only the home start up screen where all the patches are installed/updated.  Perhaps there is a solution to this technical problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-19T21:37:51.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The screen may be cause by a security setting issue that's preventing the client from loading properly.  Give our permissions guide a go to try and fix this up.  If the issue persists, you may want to return to the legacy client until our client devs find a resolution for this:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
