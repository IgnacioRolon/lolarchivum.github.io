Just kinda concerned as I unlocked the Corruption Icon, yet I did the 33 kills before I actually did the premade game with friends.\n\nThanks for unlocking it anyways though, know the ones I was premade with haven't gotten theirs just yet either.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
