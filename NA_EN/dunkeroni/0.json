I was not in queue with Sejuani, yet I lost LP. As Riot stated in their update on remakes:\r\n\r\n>All players connected to the game basically pretend the game never happened, gaining or losing no LP/IP/XP, and seeing no change to their overall W/L records\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/43lVW","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-08-29T00:46:06.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a game is remade, anyone who is marked as AFK will receive the \"leaver\" penalty for a remake. It's not just for the initial player who disconnected. There are certain behaviors that will mark you as AFK even if you don't physically disconnect form the game, such as standing/running around in base. Doing that while waiting for a remake will mark you as AFK and give you the remake penalty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-29T20:38:08.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if someone quits the game or doesn't initially, it's a good idea to continue to play the game normally in case they do actually come back before /Remake triggers. If everyone on a team goes AFK while waiting for a remake and someone comes back, it leaves the entire team behind, rather than just one player. \n\n*Zombiemaster* touched on some great points here as well. A lot of the info on this system can be found on our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ). Let me know if you have any additional questions.","replies":[]}]}
