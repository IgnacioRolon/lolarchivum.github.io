This isn&#039;t an immense issue I understand, but it would be nice to be able to easily tell if the stacks have fallen off someone if she keeps dodging in and out of a fight. It bugs me a bit because virtually every champion who has a mechanic similar to MF&#039;s W, i.e. Twitch, Vayne, Varus, etc., all have some sort of visual indicator for their current stacks. Maybe just add some small circling hearts, similar to when she has her passive up? I just think it would be a nice QOL change to her, what do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-09-05T18:41:47.928+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF is getting some tweaks in the pretty near future, and I believe that part of this package is better visualization for Impure Shots.","replies":[{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-09-06T00:27:16.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think impure shots does really little damage compared to varus W stacks aswell, it feels a bit lackluster, is it a possibility that it may have a little damage buff?","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2015-09-07T08:21:22.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like it if they changed her ult passive so that instead of increasing how many stacks she gets for her impure shots, it'll instead improve the effectiveness of the stacks by so they deal 6% then 7.3%, 8.6%, 10% of her total Ad in magic damage. Because as the game goes on and she gets items, most enemies can't even live long enough when being auto'd by her to even GET 8 stacks of her Impure Shots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-09-05T19:44:59.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aIZI5AUx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-05T18:41:47.928+0000)\n>\n> MF is getting some tweaks in the pretty near future, and I believe that part of this package is better visualization for Impure Shots.\n\nCould you please be more specific?

CertainlyT said they're already testing the visuals for a (seemingly locked in) change to her ult. So November sounds good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smefanye","date":"2015-09-05T21:24:52.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thanks for the update! It's always a bit iffy with MF changes and suggestions since she can get pushed from one end of the spectrum to the other really quickly with just some small changes. Like the suggestion I read for her to have an unbreakable strut active during her impure shots would be too much, but I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys do with her :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-09-05T02:20:20.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would be interesting to see an indicator.
