The thing is that randomly during the game, my ping will be blocked at 70-71 ms. Yet that shouldn't be a problem, but the issue is that I'm experimenting some packet loss. Some character will tp anywhere and I will only see a spell being made a second after the actual cast. I've never had this problem and it really frustrates me. Now you could think that it comes from my own connection, but I've tested my ping on any other game and they don't have the same problem. \r\n\r\nCould someone help me pls ? \r\nThx a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"dynamic Q gamble","date":"2016-08-04T15:41:06.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue since the server maintenance 2 days ago.\nPing is around 26ms, which should be fine, but I have huge packet loss sometimes.\nhttp://puu.sh/qpGa5/0cf6b22d69.png\nI will make a support ticket with the tracert, hopefully this gets fixed soon, the game is barely playable right now. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-04T15:24:41.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss could be a result of a weak network or the routing of your isp, causing you to see delays in-game.  If your other games and internet appear to be fine but League is having packet loss, then the culprit here could be that your isp is taking a scenic route to the game server.  Run a [traceroute ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)to get an overview of this routing, and attach it to a [player support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
