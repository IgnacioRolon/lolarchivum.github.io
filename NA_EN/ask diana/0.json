I went to another board and at another board (don't ask me which one tho), the message switched to \"blablabla level 7 blablabla\"\r\nThen I leveled the account to 7, but at the roleplay boards i still get the \"blabla 5 blabla\" message. I'm kinda pissed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ask Diana","date":"2017-09-09T22:25:32.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh looks like it's working now.
