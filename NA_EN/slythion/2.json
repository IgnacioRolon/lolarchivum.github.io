If the issue arises again, I'll be sure to follow through because it was quite a nasty situation.\n\nI can explain everything in as much detail as possible, but there really wouldn't be much to it so sorry for the wall of text but this is the order of events that happened:\n\n- Opened League Client (after patching to 6.19) with no issues\n- Played an ARURF match and a Normal match with absolutely no issues\n- Left for an event\n- Opened League Client again\n- Played an ARURF in the following order of events:\n - Champ Select (no issues)\n - Load Screen (no issues)\n - After 30ish seconds in game with absolutely no issues (fps + ping were perfect, no delay or anything) I found myself looking at the screen to allow me to reconnect to the game\n - Reconnecting load screen (no issue)\n - Joined match again only to dc in the exact same fashion\n - As I reconnected more often, the DC time became about 30ish seconds after I would reconnect\n- I then adjusted my Compatibility Settings in a trouble shoot\n- Played an ARAM to test it out:\n - Same issues persisted except I would now dc roughly 30seconds in, consistently this time\n- Re-downloaded League Client + ran a virus scan the next day  (no viruses btw):\n - Issue was not resolved in the Normal game I played\n- Opened **_Alpha Client_** this time (no issues)\n- Played a Normal Match (no issues, wiped the floor as Darius :3)\n- Played another Normal Match thinking that the issue was limited to the main client\n - Issue began again in the *2nd* game on alpha client\n- Re-Re-downloaded League Client (2nd time) + Redownloaded Alpha Client as I was waiting for a response on my support ticket\n - Proceeded to play 2 custom games with randos + 4 aram games (solo) with absolutely no problems on the Normal Client\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for the wall of text but I find it extremely particular that the issue didn't occur until after playing at least 1 game for both clients, as well as how re-downloading didn't work the 1st time but it appears to have worked on the 2nd download with absolutely no changes to my computer.\n\nI could still send my setup data and the other things Mr. Rubik asked for in the support ticket if you guys still wanted to take a closer look at what could have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-29T16:25:10.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you giving me full context on what happened and I'm glad things are working better now. \n\nIf you happen to experience further troubles, I definitely recommend replying to Rubik in your ticket.
