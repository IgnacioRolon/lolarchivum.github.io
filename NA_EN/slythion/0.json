Beyond that, champions are inevitably going to be balanced around their optimal rune builds, which means that newer players, who won't be able to have those even if they look up an online guide, will also be forced to play from a disadvantage.

When you are first learning the game, a MOBA veteran or not, do you know exactly how each champions stats work? Armour? Magic resist? AP scaling? AD scaling? Which champions can build which paths? Which can build both paths? How exactly to lane in league? When to use e? w? q? r? The point is to give people a little bit of time to figure out what they need to do. It doesn't take that long to get to level 17. It really doesn't. For returning players, it's a struggle to not be able to use your runes when you know what they do, but it's also a way to deter extra smurfs and alternate accounts. For people from a different moba, no matter how similar it is, there are also many differences. Riot just wants you to focus on the big picture rather than the little stuff in the beginning. Learn specific champs and how to build them and THEN focus on which runes may fit your playstyle. Arguably, even people from other mobas might not know which playstyle they prefer in THIS game. So riot is making it so they focus on other things first before they dive into the other stuff. That's why. Yes, people that have played other sports might know how to stretch, but maybe they dont' know the specific exercises they should do before starting a different sport. It's kinda the same thing ya know?","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2017-11-13T19:34:05.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing the enemy playstyle is a necessary evil.

They are very basic already, and don't need a 3-week tutorial to cover before you can even consider trying that OP Annie build you just saw last game, because you had the misfortune of facing one who passed the tutorial.\n\nEven excluding all of that, there is little to no reason to hold back players who do not seek the help. As a universal example, you teach players in Chess how to do things, correct movement, en passant, how to castle, etc. However, that doesn't make it helpful to restrict a player from castling when the opponent gets to. If you want to intertwine players of different skill levels, they're going to need the same skills, or else you're setting up the new player for a bad experience, especially when they can't adjust to mimic that playstyle the following game.\n\nAgain, advice is good. Presets are good. Forcing is bad. When I am playing League of Legends, I expect to be playing the full game, just like everyone else.

Except for before you didn't even get to have runes. You literally had... 7 runes at level 7 you could use, that was IF you decided to purchase them (before they made everyone 1ip for tier 2 runes). This time, they gave you the option to use full runepages, but won't let you edit them at first. I fail to see how much different it is. The first 30 levels are to show you how to play the game and get you prepared for level 30 (which is where the game really \"starts\" imo). There are several games where you get a full first few level tutorial. WoW, GW2, other games like that all have basically the same starting sequence of 'teach you how to do this' and then they give you stuff to explore on your own. I'm confused as to why you think league should be different? Riot _could_ implement a system where if you were already level 30 and were creating a smurf you could opt in to a \"veteran\" status where it skips the tutorial, but then it doesn't really make the game fair to everyone, and then also people will abuse this and then never learn the game properly (or use it to harass new members). I mean, riot is trying to help NEW people, not necessarily hinder their progress, but it's like trying to teach a white belt a black belt move. You know? And you can argue that people don't WANT the help, but that's just how this game progresses it's starting players. I'd be pissed if I was trying to learn this game and got ZERO help.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2017-11-13T20:40:40.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it sucked before. That doesn't mean it's peachy now. They've been one of the worst game introductions in big games because they created these \"milestones\" in the name of learning the game, and kept scaring off their playerbase, which was okay with a fresh game. Now, 7 years in, they finally get rid of their largest barrier, and they go and put some new ones up for the hell of it.\n\nThere is literally no benefit to forcing presets. Having presets is good, forcing them is bad. It's tolerable for a few tutorial games, but not 10 levels. New players get the benefit from having the presets, but the veteran gamers play for accolades, not access to a repetitive game. And overall, that's likely the majority of incoming players in the first place.\n\nAgain, presets good. Forcing bad. Forcing presets helps nobody, old or new. Nobody is advocating zero help. Nobody is taking away the tutorials, or recommended item sets, or even preset runes. It's all about allowing game access if the player wants to actually use runes to a realistic degree. If this were an MMORPG, maybe let the player gain some power over time, let them come into their own. However, not in a game entirely based on PVP. You force a player to play with their hands tied behind their back, they'll go somewhere else. That has been their problem for a few seasons now, and Riot can't seem to work their way past it, despite this update being tailored toward it.\n\nIs Riot doing better with new players? Probably. I personally think that they've devolved the game so badly that the newer player experience is not enhanced. However, no matter the case, that doesn't make this particular issue any more sparkly. Give players presets, but don't 100% force it on them.

Yes, the tutorials are (slightly) better these days and bot modes are actually helpful to newcomers, but if I was level 25 playing Tryndamere/Katarina duo mid lane and Janna/Old Galio duo top lane with my buddy at level 25 just imagine with a level 11 would be doing. The premade pages aren't even that bad (besides the unsealed spellbook one) for new players to use, it's not like anyone level 11 who isn't a smurf or MOBA expert from another game would want to maximize their potential at that level via runes anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-11-14T11:47:07.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ROFL.

I've played on other people's accounts, i know this. without one, i have to get a full item before i can stay in lane for more than 3 waves, its incredibly unrealistic. like, who actually uses gold tree on syndra? maybe this is one champion, but i find it hard to believe that I am the only one suffering from the fact that forced rune pages make some champions almost unplayable, and it hurts even more that I don't have a good opportunity to fix it until level 15, as it is the secondary page that I need to change(I want to change one thing on the primary too, but it's a preference thing). In my opinion, if a company wants to force you to play with a certain piece of content, but they choose how it works, then they should put some effort into making it work right so that it doesn't hinder the player experience instead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carfreezeus","date":"2019-05-29T15:54:05.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slythion,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QXUJdYEF,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-13T05:00:48.706+0000)\n>\n> actually though, why?
