It's simply just packets were dropped so that the packet rate wasn't updated. 60k ms would mean a minute of ping. Unless a minute passed, it's simply just an estimate based off of you losing connection. The ping measure is the time it takes for a ping to reach. Pings are packets used to basically show that the sender is there. If no packet is received you get very high ping and disconnected but the actual number isn't really relevant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HÃ¥neri","date":"2019-10-21T04:16:47.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got this shit on my main\n\nping started going up and didnt stop until 20k or something when i got attempting to reconnect. happened to everyone in the game and eventually we were able to reconnect and we won (not cause we got in first or anything, we were winning already beforehand) and for some goddamned reason i got 9 lp for the win, when id been getting 20 noramlly for wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Summoner SpeII","date":"2019-10-20T18:06:59.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened to me so at first i started hollering at the top of my lungs for my parents to get off the bandwidth, but everyone in my game pinged it so i went to twitch tv, but i saw streamers playing league fine with no problems, so it was probably only a probem for people playing normals?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-20T03:50:01.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check if your router is on fire, to start.\n\nThat would be one minute of ping, at which point you disconnected completely about 40 seconds earlier. something is grossly misreporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Cheesy Boner","date":"2019-10-20T03:53:31.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u11EA5RR,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-20T03:50:01.168+0000)\n>\n> Check if your router is on fire, to start.\n> \n> That would be one minute of ping, at which point you disconnected completely about 40 seconds earlier. something is grossly misreporting.\n\nwhole aram game had 12K plus. everyone was running around in circles until winions won us the match lel","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-20T04:33:32.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is uh..
