I made the account and didn't put an email to it so the guy added one which then took me a few hours telling the guy the owner of the account was 11. He then agreed to return the account. I reported the email, information and more to league and said they will handle it. Nothing was done about it, they played 2 solo queues on his account, a xayah  game and a twitch game which you can look at username Beastmode058 euw. A month later he is banned for \"scripting\" when he hasn't done this. I have searched everything on his computer, even offered to send everything to the support team... Heck  I will send them the laptop to do whatever. They refuse to help with this situation and proceed to say the 11 year old is liable for his account for being hacked and that he shouldn't account share ect. Which wasn't the case clearly. He must have at least £1000 worth of skins and brought champions with rp. Wasted because people refuse to help... What a waste of 2years and money. Oh well I'll stop rambling because clearly riot doesn't give a f....","replies":[{"poster":"dont trust girls","date":"2017-07-09T01:59:01.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, I'm Lucy\nThe problem is that if someone hacked your account and scripted on it, sadly then that account is still responsible for that offense. I'm sure the folks at Riot are very sorry for your loss but it is unlikely that anything can really be done about it. I am sorry for your loss but I am willing to explain to you why the Rioters wont help you in this case, he IS liable for the account and what happens to it, not only that but assuming it was someone else who scripted on the account - it still happened on that account. Whether it was intended or not the behavior still happened.  It is very hard for the people at Riot who may want to help you because if they do then the community could be put up in arms about how a \"scripter\" got their account back. They are simply unable to help outlier situations like this, if they did then it would break the validity and security of their system. \n_____________________________\nThe good news is that with the new rune system rolling in it's going to become very easy to make new accounts since the rune barrier will not longer exist. I promise it doesn't take long to get a viable champion pool, especially if you are willing to spend a little money.  \nGood luck to you!\n- Worst League Player NA ♥\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T02:48:46.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chrystalian pretty much hit the nail on the head with their explanation. It really sucks that your little brothers account was hacked from an easily guessed password, but overall the account is what is held responsible for the actions that took place. Your brother personally isn't banned from the game, however the account that was found using scripts (regardless of who it was) will be held responsible and banned. Your brother is more than welcome to create a new account of his own, and I'd suggest verifying it with his email and setting up a more secure password.","replies":[]}]}
