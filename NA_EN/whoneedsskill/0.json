I notice after 3-4 matches the client starts to distort sound and gets progressively worse each game, to the point where it also starts to bug out the client and feels like fps drop significantly in champ select. Thankfully it's an easy fix by just restarting client when I first start to notice it happening, but frustrating nonetheless. Also, literally nothing else has this issue when it happens, only league client.\n\nWindows 10\nAMD FX(tm)-6120 six-core processor 3.50 GHz\n\n(not sure what other info could be helpful, if there is something specific let me know and I can find it and add it to this)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-21T23:29:17.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you have any background applications running that interact with your audio device?

The client and sound start out fine, but after several games the sound starts going crazy and the animation stutters with it.  It is only in the launcher, and only after many games or a long time of being on.  For me it only happens after a whole day playing the game repeatedly.  Leaving it on overnight seems to induce the problem as well.  Everything else on the computer runs fine when this happens: i can watch videos, browse the web, whatever.  It's only LOL that stutters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElCap1tan","date":"2017-02-22T20:03:51.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1PgwRvcx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-21T23:29:17.188+0000)\n>\n> Do you have any background applications running that interact with your audio device?

Never happens right after opening the client I have to play a few games before it starts. Restarting the client always helps. The only software I'm running in the background are a few browsers and drivers are updated too. Seems there are more people with this issue. I remember reading another post about this a few weeks ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T22:34:10.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this happening with a specific audio device, or have you tested this with multiple audio devices?
