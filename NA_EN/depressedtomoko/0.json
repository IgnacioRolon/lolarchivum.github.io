I've updated my drives, graphics, changed compatibility mode, run as administrator, reset my computer, etc, and nothing has worked. I've searched online and done everything and nothing has worked, so now I go to forums.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-12T22:37:01.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There might be a more serious issue here like hardware failure if you're crashing into a blue screen.
