There's 0 concept of rotation, half of you stand there and freaking die to me. Most of your nidalee mains out right kill themselves on birds level 3, while the general Nid main in plat actually STARTED birds. None of your Kindred, or Graves players have yet to grasp how to even clear yet to this day, while the avg plat player did respectably well. None of you build correctly, your concept of cost vs reward is a joke, 80% of you will int on a tier 3 turret, or straight up lose 4 turrets and the game trying to find Teemo in a bush.
