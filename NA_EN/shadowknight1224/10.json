Some things I'd personally like to see:\r\n\r\nColour, size, underline, alignment (centre, particularly), image embedding, and a \"spoiler\" box.\r\n\r\nJust throwing it out there in case there are more people who want the ability to format their posts (particularly for Fan Creations).","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-04-14T00:46:55.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, glad to see someone else here for the formatting! If you haven't already I have a [post](http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/8GHuzijT-cb-formatting-101) detailing all the formatting options I've found out, as there are quite a few that the basic formatting guides didn't cover. Apologies for redundancy if you've already seen it.\n\nAs for a few others, I've seen a few red responses over my time here, but with all the sub-comm name switches I can't seem to find the specific posts. So hopefully you can take my word for it. =)\n\n* Colors are not easy to bring in, as it's not too large of a priority and has to be watched carefully for abuse (no one wants seizure inducing or all neon yellow posts)\n\n* Underline has been asked for and actually hasn't gotten a response yet if I recall correctly. No one's too sure why it isn't already in.\n\n* Alignment - I am sad I cannot upvote more than once for this.....\n\n* Spoiler box - has been asked for a lot by others, and is apparently tricky to add to this platform. It's known to be wanted but essentially has the soon(tm) mark.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-04-14T01:50:22.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My goodness, you are a genius! Thank you for the link, I had definitely failed to see that. There are far more formatting options than I expected!\n\nAs for the colours, I understand, but it's actually *extremely* useful for things like Character Concepts, where you can follow the game's use of specific colours for things like AP/AD scaling or noting resource expenditures. Perhaps there could be a set pool of colours? No neon or anything too garish?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-04-14T02:18:50.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely could work, but when it comes down to it I'm not a Red, so it's up to the Beta team. =)\n\nGlad I could help!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LouisLeGros","date":"2014-04-23T01:25:08.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why am not surprised that Riot goes with a platform that makes such basic functionality \"difficult\" when they are already copying a format (Reddit) with terrible formatting options, but at least has things like spoiler boxes.
