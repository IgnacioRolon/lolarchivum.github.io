Good Braums will save their jump+shield to nullify anything that can result in a kill (Nami bubble, Nami ult, Morgana dark binding, Leona zenith blade, Thresh/Blitz pull, etc). I can work around Morgana's Black Shield. Sure, having my bubble not CC the ADC sucks, but she can't blackshield two people at once, so my Nami ult will CC at least one person. Braum just spends the use of one ability to completely nullify anything you throw at him, and a good Braum will hold on their jump and shield for when they are actually needed (whereas most bad Braums will just waste them impatiently because they can't play the waiting game).\r\n\r\nAnd that's not even counting the true source of my frustration: the passive. It's a deathmark. If you are hit even once and he's in a position where the ADC can follow up, you're dead (unless you're Leona/Alistar, in which case he \"merely\" takes three quarters of your health). Lucian in particular is a horrendous ADC to face with Braum, as his passive lets him fill up Braum's passive faster than any other ADC and his dash means that he's more or less always in a position to follow up on Braum when he tags someone. I just don't understand how to deal with that. He doesn't really need to hit his Q, he's tanky enough to just walk up to you or your ADC and autoattack. It also doesn't seem to matter how much damage you pour on him, he seems to have Alistar-levels of tankiness, and if you back off to avoid the autoattack, he's effectively zoning you and your ADC simply with his presence.\r\n\r\nHe's also the only support with a dash to safety. Every other support with a dash is enemy-targeted (Leona, Alistar, Thresh). It doesn't matter how much harass he eats for the price of zoning you and your ADC, he can simply jump to a minion and escape retaliation, whereas any other support that attempts to do this can actually die. Even if you get him low enough to be finished off by your Cait/Ez/Jinx ult, he simply shields it off and then backs to base, having exchanged most of his health for several seconds of zoning you cannot get back. Letting his ADC freefarm while zoning off the enemy ADC is *invaluable* in the game. Being able to secure kills simply with an autoattack (again, he doesn't really need to land a skillshot the way Morgana, Blitz, Leona or Thresh do) is something I cannot understand. \r\n\r\nHow do you play against that? Braum can easily claim bush control simply by walking into the bush (even if it's a bush behind your own minion wave). If you attempt to fight him off, he just tags you with the passive and his ADC gets a free kill. If you back off, you are surrendering the bush to him and giving him zoning power. If any other tanky support were to do that, they would either (depending on the support I'm playing) get all-inned and have to back off or risk dying, or eat so much harass that they have to back off or risk dying. Braum doesn't operate like that. If you all-in Braum, he tags both you and the ADC with his passive and then proceeds to absorb an ungodly amount of damage (and if you turn your attention to his ADC, he just jump-shields to them and he still wins the all-in). If you try to harass him, he walks up to you and tags you with his passive, which means you must kite him backwards, which is still conceding him zoning power and presence.\r\n\r\nI just don't understand what his weaknesses are and how to exploit them. He just seems like a hopeless, unwinnable situation whenever I face an enemy Braum that actually knows what they're doing (a Braum who doesn't know what they're doing is still annoying but way more manageable).","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-11T17:08:48.556+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I've never lost a game as Thresh against Braum and I'm not even a particularly good thresh. The idea is that if Braum is in front, you double Q Braum to get behind him and that's when you mess up his adc. Obviously don't Double Q if their ADC is full health or their adc is someone like Tristana and you *know* she has her jump up, but if they don't have an escape up double Q works really well.\n\nLeona can also get into the backline the same way she does against a spell shield, she Es without turning on her Q, and then she goes behind the shield to Q the adc.\n\nHonestly if Blitz pulls Braum early game and gets a pull on him under tower that Braum's still not going to have a nice day.\n\nBraum's real weakness is his early game. 10 second CD Q, 14 second CD W, 18 second CD E. If Braum jumps  or if Braum E's you have a good window to go in on him. Nami has a 14 second CD on her bubble and a 10 second CD on her Ebb and Flow, if he shields your bubble then you'll have your bubble up before he can shield again. A lot of supports have CDs lower than Braum and you have to remember that Braum isn't just trying to protect from your abilities but when he sees that full strength Varus Q running at his Ashe he's gonna want to shield that too.\n\nAnother one of his weaknesses early game is he needs all of his abilities to be able to do anything. Level 1 and 2 if you get off a little harass, Braum's going to have a hard time. Especially since he can only protect his ADC for 3 seconds early game. If Braum gets out of position, feel free to poke him. It doesn't matter if he can hit Stand Behind Me and get away because if he uses it, just move in on the ADC as soon as Braum isn't close enough to automatically shield.\n\nWhen Braum hits his Q, back away a little. If Lucian dashes to follow up, your ADC should give Lucian a little hell for targeting the support and not the ADC. If Braum hits his Q on the ADC, and someone with a dash follows up, make it clear to Braum that he doesn't have instant CC like you. If someone dashes to get those AAs in you should have a clear shot for a Zenith Blade, a Aqua Prison, a Dazzle, a Sona E Power Chord, a Dark Binding, etc. If Braum tries to come in AA range to do it, CC him, put some harass on the Braum while he's CCd because yes he's gonna blow Stand Behind Me if he needs to to get away, but he can't use the jump while he's CCd.\n\nBraum is also pretty mana hungry. If everytime you think Braum's W/E are up you hit just your Aqua Prison, or Just fake a Zenith Blade, and Braum blocks it he used at least 80 mana assuming he didn't also use his Q in retaliation (at which case he blew 135 mana) MANA\t235 (+45). Yes that's a decent amount of mana, but when every time you want to block something you're soaking up at least 80 mana, and when you're Q costs a good chunk of your mana as well, a Braum who is *constantly* trying to avoid his ADC taking damage, isn't going to have the mana to do anything. \n\nNot to mention that if Braum uses his W to position his shield, then he's not actually tanky after the shield ends early game because he hasn't built any tank. He's a pretty good target to harass a little at that point because he has no natural defenses.\n\nBraum also has trouble getting to you because unlike a lot of supports he doesn't have a reliable dash in or a speed up (other than his shield which means when he gets to you his ADC is very vulnerable). So if Braum is going to proc his relic shield, beat him up. If Braum is walking your way to AA you, beat him up. Early game he won't do shit, and if you zone him out early then he's not going to have the levels or the gold to be tanky later on in the laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-11T18:05:13.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are really good tips, thank you. I'll definitely try to adjust my playstyle in the future with that in mind.\n\nHowever, I have a few concerns:\n\n1) If you're Thresh and you QQ+Flay him, what stops him from autoattacking you once and then his ADC just wailing on you for at least 50% of your health before you can get away?\n\n2) If the Braum knows what he's doing, he's not going to be twitchy with the shield or jump. I don't think I can bait his shield as Leona even by diving the ADC. He's just gonna tag me with the passive, let the ADC wail on me for at least half my health, then if my ADC wails on his ADC, then two things happen: either my ADC pumps out so much damage that Braum disengages flawlessly (he's the best at disengaging and preventing damage while escaping) or Braum tags my ADC with the passive and his ADC picks up a double kill. I really don't feel I can do anything as Leona unless the Braum is actively worse than me (and I can't take that as a given).\n\n3) When you say that you retaliate instant CC against the Braum zoning, what happens if the Braum does this deliberately to bait your CC? He just puts you into a lose-lose situation. You let him zone you; or you waste cooldowns on him (cooldowns that can't be used on his ADC); or you stand your ground, save your cooldowns for when the ADC goes in, and then it becomes like situation 2).\n\n4) The good Braums I've seen are very conservative with their shield and jump, and don't use it on every bubble/etc (I've tried to pick up only mana pots as Nami and try to out-sustain Braum by relentlessly poking and bubbling, but good Braums just tank everything and save their mana and cds for all-ins). Even running poke-heavy comps like Karma/Caitlyn, we just can't pour out enough damage to force the Braum to back off or use his shield. And if we pour all our mana on him to get him to back off, that's a ton of cooldowns and mana we didn't use on his ADC. There's also the odious fact that Braum late game becomes amazing in teamfights while poke-champions like Karma struggle to stay relevant after the laning phase.\n\n5) I've tried the constant harass on Braum tactic, and good Braums don't actually care. They will walk up to you at level 2 and attempt to establish bush dominance and casually force an all-in because they know he and his ADC can win it, and if you don't all-in him or his ADC, he zones you with bush dominance. A half-health Braum is still a significant threat because all he needs is to tag you with the passive and it's a deathmark. If he dies but manages to tag you and your ADC with his passive, his ADC can easily pick up a double kill. And the really good Braums can do this and survive with just a tiny sliver of health.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-12T04:31:47.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to hit all of the main points you brought up and then the man below me added some really interesting things I'll follow up on too :)\n\n1) Don't QQ as Thresh if the ADC has a lot of health. You normally QQ when they have about 1/4 maybe 1/3rd. If you're past six you should be able to solo an adc at that point if you get behind Braum. an AA should be fully charged, your flay, and your box. If you get away with only half health, oh well because Braum can't 1v2 you at that point.\n\n2) If he's not gonna be twitchy with his shield/jump and he's not going to use it when you all in the adc, then all in the adc. If Braum is going to use it to disengage then after you W > E > Q as Leona let your ADC AA a few times as you back up. as long as you start walking away after you stun the enemy ADC, Braum's Q should stop slowing you as they get out of the stun and you should be positioned somewhere in the middle of the enemies and your ally, far enough away that in order for the enemy ADC yo half health you, your ADC is able to follow up.\n\n3) If you hard CC him it should be because he's out of position in order to zone you out and you should be able to get a good amount of damage off on him so that he backs up and *doesn't try to zone you out again*. It's a bait if you stun him and walk away. You win the trade if when you stun him you manage to land some good Tidecaller Blessing AA's on him, Ebb and Flow, and your Varus lands a strong Q on him before he can retreat. If you're a tank support and you realize that attempting to zone the enemy out loses you a lot of your health you're just going to sit by your ADC and not zone the enemies out until you want to actually go all in.\n\n4) I'd wildly disagree about what you said about Karma. I don't believe Braum beats her out of lane because she is the best tower pushing support in the game. I dare you to give Banner, Ohm, Ardent Karma a try. minions doing +15% damage while you give your whole team the Mantra Shield for free AS and you're able to deactivate their tower if you need to, that's nothing to be laughed at and there isn't a single support that can pull that off as well as Karma can. On the other hand if your Braum is super conservative with his shield/jump and he doesn't care about you poking him, why aren't you poking the adc? If he's using his W/E a lot that's when I'd poke Braum, if he refuses to use it that means his ADC isn't being protected and you can poke them down pretty easily.\n\n5) I play Braum, in fact Lulu, Leo, and Braum are my top 3 most played, Nami comes in forth so I really know what it's like playing as all the champions we've been talking about. And Braum can't set it up where if he dies his ADC can stack passives on both of you. 4 seconds between shots man. that ADC doesn't have over 1 AS early game, and if he's alternating shots you should have time to back up before he can completely stack them. If Braum goes into the bush, ward it. In fact instead of warding it, ward river and then tell your ADC to stand by river instead of the lane bushes. \n\n---\n\nI will definitely agree that Zilean is my favorite support against tank supports because Zilean's bombs still chunk half of their health.\n\nKarma, like I said earlier, actually does decent against someone like Braum. If someone tries to stack Braum's passive in a 2v2 lane, W them. It doesn't matter whose passive they're stacking but if they're in range to stack their passive they're in range to stay in W and at that point the stunned person should be able to disengage. If they're stacking Braum's passive, use the speed boost from your E to get away, or the slow from your Q (or both) Karma not only has good poke but she has great disengage as well. \n\nPersonally I don't play Zyra very well myself but someone like Zyra or Morg (or I guess Lux) should work really well in terms of lockdowns. One really annoying thing as Braum is that you can't use Stand Behind Me when locked down. Now I understand you can't dash, that's why it's a snare, but you also can't activate it on yourself to make you tanky.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-12T06:55:16.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, maybe I'm just really bad. I mean, I'm Bronze, so...\n\nOn the other hand, I feel that Braum+Lucian is a terrifying combination that completely wrecks me. It's just one auto from Braum, then Lucian dashes, gets two hits on you, and if you don't flash out, he gets one last autoattack and stuns you.\n\nI think you misunderstood me, though. I am fairly confident I can win lane against Braum with Karma (particularly if he does the zoning thing), but I feel that Karma just can't bring to a teamfight what Braum does. Karma is good at sieging towers and the build that you proposed sounds really good (I knew about Ardent Censer but I didn't think of Banner and Ohm), but I just feel that if the enemy team engages on you, you are kind of screwed. Braum may not be able to engage per se, but their jungler or top laner can (particularly if they're someone like Jax, Trynd, Gnar or Xin Zhao). And then when you fight back, Braum does a follow-up initiation with his ult and tagging people with his passive, plus his shield for good measure, and Karma just can't compete with that. By mid/late game, her Mantra+Q will only chunk the backline, which she can't reach because she's squishy and can't dive. If they dive her, she's forced to do a Mantra+E on her team and maybe W+Q whoever dives her ADC. That's about it. Braum can do so much more.\n\nAs for the \"can't pour out enough to faze Braum\" is more of a \"I need to spend way too much mana to get Braum to back off, in which case I get very little mana to do my job and harass the ADC.\" With Nami, I had to spend most of my mana (even with mana pots) just constantly Wing and Qing Braum to get him to stop zoning, and all that mana was mana not used on his ADC. And when I made the mistake of landing a bubble on his ADC and my ADC followed up on my W harass, Braum tagged us both with his passive and his ADC picked up a double kill (I popped immediately, my ADC shortly afterwards).\n\nI don't know, after that Lucian+Braum game, I am just completely terrified of Braum. He is to me what Teemo is to most of the playerbase. I feel that if I have to face him and he's good, there's nothing I can do and I might as well surrender at 20 because the game is effectively unwinnable.\n\nThanks for the reply though! I am just really disheartened after that game broke my 20-ranked-wins streak and I got crushed in such an absolutely relentless way.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-12T18:11:25.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't W Braum too much as Nami. Nami was my most played champ at the beginning of the season (and speaking of Bronze, we're playing at the same skill level here, so I kinda feel the people you're playing against) and I used to be like 'W is her most useful ability I'll max it first', but the more I started playing Nami the more I realized that Nami who either maxes or spams her heal, is the same Nami somebody inevitably (and it's almost always a Leona for god only know why) calls 'sushi' in all chat. Her W is a big mana drain, and it's not good early game while it's giving diminishing returns. If you're Nami and you want to poke somebody, you want to use your E. In fact you want to max your E first and if you realize when you E your ADC they're like 'Ima farm some minions' (because bronze lyfe) then just use your E on yourself to harass the enemies and save giving it to others for teamfights. It's an extra 75 damage on every AA (not including your AP scaling) when you max it out. Not only that but it's forcing you to get in your actual AD on that attack, so each one if like 130-140 or something damage plus a slow. Not only that but it's a lot more mana efficient saying at max rank her E costs 5 more mana than her first rank W. And if Braum backs off and the Lucian gets closer you're free to change targets (not only that but if you do manage to slap Luc with one of them, that slow makes for an easy bubble).\n\nRemember that Braum is zoning you through OP AAs, and that Nami has OP AAs. The difference is Braum is melee and Nami can throw her AAs from a distance.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-12T19:04:25.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh. I do max W first (I max E second though). Huh. That probably explains a lot.\n\nThank you, that was INCREDIBLY useful.\n\nI will still probably max W first on more passive lanes (like Sona/Soraka/Janna), because the early-level poke can actually chunk the ADC for quite a bit, and the range is a lot bigger than Nami's autoattacks, but I'll definitely max E first against tanky melee supports.\n\nThank you again!","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-09-12T21:40:07.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem. I used to always max W first myself so I know how tempting it is to do so. Nowadays I normally test the waters, give my ADC my E a few times and see if they use it and then see if I'm able to harass well when giving myself my E, and if I can use my Tidecaller's Blessing it's what I max first. If not I normally just max W/E at close to the same time. It means that I don't normally max one until level 10-12 but it means that I have good damage and good heals. Because you're right the W does have good early game poke (which is probably part of the reason it's so mana hungry)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"C13Magnum","date":"2014-09-12T00:00:37.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum, and disengage supports in general, or prone to sustain but especially to poke.  As Nami or Soraka, you don't have great poke, so you don't even really have to harass him or go for kills, stay back, avoid his q's and let the adc farm.  Lane goes even and you just decide the game in team fights.\n\nOne support I love running into him is Vel'koz.  Zyra is effective as well.  You sit back and spam your spells and slowly work his team to a significant health deficit that they can neither trade back nor heal from.  He can't engage on you without taking your full combos, which for Vel and Zyra is a LOT of damage that his shield doesn't do well blocking.\n\nHow I see support champs is that there are really 4 major utilities they supply: engage, disengage, sustain and poke.  And they are a bit of rock, paper, scissors.  Engage beats sustain, sustain beats poke, poke beats disengage and disengage beats engage.  Engage and poke can go even, and sustain and disengage can go even.  Supports typically specialize in one category, but sometimes can function in some of the other categories as well.\n\nWith Braum, if you can poke hard without them being able to trade back, you'll win lane easily.  ADC's like cait, kog and varus as well as supports like vel'koz, zyra, or, to a lesser extent, zilean, work well against braum.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-12T00:23:21.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh, it must be that I don't practise the right supports. I'm not that good at sustain supports (I like Nami for her CC mainly), and my other main support is Leona, which is as Engage as it gets. I feel Karma can reasonably out-poke Braum, but Karma is an excellent early-game bully and excels in 1v1 or 2v2 situations, whereas Braum is just all-around good at everything and will definitely outclass Karma in teamfights (unless you're running a very heavy poke/disengage comp with stuff like Lulu top, Ziggs mid, Cait ADC and Sejuani/Nautilus jungle).\n\nI don't have Zyra or Vel'koz, and I don't feel confident in my Zilean abilities to take him to ranked. I was thinking about picking up Thresh and start practising him, but Thresh is Engage/Disengage like Leona and Braum pretty much outclasses them in both areas. If I was better at Morgana, I'd take her, but alas I don't really \"get\" how to play her to her full potential (I am rather mediocre with her).\n\nI am also decent with Janna, but I feel that she's very disengage-y (like Braum) so we're both simply going to be biding our time in lane until someone engages, and then we see who has the better disengage (and yet Braum has a huge tankiness advantage over Janna that she can't overcome, because the \"shield yourself and trade\" strategy you are supposed to use with Janna is kind of dangerous when you're so squishy that a single Q or autoattack that Braum lands on you means certain death or at least a blown summoner), so I also feel the trade will go in Braum's favour again.\n\nI played Zyra when she was free and I was absolutely terrible at her.
