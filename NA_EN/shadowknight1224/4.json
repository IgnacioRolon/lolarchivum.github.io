Slows are usually a set of golden-orange diagonal lines, or ice-effects, which are immediately identifiable as slows. DoTs are usually green or red coloured (poison, blood or fire themed), and Grievous Wounds have the \"heart crossed by daggers\" symbol. Any form of heal is accompanied by a bright green glow or sparkles around the champion.\n\nI feel it upholds the Design Values(TM) of the game to create uniform, clear indications of armour/MR shred, which are often forms of \"invisible power\" that get severely underestimated (particularly by new players).\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"MASTERKEN94","date":"2014-08-16T06:03:27.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea a lot. I don't play MMO's as much as league but whenever I do I like the options it has where you can choose what battle texts' will pop up as I like to have it all turned on. I just think that the more info I get to see that catches my eyes by floating up on the screen the better. And they could easily implement it by adding another small bar like whenever you are cc'ed. They could use the symbols for the armor and mr and just have it like cracked showing that \"Hey you're armor or MR has been reduced by some form of shred and this is how long you'll be missing it so be careful in this fight.\" Going on this thought riot said that with the implementation of jungle timers they wanted to give us information that is already there so I don't see how this could be anything but that!","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-16T07:16:58.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure numbers are the right idea (cluttered interface, and if you try to distinguish the number by colours, you make things difficult for colourblind people), but some unique effect (such as a dark purple aura for MR shred and a ring of cracked steel slivers for armour shred) would be ideal for this.","replies":[{"poster":"MASTERKEN94","date":"2014-08-16T07:31:21.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah numbers aren't what I would want either in league. In WoW it works but yeah colorblind people wouldn't like it but its more about having the info there like where I said have a bar pop up under your health bar like when you're stunned or slowed and I'm sure they could make particles to help even more such as dark purple aura or cracked steel.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-16T08:39:54.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, perhaps an indicator similar to how CC works would be a good idea. After all, resistance shred is a type of debuff, just like cc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-08-16T20:07:20.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally: I think this suggestion is awesome! A bar has some of the best clarity on *how much* of your resistances are shredded. I'm a little concerned about how quickly you'd be able to figure out what was happening to you, though. Maybe a bar and some other indicator, too (the indicator is a particle effect that is basically to tell you, \"are you taking increased damage?\").","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shivarus","date":"2014-08-16T18:32:50.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The heart crossed by daggers symbol indicates grievous wounds, not DoT","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-16T18:40:42.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oops, fixed!
