You probably don't remember me, it was back in the day of the old DotA forums (I was the Forum Leader of the Fan Fiction section). It was such a surprise to see you in the red tracker here! How are you doing these days? I vaguely remember you were doing badass things in the Nevada desert like... 7 years ago? Man, it seems like it was both really recent and a long time ago at the same time. How is Naz doing? He was such a cool guy. Man, I wish I remembered the names of the other admins, but Naz was the guy I went the most to. I remember assassin, Trystero, Valorian... augh, I wish I could remember the name of the Serbian guy who was in charge of Suggestions. He was friends with another Forum Leader whose name also escapes me and they did a lot of funny stuff together.\n\nI do remember my Fan Fiction staff, though. Inferno DK and Col.Sharpeye were really cool people and we got Fan Fiction from an abandoned ghost town to a semi-thriving place for creativity. Man, those were the days. I still remember that one piece of fanfiction that inspired me to apply myself fully towards my writing.\n\nSorry for the trip down Memory Lane, I'll stop babbling like an old man about the old days now, heh.","replies":[]}
