Here's the thread where I list songs that I rewrite in order to make them League-themed. I'll include youtube videos of the originals in case I pick something that you aren't familiar with. Without further delay, let's have at it.\n\n*-*\n\n#Hit Me With A Skillshot\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=serV18MirGg\n\nWell you’re a real tough cookie with a long history\nOf owning bot lanes like the one in here.\nThat’s OK, let’s see how you do it,\nReady up your jukes,\nLet’s get down to it.\n\n[Chorus:]\nHit me with a skillshot,\nWhy don’t you hit me with a skillshot.\nHit me with a skillshot,\nFire away!\n\nYou come with Mystic Shot,\nYou don’t fight fair.\nThat’s OK, see if I care!\nBlow your mana, it’s all in vain,\nI’ll Relic Shield to full health again!\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWell you’re the real tough cookie with the long history\nOf owning bot lanes like the one in here.\nRight when I hit your cute face with my Zenith Blade,\nYou'll wish you'd saved mana to Arcane Shift away.\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n*-*\n\n#Pulling With A Blitz\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfOOEmI7urA\n\nHave you seen that ball and chain, walking up the bottom lane?\nOn that famous thoroughfare, with its sensors in the air?\nSteam pipes and metal plating, quick snipes that are quite grating.\nTaking every stab at a wonderful grab!\n\nIf you’re pulled and you don’t know what to do,\nWhy don’t you panic or throw ‘em fits,\nPulling with a Blitz!\n\nOverdrive and chases you, can’t escape,\nA grab is overdue, call it quits.\nPulling with a Blitz!\n\nWalking with a golden arcane golem,\nTrying to get a killing spree rolling (some kills stolen!).\n\nCome, let’s mix, where ADCs walk with tricks,\nUp their sleeves and greedy mitts.\nPulling with a Blitz!\n\n*-*\n\n#Baron Buff\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIWF6U9hIho\n\nEnemy jungler got a hold on my laners,\nSince he come around they ain’t been the same,\nOoh, he’d look at them with his blindfolded eyes,\nHe’d all-chat things that’d make a grown man cry.\n\nEnemy jungler took the buffs from my jungle,\nGame’s been a train wreck since the pre-game lobby.\nOoh, he’s making plays and securing kills.\nNow all my team does is curse at the enemy jungler.\n\nWe just keep falling for his tricks,\nHe’s got us spinning with his murdering kicks.\nHe’s jumping in and ward-hopping out,\nWe miss skillshots as he jumps about.\n\nHe got the lizard buff that everybody wants. [x4]\n\nEnemy jungler came alone into our ground.\nHe got all my team to follow him ‘round.\nOoh, he got a triple kill hiding in the bush,\nThen he disappeared while I split-pushed.\n\nWe just keep falling for his tricks,\nHe’s got us spinning with his murdering kicks.\nLate in the game, when no one’s around,\nI got a plan to take that jungler down.\n\nHe got the golem buff that everybody wants. [x4]\n\nI stole his blue and two of his wolves,\nI got the drag and then hashtag-YOLO’d.\nI swept in to smite all his buffs,\nThen I stole baron ‘cause I’ve had enough.\n\nNow I,\n\nI got the baron buff that everybody wants. [x4]\n\nI got the baron buff… [x4]\n\nI got the baron buff that everybody wants.\n\n*-*\n\n#When You're Good To Karma\n\nBased on [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/L8kjpUb7-questions-about-karma-skinstheme-riot?comment=00000001) post.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoDS1lWdpjw\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen!\nThe Enlightened One!
