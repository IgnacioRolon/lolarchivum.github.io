That is fine. However, making her damage-based or aggressive makes no sense with the rest of her kit and playstyle. Instead, I have a better suggestion:\n\nIn order for this to make sense, we need to adjust her baseline E:\n\nSHIELD STRENGTH: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 70% AP) to: **40/60/80/100/120 (+ 40% AP).**\nBONUS AD: 10 / 17.5 / 25 / 32.5 / 40 (+ 10% AP) to: **4/8/12/16/20 (+ 5% AP).**\n\nAnd we need to beef up her passive:\n\nPASSIVE: Janna gains 8% bonus movespeed at all times.\n\nSo the changes to her W:\n\nNEW PASSIVE: Using similar technology used for Zyra&#039;s plants, Zephyr spawns an air elemental on the ground within 1000 units of Janna, in a random location towards the nearest visible enemy champion. The elemental lasts for 5 seconds. If Janna picks up Zephyr, she becomes empowered for 1 second, greatly benefiting the next spell she casts during that time:\n\nQ: Increases knock up duration by 0.5 seconds.\nE: Doubles shield amount (before +shields/+heals) and AD granted.\nR: Enemies knocked away are slowed by 50% for 1 second (the slow decays over the duration).\n\nCooldown: 7/6/5/4/3 seconds.\n\nNEW ACTIVE: Janna forces her air elemental to spawn, allowing her to &quot;cheat&quot; her passive&#039;s cooldown or forcing a repositioning if the elemental is in a disadvantageous location.\nCOST: 50 mana.\nCOOLDOWN: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds.\n\n*This allows Janna to expose herself to enemy retaliation in order to get the full value of her spells, but with her bonus movespeed and preference towards movespeed items, she can dart in and out of the fight to pick up Zephyr and gain her empowered cast.*\n\n*What's more important, it doesn't force her to be aggressive or deal damage, while still exposing her to retaliation by the enemy and making her work for her shield and peel.*","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-09-14T16:28:33.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if balancing her interaction on RNG is a good idea.

The extra CC is a way to tempt Janna to use her Zephyr empowered cast on something other than the shield, thereby overall nerfing her shield through the course of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2017-09-14T17:07:06.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody will EVER use anything besides the empowered shield. I don't think you realize how stupid doubling the shielding and AD is when it's already extremely high. can you imagine someone getting _~100_ AD and roughly 600 shielding from some guy pressing E?\n\nthe q's knockup is not reliable enough and the R's slow is laughable at best. unless you are a janna main i can't see how you can justify that lol","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2017-09-14T17:10:44.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must have missed the part where I halve the shield and AD values for her normal E. Empowering her shield brings her to the values she has on live, and forced her to expose herself to enemy retaliation. So it's a straight up nerf + vulnerability.","replies":[{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2017-09-14T18:18:24.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you are missing my point although i don't think i made it very clear. nerfing janna's shield will make her useless as her other abilities don't really matter that much. so they are nerfing janna's shield and having a tradeoff for that by making it so that she is more than just a shield bot.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2017-09-14T18:25:14.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I will take a half strength shield that has the potential of being full strength over the current changes that absolutely cripple her laning phase.\n\nAdding a bit more CC to her kit and encouraging her to move around the fight helps her be more than a shield bot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
