It would foster the exact kind of teamwork and cooperation Kalista's soul-bond mechanic is meant to evoke!","replies":[{"poster":"Shikatsuyatsuke","date":"2014-11-07T02:05:40.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnvyDragon","date":"2014-11-04T21:50:27.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I'm just satisfied with the idea of being able to fire an ULTIMATE LISSACANNON ICENUKE.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-11-04T22:42:48.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I agree, that's an amazing combo, but imagine how it would be if Lissandra and Kalista could outplay/stall the enemy team by alternating ults on each other to keep the other away from harm while Liss cc's them and Kalista kites them to death?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rustling Bush","date":"2014-11-04T22:45:34.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would perfer an ap malphite ult into her ult, that shit would be scary af. think about it, well from what i've seen from the video, her ult doesn't do any damage or does very little damage.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-11-04T23:01:13.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does have a tiny knock-up, which can trigger a Yasuo ult.
