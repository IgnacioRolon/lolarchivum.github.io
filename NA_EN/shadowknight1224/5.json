I'm not sure if sexualizing an splash art just because is the way to go, my guess is no since the splash art is supposed to showcase the champion itself, sometimes champions have big boobs and those happen to appear in the splash art but also sometimes the pose will conceal said boobs, eg: Sona who had one of the worst splash art showing nothing but cleavage and now her splash have her in a more subtle pose.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that instead of trying to sexualize men, the logical answer would be to de-sexualize women and instead make them fulfill their role/fantasy in their splash arts as well as in game. Can we have accidental sexy elements in both cases? yes please! and here is where I agree with you, a little more ass never hurt anyone but lets think a little bit:\n\n-Who does Lee Sin resemble in popular culture? my guess goes to Bruce Lee and the likes, sadly, these men had no booty to shake, but they neither had big burly upper bodies so there's kind of a disconnection in there.\n\n-Hows Lee Sin in-game? well, he certainly have always had these pants so it's nothing new, they do conceal the little booty he has but to be honest you can still see some of it. Riot can't suddenly decide he's wearing spandex when he has a certain shape in-game.\n\nSo I think this explains why I understand the current low sexiness of this splash art. With that out of the way, I must say **I do not like this splash art**, the drawing technique itself is alright, the pose however is just bad, he looks like a looney tunes character, almost funny, there's no tension in his lower body whatsoever and in order to break one of those things one would think you need to have a lot of strength applied to your legs, welp I guess Lee can just stumble onto things and they'll break. He's a disciplined monk he's not some rookie who's learning how to kick things, attention to body motion is important, especially in fighting monks, this monk is sloppy all over the place, his hands are flailing, his other leg is dead behind and his kicking leg is not even straight, where's the discipline Lee Sin shows in-game?    \n\nAnd of course there's the face, a HUGE change from current lee sin ({{champion:64}} for reference) who happened to be a man with Chinese features, small nose, small lips, some facial hair, square-ish chin and rugged but not stupidly manly head, all in all great features that happen to feel somewhat Chinese (let's be real they have very specific ways when it comes to manliness) pretty much like what Yasuo has going for him, though in a different way. Now, Lee Sin is... Taric, or Wesley Snipes ._. big nose, big lips, weird and overtly big bone structure... wth?\n\nSomeone posted below the splash art with his mouth opened and I must say it looks way better mostly because it adds emotion to the whole piece, gets rid of the awful huge lips and makes the nose look smaller -.- not to mention it gives a dynamic motion to the whole body, as if he was trying to kick something!!!!\n\nSorry for the huge text wall X_X","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-10-01T17:45:44.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really think that de-sexualising the female characters is a thing that is ever going to happen, so what I'd like would be some equality.

It's not sexy when presented alone and unadorned, but shirtlessness CAN be made sexy under the right conditions (right pose, right lighting, maybe throw in some water dripping down the muscles). The V-shaped muscles on a dude's hips are definitely sexy and it'd be awesome to have more of that (I think Varus and maybe Brand have a little bit of that going on).\n\nWell, Pantheon is a great example of a dead-serious dude who can dress as skimpy as he wants and you will still respect him, given that his mechanics are beast, his voice acting is excellent and his overall look is rather fearsome. Similarly, you can probably put Tryndamere in a tiny loincloth and he would still be scary as hell, given that he's a rage-fueled barbarian that will dive you under tower, kill you and then walk out.\n\nMy beef with Zyra is that if she's a plant possessing a human, she can either be like \"clothes? what are clothes?\" and just cover herself entirely in bark/leaves (since she is, you know, a plant, and plants are very keen on protecting their soft, vulnerable interiors), or she can go \"yes, humans do this thing called clothing\" and *dress properly* (The way that Brand, an elemental entity of fire, kept pants on the guy he possessed). What she does is this half-way thing that makes no sense whatsoever. Also, according to Elise's backstory, she is the leader of a cult, which means her way to lure people is more related to her voice and charisma than her looks. This same beef I have with LeBlanc. She's a powerful assassin-mage, the timeless leader of a secret society. Why is she dressed like a stripper.\n\nAhri is the only one that fits, yes, and I'm miffed we don't have a charm-based male champion to balance the scales. Would it be *that* hard to just pull a random Noxian and make him basically like pre-transformation Cassiopea? Some hot dude that ferrets out secrets and manipulates people with his looks and charm, it can't be that hard to come up with a kit based on that (especially since the Charmed condition is pretty much unused).\n\nAlso sorry I gave the wrong impression, but I'm a dude as well. I consider myself bi, though I lean heavily towards guys (which is why this topic interests me so!). It's honestly not that hard to make tasteful sexy dudes. It's really, really not. Some people like to blow it out proportion in order to have an easy excuse not to do it, but it really all basically boils down to \"use the same thought processes you use on the women, but on the men instead\". I will say that Evelynn is rather tasteless even for her character concept, but if you take Ahri instead, you can see that effort was made into keeping her alluring but still tasteful.\n\nYou can easily make pre-existing character sexier by just making small adjustments. Put Tryndamere in a fur loincloth. Cut some windows in Pantheon's chestplate to show off his muscles. Remove that thing Varus has across his chest. Remove the leather that Draven has under the V-neck and let his abs shine. Give Aatrox some clothes around his waist (loincloth, codpiece, torn pants, whatever) so that he's not a sexless creature. Make Yasuo's half-cloak thing smaller so that we can actually see more of his chest.\n\nBasically, the key is to A) show more skin, B) make that skin alluring. A is super easy to do and requires no explanation, but B is all about how you frame that skin that's showing. If female characters have to endure useless armour that offers little to no protection (like Irelia's chestplate, which leaves her upper chest completely exposed), so should dudes. Some dudes should have sensible armour, like Leona and Diana do, but there should definitely be dudes with horribly impractical armour to balance out the scales.\n\nFor example, this is a fanmade skin for Garen:\n\nhttp://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/178/3/4/league_of_legends_garen_skin_texture_adonis_by_haruhi81-d6axo7s.png\n\nSorry for the wall of text.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-10-01T19:32:45.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to write it! it's enlightening and refreshing at the same time especially because you're a dude but the post remains objective!\n\nThe visual example is great as well and illustrates the point at lot.

Now what we can see IS pretty, but the pose and the image angle make it so that his main asset (shirtlessness) is as obscured as possible.\n* In case anybody likes the sight of strong bare arms, his right arm is almost completely covered by his body, and his left arm is obscured by shadows (which stems from image angle and the position of the image's light source, both of which are decisions made by the artist).\n* His pants are designed to be as unsexy as possible. Not only are they loose and conceal any muscles or curves his legs/ass may have, they are also of a dark, solid colour that helps shadows obscure his form.\n* As I mentioned before, there is a deliberate choice to shadow his ass as much as possible.\n* Lee Sin's only selling point in this image, other than the 1/4 of chest we can see, is his face, and Lee Sin in particular cannot rely on his face to sell a picture, given that his blindfold is enormous and easily covers half his face, he doesn't have a very pleasant hairstyle, and his mouth/jaw/cheeks are rather generic. I could let the hairstyle and the generic jaw/cheeks/mouth slide, but eyes and facial expression are hugely important if you want a person to sell attractiveness based on his face. Thanks to the blindfold, this is impossible for Lee Sin.\n\nIn short, this depiction of Lee Sin seems to take whatever might make him attractive and deliberately obscure/conceal it as much as possible.\n\nEDIT: My last point about Lee Sin's face is not that anything about his face should be changed, but that the artist shouldn't rely on Lee Sin's face to be his main source of attractiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-10-01T04:47:17.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry bro, Lee Sin isn't sexy.
