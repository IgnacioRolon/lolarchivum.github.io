This line follows the aesthetics of courtly intrigue and the danger that lurks in a city.\n\n**Tier 1:** Courtier's Crossbow.\n\n*Cost:* 365 gold.\n\n*Benefits:* \n+5 Attack Damage.\nUNIQUE PASSIVE - OPPORTUNITY: Your next damaging ability or autoattack against a champion will grant 8 gold provided there is an allied champion within 1000 units of you. You generate one charge of Opportunity every 10 seconds, storing up to 5. Killing a minion disables this passive (and the charge generation) for 12 seconds.\nYou may only be in possession of 1 Gold Income item.\n\n*Gold Efficiency:* 49.315%\n\n**Tier 2:** Arbalest.\n\n*Cost:* 865 gold.\n*Builds From:* Courtier's Crossbow.\n\n*Benefits:*\n+15 Attack Damage.\n+5% Cooldown Reduction.\nUNIQUE PASSIVE - OPPORTUNITY: Your next damaging ability or autoattack against a champion will grant 12 gold provided there is an allied champion within 1000 units of you. You generate one charge of Opportunity every 10 seconds, storing up to 5. Killing a minion disables this passive (and the charge generation) for 12 seconds.\nYou may only be in possession of 1 Gold Income item.\n\n*Gold Efficiency:* 80.73%\n\n**Tier 3:** Spymaster's Tutelage.\n\n*Cost:* 2200 gold.\n*Builds From:* Arbalest + Long Sword + Long Sword.\n\n*Benefits:*\n+50 Attack Damage.\n+10% Cooldown Reduction.\nUNIQUE PASSIVE - OPPORTUNITY: Your next damaging ability or autoattack against a champion will grant 12 gold provided there is an allied champion within 1000 units of you. You generate one charge of Opportunity every 10 seconds, storing up to 5.\nYou may only be in possession of 1 Gold Income item.\nUNIQUE ACTIVE - BOLT OF DARKNESS: Fire a bolt of shadows that detonates at target location. Enemies caught in the area are blinded for 1 second, and their armour is reduced by 20%. The armour reduction effect decays over 2 seconds. 60 seconds cooldown (850 range, 250 radius).\n\n*Gold Efficiency:* 96.21%.\n\n-*-\n\nPotential champions who may use this item: Ashe, Ezreal, Caitlyn, Jinx, Pantheon, Xin Zhao, Jarvan IV, Gnar, Lee Sin, Aatrox, AD Blitzcrank, Vi, Riven, Poppy, Jax.\n\n-*-\n\n*Rationale:* This item is inspired by the Frost Queen's Claim line. The passive was lifted from Spellthief's Edge with a few modifications:\n\n* It does not grant passive gold, so the gold per proc needs to be higher. This means that AD supports need to be aggressive in order to earn gold, which allows opponents the opportunity to counterplay and turn a trade around.\n* It does not add increased damage per proc, given that AD champions often do well enough damage on their own.\n* It does not proc off structures, since AD champions have an easier time taking down towers than their AP equvalents, and therefore need no further encouragement to do so. This is also why I took the number of charges from 3 to 5.\n* It requires an allied champion within 1000 units in order to discourage mid-game split-pushing (which AD champions are rather good at).\n\nThe stats given are geared towards maximising the damage output of the AD support, and the active is particularly good on auto-attack heavy teams but works adequately to give ADCs a boost regardless of team composition.\n\nAddition: It's been raised as a concern that the visuals on armour shred may be unclear. The way I envision the active on this item is a lance of thick shadow that explodes into a smokescreen-like burst of darkness. The smokescreen lasts for 1 second (the same duration as the blind). The armour shred could be represented as tendrils of shadow clinging to the champions affected. The full armour shred would be represented as a thick shroud that slowly fades away until it disappears entirely. Further discussion on the visual clarity of resistance shreds can be found [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay/I6NAkeor-visual-clarity-resistance-shred).\n\n-*-\n\nComments and criticism welcome!\n\nEDIT: POST OF THE DAY???

In my experience, Zeke's and FQC are main items (esp on Ashe support!), but I feel the stats on FQC is wasted on a lot of AD supports (Darius, Blitz, Thresh, Pantheon, J4, etc).\n\nThat said, the attack speed active is a little lackluster for me. Given FQC has one of my favorite actives in the game, I'd love to see a new thing created for AD supps--maybe upon activation, Courtier's increases attack speed and stuns the first target attacked (for a short duration, like .5 sec) by each ally within range of Courtier's active.  Something nifty like that to help you use that darn attack speed! \n\nThough I am hesitant to use something like atkspd on an active like that since typically support item actives are useful for teamfighting and laning, not taking towers/objectives, which atkspd would be super useful for.  Perhaps the stun and maybe a burning shield or maybe movespeed stealing?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-14T22:48:18.058+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply!\n\nI have to agree that the active is rather lackluster (FQC's active is one of my faves as well), but I was trying to go for practical over elaborate.\n\nWhat would you think of this:\n\n\"UNIQUE ACTIVE - BOLT OF DARKNESS: Fire a bolt of shadows that detonates at target location.

You don't use it when the enemy is coming in or running away, you use it when the enemy is already committed to a fight, when the enemy is at its peak of power, and you can reduce it or nullify it. Like I said before, if you want a chasing item, Frost Queen's Claim or Talisman is more your thing. Much like Face of the Mountain, this item is for the thick of a fight, when your ADC is *already* autoattacking the enemy, and you need to swing that trade in your ADC's favour (ideally, you want to apply Black Cleaver stacks first and *then* this item, in order to maximise your ADC's damage on them).\n\nAs for the snare, I am loath to apply any form of movement cc on this item (not to mention that roots and snares can interrupt dashes, blinks and jumps in mid-casting), given that I want Frost Queen's Claim to remain useful in its own way, so that each support item has its own specialty.

I count melee AD carries as AD supports for the purposes of this item, so everything I said stands for them as well. If you're worried that solo laners are going to buy this item for the two second blind, well... the item is never fully gold efficient, and the first two tiers are absolutely awful gold-wise (not to mention their gold-giving passive flat out does not work in a solo lane). If a solo laner is willing to sink 2.2K gold for +50 AD, 10% cooldown reduction and a 2 sec blind and armour reduction on a skill shot that they can miss... well, let me just say that there are better itemisation choices. Last Whisper and Black Cleaver ignore a higher percentage of armour than this, and the blind is not terribly powerful for its cost, particularly when you can still be destroyed by abilities.\n\nAt the end of the day, I don't worry overmuch. Blind is one of the softest forms of CC, and for the price you're paying here, plus the need to aim the skillshot, it becomes a very gimmicky build in the hands of an AD solo laner. Once the opponent is aware of what you're trying to do, they can easily bait the item's active and then kill you in the 60 second cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Wicked Shiv","date":"2014-08-15T03:27:04.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's most effective on AD Supports but not limited to them.

Zeke's + Talisman (or other support item) + 10% CDR from masteries means ECA is up so often, it's hilarious (I also stole dragon with it XD). I think Talisman works well since the combination of Volley + Talisman means your whole team can kite/engage rather easily.

I think crossbow would have higher gold generation, so a bit of mana regen would be easy to pick up too (I imagine Tear would be the best pick up here, since you can build into Manamune if it gets to late game. I don't think I'd get Mikael's since I would be overcapping on CDR with Crossbow, Zeke's, and masteries). Having combat stats on a support item too would allow you to put off zeke's for damage a bit too. I think crossbow would be, in most cases, the better option; boots of mobility would probably be more than enough to get around quickly, not to mention Zeal is a good intermediate item on Ashe (for the attack speed and crit chance).\n\nWhat I just realized, and I like a lot, is that with the new AP top lane meta (Maokai/Gragas/Nidalee still does magic damage with her spells/Lulu, etc.), there's more room for AD champions in a team composition; since we already have champions like Zyra and Annie in support that provide a ton of magic damage, now you can have a legitimate AD threat as a support with Ashe/Gangplank/Poppy/other AD supports (the pool will really open up now that there's a legitimate option for AD supports).","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-15T06:33:03.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mana problem could be easily fixed with a Frozen Heart (which also gives you armour and cooldown reduction, though you might be overcapping the CDR with masteries).\n\nThat's the idea!

I think Tear would be more than enough, actually preferable since it is cheap and gives her a good amount of regen plus extra mana as the game progresses (and she can stack it pretty quick with her Q). I would probably just leave it at Tear until late game, since I'd want to prioritize attack speed and crit chance next on Ashe, but Manamune theoretically doesn't seem like a bad item on support Ashe (or you can build Archangel's for stronger ECAs, or sell it for another regen item for even more AP).\n\nNot to mention Ryze and Mundo deal a lot of magic damage :D\n\nJust wondering, have you thought of adding a passive gold generation to Crossbow like the Spellthief line has? I'm just thinking; most supports who take FQC are ranged; I guess you could argue that melee supports will want Targon's anyways, but if a melee support has good early game damage, say Pantheon, and would rather build damage (since he already has his passive to mitigate a lot of damage), it would be difficult for them to use the stacks since they're inherently zoned due to the lack of range. Maybe if you lower the gold generation on proc and add some GP10? Just so it's a little more forgiving if you're completely zoned and can't proc the stacks.

You can do similar if not greater burst damage with a Volley + Crit, plus you have greater sustained poke with your autos. Your ult too is fairly similar to Sona's, as a fairly large AoE CC, but it's also global compared to the relatively short range of Sona's ult. Hawkshot is basically blue trinket; you basically have two trinkets, which is freaking awesome.\n\nIt's hard to say about the Manamune build; I was only suggesting Tear as a replacement for the mana regen on Talisman. I would probably only build Manamune if Crossbow was implemented in the game, and as a later/last item if that (I would try to get Tear as soon as I thought I needed mana, but leave it at that till later).

Blinding full-on AD casters like Pantheon is useless, and tanky ADs can just weather it.\n\nAs I explained to another poster: the armour shred is deceptive. Enemies not stacking armour will get a 5-8 armour reduction (practically meaningless late game), and while it does have an optimal effect on enemies who ARE stacking armour, it's a decaying effect. This item doesn't perform well in solo trades, the math just doesn't back up those fears.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2014-08-12T23:48:07.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My suggestions:\n\n- Going from Arbalest to Tutelage, no change in gold generation.\n  - Keep the item in line with other support items\n- Remove the lifesteal\n  - A support isn't going to deal enough damage to get much from lifesteal, anyway.\n  - If you want to add on sustain, give it life on-hit (old doran's passive)\n  - If you want to give it more poke, just increase the AD (and build out of a Pickaxe)\n- Remove the lifesteal from the active\n  - It's largely invisible power; it won't feel as good to use, and your allies won't notice how much it's helping them\n  - Instead, just increase the AS boost, or give all nearby allies some on-hit damage (like a sona Q aura).","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-13T00:16:47.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* There is no change in gold generation between Arbalest and Tutelage.

Whether they have good bases or cc, they need to get in the enemy's face to use it, and they're not going to make it there without some tankiness. Plus, they get the execute on Relic Shield, which also gives them sustain, so they'd rather use that.\n\n>#Ranged\n\nThe issue here is that all ranged AD's scale really well, because of the way that AD scaling works (multiplicative with AD/AS/Crit). So they suffer from \"the lulu issue.\" If you give them good enough cc and/or bases to be useful in a duo lane, without farm, they just go to a solo lane, bully the crap out of the other laner, and then scale super well, too. So these champs don't really need an AD support item, because they'd rather be farming.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"runesage86","date":"2014-11-20T18:09:30.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this, even if I don't play Ad supports.\nOne thing to ask. Could Brutalizer fit in somehow? It would make sense, more CDR, and the Pen from the bolt of shadows. I get that that would make the cost really high. However, you're getting 8 gold an auto. Tis alot. You'd get a ton of gold early, which would help. However, this item has absolutely NO regen at all. None. If you're an AD support, and you buy this item, you're going to be poking a ton. Most AD supports are melee, so you'll be taking a lot of harass while trying to get close enough to hit. Maybe add a little lifesteal 2nd level instead of CDR?

Black Cleaver is soo good.\nI also get the reason for no lifesteal. Every support has to make that choice. Utility? Tank? Poke? \nHowever, Spelltheif's edge does have a sustain. Mana regen, which is great because you're using your abilities to get it. Also, on hit, spellthiefs restores mana.\nIf you're getting CDR on the second level, shouldn't you be getting a little mana back? Or if you changed the CDR to something like, i don't know, Movespeed? Something like a Essence Reaver but massively toned down? Extra crit damage? I'm just spouting nonsens, but more CDR with no mana regen seems like a bad idea. \n\nPlease comment.

The items all sound like they could be linked to Noxus as a premier weapon for their soldiers, but a place like **Noxus**, which has a lot of stabbing people in the back as everyone wants power doesn't really promote the idea of an **alliance**, especially when the item becomes the **Spymaster's Tutelage**.\n\nEverything else is sound, but I'd say that the passive **\"Alliance\"** should be re-named to something more fitting, perhaps something like **\"Shot from the Dark\"**, to imply your support is kinda sneaking about, getting ready to strike, and to also to make the \"Bolt of Darkness\" tie in a bit better.\n\nThat's just my opinion, and people may just thinking I'm talking out of my arse, but regardless the idea behind the items is solid and I think the Courtier's bow line definetly could have a place in League!","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-20T23:11:37.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the awesome reply! I love fluff and lore myself, so this is a really exciting comment.\n\nThe reason I named it alliance was to reference the fact that it's a support item, that it requires to be near an allied champion, and to evoke the theme of shadowy confabulations behind locked doors. The idea was to evoke a sense of city intrigue and \"supportiness\", so I felt alliance was a way to convey that. The feeling I wanted to evoke was that you were a courtier/spymaster sniping people from afar (or weaving in and out of the ~~shadows~~ tall brush as you harry your enemies).\n\nI guess that the idea is to emphasise that even shady people are capable of profound loyalty. The idea is that you, the AD support, are the Spymaster, and you become the tutor to your ADC, tending him like a flower in a garden, pruning the weeds and tearing out the insects that wish to devour him, so that he may bloom into a late-game carry. You are the wise mentor, taking out threats and keeping them off your charge, so that he may grow strong under your, well, tutelage. :D\n\nDoes that make the term Alliance make more sense?

From this, I'd say that even though Alliance is a decent name (not discrediting your naming here), but the name could fit more towards the theme inherent with the Spymaster's Tutelage; a name that would relate towards the support being the guy watching over their carry, coming to help when necessary/when an opportunity rises. \n\nHere's a name for ya, might not be any good, but lets see: **Opportunity/Opportunistic**\n\nThat implies to the nature of being a Spymaster, while still going along with the theme of the whole item line; when there's an ally nearby, you wait for an opportune moment and then strike, taking advantage of the enemy's focus on your carry, allowing you a sneaky shot in. \n\nTo re-iterate, the whole item line is absolutely fine and what I'm suggesting is basically me nit-picking because I'm a guy who's all about the little things, so what I'm saying might just be a load of bollocks!
