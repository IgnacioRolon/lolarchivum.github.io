She's a very skill-based champion that becomes overwhelming when ahead and completely useless when behind, the definition of a feast or famine champion. AD assassins, even when behind, can still help secure objectives or soften up targets for their ADC with Black Cleaver. AP assassins tend to be more hit-or-miss, but I feel LeBlanc is on a particularly difficult place at the moment.\n\nSo here's a proposal to make LeBlanc more skill-based, highlight her theme of deception and misdirection, and give her more opportunities for her enemies to counterplay and for her to aid her team even if she's behind.\n\nI'll be listing the changes as though they were patch notes, for clarity's sake.\n\n*-*\n\n**Q: Sigil of Malice**\n\nNEW: Removed.\n\n*I feel the current iteration of LeBlanc's Q offers no counterplay. It's not a skillshot like her E, and it's her main source of nuke damage, which often comes for free as she needs only to get in range before she can pop it. Furthermore, it's not really fitting with her theme and it's frankly boring to execute or play against. I decided to rework this ability completely.*\n\n**Passive: Mirror Image**\n\nNEW: Removed.\n\n*Given that I wanted to emphasise LeBlanc's deception theme, I decided to turn her passive into her Q and give her more control over it.*\n\n*-*\n\n#Passive: Gift of the Black Rose\n\n*Effect:* LeBlanc becomes stealthed for 3/3.5/4 seconds (at level 1/7/13) when she reaches 30% health. Autoattacking or casting an ability breaks the stealth. When LeBlanc breaks the stealth (or it runs out), she gains bonus magic penetration equal to 5% of her AP for 2 seconds. This passive has a 60 second cooldown.\n\n*This ability retains LeBlanc's defensive/slippery passive, but it also gives LeBlanc a temptation to go back into the fray at low health. The bonus magic penetration can help her secure a kill, and the surprise effect from her stealth can be the edge she needs to take out an enemy. This passive can be used for running away, yes, but it's optimally used to execute high-risk/high-reward, exciting plays, which is gratifying for both the LeBlanc player and her enemy, as a low-health LeBlanc is quite easy to kill, and anticipating her greediness can be very rewarding.*\n\n*-*\n\n#Q: Mirror Image\n\n*Casting:* Activated ability.\n*Range:* Self.\n*Cost:* 60/70/80/90/100 Mana.\n*Duration:* 4/5/6/7/8 seconds.\n*Cooldown:* 15 seconds.\n*Effect:* LeBlanc becomes stealthed for 1 second and summons a clone of herself with her same current amount of health and identical statistics. Her clone is controllable by holding the ALT key and casts Distortion, Ethereal Chains and their mimicked versions in the same direction as the mouse cursor, but deals no autoattack damage. The clone casts her spells at the same time the original LeBlanc does (it is not possible for LeBlanc to cast a spell without her clone doing so at the same time). Dealing the killing blow to the clone deals 60/80/100/120/140 (+80% AP) magic damage to the killer (unless it is a tower). Casting a mimicked version of Mirror Image instantly kills the old clone. The clone instantly returns to LeBlanc if commanded to move further than 500 units.\n\n*Turning LeBlanc's passive into a more active part of her kit helps emphasise her trickster nature and allows her to make plays with her other abilities. Given the damage inflicted to enemies who kill the clone, a LeBlanc player can use this ability to establish lane dominance and bullying, and later on, to fake out enemies (if she always sends the clone first to zone/harass enemies, she can later go first herself to take advantage of her enemies' trained behaviour of not attacking the clone).*\n\n*The short leash on the clone means that while LeBlanc is encouraged to send out her clone to harass and zone, she's always going to be overextended and within autoattack range of all ranged AP mids. The cooldown and mana cost make spamming this ability prohibitive in early game, which keeps her zoning power from becoming overwhelming (and instead can let LeBlanc fight back against other zoning midlaners like Ziggs, Xerath and Orianna).*\n\n*Successfully managing LeBlanc's clone is key, as it basically doubles her damage potential. Furthermore, this is a partially defensive ability, as low-health enemies will think twice before chasing down or igniting LeBlanc if they cannot afford to make the wrong choice.*\n\n*-*\n\n#R: Mimic\n\nNEW: This ability gains a 50 mana cost at all levels.\nNEW: The cooldown of this ability is reset on kills and assists.\nNEW: LeBlanc's mimicked spells deal the same damage and have the same AP scaling as their normal version (according to the skill ranks LeBlanc has put in them).\nNEW: LeBlanc's mimicked spells gain additional effects.\n\n**Mirror Image:** Both LeBlanc and her clone gain 30/40/50% bonus movespeed for as long as the clone remains alive.\n\n**Distortion:** Leaves behind an area of reality distortion for 2 seconds that slows the movement speed of enemies for 20/25/30%.\n\n**Ethereal Chains:** If the target is snared, another set of mimicked Ethereal Chains is shot from the snared champion to the nearest enemy champion within range. This is fired as a skillshot as though LeBlanc was standing in the position of the snared enemy. This process continues to repeat if the new set of mimicked Ethereal Chains manages to snare another enemy champion. Snared champions obtain an immunity to mimicked Ethereal Chains (but not to LeBlanc's normal Ethereal Chains) for 5/4/3 seconds after being successfully snared. Every new set of mimicked Ethereal Chains deals 10%/30%/50% more damage than the previous. If there are no valid enemy champions within range, no new sets of mimicked Ethereal Chains will be shot. Champions with the immunity to mimicked Ethereal Chains do not count as valid targets. If both LeBlanc and her clone land the snare on two sets of mimicked Ethereal Chains on a single target, only one set of Ethereal Chains is fired.\n\n*Rather than turning LeBlanc's Mimic into simply a burstier version of her spells, I decided to go the utility route. Having an ultimate that duplicates spells seems like a waste if it's simply used for more damage, rather than for additional effects. Mimic is LeBlanc's main playmaking ability. Shifting the burden of her damage to QWE spells and giving her utility on her R allows her to be an assassin that can coordinate plays with her team and set up kills for others. The changes in her mimicked Ethereal Chains, for example, offers her CC synergy with champions who can lock down an entire team for the amount of time her chains need to proc (Sejuani, Amumu, Nautilus). This is the main tool that allows LeBlanc to stay relevant even when she's behind. While she may not have the damage she needs to assassinate anybody in the enemy team, she can still offer utility in teamfights, which her team can use to turn the tides of a game.*\n\n*-*\n\nComments and criticism welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-09-13T14:34:48.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you remove her sigil of malice, you're basically removing her ability to be an assasin. considering that her sigil allowed her to do tons of damage if it gets triggered by one of her other spells, that's what leblanc is about, to trigger this damn sigil.\nThe reworked Q is somewhat weird. You create a clone, and what? you're supposed to control once the champ and the clone? Yeah it would allow Leblanc to deal more damage with her W and E, but controlling both of them would be really annoying. as well the clone range is extremly low, consider that 500 units is LESS than her W range. If her clone will distort to a location, it will instantly return to leblanc, probably won't even deal any damage or will bug around.\n\nGiving leblanc a mana cost on her ult would be incredibly annoying, mostly because her W already eats tons of mana, and if leblanc runs out of mana but has a her mimic W up, it gives her a last chance to either die or juke. if you give it a mana cost, you basically removing her last chance to juke.\n\nI think riot has something to improve Leblanc kit to make it more \"decieving\", so we better wait and trust them~","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-13T16:35:20.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, I feel that LeBlanc's Sigil is the least interesting part of her kit. It has no counterplay and requires no skill to QRW a person for three quarters (or more) of their health.\n\nAs for the clone, it casts spells at the same time as the original LeBlanc does, so if you use Distortion, both the clone and the original LeBlanc distort to the same location (dealing double damage) and if you return to your original location, so does the clone. If you fire Ethereal Chains, the clone will fire another set towards the same direction you are firing them from (again, doubling your damage output). I'll clarify this in the OP.\n\nMathematically speaking, LeBlanc's triggered Q does the same damage (and has the same AP ratio) as landing the snare on her E. With her new Q, you are doing more damage than before (one full W's worth of damage) if you can land the Ethereal Chains.\n\nThe mana IS a concern I have for her, especially with her new reset mechanic. I may go back on it after doing some math on it.\n\nEDIT: The mana cost was definitely too high (I've lowered it to 50), but you can't have such powerful utility for free. Getting out a new clone and giving yourself a speedboost, or having a blink with a slowing aoe, or potentially snaring a whole team, that has to come with a cost. Her passive already covers a last-minute defence so that you can make a quick getaway if things go sour.","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-09-13T16:48:13.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, but when i read this,  her clone would be not great for juking anymore, since it dashes to the same direction as leblanc, and probably follows her as well. If you plan to juke, you probably have to controll the clone and the champ at the same time, and as said, if the clone gets out of a 500 unit range from leblanc, she gets teleported back to the real leblanc.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-13T17:06:40.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The clone casts the same spell at the same time as the original, but she doesn't need to have the same positioning. You can hold ALT to command the clone to move to another direction. Let me give you an example:\n\nLet's say you are running away in midlane. You're blue-side, so you're running southwest towards your base. You put your clone behind you to block any funny skillshots like Jinx's or Ashe's ult, and you keep the clone 500 units behind you. You then have both the original and the clone start running southwest to the base. When you use Distortion towards your base, both the clone and the original cast the spell in the same direction, so they end up both still 500 units apart, but closer to their base. If you do this with the mimicked version of Distortion, you actually create 2 AoE slows behind you, with their centres 500 units apart.\n\nWhen you're running away, you want to position LeBlanc's clone on a straight line behind you (or before you) so that you can overlap mimicked Distortions and use the clone as a human shield. When you're engaging, you want to use the clone to flank people and get around minions so that you can land your chains or get harass on them with Distortion. In lane, I imagine a common strategy will be to send out your clone behind the enemy creep line and then use Distortion. Your Distortion will hit the creep wave (netting you some last hits) while the clone's Distortion will put on some free harass on the enemy midlaner.\n\nYes, it will take a lot of micromanaging to fool people with LeBlanc's clone and get the most out of it, but I could say the exact same thing about Zed's shadows.","replies":[{"poster":"It Is I Emoto","date":"2014-09-13T18:37:31.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would not be like zed shadows, because he switches positions with them instead of having a clone of him running somewhere else\n \nhonestly it'd be great if you could switch positions with the clone, because that would make it extremly tricky to catch leblanc","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-13T19:06:17.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I didn't say that LeBlanc's clone was literally like Zed's shadows, only that they needed the same amount of micromanaging in order to outplay. Just like Zed, LeBlanc needs to be aware of the position of her clone and how her spells are going to be fired off from them, as well as her own. This level of duo-managing is what will separate the best LeBlancs from the rest.\n\nI am highly uncertain as to letting her switch positions with the clone, since it feels like it could lead to very cheesy kills with very little skill involved. If you know that your clone deals damage to its killer (and it has to deal damage, otherwise manaless champions or champions with chalice will just automatically delete your clone every time you cast it, and deprive you of one of your main tools), you can simply switch with your clone to fool them into killing your clone and netting you a cheap kill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
