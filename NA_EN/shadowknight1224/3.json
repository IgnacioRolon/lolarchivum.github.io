I am sharing the statistical data that I gathered, and abstaining myself from drawing any conclusions one way or another. It is my aim that this data may spark a *healthy* and *respectful* conversation on the portrayal of gender and how it reflects in role assignation in League of Legends.**\n\n*Methods:* I have not included champions who, while gendered, lack a sufficiently human form (or, in the case of Annie and Nunu, have not reached adulthood). I am using the official primary role that Riot suggests for the champions (even though they may not be up to par with the current meta).\n\n*Rationale for Exclusion:* In order to avoid significant data skew, I have filtered the champion pool through these three questions: \"Is the champion sufficiently human? Are they clearly gendered? Are they adult?\" If the answer to all three questions was yes, I included them. My reasoning for doing so was to obtain data relating exclusively to the interaction between gender portrayal and champion roles. I wasn't out to make a basic comparison between genders and roles (I'm sure it has been done to death). I wanted to focus exclusively on adult, human-like champions who are given overt gendering, and see where they fell on the role distribution.\n\n-*-\n\n*Assassins*\n\n**Female:** 5.\n(Akali, Evelynn, Katarina, LeBlanc, Nidalee)\n\n**Male:** 5.\n(Kassadin, Master Yi, Shaco, Talon, Zed)\n\n**Ratio:** 1.\n\n**Note of Interest:** Most of the male assassins are AD-based, most of the female assassins are AP-based.\n\n-*-\n\n*Fighters*\n\n**Female:** 7.\n(Diana, Fiora, Irelia, Kayle, Riven, Shyvana, Vi)\n\n**Male:** 14.\n(Aatrox, Darius, Dr. Mundo, Gangplank, Garen, Gragas, Jayce, Lee Sin, Olaf, Pantheon, Tryndamere, Udyr, Xin Zhao, Yasuo)\n\n**Ratio:** 0.5.\n\n**Note of Interest:** Almost 43% of the male Fighters have Tank as a secondary role, while only ~14% of the female Fighters are the same.

Gender of a champion is closely tied to his concept, ex. Vi is a badass female brawler and it wouldnt make sense to make her male, because her current identity is the best that riots creative team could come up with.\n\nGod I do hope Riot will never pay attention to statistics and male/female ratio when making champions, because gender of one should be based on an artist's idea, not being politicaly correct.\n\nAlso, why pretend that male and female ratio should be 1/1 in everything when both genders are clearly different from each other?","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-27T17:21:40.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely fail to see where you're getting the idea I am suggesting any sort of forced [anything].

(see: \"Stand behind Braum\" and \"They'll have to get through me.\") both are protective in nature. \n\n2) why not include champions who \"were\" male and who now are male voiced other things? Examples: Nautilus was a sailor, is now nautilus, clearly male. Dr. Mundo is a mutated male-with the same sort of technology as singed who you did include. All told, there are twice as many male champs as female champs-if you want to look at the ratios for future developments you may as well just include all of them as they've all got \"de facto\" genders. Why leave out the yordles for instance?\n\n3) Diana is an assassin, Nidalee is currently played as a fighter though she was a Mage. With this change the majority of the female assassins are built tanky (Nidalee Irelia Shyvana Vi and I would say Elise as well but you're excluding her as non human I think?) while there are only Riven and Fiora played as mostly squishy semi carry assassins. I think the point made in this section is largely conjecture. \n\n4) overall the problem you're having is role confusion (in my opinion) and your exclusion of a large amount of the champion pool. A better discussion would be an examination of the roles of ALL the female champions, versus the total number of champions in a role, with an even distribution of gals/role being 1/3rd of the champions roster for that role since females are at present 33% of the champ pool almost exactly. \n\nExample: fighters\n\nRiven Shyvana Elise Evelynn Nidalee Vi Irelia Poppy Fiora\n\n9 champions out of\n\nUdyr Aatrox Xin Zhao Garen Darius Renekton Nasus Rumble Jayce Master Yi Yasuo Tryndamere Volibear\n\n22 champions (might be missing a couple).

A lot of the male-gendered champions in League are suffering from the \"male as a default\" syndrome, where everything that is neither clearly male or clearly female is either male-voiced or referred to as a \"he\" since we as a society tend to see maleness as the neutral default (why are creatures like Malphite, Blitzcrank, Jax, Twitch and Kog'maw male-voiced and referred to as \"he\", for example, when it could have been extremely easy to give them female voices and refer to them as \"she\" instead, without altering their physical appearance in any way? It's because society tends to default to maleness in the absence of any gender indicators). If I were to include all champions in my calculations, I would end up with extremely skewed numbers. Note how my methods remove over 50% of the male roster, letting me assess the data more clearly.\n\nAs for 4), I didn't want to unleash a maelstrom of fury upon me by assessing the portrayal of female champions in the game, especially when Riot has admitted that they do not have much variety in the way of female bodies, and they're actively trying to remedy this.

Particularly for the Yordles-they have their own set of sex characteristics that the species follows, and they are by all indications make and female. I think excluding yordles from the listing just because we're not 100% sure how their genders work is kind of hair splitting, as none of the characters actually has an established gender independent of their physical sex because frankly in a fighting video game it's pretty irrelevant. You may as well throw in Annie, Nunu and the Yordles. \n\nFor 'Male as default' I'll definitely give you:\n\nKhazix Rengar Gnar Twitch Chogath Velkoz Kog'maw Skarner Volibear Fizz, Hecarim, Rammus, Amumu, any of the Shurimans (except that Nasus and Renekton are brothers and it's a core piece of their lore as important as Morgana and Kayle being sisters), and Avivia all that's a fair, switch the VOs and nobody would be confused. \n\nBut, Nautilus, Malphite, Aatrox, Jax, if any of those kinds of champs with quite clearly male-esque body types were female Voiced and referred to as female, it'd be as odd as Zyra being male, or Morgana.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-27T13:46:43.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I included Aatrox and Mundo as \"sufficiently human\" and they are part of my main assessment (look for them under \"Fighters\").

If so, are they adult? If so, are they clearly gendered?\" If the answer to all three questions was \"yes\", I included them.\n\nI admit that Jax is very much an edge case (like Nasus, Cassiopea and Nami, who are \"mostly human\" with a few significant non-human traits). I decided to err on the side of exclusion mainly to avoid bloating the male group and end up with skewed numbers (particularly on the Fighters category). I also choose to exclude yordles because, well, they are pretty non-human, and because male yordles outnumber female yordles by almost 3 to 1, again generating needless bloat in the male group. After all, what kind of useful data am I going to generate from including yordles in my calculations, when they are mostly irrelevant to gender portrayals in the game? There *is* a point to be made regarding the gender portrayal of yordles and how female yordles resemble humans much more than their male counterparts, but I feel that's not very relevant to this particular thread.\n\nMy reason for excluding child-champions like Annie and Nunu is that a significant part of gender portrayal relies on secondary sexual characteristics, which require having passed through puberty.\n\nIf you're interested in data regarding the entire champion roster, I include a few numbers at the end:\n\n> **Reassessment Using Excluded Champions**\n> \n> *Female Champions*\n> *Most Likely to Be:* Mage (30%).\n> *Least Likely to Be:* Tank (5%).\n> \n> *Male Champions*\n> *Most Likely to Be:* Fighter (~36%).\n> *Least Likely to Be:* Support (~6%).\n\nIt's not much, but it's a \"bottom line\" sort of data.

In fact, I specifically state that I avoid doing so. What I provide is processed data.\n\n- Statements regarding highest natural HP and Armour are a way to gauge tankiness. My intention when presenting that data is to let the reader know who is the tankiest of a given class. The reason this is relevant is because tankiness seems to be an extremely gendered characteristic in champion design. Note how \"damage-dealing\" is actually very evenly split among genders, while utility seems to have a slight female bend, but tankiness is highly correlated with maleness, and I wanted to highlight those special cases where it wasn't (such as Sejuani, Miss Fortune and Quinn).\n\n- \"The way the game is played\" is actually very subjective. If I went down that road, I would be giving you even more ammo to tell me that I'm manipulating data. I play Evelynn as a tanky AD bruiser, not as an AP assassin; I am aware that the roles Riot uses to classify champions end up outdated or ignored. I chose to go by Riot's roles because they reflect their intention upon character creation (and they can actually change this whenever they want; it was until recently that Nidalee used to be classified as a Support). I agree that Leona is a tanky support, but Riot has classified her as a Tank/Support rather than a Support/Tank (the way they classified Braum). In an attempt to redress this, I edited the original post a while ago with a weighted score using secondary roles as a way to give my percentages more nuance.\n\n- The \"current role\" argument that you are proposing is actually 100% unfeasible. Who is the ultimate authority for determining whether a champion is supposed to be built tanky or not? If we ignore Riot's roles, who become our guidelines? Pros? If two D1 pros build the same character in different ways, who do we lend credence to? Do we go instead by what the majority of the community does? That has its own set of problems too, since if we criticise Riot for having outdated roles, can't we criticise a significant portion of the community for building AP Mage Nidalee or Support Kayle, even though they are suboptimal? And if we do decide to ignore the part of the community that is \"doing it wrong\", what yardstick do we use? It loops us back to the previous conundrum: what pros do we listen to? Ignoring Riot's roles is nowhere nearly as feasible as you may think.\n\nI am glad you are sharing your conclusions with me, but I don't really want to swing the conversation one way or another.
