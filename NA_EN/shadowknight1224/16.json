I mean its common sense. in general just dont be a dick to others. some people dont care until its too late, or even then they'll just make a new account and continue the process, or worse at a much more harsh way because it doesnt matter to them! All in all i really dont see how its helping when we still see it much more common in games now a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zane yalgir","date":"2014-12-24T10:23:02.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShadowKnight1224,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zGUEt0Ha,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-08-19T01:23:57.995+0000)\n>\n> I am an avid follower fo the Red Tracker, and it just warms my heart to see Lyte's posts.
