Basically, the actual problem with the way the lore is heading right now is that there is no longer a valid in-universe justification for stasis.\r\n\r\nWithout the League, only two things may happen:\r\n\r\nA) Riot continues with stasis; that is, no champion ever dies permanently, suffers any sort of concluding fate or loses their powers, Valoran in general remains mostly the same and suffers no truly significant change; but Riot no longer has the League to justify why this is so, therefore this stasis feels contrived and any semblance of drama/tension/high stakes in champions' stories disappears once the reader remembers this.\r\n\r\nB) Riot gets rid of the stasis, being willing to actually craft a story that moves Valoran and the champions in a given direction. Doing this, they run the risk of killing off/depowering fan-favourite champions and taking the story in a direction the fans dislike, which may lead to constant vitriol being poured upon the Lore/Narrative/Writing teams and the higher ups pulling the plug on the whole thing after it creates the exact opposite effect they wanted to attain.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, option A) is the safe choice that leads to irrelevant and tension-free stories that may as well not even exist, while B) is the high-risk/high-reward choice that may turn LoL into either a great example of lore and narrative in video games or a vitriolic hatefest towards Rioters. If I were to hazard a guess, I don't think Riot would really go with B). For what I can tell, Riot enjoys playing things safe, which means that they will want to maintain the stasis if only to avoid limiting themselves in the future. After all, if they said that the League was limiting the stories they could tell, stasis ensures that no change ever really \"sticks\" and they can do whatever they want with whichever champions they want.\r\n\r\nWhich is a shame, if you ask me. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy reading stories even if they're inconsequential, but that's just something that I can't digest in the slightest. I can't really get myself excited over any story where there is no real tension and I already know how it's going to end. I'm willing to give Riot a chance, of course, they deserve at least that, but I just can't see how they're going to get themselves out of this dilemma.","replies":[]}
