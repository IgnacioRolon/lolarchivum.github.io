My new pc has a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor, it's an all in one pc so I cannot change this. I tried it out in a custom game earlier and it seems like the screen is smaller. I can't see as far as I used to be able to. Can anyone help? \r\n\r\nMy in-game resolution is set to 1920 x 1080. \r\n\r\nThe camera seems too zoomed in? I've tried scrolling out but it won't go any further.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-03T18:30:38.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In case you switched to a 4K, keep in mind that it's not a setup we currently support.  Your resolution may also be too high so your game screen can look wonky- especially if you tab out.  I recommend reducing your resolutions in-game and screen to fix things up, or swapping screens.  You can also hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you still have any issues.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
