His laning phase really isn&#039;t that bad if you just play smart and wait for your power spikes. He gets an easy shield from his Q to help with trading as well. Not to mention he gets basically an unlimited flash at level 6, as long as you have the mana for it. His ult is an amazing gap closer or escape tool. At max rank with 45% CDR it&#039;s at about a 1 second CD. No one can catch that.\r\n\r\nThe build I&#039;ve been going with is this:\r\n{{item:3158}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3040}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3089}} {{item:2139}} \r\n\r\nIt gives me about 900 AP, and 45% CDR. My W with this will do very close to 1200 damage per hit, on about a 3 or 4 second CD. An enourmous shield and poke with my Q, and a nice slow with my E with some damage. Plus, I can basically ult whenever I need to, for almost an endless amount of time it seems.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I feel like {{champion:38}} is a very strong champion at the moment, if built correctly. He is very feast or famine though, but from my experience, playing safe in lane, and just farming up makes him unstoppable mid to late game.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think about him?","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-08-25T13:54:08.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kass is considered an anti mage meant to counter mages while being an assassin.

I back as soon as I have enough for it, then tp back to lane.\n\nAs for {{item:3027}}, this is my first item. I let it stack while I also stack my tear.\n\nWith proper harass from my Q, I can pretty much CS to my wits content.\n\nI've yet to face a counter with him, but I dread when I do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-25T11:41:49.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is pretty good, though not great in a lot of matchups.

But most Kass player use Q always for minions and get so bullied that need to back or give first blood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2016-08-25T10:35:32.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres no way a ranged champion will let you farm up early game\ntakes way too long to get going because he needs a lot of items, and he doesnt have a good laning phase.","replies":[]}]}
