But randomly during games I'll get MASSIVE FPS drops, dropping as low as 7 fps at times. This inly happens when I play league, other pc games I play I get steady fps(depending on the game).\n\nIt happens at all stages of the game, and for some reason, late game specifically, if we have one of the enemy inhibitors open, if I go and auto-attack it my FPS stabilizes. \n\nI'll try and put down some of my specs, I'm not very familiar with PC.\n\nQuad-core AMD A6-7310 APU with integrated AMD Radeon R4 Graphics\n8GB of RAM\n\nIf there's anything else I can tell you guys just let me know, please help.\n\nEdit: Everything is up to date on my PC as well","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T03:47:47.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS drops can be caused by such a wide variety of reasons, but typically we can pump up the frames by checking over a few different settings.
