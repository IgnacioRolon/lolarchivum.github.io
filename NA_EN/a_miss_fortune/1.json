She has an AD scaling on her Q and W's passive stacking damage, and her ult scales off AD by applying stacks of W (adding stacks and applying damage for each stack). Now her ult scales off AD twice: once off total AD (Impure Shots stacking) and bonus AD (\"base\" physical damage.) It did more damage if they had stacks to begin with.

I've told them. I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL FOR SO LONG that MF was good.

Is she bad?  In a way, yes.  Is she as bad as the boards make her out to be?  Not even close.\n\nDid the buffs help?  For me, yes, because I built MF with raw damage, stacking as much AD as possible, so now my ult does just insane damage.  However, it still doesn't solve her core issues.  Both of her passives are still afterthoughts, and she still lacks a specific niche.  These things I think will be solved (hopefully) by preseason 6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-10-04T04:50:02.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FWIW, she's one of my 3 favorite ADCs.
