The difference between her and Twitch was that Twitch was able to have a decent early (his DOT damage was higher early and his stealth was much more reliable) and a godlike lategame.

Miss Fortune's ult alone can win teamfights and is perfect for last hitting due to it's range, plus when her passive is up she has a really high base movement speed and it's not uncommon for MF players to get Boots of Mobility so they have around 500 movement speed I think?\n\nTrust me MF is viable, she's hard to play and harder to master but it's so rewarding.
