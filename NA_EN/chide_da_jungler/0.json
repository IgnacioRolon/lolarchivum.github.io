This causes the other jungler, when you successfully steal a buff but they see you walk out, ask themselves if you smited it or if you didn't.  It also applies more counterplay for \"invade\" junglers stealing camps from under your nose and setting you behind.  As a downside, if you see the enemy's taken poacher you can simply make sure to leave at least 1 little minion (e.g. unsmiteable) for last so they can't smite-steal under your nose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jesus is Savior","date":"2015-04-19T14:21:25.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fojrgR8w,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-19T04:37:26.119+0000)\n>\n> I had a rework in testing a month or so ago that didn't pan out, ended up causing more problems than it solved.
