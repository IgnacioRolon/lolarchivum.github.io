Ideas include a small stacking-requirement like feral flare had. Something small so all junglers can hit it, but not so small that it could be attained while laning.\r\n\r\nYou get the idea.","replies":[{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2015-04-13T16:44:18.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's wrong with cinderhulk in lane?? Smite is good in lane but considering that the person is either going {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:11}} or {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:12}} they are sacrificing a core escape spell or map control for smite. It has it's perks for steals and  so on which makes players tend to go {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:12}} but this makes them an easy target to gank since they have no flash. Also the stats of cinderhulk are actually less useful than {{item:3068}}  early game, as it only gives health with no other stats such as armour. Also {{item:3068}} deals more burn damage aswell and is better for dueling. My solution is abuse the early game and put them behind before they get mid game items","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2015-04-13T19:47:00.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please explain how it is better than Sunfire Cape in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yimmortal","date":"2015-04-13T19:06:46.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh man i totally miss seeing a lee sin every game for the past 2 years","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-04-13T17:18:53.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not only that, there are actually disadvantages to using Cinderhulk in the lane, its passive will auto push the lane and force you to think about when to make trades that causes Cinderhulk's passive to ramp up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Snail","date":"2015-04-13T17:18:23.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a considerable opportunity cost for a top laner to dedicate to cinderhulk: losing TP or flash, and being pigeonholed into a straight HP build. \n\nI think we should watch it play out for a while first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2015-04-13T17:15:51.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with Cinderhulk that impacts laning so badly?","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-13T16:39:47.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, I say leave it.
