I believe it has something to do with the new update that has hit recently, resetting my ban time. I don't know the date of the original ban, but I assume it could be found on Riots end.  I would love this to be fixed, as a unlawful ban isn't something that should be happening.\n\nTo preface: I've had no interaction with the game during the original ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T00:43:44.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't look like this ban has been reset or changed at all. This is the only punishment that's been on this account and it started on 10/13, so it should be expired by 10/27.\n\nIf you do want more context on why it was placed on your account, be sure to hit up our player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Szajcore","date":"2017-10-19T00:51:18.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd make sense if it was started on 10/13, but what I'm referring to is when I log in. The game restates my actions and says that I have been banned for 14 days. I then go to the play button, hover over it, and it states that it is still a 14 day ban. This gives me the impression that a new ban has been placed, and that I had not gone down on any \"ban days.\"\n\nAll in all, it looks like it is not tracking how many days I've been off of the game, making me think that another ban has been placed today, or the countdown until the ban is over has not started. \n\nBased on what you've said, it seems as if I'm dealing with a display bug. \n\nThanks for the quick reply btw!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T02:12:35.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that message tracks the length of time, only the duration. It's not a bug, it just isn't a countdown timer and you need to wait out the full 14 days first.","replies":[{"poster":"Szajcore","date":"2017-10-19T03:44:21.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clearing that all up, and responding so quickly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
