So if you add your reaction time plus ping and then random packet loss everywhere you get tons of issues.

The thing about ping is 1) the delay can't even really be completly noticed because you click somewhere to walk and then some guy shoots the skill shot and you don't even see that the skill shot is going where your going until the delay is ended and then you've already walked into the skill shot. 2) you can press a button like actives and it won't go last game I had to press my tp on about 30 times and on 5 differnt structures in my base and several minions for the game to notice and start tping. I was lower mid bot lane and my guy walked almost to my base before it would go off to the point that tping any later would have been stupid since I would be able to almost walk there just as fast. 3) lag spikes. When you go 10/0 in lane with tristinia and then every single teamfight when the j4 and fiddlesticks ult from out of view and then that causes you to lag for 5 seconds every single teamfight it gets pretty old and makes you lose tons of games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CommandShockwave","date":"2014-10-07T19:26:49.021+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Give us a gold advantage, or add a turn rate onto west coast players.\n\nYou really don't understand how this stuff works, do you...\n\nNot only is it a TERRIBLE idea (lets make *everyone* have less fun, so we don't have to be alone!) , but it would be virtually impossible to even implement into the game.\n\nRuining the game feel for the entire other side of the continent is *not* how anyone with half a brain would address this problem.

Honestly all the East Coast players are asking for is Equality. Would you pick a handicap if you had the choice between on or not? You can get to challenger or wherever you want no matter where you live (Give or take if you are trying to play on NA from EU or something haha) but still why would anyone want a disadvantage in a competitive game? All I am saying is that there should be a server on the East Coast to compensate. It isn't an obscene proposition. I don't feel Riot is greedy or anything of the sort I just would like to point out that for the past few years they have been trying to address the issue from their end in Cali when just adding an East Coast server would solve most of the issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dehorn","date":"2014-10-07T15:03:46.245+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"im gold 4 with 110 ping. by that image i estimate my true rank to be diamond 5 50lp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona God","date":"2014-10-07T22:39:24.808+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a player who is Gold 5 and living in Florida.

There's no reason a gaming server for NA should be on the west coast. That's a terrible idea. There needs to be a server in central US, somewhere like Dallas, TX. This would make the most fair pings for the most of NA. It's better to have east and west coast players with an average of 80 ping and central players with lets say a 45 ping average than to screw over the central and east coast players. This will bring the overall combined ping down by a considerable amount for each match instead of giving all advantages to west side players and gradually disadvantaging players as you get further east. No location will be perfect for everyone, as ping != distance.. but putting the server in a location central to the players is a basic concept I figured RIOT would understand. Why isn't this taken care of, despite the game being out for so many years and being so popular?","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2014-10-08T02:33:48.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"There needs to be a server in central US, somewhere like Dallas, TX.
