And that you need a girl or a guy or you are a loser.\r\n\r\nSo backtrack like 10 months ago. I was 20 and I never had a GF and I felt like shit for it. So I started dressing nicer, going to the gym, and forced myself to be outgoing.\r\n\r\nI ended up getting my first gf a few weeks later. She turned out to be bat shit crazy. A month later she is talking about marriage and wants me to sign an &quot;ownership&quot; contract for her. On top of that she was mentally abusive and freaked out on me to &quot;break up&quot; with me, just to come crawling back days later. So fast forward another month and she cheats on me, big surprise.\r\n\r\nA month after that she has her new bf text me from fucking Alaska that he is worried for her safety. Like 2 days after that they break up and she crawls back to me, this time I didn&#039;t take the whore back.\r\n\r\nSo I had a run in with one crazy bitch, no big deal right?\r\n\r\nWell, now I&#039;m onto another girl and I just feel like this is just a huge waste of my time. Sex isn&#039;t the glorified thing everybody makes it out to be, and I would prefer to just be left the fuck alone. My grades have dropped, I have no free time, and I am wasting money.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to break up with her tomorrow morning. Being single is so much more enjoyable.","replies":[]}
