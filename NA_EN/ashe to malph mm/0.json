Seems you start with that.\n\nand it also looks like he is just guilty of trying to help you find trolls like I was.\n\nBasically Rito only punishes the ones trying to make the game less toxic.\n\nEDIT; o wow he said perma didn't he... that's harsh.  Well the secret to not being banned is basically don't give a shit about the game at all or anyone in it.  if you get trolls, don't care, ignore them and let them be trolls.  You can't stop them all or even a single one of them... I had reported some of the worst toxic people in the game and I've only ever seen one get punished.  and it wasn't either of the ones threatening to track down and murder a fellow player, or the ones feeding while yelling racial slurs, or even the one afk in fountain and telling the enemy team everywhere we went in all chat.  Was the guy who threatened to report my nephew for feeding... he was a bit of a jerk, and my nephew isn't good at the game, but really out of all the trolls and horribly toxic people in the game; the one to get punished was the one who was just frustrated with all the bad players","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashe To Malph mm","date":"2017-09-18T21:43:31.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you realize how much i play? and that in about 200 games since my last warning this is what gets me permabanned? did you read over this and actually think this guy deserves to have a 600$ over 4 years of work account perma banned because of the things i said? \"hypocrite\" being the worst thing i can find? thats fine im just going to fucking kill myself","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashe To Malph mm","date":"2017-09-18T04:22:12.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does this get me anything more than chat restrictions? there's over 600$ worth of skins and 4 years of work on that account. and I get a perma ban for this?
