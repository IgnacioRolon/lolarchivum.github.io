The limit should increase with how many points the player invests in that skill, let&#039;s say 3/5/7/9/12 (at max rank it should feel the same as before). At lower levels the wall could become wider 325 / 365 / 425 / 465 / 500, last longer at all levels (4s) and with a slightly shorter cooldown (25 / 23/ 21.5/ 19.5 / 18) to trade off this nerf. I think that would be way more healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2019-02-03T02:58:23.422+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"maybe stop trying to launch skillshots in the same direction and reposition yourself slightly? the point of the ability isn't to brute force it down.

If somebody like Corki or Kai'Sa could just demolish the wall instantly, there'd be no point. \n\nIt's balanced enough. The long cooldown coupled with the fact that it only protects him from one direction gives it plenty of counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Eldeazar","date":"2019-02-03T02:58:10.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"It gives him too much safety, he already has mobility, cc and a shield. If one or two champions would be able to demolish it quickly (not instantly) and at the expense of abilities that would just be counterplay, which yasuo is very much lacking.\nExcluding ranged minion attacks, absorbing 12 projectiles at max rank is basically the same as the wall is right now.\nFurthermore, it would punish yasuo's that are behind, since they typically level wall last and reward enemies that are ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-02-03T03:05:39.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has conditional mobility, CC on a telegraphed skillshot, and a shield that he has no control over its use. \n\nYasuo has tons of counterplay, and his winrates and pick/banrates show that he is not overpowered. He doesn't need nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Eldeazar","date":"2019-02-03T03:12:39.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has 2 ways of dealing that CC and increases the disable time with his ultimate, plus no limit to how many targets it can affect. His mobility is conditional but with a low cooldown, so we all know what yasuo can do with many targets. He has no control over the shield but still, it's a **shield**.\nWith a champion that is so heavily played and with such a high skill cap, I don't know how much information you can take from win rates alone.\nI do agree he is not OP in pro play, or else his issues would be adressed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2019-02-03T03:00:51.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Giving yasou counterplay  a whole lot of people will be upset for suggesting it.","replies":[{"poster":"Eldeazar","date":"2019-02-03T03:06:34.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know.
