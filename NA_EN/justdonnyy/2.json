They are influenced by this freaking toxic community, and we can't really blame them. The most obvious way to prove Riot is trying is read patch notes. Ever since Akali's rework, her damage and w are changing bit by bit, although most of the changes won't affect her greatly, they are balancing her with just the right amount.\n\nI also want to remind all of you out there who hate Riot (or support Riot, and I hope you keep your hope in them) about the -3ad to graves and -5ms to irelia.\nTo most of us, it is probably like a joke.

If any of us who don't main those champions are given the ability to nerf them, half of us will probably gut them, as I would have done, but Riot went the other direction.

The more substantial your feedback is the less useful it becomes because no developer would let his mind changed by a random player no matter how insightful his line of reasoning may be. More abstract feedback can be much easier examined and repurposed in a way that the developer feels like it´s still his idea and can be more confident in making adjustments.  \n\nAnd I don´t even believe that fora are the right place for this sort of feedback, so it makes perfect sense to me that most discussions devolve into circlejerks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-01-01T13:36:10.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The truth of the matter is that the \"haters\" don't really think that anyone else, who isn't saying bad things about Riot and League, is correct but themselves. Which means that you and me, who still play the game daily, must be Riot sympathizers or sheep who eat up anything they give us while they themselves are representing \"truth\".\n\nLittle do these people know that they only represent THEIR \"truth\" and that their opinion is not a sure indication of anything. Having an opinion on both sides isn't wrong, it's either subjective or objectively sensitive depending on the way you look at the problem. \n\nAnd let's just remember that the Boards are mostly in this state because people (first and foremost) use to for complaints more than for discussing problems, game balance or anything in general. And it's way easier to get upvotes and have your opinion on the top of the front page if you're being condescending, rude and generally \"anti-Riot\", claiming how the game must be dying because your interest in it has dwindled over the years - and blame it all on having to move on from the long gone S1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jango Mage","date":"2019-01-01T09:27:42.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Imo ppl who do this are the reason rioters are not always keen on commenting here on the boards under gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"boogeyboy","date":"2019-01-01T21:59:05.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lick them baby yea lick em lick em","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog goes moo","date":"2019-01-01T17:12:05.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Lol you want people to actually suggest good ways to lower the damage of the game instead of just saying 'lower the damage.'

I'm perfectly fine with voicing opinions, I do that myself, but then it's people who go and blame it on Riot or someone at Riot that kinda angers me as those people want nothing but their mains to be strong, which in a game this diverse can't happen 24/7. Even yesterday I found a post in gameplay about how all of these broken champions is the fault of CertainlyT and that he should be fired. I can agree with his designs being a little annoying but wanting someone to be fired for trying to introduce new mechanics into the game (That don't always work out) is no reason to fire someone. I always try and upvote posts that have evidence (not bullshit ones like I got oneshot by one zed q with 5000 health and 300 armor) to backup their post, because having evidence means you're at least making a constructive post and not saying Riot sucks dick and that they should balance around your preferences. \n\nEither way, appreciate you making a post like this. I've been thinking of making a post like this but figured it would just get downvoted into oblivion so didn't bother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bouncemaster Zac","date":"2019-01-01T06:50:24.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hate and flame should be directed at Tencent, not Riot.","replies":[]}]}
