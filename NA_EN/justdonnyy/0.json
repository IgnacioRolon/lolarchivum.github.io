The last paragraph is some extra toxicity that happened between me and the enemy Diana that has nothing to do with the main topic of this post, but is interesting anyways.  \r\n\r\nso pretty much I was just in a game playing vlad against a zed, and in typical 'bad game' manner we started falling behind in kills. I was also not doing as good as I could have been, but anyone who plays vlad knows he's a late game 1v5 champ, so regardless of how the game is going, things can always be turned around. \r\n\r\nso around 10 minutes into the game the draven (adc) had already been talking about surrendering and quitting the game because it was lost since he died twice... meanwhile our openly toxic lee sin (jg) was pretty much calling draven trash and 100% the reason why we were losing in /all. \r\n\r\nso around 20 minutes when they already had three towers and were pretty ahead with a recent rift herald kill, the lulu (sup) typed in /all that bot was \"open\". the game still lasted a while because it seemed like she was still playing, then once they actually used the herald they got recently, kled (top) decided to join lulu in saying that it was over and that they should \"end fast we're just in spawn\". shortly after for only like the last 60 seconds of the game, lee sin joined them AFK-ing in spawn. \r\n\r\nfor the last 2-ish minutes of the game they pretty much were demanding that I give up and stop trying because the game was over, again, my score wasn't amazing but I never give up a game fully, especially a ranked game, so I ignored that and kept playing until they inevitably won the game because three of my teammates we're AFK in spawn.  \r\n\r\nso then, the post-game chat happens, and I was understandably pretty pissed, I just lost LP that I didn't deserve to lose because it wasn't a real game in my opinion, not to mention the flaming from the toxic jungle and support who quit mid-game, so, after the lulu typed \"vlad, you need to know when to quit and when things arent winnable\", I made the educated choice to share my opinion on their choices by saying \"every game is winnable, you're a quitter who's going to be in this rank for a long time, enjoy the report\". which yes, wasn't exactly the nicest thing to say, but I think they deserved to hear it. \r\n\r\nthen, within the next 60 seconds, I was told \"You're fucking garbage, that isn't winnable, you're an idiot if you don't know when to give up, you should give up league in general\" ect. ect. I don't remember word for word but that was pretty much jist of it. \r\n\r\n**Sub-plot -** If you're somehow still reading and are even more interested about this shitty game, here's some subplot because even the enemy team was toxic to me. mid-game pyke got a triple kill only with his ult, I proceeded to say how I don't think an execute has a place in a game like this, which is an opinion I have on a champion and has nothing to do with me being toxic to another person. their Diana (jg) then explains that pyke is perfectly fine. Then I explain how his two CC moves and invisibility / healing makes him way to overpowered especially in this elo where not many people can counter it (bronze 1 / silver 4). then she goes on to say that \"vlad you have an invis too idiot lol\", when i explain how a puddle of very visible blood is _not_ invisibility, she responded to her stupidity by saying \"lol whatever, losers gonna be losers xd\", then spent the next 10 minutes camping mid, getting kills on me (about 3 of them) and after each time saying \"lol you're worse then i thought\". I told her that insulting me based off my opinion of a champion was pretty toxic, and that she'd probably agree with me if she were on this team getting destroyed by a fed pyke. \r\n\r\nWell, if you read it all or the TL:TR, please give me your opinion on whether or not you think I did/didn't deserve this treatment or if I should or shouldn't have given up. \r\nI'll be ignoring toxic/rude responses because as you can tell, I've had enough of that.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-02-21T10:54:55.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't understand your timeline here.

Every game of LoL (on the servers, excepting technical failures, etc.) continues until there is one winning team and one losing team. If both teams try their best and give it their all - for example, in a pro match where there's big money on the line and Riot doesn't want to declare a tie - one team will still lose. Echo Fox actually won against CLG recently when a bug crashed the server in a way that the match couldn't be recovered and Riot declared the former the winner because they were far ahead. CLG was surely hoping that match was winnable, and they were trying to win, but even Riot admitted that such a huge lead was basically a guaranteed win.\n\nI've even had a bot match win ripped out from under me - yes, bots - because the rest of my team gave up. They were a 4-man queue that was feeding pretty hardcore, but I was carefully and patiently carrying. Suddenly, one of them said that his mom was telling him to turn off the computer RIGHT NOW because it was a school night. His friends didn't want him to get a leave, so they surrendered.
