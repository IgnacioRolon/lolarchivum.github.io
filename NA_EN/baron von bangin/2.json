Often times players are faced with Riot telling them what the changes will be and are surprised when they recieve overwhelming negative feedback from players and (unless it&#039;s Lee Sin) will go through with the changes anyway.  This is useually because the changes are discussed with players early enough, resources are locked in or different projects are scheduled and more time can&#039;t be spent revisiting the champion rework.   Riot is asking for input now and that looks like a shift in the right direction but I challenge them to give us feedback as well.  Tell us plans BEFORE they&#039;re locked in. Let the players discuss the pros and cons with you. It seems like that would be a potentially powerful solution sinc the Dev team has admitted to often misunderstanding what players like about a champ. \n\nSo talk to us, Riot. Don&#039;t just ask for feedback, start a conversation early, before it&#039;s too late. Play ball with your players :)\n\nEDIT: A lot of the discussion seems to be aimed at Vel'Koz specifically. I am more invested in Vel'koz than the other mages being touched so I might have talked about him more specifically, but I made this thread with the intent of discussing how Riot can avoid misalignment with reworks by starting an early TWO WAY dialogue with players about what changes they want to make _before_ they're locked in.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-23T03:57:18.353+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":14,"body":"> So talk to us, Riot.

If you can only do broad strokes, then do broad strokes. If you can do more detailed stuff, then that. But for me and this is how I understand the OP, we don't want to get to mid year, see a champ get something like Skarner's spires, and not be able to fundamentally change that.

Riot tends to actively seek out support for their plans and then mostly tries to ignore anything else. So when people get upset about a change, it seems that Riot's first reaction is to ignore it.

Yeah these were small changes but it worked wonders imo.\n\nMf has more going on than some tweaks too. most important she got new scalings which is kind of important too, i think. \n\nOf course, these were not heavy reworks like Poppy or Sion but there are only these 2 champions in this category anyway. And i think both are a success. \n\nAnd Fiora, well. I would say there are a lot more buttons to press for precise tuning on her new kit but I would be lying if I said I am an expert in balancing champions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatHaleState","date":"2016-01-23T00:45:35.336+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"One word.

So, they tried to drastically change each champion, which ended up being pretty hit or miss. And the misses were by a pretty large margin, probably because they haven't always managed to properly predict exactly how much time/resources they need to rework a champion right (lack of time is probably a pretty big reason they haven't been able to take more player feedback, but you could make an entire thread on that topic).\n\nNow, let's remember. Riot *likes* Vel'Koz. They like how he plays, and what he offers to a team. The biggest issues they have with him are that:\n1. The *way* he deals AoE damage + light CC is interesting, but that in and of itself isn't very unique. So they're interested in keeping *how* he does things (meaning they'll avoid changing the basics of how his spells work unless they find a really good reason to), and just tweaking *what* he does a little bit. I honestly expect it to be pretty minimal, and not too far removed from what he already does.\n2. Vel'Koz's Q is basically the most interesting ability in his kit. It's fun to use, and it doesn't feel like crap to play against. But, it's universally accepted that he's better off maxing W first for waveclear. If possible, they'd like to find a solution to that. I get the feeling this is more of a \"we'd like to do this, or maybe this is a direction we'll use for his overall changes, but if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out\" sort of thing.\n\nI'm really not that worried about Vel'Koz changes. Rather, I'm kind of looking forward to them. When we do get information on them, if they suck, I'll say it. If they're cool, I'll say that. But until then, this is my stance on the matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-01-22T23:29:53.651+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's an epic Helmet Bro image.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-01-23T00:13:29.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's from the Vel'Koz reveal video","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Bangin","date":"2016-01-23T01:26:18.166+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still epic doe.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RedSevenZ","date":"2016-01-24T04:20:40.256+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its never too late to bring back the heavenly fan rito.
