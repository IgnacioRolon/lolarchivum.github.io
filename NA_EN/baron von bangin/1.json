You are basically getting a better skin for the same price as you get a 975.

When we develop skins, we try to capture the fantasy of a skin; sometimes that means adding sounds and particles, and in other cases, a new model works to create a completely different fantasy. \n\nFor example, Arcade Miss Fortune would be pretty lackluster without sounds to accompany the particles - you'd lose the real feel of 'arcade'.

But when compared to when the \"1350 price tier\" that started in 2012 with Kha'Zix, of which there was two that year, and compare it to 2013 when there was four (not even including the price \"readjustments\") and then to 2014 when there was eleven there's pretty clearly a trend starting to happen.\n\nOnce again. Not saying the skins are too expensive or that they aren't worth it.
