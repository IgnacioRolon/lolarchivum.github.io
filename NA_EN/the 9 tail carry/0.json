It's based on a number of clean, non-toxic games played.  The number varies based on severity of the punishment that the player had; i.e. a player who was on a 14 day suspension will need more clean games to reset to a chat restriction than a player who was on a 25 game chat restriction would need to reset to a 10 game chat restriction.  And here's the thing... if a player is still being toxic, just not severely toxic, they aren't going to be working towards that reset very quickly.  It retards their progress if they are being regularly reported, even if the system doesn't issue them a punishment based on the reports.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n_formerly VentressRedeemed_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-02-14T04:42:08.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5th?

If you've been punished before, it'll be permanent. There is no excuse for intentionally feeding. Ever.\n\nIf others are being toxic, they will be punished according to the severity and their history. That still does not give you the right to intentionally feed or be toxic in **any** way back to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2018-02-13T21:20:21.896+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no excuse for intentionally feeding.

Your first offense was a chat restriction (you can't use chat or have limited times to use it), as was the second, and I believe third offense. The 14 day ban occurs when you continue to get reported for being toxic/feeding/trolling _even after_ your first 3 warnings. It escalates then to a permanent ban if you _STILL_ continue to get reported for the same toxicity/feeding/trolling after the 14 day ban. So your permanent ban is like your 5th offense that tells us that you continued to behave in a manner that got you consistently reported for unsportsmanlike behaviors. If you got through 3 chat restrictions and a 14 day ban and didn't pick up on the fact that your behavior was getting you punished over and over again, you deserve your perma ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EBGenetics","date":"2018-02-13T22:49:05.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":21,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The 9 Tail Carry,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HxQf8Twu,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-02-13T21:17:39.155+0000)\n>\n> First of all I will admit I have been toxic and the way I handled the situation is wrong, In my most recent game I was perma banned for feeding however, in this game I had people throw insults at me such as &amp;quot;I hope you die of cancer&amp;quot; and stuff like that.
