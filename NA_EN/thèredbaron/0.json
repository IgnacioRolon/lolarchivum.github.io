We are in a game full of silver/gold players, we know how to faceroll and feed. thats it. Throwing around &quot;calls&quot; left and right is only going to get us caught in the enemy jungle because you _think_ you know where they are. You don&#039;t know anything, the moment you think you do is the moment you stop progressing as a player and get stuck in supposed elo hell. Which is just your own making. Even challenger players still have to improve on a daily basis if they want to stay in challenger or hopefully go pro one day, there is never a point where you know everything about this game. Even the devs don&#039;t know everything. So when another player makes a call, and you go and shut them down for a &quot;bad call&quot; just remember the 12 calls you made earlier that all lead to deaths. \n\nIts important to call out information like missing laners and junglers, but we as low elo&#039;ers don&#039;t know enough to go around calling for big and complicated plays because we aren&#039;t good enough to execute on them 100 percent of the time nor do we have the game knowledge to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each play. Focus on your mechanics, and absorb as much macro knowledge as you can, and in the meantime, stick to pings. You will win a lot more games.\n\nEdit: This post was to bring up that focusing on your own mistakes is far more important than focusing on your teammates mistakes. ego and pride take way too much space in this game atm.\n\nDon&#039;t be the reason your team loses, and don&#039;t credit yourself when you win. Its a team effort, (mostly just flailing around angrily until the game ends in terms of our elo... ;P) \n\n-- A perfectly below average player\n\nEdit: It seems the post is being downvoted by players who feel this doesn't apply to them. They then comment that they are an amazing shotcaller, _yet they are in gold/silver_ {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\n\nEdit: There has not been a single argument to my post that had any evidence to support it, and they all have at least one line that basically says \"cry more\" or \"I don't need to prove anything\". further proving my point on arrogance.

There are a million and one factors that can effect a teamfight, just relying on one is simply silly. If the attacking team has a 20/2 rengar, and the defending team has 10 kills split among them, the rengar can effectively one shot one or both carries, or he could go in and get hit with any cc and be focused down, or his team could back him up and clean up after the cc was put on cd against the rengar, or anything at all could happen to effect the fight in either direction. There are so many factors to consider in terms of teamfighting, and not one person can reliably know the outcome of every single play. Its not humanly possible. \n\nAn example of my own: Chess. Chess has been around for over 1000 years and even STILL, nobody can predict the outcome of every single play. even the best grandmasters make mistakes. League of legends has infinitely more varied outcomes to plays because it is a more complex scenario. There are 100's of champs, not just a dozen or so pieces, and there are thousands of positions on the rift that any champ could be in and any given time. \n\nYou can't make your claim because you would have to be inhuman for that to be the case, and I can reliably say you aren't.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T01:51:48.274+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> You are definitely full of yourself. \n\nCry more. You care about this way more than is healthy for you, but i dont give a fuck, because what you think has zero impact on how i play the game.\n\n> In regards to your example that: \"defenders have an advantage in fights\" ... that isn't always true? \n\nCorrect, it is a generalization that is true in most situations and definitely varies if the comps or player performance are unusual. God forbid anyone uses a generalization on the internet, some semantics-wielding brat will inevitably see it and lose their shit.\n\n>  If the attacking team has a 20/2 rengar, and the defending team has 10 kills split among them, the rengar can effectively one shot one or both carries, or he could go in and get hit with any cc and be focused down\n\nWhich is why in this case, you turtle up under a turret and CC that shit, instead of charging down lane and dying to an ambush where you have no warning or chance to peel. Classic example of when to defend.\n\n> You can't make your claim because you would have to be inhuman for that to be the case, and I can reliably say you aren't.\n\nThis logic is a trash fire.
