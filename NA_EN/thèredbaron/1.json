They haven't even given it a shot. That shows stubbornness at best, and incompetence at worst. Btw, there was no data on how long they measured whether players came back or not. Maybe not by the time the study was complete, but players come and go all the time because there hasn't been a healthy meta in this game for YEARS. Each meta drives players away. URF is an escape where you can get together with your buddies and roll on the floor laughing out of enjoyment, the game has lost that aspect. URF was never intended for you solo players. It was intended for a group to have crazy adventures.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2018-06-27T17:05:02.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brath,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KuOu41Xi,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-18T23:12:02.177+0000)\n>\n> You think we don&amp;#039;t but we do because contrary to public belief players do in fact know what they want, and are the reason you make any money at all.\n\nEA (sorry I mean riot.

[150,000 active players, actually.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalrius).\n\nThis is free money for Blizzard. A version of the game that they don't have to ever update and only pay to keep the servers running (and in the age of VM's, that's a lot easier than it used to be) and handle the occasional GM request. If only half of those private server folks make the jump, that's $1.1M every single month in subscription fees.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThèRedBaron","date":"2018-06-27T14:38:42.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Onotori,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KuOu41Xi,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-06-18T23:35:39.507+0000)\n>\n> That Vanilla server is going to implode, and I'm going to laugh the whole time.\n> \n> No one actually *liked* the game in Vanilla, they liked the community aspect and all that.
