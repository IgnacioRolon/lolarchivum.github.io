I even deleted Steam to see if it would fix it but nothing helps. Tried resetting the router, ipconfig, etc. \r\n\r\nI have been playing for around 5-7 months now and would like a solution. Anything helps so...","replies":[{"poster":"nfzeta","date":"2016-11-20T03:56:26.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annndddd... Here we are again folks.
