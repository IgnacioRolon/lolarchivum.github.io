It&#039;s complete bullshit. I wanna climb in one role only in ranked and it completely screws me up personally when i get another role. You dont see faker playing ADC in Pro tournaments do you? No cause he gets the lane he wants and hes best at THAT lane. I don&#039;t know about others but I know I&#039;d rather wait 10 minutes in que and get the role i want then wait 3 and get my secondary role which i&#039;m not the best at. I&#039;m a hell of a lot better at my primary (obviously that&#039;s why its my primary). I wish riot would just implement a One role que into ranked play. That is the end of my rant","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-06-15T02:48:52.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"enjoy your 30 minute queue times","replies":[{"poster":"Trugzz","date":"2016-06-15T03:58:14.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd wait lol","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-15T05:23:19.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Others don't want to wait half an hour, and having people queue up as only one role makes others wait as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flaherty","date":"2016-06-15T02:55:56.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if you were here when Teambuilder was a thing, but you chose 1 role for that and queue times were god awful for anyone not support, a lot more so than the current dynamic queue times.  When everyone wants to play mid, for example, then no games can be made because there aren't people to fill up the other roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Trugzz","date":"2016-06-15T03:57:11.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see that, but yeah i think people who want to do 2 roles should but people who only want one should be able to choose only one.

Queuing for 1 role will not only make you wait longer but will also make everyone else have to wait longer because a group can't be made until all roles are filled.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowYodel","date":"2016-06-15T03:01:19.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! I would love that. If I really want to play one specific role I'd rather wait than get a role I don't want. Secondary roles should still be a thing for people who don't care, but I'd like the option to only que for one role. Riot make this happen!","replies":[{"poster":"Trugzz","date":"2016-06-15T03:58:48.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wish they would!","replies":[]}]}]}
