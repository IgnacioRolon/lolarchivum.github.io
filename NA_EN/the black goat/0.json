As I recall, once I had my starting item with my runes and masteries, I started around 87 AD.  Now it is 72 I believe.  I will start a practice game in a few minutes when I have more time and get better numbers but I know something has changed for sure.  Not seeing it in the patch notes unless I have overlooked something.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T01:56:09.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few different things factoring into that level one damage so it's a little hard to pinpoint just what exactly is affecting this change. I don't believe her base damage was lowered in this recent patch, but that change might be coming from item adjustments as well. Hit me up with your starting build and I might be able to pinpoint just what was changed!","replies":[]}]}
