I have to use task manager to end the bugsplat so that it stops producing bugsplat windows every second. The launcher also never opens. This occurred right after the 7.6 patch. I queued up for 1 game and then it bugsplatted and never was able to launch league ever since then.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-24T21:16:22.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have a bad install so it's failing to render anything.

I cannot even open up the client to the login screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Strykero","date":"2017-03-25T17:50:49.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nevermind, I completely uninstalled it once again and everything works now!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kytharsyss","date":"2017-03-24T20:55:20.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has just happened to me as well and i was using the updated client for about a whole 3 days, and before this there was the stupid issue with the discord overlay causing my games to crash on the load screen.... come on Riot plz get your shit together","replies":[]}]}
