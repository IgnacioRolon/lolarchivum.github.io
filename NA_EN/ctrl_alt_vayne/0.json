Some things about myself. I am 15 years old and I have dream of becoming a professional league player (I know i&#039;m only Silver). I live in Arizona and and creating a team to grow and improve has a team. Practice times will be based off when the whole team can make it and I am very strict about the practice times (Yes I understand if you miss a few). As of now, I am in MST (Mountain Standard Time). It would be a bonus if you guys have a similar time zone or about 1 hour off, as it would be hard if any higher.
