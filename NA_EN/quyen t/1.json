Who just got level 5 mastery and just got banned for saying these things was on my account. So basically I let him play one game for the day because he was already banned on his account, and being a good friend, I allowed him to; I wasn&#039;t in supervision of what he said but when I logged on right when he said he was done, I got banned. I&#039;m sure I deserve this ban, but again, I was allowing my &quot;Toxic friend&quot; log onto my account and play a game. Though the weird thing is that he was supposed to be unbanned today, so I don&#039;t know why he asked me to play. I guess this is one of the worlds mysteries. ://\r\n\r\nYes I have been temp-banned once but that was when I was new to the game and couldn&#039;t control my anger. I know what it feels like to go through those things.\r\n\r\nIm actually sorry for what he&#039;s caused.  Again I dont know why I let him go onto my account when he already has 2 perma-banned accounts and a temp-banned one.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-09-10T04:43:02.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can imagine that it is very frustrating to find yourself being punished for the actions of another person, but all things considered, you are quite lucky that it was just a temporary ban and not a permaban.  Riot has a zero tolerance policy towards hate speech, and many accounts are immediately permabanned for using slurs this many times in a match.  Also, account sharing is against the ToS, and can also get you a permban on the account.  \n\nSituations like this, where a player has an account, but is not the one who actually commits the behavioral infractions, are one of the big reasons why account sharing is not allowed (the other being boosting).  It would be far too easy for players to say \"but it wasn't me\" any time they were punished, if players were allowed to share accounts.  So, Riot made it part of the policy that players are never to share their accounts, and players are ultimately responsible for anything that happens on their accounts.  \n\nIt might not seem very fair, but my advice would be to try and be glad that you weren't punished more harshly, and to definitely never let anyone else use your account again in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2017-09-10T15:33:08.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. account sharing isn't allowed so that alone is cause for a perma-ban. \n2. you are responsible for your account and what is said on it, sadly even when hacked sometimes or shared in this case.\n3.
