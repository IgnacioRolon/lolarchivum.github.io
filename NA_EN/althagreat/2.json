Should I start a blog? \r\n\r\nShould I just become a bodybuilder? Should I not try to focus all my time and effort into one thing?\r\n\r\nShould I go stand outside wal mart and hand out fliers and try my luck at being a motivational speaker?  \r\n\r\nSHould I continue to try and find success on the internet? Should I play league of legends while life pasts me by?\r\n\r\nThank you GD for being the place for me to express myself and let vent to let my stresses go. It&#039;s only thanks to you guys that I can get this off my chest and move forward in life.\r\n\r\nIs greater education the only answer in life? \r\n\r\nShould I just be happy living.....\r\n\r\nWe have to ask ourselves these questions constantly in order to evolve. It all starts here. Address the problem. Identify a solution, Test and record the results. Rinse and repeat until you are successful. \r\n\r\nI got this. I know that I&#039;m useful to someone....I know at least 1 person will read this. I&#039;ve gotten great advice from you guys before don&#039;t let me down now.\r\n\r\nYou may not be the best community..but birds of a feather flock together. One thing we can agree on is our love for the league designs. \r\n\r\nThe world is a beautiful place...let&#039;s make it more beautiful. Maybe I should draw a picture or make a song...Maybe I should eat...usually when I do activities that don&#039;t require the use of my brain it helps me think better. Even while writing this I can feel the creative juices in my brain swoosing around like a sonic slushy or a dairy queen blizzard. The taste of the strawberry cheesequake blizzard always triggers my dopamine chemicals....\r\n\r\nI went out last night got drunk and high had a good time. It&#039;s nice to go out and loosen up so you can come back motivated for the next week especially on the Lord&#039;s day which is always a day of celebration and relaxation. I love being in my zen place. I love to socialize but I&#039;m tiring of being a thinker and not a doer. I guess writing this is doing something but I need to really do something. Greater. More creative. Something that takes hard work and effort that people can enjoy or benefit from or both! I think I should fold my laundry and wash my bed spread. anime is good sometimes but too much of anything can kill you. This isn&#039;t the old days. It&#039;s time to move forward.  It&#039;s time to accomplish something that could never be accomplished before. I feel like the answer is so close. It&#039;s at the tip of my brain. I can feel it coming to fruition. The fruit is ripe and just needs to be picked. The seeds were planted long ago. The nectar of intelligence is dripping from the pores in my head. There is a buffet of even more all around us...Eat to your hearts content! \r\n\r\nI am going to do this. \r\nI am going to blow your minds.\r\nI am going to evolve. \r\nI am going to create. \r\nI am going to help you all.\r\nI am going to entertain you.\r\nYou are going to be so stimulated and excited that you won&#039;t be able to get enough of me....\r\n\r\nI hope you&#039;re ready....because I have a new innovative idea that I am about to put into action. The money will come rolling in. People will congregate around me just to get a piece of the pie. You&#039;re going to love it. \r\n\r\n~~~_You guys are truly my family and my family is all i have_ ~~~","replies":[]}
