I don't know why Riot has such an issue with this.\n\n1. The marksman class should do less damage in a short time than the mage class.  A mage's burst should do markedly more damage in a short amount of time at any stage of the game than a marksman can ever do in that time, even with high crit rate. A mage's combo should always be significantly higher than a marksman's full kit rotation in the same duration of time including any non-skill autos.\n\n2. A mage's cooldowns should be significant enough that a marksman's damage has time to stack up to match/surpass the mage's  burst over long periods of time.\n\nSo the balance is that High DPS should come at the expense of burst. You cannot burst a target, but what makes the DPS higher than the burst over time is the presence of *consistent damage output over time* resulting from the consistency of AD scaled autos being the primary source of damage. Cooldowns are essentially what keeps the mage from being able to out-dps the marksman, while still being able to outburst them. \n\nI don't think marksmen are really supposed to be tank busters. No one should just \"bust\" a tank. But tanks shouldn't be enough of a threat on their own that they need to be busted anyway. Tanks are team oriented. Marksmen should be a more reliable source of damage against tanks due to sustaining damage, but they shouldn't be \"tank busters\". A focused Marksman should be able to take down a target fast with a coordinated team, but a mage should have the aoe ability to be a primary threat. \n\nMarksmen *should* be strong at dealing damage to objectives. Tanks should be strong in forcing those objectives. Mages should be strong threats to the aquisition of those objectives or to the enemy team, but also should do some damage to them.\n\n A marksman should never be a strong duelist.  A marksman should never be a primary source of AOE damage. A marksman's single autos should never be strong enough to outburst a burst class.\n\nIn fact, it's stupidly obvious what Riot could do to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-03-20T22:34:51.572+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solitair,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7E8AANIT,comment-id=00020004,timestamp=2018-03-20T21:00:39.713+0000)\n>\n> It really doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s really not so hard.

If I might ramble on a bit?\n\nAmusingly, this was also once the case in League when I started the game - though I do remember that mages usually needed to whittle down opponents before they could get into burst range and teamfights also lasted longer. The strength of the Mage-class was burst and wave-clear, while ADCs were turret damage and sustained damage. The power creep in champion kits across the board has muddied the identity of champion roles... I also think that it's harder to pinpoint what you might regard as the 'prime' example of what every 'subclass' might be, especially when the line between Tanks and Fighters seems to become increasingly blurred with every new release and rework. Tanks used to have a lot of CC but do less damage, wheras a fighter had a lot of damage and innate bulk, but little CC. Now there's a ton of tanks with not only oodles of CC, but also feature things like damage that scales off of HP and %damage.\n\nWhat I think catapulted ADCs to the front of the line to being good at so much was the cost reduction for their core items, with each of those items further feeding off one another, more than the other classes. An ADC getting hit by a full combo of a mage SHOULD kill them more often than not - because as it stands, that ADC is more than likely just going to obliterate you if they survive or if you miss a single skill. Hell, I've seen ADCs manage to kill a mage while taking their entire combo to the face by virtue of lifesteal and crit alone.\n\nI think Riot should really try to break down what each and every class means at it's core. Tanks? Damage Mitigation, Sustain, Crowd Control. Pick two. ADC? Range, Mobility/Safety, Damage. Pick Two. Probably grossly oversimplified here, but there are some champions who seem to do everything well. Tristana? Twitch? They do it all. Course, try as you might - there will always be tiers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2018-03-22T12:40:42.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried making a post about players balancing the game, but people downvoted me, they would listen to you, try making a post on everything riot can do  to balance the game, and ask others for their opinions, because around here, is i feel like most posts that arent circlejirks, dont hit the front page to be noticed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-03-20T19:04:58.609+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":4,"body":"If only there were some kind of damage that scaled off of how much HP the enemy has...","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-03-20T21:04:17.854+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rework everyone to deal % max health damage?\n\nThat could be...interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-03-20T21:40:01.862+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wasn't trying to imply that.\n\nRiot historically had champions/items that were better against tanks (%HP) but not as strong against squishier enemies.

If the adc no longer has beefy targets to hit then the adc did his job. Or the enemy team drafted a team comp that is countered by your tanks. The mage then becomes the carry for the rest of the fight.  NEVER EVER shold the adc or the mage be the single team carry.  Its supposed to be shared.\nAdc's where never meant to kill everything. Adc's THINK they are supposed to kill everything.  Realistically the mage is there to kill squishies and the adc is there to kill  the tanks.  Thinking adc's are supposed to be the best damage dealers and good verse everything is what got us to the mess we are in.\n\n> Best case would be to rework crit to bypass % bonus armor on critical hit and significantly lower crit's bonus damage then get rid of last whisper and voila we have a class which excels at dealing with high armor targets that naturally scales up to defeat their defenses without blowing up squishies\n\nThis is worth a try at least. But honestly the first thing that needs to happen is Riot getting together and figuring what NICHE they want the adc role to have.  Right now they kill** everything** quickly and need little help to do so. \nIts getting to the point where the optimal team comp is 2 adc's  (1 with wave clear) ( can be substituted for a mage if they do high consistant dps like ryze/azir)  and 3 tanks( 1 for peel, 1 for initiation, and 1 for follow up initiation). \nYou might think im exaggerating but its been trying to head down that path for awhile. \n\nProtect the kog comps?  If the only threat is Kogmaw and the team comp works then something is broken.\nThere have also been lcs meta's where Corki/lucian/ezreal/ other adc was mid with sometimes an adc jungle and adc bot supported by 1 peel support and 1 engage tank.  And at those times They usually won. THe 2 adc comp had the highest win rate  and later was nerfed in some way.\n\nPS: Its gotten so bad that when u say \" omg that adc killed my mage b4 he could even get his combo off\"  people respond with \" well ya adc's are the best single target damage dealers and should kill the mage\".  This shows how out of hand things have gotten if even the adc's think they are supposed to win the fight against, what is supposed to be, one of there counters( the other being assassins).","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-03-21T12:09:08.460+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">or if that get's addressed and cannot be done they will just build damage or play different class\n---\n>Then they can die to anyone easily and there isnt a NEED for the adc that game and they will just be average.\n\nexactly,if they don't pick tanks don't pick an ADC,that would finally make them less mandatory\n\npicking an ADC against a full damage/burst team comp should be like picking for example an assassin against a full tank/peeling team comp,you should be useless unless you are far better than them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bird GirI","date":"2018-03-21T15:12:01.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The adc must have been grossly fed to survive the whole combo and kill him before another spell comes up, and you know it. Don't be ridiculous. And please don't bring up the \"adc's in multiple roles meta\" meme back. There's something seriously wrong with the brain of someone who thinks it counts if that adc playing a different role is complete garbage in the bot lane. Ezreal, Graves, Quinn, Corki are all trash bot whenever they are viable elsewhere. That's like thinking tanks are broken just because Braum can go bot, Malphite can go top, Galio can go mid, and Sejuani can go jungle. \"They can do every role.

Why do you think there's two high DPS champions picked in mid and adc role in every competitive game? To deal with the tanks, not because they're inherently strong. Kog is trash in solo queue but great in pro play for this reason. He shines when he has three targets to use his % damage against.

For 1 the adc has cheaper items so they will get there items faster.  (2) adc's have the mobility  to dodge skill shots and/or the cc to make sure the mage cant get away. \nEarly game the mage doesnt have the damage or the cd's to kill an adc.  Late game most mage will die if they miss a single ability or get cc'd.  Plenty of times i have seen even syndra die solo to the adc before her ult animation could even finish.

Unless ofcourse your a hard carry urself like azir ( mage adc) or GP ( aoe adc) ect.\n\nIf you pick a champ to kill the enemy adc then you have to perform otherwise playing a tank and peeling would of been better.
