Well , nobody can 1v1 me... except people who got sated devourer, who duel me without breaking a sweat, like {{champion:11}} {{champion:102}}  for instance. I understand that sated devourer should be strong to not push out of viability farming junglers, but that&#039;s too strong. I think something should be done, either give it an earlier powerspike for a less strong item overall, making those junglers relevant and willing to do sthg else than powerfarming throughout the game, or really make it stronger later.\r\nIdeas such as on-hit doubled every 3 autos instead of 2 sound good.\r\n\r\nI mean.. splitpushers/duellists like {{champion:24}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:77}} as toplaners just can not put any pressure in the map mid-late if they&#039;re matched against a Sated dev&#039; jungle, even when the sated jungler as a champion in general should be weaker 1 on 1 (they would lose without sated handily). Because they&#039;re just gonna get destroyed in 1 on 1, when in fact their whole kit relies on being able to put enough pressure to drag at least 2 or 3 people to deal with them, which is the whole purpose of splitpushing.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a 1v1 against 2 champions with optimal builds, the presence of a sated makes things so much different should not be.\r\nAKA without sated champion 1 destroys champion 2 ; if champion 2 has sated all of a sudden he destroys champion 1 easily.\r\nAlso, the item&#039;s damage is a bit too tank-melty, with its obvious synergy with botrk and mixed damage.\r\nAnyway, {{item:3153}} is a bit broken right now.","replies":[{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2015-08-16T03:48:39.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw a freaking Aatrox 1v3 with Sated Devourer recently.

The only problem i find though is how fast it scales in team fights. You can zone them and just destroy them completely no dragons, but if your teammates constantly misposition themselves or try to engage team fights, it can make all the hard work waisted.","replies":[]}]}
