The problem is that indirectly that put too much power in botlane (you know, game's decided by botlane most of the times) so if we can't just nerf supports, well... I guess adc's are the other thing we can touch (base kits or itemization, but knowing adc's, nerf their itemization and they'll just abuse other items not intended for them). And tbh, it's definitely not like adc's are in a weak spot at all, they've been meta for years after all.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Kaìju,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VsHBEuiE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-25T18:20:27.360+0000)\n>\n> Are you saying that marksmen should have their base resistances and HP lowered?\n\nYeah.

Nerfing the base defensive stats of adcs will result in 2 things. it will either kill off the marksman class, because they are already pretty squishy, or it will kill off alternative supports; supports without peeling/shielding.

Tank supports also have good ways of protecting their adc's, with just CC or actual protection mechanics like Tahm Devour, Braum's dash + bonus resists and his unbreakable, etc.\nThey can even take Guardian and locket which are powerful shield generators.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xToxicOsirisx","date":"2018-01-25T19:19:49.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shielding and healing are not a staple because other supports exist, such as brand, leona, or sion.
