This makes him able to get a full build without even needing a mana or manaregen component, so he can go for even more of a crazy scaling build.\r\nGiving him scaling manacosts could help limit that and force him to take {{item:3165}} or some other mana item that has less synergy (since CDR doesn&#039;t give him attackspeed anymore, for instance).\r\nOf course he&#039;s still very complicated to balance due to his incredible power status in competitive yet very low winrate otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2016-07-09T01:52:24.115+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am perfectly fine with Azir being a beast lategame.  The thing I dislike is that he is able to have a fairly safe earlygame and has access to too many tools during said earlygame.\n\nOne person suggested that we remove the damage on his Q and simply make it a re-positioning tool for his soldiers, an idea that I like quite a bit (of course he would need some buffs to compensate).  This would remove his burst potential (and significantly remove his earlygame presence, something that a lategame hypercarry really shouldn't have anyway)  while not really affecting his DPS (and I feel that DPS is farm more important for Azir's identity).","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2016-07-09T18:43:52.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please this.\n\nAnd this would kind of help easily redefine him since they'd be able to put a lot of power in to something else.
