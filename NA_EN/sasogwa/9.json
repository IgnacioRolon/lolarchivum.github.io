You don&#039;t need to make a very detailed tooltip about what champions you killed in particular, but at least show how much stacks you have on it would be a really great QOL change, and allow to better appreciate how good (or bad?) this mastery actually is.","replies":[{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2016-11-21T14:55:58.580+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing with \"Expose Weakness\".\n\nI still don't fully know how that thing works to this day...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-11-21T16:36:51.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always wonder whether you deal increased damage, too.
