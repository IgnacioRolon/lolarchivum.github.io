I play a lot of flex too so that might be why she doesnt cause many issues for me because two of the people I play with regularly play jungle and its easy to ask for a gank and just shut her down early. Shes useless if shes not ahead at any point.\nI guess its been my experience that the jungler and support beat cait, not the adc and I really dont see too much wrong with that.  Every class almost has that one champ that beats all the other in its class. She has some matchups where her synergy with her support is just nuts but shes not the only one.\nA good xayah with leona support or Jhin with Leona support is just as oppressive as she is with nautilus/thresh/blitz.
