I think it's perfectly fine to nerf FH, but giving it a little more lategame power (via the aura) seems a nice solution.\n\n(Don't worry, ADC will still be the carries that kinda melt tanks lategame, but it could be less obnoxious).\n\n\nStill, about Randuin's/Thornmail, if the passives are well-thought, I'm not sure the numbers are good. We'll have to wait live to test those items, because they could be underpowered due to too low numbers. But the idea behind the changes are good.\n\nAnd about {{item:3742}} , I think it's kinda like, the new randuin's. Stat-wise, it's stronger than new randuins, helps a bit with kite but gives only straight stats (health, armor) and no aura/passive that would scale well in lategame to reduce/turn against them carries DPS.

I think it's ok either one or the other is a must buy for heavy tanks and I'm sure it'll remain that way, but I think maybe they won't be rushed as the first item as frequently anymore.\n\nFrozen Heart has been nerfed in the past. Its passive used to be 20% (and even before, it was 25%). Meanwhile, Randuins also slowed movespeed of autoattackers [good old times where kiting wasn't so toxic once you had it :(  ], but its attack speed slow was less good.\nRight now, Randuins has health and crit chance reduction.\nBut yeah, Frozen Heart has CDR and mana.\nYet somehow, as it's been in the past that way, when I think about attack speed reduction items, I think more of {{item:3110}} than {{item:3143}} . The fact that Frozen Heart always applies in an aura, and Randuins doesn't also further shows that.\n\nAs for being rushed, I don't know about that. I feel like champions like {{champion:75}} / {{champion:14}} will want to get {{item:3110}} as soon as possible, even if nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2015-08-10T14:43:21.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sasogwa,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7oAOuhH7,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2015-08-10T14:38:45.668+0000)\n> As for being rushed, I don't know about that.

A number of top lane champs like Nasus or Maokai are ability reliant enough with high enough mana costs they're almost required to build FH or Righteous Glory.\n\nWhat I meant is we'll see more of different champions. Like Renekton with a dead man's plate against an AD top laner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
