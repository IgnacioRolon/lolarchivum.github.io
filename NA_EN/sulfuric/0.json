Cool. I figured this would be a good time to talk about some minor quality of life improvements that she could use.\n\n1) Mantra Q (Soulfire)\n\nProblem:\nCurrently, if Karma uses her mantra Q, and then dies, the circle that normally explodes after a short time actually disappears. Most champions have their abilities continue as normal if they die after casting them, and Karma should be no different. I've lost many kills where I could have traded if this didn't happen.\n\nFix:\n**Make it so if Karma dies after she uses Mantra Q, the circle still explodes and deals damage as normal.**\n(see bottom of post, apparently mantra Q circle doesn't disappear as much as I thought)\n\n2) Mantra casting\n\nProblem:\nKarma suffers from a problem that is inherently unique to her kit. She has an ability (mantra) that affects one of her other abilities but does nothing by itself. No other champions has this type of kit interaction. The problem is that in stressful situations, Karma has to press an extra key to use any of her empowered abilities. Sometimes I press R right before CC wears off and find myself using a normal ability instead of the empowered ability that I thought I used. Sometimes I'm milliseconds too late and I can't even cast the ability because I had to hit R first. Either way, it's very frustrating as a Karma player when my champion has to jump through an extra hoop just to get her to do what I want.\n\nFix:\n**Make it so that Karma can cast Mantra while affected by hard CC. **This means that if you get stunned, you can hit R, and then the instant you escape CC you can use the Mantra empowered ability you want. Riot has stated that \"fighting the game\" is an aspect they want to reduce/remove, and I feel like here we have that option.\nJust to clarify, I do NOT want to change Karma so she can cast a Mantra empowered ability during CC. I just want to change Mantra so it functions the same way Gangplank's W, Alistar's R, etc. all work (aka, castable during CC).\n\nThoughts, questions?\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nFollow up edit: I've been testing the Mantra Q disappear-after-death thing and it seems that it does not happen 100% of the time like I thought. I just want to correct that myself and say that it doesn't always disappear. I don't know if something has changed in a recent patch because I know I have seen this happen to me before, but perhaps it's already been fixed. I'm having a hard time replicating it by myself vs. minions/monsters, so it might be constricted to champion interactions. Anyway, the second part dealing with casting mantra during CC is what I REALLY want to change, the first part is more of what I consider a bug fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-09-11T17:30:13.074+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good suggestions, we'll get those in. \n\nI'd also like to highlight your approach with this post as really well done.

The weird thing is that RE gives a shield based on your R rank, so if you have leveled up your e enough, RE can actually provide a weaker shield than your standard e, thats why scarizard said that the initial target would get the base E shield plus the bonus shield value from R, and the rest of your allies in the AOE would get just the bonus R shield\n\nLastly i just wanted to say that Karma should have a haste animation, she was reworked right about the time where haste animations on every new champion was starting to be a thing, but its odd that she has a MS buff ability but doesn't have a haste animation herself, she just does her twisted fate jog.... but faster... (her run animation itself isn't all that pretty for the classy lady that karma is)  I think her haste or new run animation should get rid of the clenched fists, they make her seem tense which doesnt fit her character, i think open hand, flat palms would be better, and a sort of run where she kinda runs to her side with one arm across her chest and the other arm extended behind her would work\n\nsorry for such a long post, been playing karma for a long time and have always had these thoughts and ideas for my bad","replies":[]}]}
