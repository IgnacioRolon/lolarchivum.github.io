Even if I just want to click on my match history, it can take up to 5 minutes. This has been happening for the past month. I have Windows 10. Also, when I am able to join games (which is rare nowadays due to the client lag), my Windows task-bar will appear at the bottom of the screen, and I can't remove it no matter what I do. Can someone please help?","replies":[{"poster":"0someone0","date":"2016-10-17T05:11:33.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the blinking happens to me too","replies":[{"poster":"Retrovert","date":"2016-10-17T05:56:35.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=0someone0,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7L7U6p3W,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-17T05:11:33.374+0000)\n>\n> the blinking happens to me too\n\nI hope something can be done about this!
