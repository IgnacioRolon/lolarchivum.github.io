The fact they don't have feeding considered into being toxic is baffling. Feeding is just as bad as flaming teammates and most players will agree. Not trying to win a game is basically throwing and should be considered toxic. Fuck Riot they don't have a definitive stance on anything. They let cheaters and public known flamers and re-endorse them like NIghtblue, game is shit and the community is worse.

Better people at that time have endorsed this company so much more and it is very sad to see it come down to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-13T16:45:14.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, he also recieved a unique punishment which they hadn't completely determined the rules surrounding it prior.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-09-13T01:03:20.648+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Intentional Feeding can and will be punished.
