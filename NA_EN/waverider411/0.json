This player then ran it down several more times dying on purpose and flamed our team. i did not use profanity, racism, or pick on an innocent player. i clearly stated to a player that openly stated in chat that their intent was to throw the game for us that if they continue to negatively impact the game for myself and others that i will report them for doing so.\r\n\r\nPre-Game Chat\r\n[2019-10-20 16:15:03 PDT] waverider411: bot\r\nIn-Game Chat\r\n[0:25] waverider411 (Morgana): invade?\r\n[1:42] waverider411 (Morgana): naw just be here when the game starts\r\n[1:47] waverider411 (Morgana): not 2 min in\r\n[4:34] [All] waverider411 (Morgana): how many heals did u get right there wtf\r\n[6:09] waverider411 (Morgana): u throw youre getting reported olaf\r\n[6:21] waverider411 (Morgana): u already said u can make it happen in chat\r\n[6:41] [All] waverider411 (Morgana): olaf in now inting\r\n[6:51] [All] waverider411 (Morgana): gotta love 3v3s..\r\n[7:20] waverider411 (Morgana): u already said u can make it happen so the other team wins i have it in chat\r\n[7:44] waverider411 (Morgana): your inting\r\n[7:52] waverider411 (Morgana): enjoy the ban\r\n[8:05] waverider411 (Morgana): nope\r\n[8:11] waverider411 (Morgana): im tired of ppl like u inting tho\r\n[8:20] waverider411 (Morgana): then play for real\r\n[9:37] [All] waverider411 (Morgana): i have popped off on him at all this kid is a troll\r\n[9:59] waverider411 (Morgana): excuses\r\n[10:23] waverider411 (Morgana): no we arent..\r\n[10:38] waverider411 (Morgana): yeah youre reported XD\r\n[11:10] waverider411 (Morgana): yes please continue give me more to report you for\r\n[11:34] waverider411 (Morgana): i have it.. and ur\r\n[11:53] waverider411 (Morgana): and ur chat screen shotted\r\n[12:14] waverider411 (Morgana): u sound like a child please stop\r\n[14:06] waverider411 (Morgana): i havent said anything about rumble\r\n[14:10] waverider411 (Morgana): he wants to end cause of you\r\nPost-Game Chat\r\n[2019-10-20 16:34:41 PDT] waverider411: 3v3s is so toxic\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the game had finished i received a chat restriction and penalties to my account dropping me from honor 5 to honor 1 with a lock preventing me from gaining honor or receiving rewards until it was removed. With it being the end of the season it is impossible for me to acquire honor level 2 in time for the end of the season meaning all the positive behavior ive displayed during the whole season has been thrown away, while someone who was actually toxic during the season is able to raise their honor level back up and acquire the end of season rewards due to them not having such time restraints. i filed an appeal to riot support asking why ive been punished for my chat and was told the following\r\n\r\n''The thing is chat is in the game to help your team and to be a positive encouraging force, not to police others. We handle that part with the Instant Feedback System! If someone is breaking the rules, all you need to do is report them after the game!''\r\n\r\nRiot support is telling its players that they're not allowed to stand up to dishonorable behavior even if its in a way that doesn't use profanity , racism, or harsh words. i feel that this instance is not being looked at fully and that i am just being pushed aside into the pile of report appeals. i have never received any form of negative punishment or feedback towards my account and ive played since season 2. Riot support is supposed to be their to help their players but right now i dont feel very supported. All i did was ask this player to follow the rules and stop negatively impacting the game for us or that ill have to report them for doing so. i have also received these comments within my ticket...\r\n\r\nSanguinedogma states the restrictions were issued due to the following but i disagree,\r\n''After reviewing your account, I can see that this chat restriction was correctly placed for negative chat behavior. Specifically, for arguing with your teammates, calling them out on their performance, or for making a mistake, and contributing to an overall negative game atmosphere that impacted your fellow Summoners.''\r\n\r\nFor starters i didnt argue with that player i repeated myself that ill report them if they continue to openly feed which they said in chat they were going to make happen. Secondly, i wasnt calling someone out on their performance, i told them to stop inting because they said they were going to int then ran it down a few times. Third, i couldnt of called them out for making a mistake when it clearly isnt a mistake if theyre saying in chat that its their intent before they do it. Lastly, how can telling a player who is openly saying that theyre going to negatively impact the game for the whole team to stop negatively impacting the game for others? am i not allowed to defend myself or other players?\r\n\r\nThe Orphan also states that\r\n''It's best to avoid telling other players you're reporting them or telling another player to \"report X player\" as it takes away from focusing on the game and other players start arguing about who should report who, what's 'reportable,' etc. We only need one report to take action on a player, so as long as you report them after the game you don't need to ask for more or threaten a player you're reporting them.''\r\n\r\nI didnt tell anyone else to report this player i said i was going to if they continued to purposely ruin our teams experience. This is saying players arent allowed to state that theyre going to report another player which is wrong. How are you going to censor or punish someone for non-offensive speech, when im saying im going to report a player for truthful and intentional negative behavior which not only negatively impacted the game for myself but our fellow teammates loosing them LP in the process. Its not threatening another player if theyre at fault, i would understand the punishment if i was picking on a innocent player but in this instance that is not the case. i was openly enforcing the rules and im now being punished for it.","replies":[{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2019-11-04T23:17:17.490+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why are you needed to \"stand up for the rules\"?

It's not to be confused with getting the most amount of honor yourself. I've seen many players recovering from a punishment but don't honor others cos they thought everyone else is trash. They just stunted their own honor progress by not getting the team honor bonus. Honor someone at the end of the game. Encourage others to honor someone (don't go gloating about others needing to honor yourself, that will just repel others away from honoring), like that top laner that was feeding but still kept it going and not gave up, or the tank just sacrifaced himself so the team can run the enemy over.\n\nHonors progress is gated by both game time and real time.

The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2019-11-04T23:53:35.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"waverider411","date":"2019-11-05T00:00:25.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Silly Neeko,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sfRfvkUa,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-11-04T23:53:35.614+0000)\n>\n> Ive had a similar experience but fortunately for me it was near summer of last year so i could get my rewards back up.
