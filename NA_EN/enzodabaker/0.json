I guess that \"compensation buff\" for removing DFG is working as planned.. If you guys think this wasn't a planned nerf to protect their LCS reel then you must not know riot. Even newbies can understand when you nerf his ult, remove his poke, increase his late game CD for Q, and nerf his stun. These are obviously nerfs, not compensation. Yes he did get mana upgrades that he needed and he will have much fun farming for 30 mins using it. Because he can't do anything else anymore. 32%... Are you kidding me? He was WELL below the top tiers in win % before this nerf. LCS protection, protect that reel! Next up, LB/Kat/Zed buff, cuz..

You can no longer poke an enemy with it because he's smart enough to just sit behind the line which reduces his Q to a farming tool only. What other poke does he have after this is removed? His W? It doesn't land unless the player is stunned and you can no longer stun a player because they can simply walk away after the telegraphed location is given. \n\nW's straight numeric buff is worthless if your stun has been greatly nerfed.\n\nR - 20% extra AP is a huge bonus when facing NON ap chars in game, which is usually about 60-80% of the characters in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
