Both typically build a healthy mix of defensive and offensive items based on the situation. Both propel themselves into the front line. Both make excellent use of crowd control and/or sustain.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s where I think they differ! Bruisers are tanky assassins and Tanks are tanky supports. Bruisers are looking to safely create picks, using their burst, dps, and CC to get priority targets low enough for their team to murder. Tanks are creating zones of control which enemies cannot safely move past without killing the Tank.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples: Jarvan and Wukong are Bruisers. Sion and Nautilus are Tanks.\r\n\r\nJarvan and Wukong can recklessly jump into a fight and use their damage heavy CC on priority targets, but can do almost nothing to prevent an enemy bruiser or assassin from doing the same. Sion and Nautilus have some pick potential, but are hindered by unreliable burst and low dps, making them easily kited. However, they do have strong tools for counter-engaging, peeling for priority targets, and causing attrition damage which generally stops enemy bruisers and assassins from doing anything.\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s my rule of thumb: If you&#039;d rather the enemy pick Zed over Ezreal, you&#039;re a tank. If you&#039;d rather the enemy pick Ezreal over Urgot, you&#039;re a Bruiser.\r\n\r\nTell me if you agree or if I&#039;m completely wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-05-05T13:05:17.038+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that there is no real definition for either.\nEveryone uses his own definitions of tanks/bruisers/fighters.\n\nMy definitions would be:\n\nTanks: Tanky, high cc/utillity, good burst, low dps.\nExamples:{{champion:12}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:89}} ...\n\nBruiser: Tanky, high dps with good aoe, low cc, no/few gapclosers.\nExamples:{{champion:86}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:102}} ...\n\nFighter: Tanky, High singletarget dps with good burstspikes, good offensive gapcloseing, a bit cc. Examples:{{champion:107}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:39}} ...\n\nLight Fighter: Lowish tankiness, high mobillity and other tools to avoid damage, high damage, low cc.\nExample:{{champion:91}}  {{champion:114}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:92}}... \n\nI seperated into those 4 groups as they differ quite a bit in their playstyle.\nMost champions are a bit off a mix between those classes anyway. Amumu for example is a Tank that gets quite close to bruisers with the constant aoe damage from W and the low cd E, while Jarvan is kinda tank/fighter hybrid, good cc/utillity and burst with good gapcloseing+singletarget dps.\nAlso, many champs are kinda in between fighter/ligth fighter and it's mostly their itembuilts that pushes them to eitehr side.\nA full off pant would be a light fighter by my definitions, but a tanky pant would be a fighter.\n\nP.S: I would cry if i play a bruiser and the enemie picks ezreal, bruisers are very vulnerable to kiteing, and Ez is the lord of kiteing...Killing the likes of ez is a job for Assasins like Talon","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-05-06T00:45:23.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon is an assassin, not a light fighter. The difference between light fighters and assassins, IMO, is in their burst and ability to deal sustained damage. Riven's sustained damage is nuts; if you let her keep Qing/Eing and weaving autoattacks she hurts like hell. But her burst (highest damage output in the first 2 seconds of a fight) is nothing special compared to an assassin like LeBlanc or Talon. She can 100-0 people after weaving a few autos, but not instantly delete someone before they can move like LeBlanc or Talon can. Meanwhile, after Talon whacks someone, all he does is auto until his abilities come off CD again.\n\nYi is classified as assassin but I'd say he's a light fighter or even regular fighter with high sustained DPS if built bruiser. Fiora is probably only a light fighter or assassin. Riven is the icon of a light fighter. I'd put Yasuo as a light fighter, since his burst is nothing special but his sustained damage with crits and Q is nuts. AD Fizz was definitely a fighter, while AP Fizz is an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-05-06T01:19:48.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the point there is no clear classification, the taggs riot gives are hardly enough.\nAs i said, those are my definitions, and one could eventuallly add assasins and meleecarrys to lightfighters, haveing only those who can aswell be fighters with a more tanky built as lightfighters, but assasins aren't that different, they have everything in common with my classification of light fighters, just that assasins deal burst damage while meleecarrys focus on dps, but both are squishy, slippery, with low cc high overall damage and try to either find a 1v1, get a flank and kill the backline or come for cleanup, so i didn't feel the need to really seperate them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-05-05T08:06:34.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The term \"Bruiser\" is an old tag for what Riot now officially classifies as \"Fighters\". It all comes down to what their job in the game is, and how they typically accomplish this.\n\nFrom the description of Fighter on the Wiki:\n>Fighters can build to be extremely survivable, but the key distinction between tanky fighters and true tanks is that tanks are designed to draw damage and disrupt enemies, while fighters deal damage.\n\nThey can both initiate, may have CC, but the \"rule of thumb\" you're looking for is: After the shit hits the fan, what are they doing? If you're a Fighter, like Kha'Zix, after the fight starts you try to dish out as much damage as possible or seeking out targets. If you're a Tank, like Braum, you are sticking near your allies and defending them either through direct protection (such as spell shields or health shields).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2015-05-05T08:57:01.407+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Tank:**\n\n- Tanky\n- Low burst damage\n- Decent sustained damage (over time threat)\n- A ton of long and/or AoE CC and/or utility\n- Usually, 0-1 offensive items\n- Better with early defense than early offense\n\n\n**Bruiser:**\n\n- Tanky\n- Decent burst damage\n- Good sustained damage\n- Single target CC, less utility\n- Usually 1-2 offensive items, or 2 semi-offensive ones\n- Works both with early offense and early defense\n\n**Fighter:**\n\n- Robust (good base tankiness)\n- Good burst damage\n- Good sustained damage\n- Short, interruptive or conditional CCs, low team-focused utility\n- 1-3 defensive items, preferably build later\n\nExamples:\n\nTanks:\n{{champion:154}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:14}} (edging towards being a bruiser)\n\nBruisers:\n{{champion:59}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:421}} \n\nFighters:\n{{champion:92}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:23}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeeDrakon","date":"2015-05-05T10:47:17.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"IMO tanks DONT build offensive items since they dont scale with AD/AP very well.
