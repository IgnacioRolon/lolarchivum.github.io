Lucian should not be getting beaten IN LANE by Vayne, and yet he is. Hard. I&#039;m confused as to what Riot&#039;s philosophy on nerfing every early game ADC was. Did they really not expect hypercarries to become fucking broken?\n\nSo Lucian is supposed to be a lane bully. Well, that goes out the window with 30% passive scaling until level 6 and 500 range.\n\nHe&#039;s supposed to be mobile enough to out-maneuver Vayne and most other ADCs, right?\nVayne Q: 6 sec. CD and a 30% AD boost on next AA\nLucian E: 18 sec. CD (that can be reduced but requires a huge amount of mana and an all-in) and a 30% AD boost on next AA\n\nAt max rank, it's even worse.\n\nVayne Q: 2 sec. CD and a 50% AD boost on next AA\nLucian E: 14 sec. CD and a 50%/60% AD boost on next AA\n\nMidgame, where he&#039;s supposed to spike. Well, that&#039;s kinda hard when you get bullied EARLY BY A LATEGAME CHAMPION.\n\nHis lategame is utter trash. While Vayne is stealthing every 2 seconds, doing %hp true damage, and stunning people, Lucian is trying to dash into range without being blown up or CC&#039;ed to death. Did I mention his Ult, which is only good for clearing waves and poking, has a 20 sec longer CD than Vayne&#039;s Ult, which lets her carry a teamfight almost on her own?\n\nOh, Lucian gets a MS boost if he uses his no damage W AND gets in range to AA? That&#039;s fucking cute, Vayne has a permanent 30 MS boost that TRIPLES TO 90 when ulting just for moving towards an enemy champion.\n\nEither buff Lucian and other ADCs (significantly) or NERF VAYNE. Botlane is a complete fuckfest thanks to Rito nerfing every single ADC as soon as they became FOTM aside from Vayne.\n\nOh, and here's a fun fact: Vayne has a higher winrate than Lucian at 20 minutes (against ALL champions, mot just this matchup), and maintains it regardless of how long the game goes. Let's not even mention the fact that she's almost three times as popular. \"weak in lane\", huh?","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-09-11T00:09:39.869+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a nerf Vayne or a buff Lucian thread?","replies":[{"poster":"PerishSoftly","date":"2015-09-11T00:37:05.989+0000","up_votes":114,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes","replies":[{"poster":"kusagari77","date":"2015-09-11T03:40:59.043+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:45}}  YES, HAHAHAHAHAH","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TacoTheKitten","date":"2015-09-11T04:15:06.045+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/35476703/images/1413135360324.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2015-09-11T00:32:10.604+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"Either/or","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-09-11T03:14:47.181+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daedalus871,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YEmlGzNA,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-09-11T00:09:39.869+0000)\n>\n> Is this a nerf Vayne or a buff Lucian thread?\n\n**why not both**","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-09-11T01:27:39.690+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probably a little of a nerf Ahri thread too because why not.","replies":[{"poster":"DrNova","date":"2015-09-11T02:15:25.913+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's not forget poor Vlad, everyone jumped ship on that QQ train","replies":[{"poster":"Ancestor007","date":"2015-09-11T05:11:44.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And maybe for Zed and Lee.","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2015-09-11T05:36:06.117+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"so lemme get this straight. this  comment thread is actually a nerf vayne buff lucian buff ahri buff vlad and nerf zed and lee comment thread?","replies":[{"poster":"Ancestor007","date":"2015-09-11T06:02:49.522+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also add some.","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2015-09-11T06:05:15.501+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"SWEET lets nerf naut i dont like the way he looks at me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ancestor007","date":"2015-09-11T06:42:59.806+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or maybe let's nerf vel'koz bekoz schoolgirl skin incoming","replies":[{"poster":"Punkkee","date":"2015-09-11T06:45:57.874+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"let's nerf vel'koz bekoz\"\nupvoted for play on words","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-09-10T23:13:16.261+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":50,"body":"Differences in player skill tends to matter more in Bronze, Silver, Gold, and even Platinum than differences in champion strength, unless the difference is overwhelming.\n\nMostly because mistakes in positioning, decision-making, or mechanics will have more effect on the match than the champions in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2015-09-10T23:14:23.655+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":3,"body":"Vayne has a 54.75% winrate vs Lucian in Plat+ as well.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-09-10T23:15:46.781+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":24,"body":"And how does that result in you losing lane to Vayne in Silver?\n\nI'm not commenting on Vayne or Lucian's balance; I'm saying that any difference in the strength of the champion is not why you, personally, lost lane to Vayne as Lucian.\n\nSupports typically have more effect on the matchup during laning phase than the ADC anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Alpharite","date":"2015-09-10T23:17:03.469+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"The anecdote of me losing to a Vayne was simply a starting point.

This means nothing for when she's running away. So once she starts losing the trade and tries to back off, Lucian can stick on her for more free damage. That's not even counting support influence. Landing a Thresh hook or Nami bubble early game is devastating. \n\nAs for the other points you mentioned:\nStealth- Seriously drop a pink ward. Instantly regains all the DPS you would lose while she's in stealth (for 1 second, mind you).  Now she's suddenly within close range of you and if you or your support is competent at all she's an easy target for CC/ultimates/burst. \n%hp true damage- This has been addressed before, but to squishies, the base damage on the ability is more impactful than the true damage itself. In fact, true damage makes up very little of her damage output. Meanwhile a champion like Lucian who may not be rushing BORK is building something like IE instead, which means more raw damage with less penetration. Surprisingly Vayne is squishy.\nMove speed: They changed it so that allies can also proc w's move speed bonus, so that should help. Also, Lucian can use Culling as he's running/dashing away. You may say that it's only for wave clear, but throw the whole ult in the face of the Vayne who just tumbled to try to chase you down and suddenly the fight doesn't look so great for her at 1/2 - 1/3 health. \n\nBut no we're all idiots sorry.
