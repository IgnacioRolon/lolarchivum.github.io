The OP is saying that Riot needs to act faster when balancing champions who are obviously out of line.  And he's correct.  Some champs just spend weeks and months being broken or 'strictly better than' other champs in that role; they don't have a niche, they're just good all the time - like Lucian is now and has been for months - and that's a problem that needs to be rectified sooner than what it has been.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-06-01T05:40:37.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude it's the very next patch.\n\nYes he's very strong, but he wasn't full on insane nuts broken (he's less powerful than current state Zed) nor as in dire need of buffs as Taliyah(who got a hotfix).\n\nNext patch is pretty soon be patient a little.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2016-05-31T17:44:36.581+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"As I have said in many threads, Lucian is *being* addressed in 6.11.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Girard","date":"2016-05-31T16:02:34.442+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have never had a problem against Lucian, ever.
