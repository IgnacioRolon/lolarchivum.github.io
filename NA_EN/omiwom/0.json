It is those differences that make Kalista stronger overall.  If you limited her stacks and took away the slow on Rend, and she becomes weaker overall, then maybe she deserves a bit of tweaking on how much stronger she gets to be in that mechanic.","replies":[{"poster":"MidEvilKnight3k","date":"2015-03-24T09:42:28.143+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":3,"body":"There is no reason to compare single mechanics.  Champions have a certain power budget, and while most people agree that Kalista is over-tuned, that does not change anything.  They wanted kalista to be a high mobility, good utility, and lower damage carry.  They also decided to make her damage very back loaded.  As opposed front loaded damage like graves, or consistent damage like Vayne.  \n\nWhen they look at what needs to be done with Kalista, first they need to decide if the mobility is just too much and needs nerfed, or if the damage needs nerfed to compensate for allowing the mobility.  If they determine that her damage needs nerfed, then they need to decide if they want to take away from her sustained damage, or if they want to take away from the back loaded damage of rend.  \n\nIf they decided to take the damage from rend, then there is less of an incentive to save the stacks and Kalista might start using the rend primarily for the slow and she would still have her sustained damage.  So maybe instead they should leave rend very strong and just nerf her numbers. That way Kalista would still have to make the decision between the slow and damage at times.\n\nTwitch has absolutely nothing to do with the process of deciding what to do with Kalista.  Who cares if one champion has a similar mechanic on an ability.  And who cares if one of the abilities is clearly way stronger.  It does not even matter which champion is stronger overall.  Why limit yourself to designing a champion because of another champion?  As I already said, Twitch has way more damage overall, it's just that twitches damage is not focused on contaminate.

Right now, most of Kalista's damage comes from E. But that's because build attack speed and Hurricane. Give some actual ad to Kalista, and you'll have a by-the-book ADC.\n\nThen again, twitch has a dot versus a %hp proc. Twich has an aoe ultimate where Kalista has a team-utility and engage tool. \nKalista has more utility (which is completely unrelated to her mobility) where Twitch has damage. Both have a on-hit steroid but twitch is probably the strongest there.\n\nI htink Kalista and twitch have similar damage potential.
