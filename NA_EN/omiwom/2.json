Are you serious? 3 seconds or not, put it in a place where you think the fight/teamfight will happen and kill everyone. Stun and shield which is both bs if you land it. Besides, just build him tank and you would still do dmg with all your abilities. I tried it once... kinda worked... also I hate his ult, so very annoying playing against him. Back to his w, nerf his shield please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-06-21T15:52:21.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind the stun if he didn't also have 3 slows and almost as much damage as other assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malyshev","date":"2015-06-21T14:02:41.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's too long.
