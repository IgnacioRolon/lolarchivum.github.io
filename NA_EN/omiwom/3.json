It leads ppl to believe the game is still as it was when it released...where the entire game was focused around protecting the ADC and letting them do all the dmg. The game is much different now and ADC's arent really relied upon to be the teams only dmg source. But either way. i agree. I dont like it being called \"BOT\" either","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgentBlack","date":"2016-01-14T20:09:13.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they're moving towards more options for bot lane than just Marksman.
