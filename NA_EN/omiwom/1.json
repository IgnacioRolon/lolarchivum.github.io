Adc's are the strongest damage dealers late game because of their massive multiplicative scaling with AD, AS, and Crit, especially crit. Kalista, however, typically builds Runaan's instead of PD, which gives her 20% more AS but 35% less Crit.

I get what you mean by its one of her abilities, but its mostly just gated by cooldowns and has a second portion that doesnt have a mana cost. I consider that a \"free\" ability because it costs her almost nothing to use it and she loses nothing strategically(mana/combat effectiveness) And yes, most energy champions by that definition would fall under free with the exception of Shen and a couple others but thats part of the reason I think those champions have balance problems when they are strong in the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Aych Pii","date":"2015-06-12T13:30:58.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She loses combat effectiveness because she could potentially have a combat ability in that slot.

Building {{item:3085}} instead of {{item:3046}} has serious tradeoffs, namely that she's a far worse duelist and is far weaker at burning through tanks compared to a normal adc. Kalista does have rend, yes, but she wants to use it as an execute, which isn't nearly as effective against tanks, and you can't heal off of rend damage unless you have red elixir.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2015-06-11T12:53:53.413+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":">  far weaker at burning through tanks compared to a normal adc.\n\nHigh attack speed build, and I have yet to see a Kalista that doesn't build {{item:3153}}.
