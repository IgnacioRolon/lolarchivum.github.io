If there is anything that is so inherently broken it needs to be banned every game, than the champion should be disabled.  \n\nYou can build strategies around assuming that certain champions won't be in a game, or decide to try a more uncommon strategy by making sure your counter won't be in the game.  \n\nHaving more bans would likely expand the meta.  When you have so many high priority picks that they essentially become pick or ban status, people are forced to play them just to ensure the other team doesn't.   If you were able to ban out all of those, lesser played champs would be by default get played more, and you would end up with a lot more variety in the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2016-05-12T16:13:16.373+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why not give everyone 1 ban to deal with 1 less thing that they hate?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WarlockLaw","date":"2016-05-12T19:20:07.326+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The guy didn't even talk about 'strong' champions or what people banned.

With the precedent of raising bans the first time, Riot should still be open to raising the bans again, and the last time was based on numbers of champions in game, not number of 'OP' champs. \n\nIf we had more bans, you would have a better chance at getting to ban Blitz. If you dislike playing against him so much this should be a good thing for you. This goes for any other champ that players dislike seeing in game. More bans = better chance for something you dislike getting banned out. \n\nIf I were to take your final argument seriously, I could take it a step further and say that we should reduce or remove bans. If bans just change the number of 'OP' champs, then we may as well not have the bans to begin with. If League is balanced well, no bans wouldn't really change anything just like adding more won't either.\n\nFor reference, Smite has 76 gods in their game, but this season they upped their bans to 4 for each team, 8 total. This change allows players to more easily ban out counter strategies to their team comps, or at the very least allows each lane and jungle a personal ban (assuming team coordination). They have about 60 less playable characters then League does, but they get more bans.

The majority of tournament magic is standard. It's the main supported constructed format. And the most played format in any organized play by a wide majority. The only thing that would compete with it is draft, which is a limited format. To put that in LOL terms, standard is comparable to summoners rift with draft being like aram.","replies":[{"poster":"JESUSSAYSNO","date":"2016-05-13T17:10:00.863+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DaSarcasticGuy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=307T8zym,comment-id=00130000,timestamp=2016-05-13T09:46:34.107+0000)\n>\n> Please don&#x27;t use examples about stuff you clearly know nothing about.

Yes if you are aware of the bane change than it would make sense, except he tried to say that type 2 and standard were 2 different formats when they would be the exact same thing if type 2 was still a name that was used. The face that the name type 2 was retired 10-15 years ago means that most people aren't aware of it.

This never happens in low Elo because you usually can't put together a coherent team comp with clear counters before the ban phase, and rarely happens at the pro level because the pros know who they're fighting and ban to intentionally weaken the enemy team comp.  Allowing each person to ban would allow them to do a better job of preventing themselves from getting countered.\n\nThe other issue is that so many people are convinced that first pick has some huge advantage and use that as an excuse to not give them a ban, which is only partly true.  First pick gets to pick whoever the hell they want, but they also give the entire enemy team the opportunity to counter pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2016-05-12T21:57:59.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"12 bans how about we ban all of the junglers? or all of the supports? how about we ban out an entire role of the game all the adcs?","replies":[{"poster":"SlaktarTasken","date":"2016-05-12T22:15:20.170+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blank jungler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=307T8zym,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2016-05-12T21:57:59.523+0000)\n>\n> 12 bans how about we ban all of the junglers? or all of the supports? how about we ban out an entire role of the game all the adcs?\n\nConsidering how many there are of each champion type that isn't possible even with 12 bans, and even if it was, would it be so damn horrible to for once see a game without an ADC?

The only way to not have an adc, is to create a new class of champion that achieves a similar outcome. Mid has assassins for killing and mages for utility/control; an adc does the killing so perhaps some sort of ad/ap utility caster that can hit towers?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
