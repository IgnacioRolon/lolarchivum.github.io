While the West Coast used to be privileged to the low ping and local LCS broadcasts, I was wondering if any of this would change. 30 additional ping may not seem to be a very large increase to many of us Plebs, but as MonteCristo pointed out that many of the Korean and Chinese teams play right outside the servers in their respected region, with ping as low as 8 (allegedly).
