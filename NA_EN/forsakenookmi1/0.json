However, this policy was not conducive to reforming the player, as they'd keep abusing their limited chat and stack up hundreds or thousands of chat restrictions (essentially being permanently chat restricted).\n\nThe only way to improve the behavior of someone unaffected by their chat restriction is to increase the penalty to something worse, and ultimately remove them entirely if they continue to be a problem. That is why Riot is not looking for any way to keep toxic players in the community and does not consider permanent chat restrictions anymore. **Of course, policies can change, but there's no sign of that happening anytime soon.**\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/q7NYtdkw-uplift-my-permaban?comment=0003000100010000000100020001\n\nIf you have some sort of condition which makes it more difficult to refrain from taking out your frustration in chat you should consider getting help and talking to your family about it, but otherwise it would be a good idea to take measures to prevent yourself from typing, such as moving your chat window off the screen, using a 3rd party keyboard app to rebind your Enter key, or editing the config file to shrink the chat window down to nothing. If you're feeling frustrated, don't queue up for another game just yet! Take a break and cool down and come back when you're feeling composed.","replies":[{"poster":"eazymakaveli3","date":"2017-04-19T05:10:17.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"come on, you know nobody ever \"reforms\". thats just a bullsht reason to please the 10 year olds buying skins.\n\nalso, the \"toxic players lose 24% more games\" fact or some shyt like that is bullshyt. have you ever thought that, maybe, people are toxic BECAUSE they lose, not the way around???? lel","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-18T19:24:14.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They have tried infinitely stacking chat bans in the past, effectively making them permanent, and the majority of players affected turned to displaying their toxicity through gameplay rather than chat.\n\nI am sorry that you have an issue with anger, but Riot has put their foot down and said that their chat system is not the place for you to take it out. You can yell at your monitor, put something soft near you to throw, or something else, but by raging in chat you are causing people to quit this game and are therefore losing income for Riot. (although with the outlook they have shown to the public they would be more concerned about the damage to the player experience than the income, but they are a company so who knows) If you did that in any self respecting establishment they would escort you out as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Undying Noxian","date":"2017-04-19T05:09:11.665+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"League is they only competitive game with this much of a spineless community, look at any other competitive came.
