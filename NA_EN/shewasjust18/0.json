I am just wondering this because maybe you're in a ranked match and someone on your team has skype or discord or even teamspeak and you wanted to add them. And you cant? This is really curious from me. Just wondering! Thanks! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T22:58:52.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not on the team that works with and develops the new client, so I can't really speculate on this.
