Does anyone know how to fix this glitch. Basically me and my friends played a game but then enemy ziggs disconnected and then they remake. So after that I just skip the stats and went straight to a new game inviting my friends. BUT then I couldn't invite anyone so I thought it was the client that was lagging so I left and reloaded the client. However instead of allowing me to play it puts me into reconnect screen and opens a game THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST!!!! Anyone know how to fix this? PLZ help will greatly appreciate.","replies":[{"poster":"hoopyfromspace","date":"2017-09-20T23:19:07.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep guess I just had to be patient thx :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T23:00:01.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of these reconnect issues today have been caused by ghost games. Essentially you're right, the game doesn't exist anymore, but the end of the game was never properly recorded to the servers. It should clear up after enough time though, have you been able to get back in yet?","replies":[]}]}
