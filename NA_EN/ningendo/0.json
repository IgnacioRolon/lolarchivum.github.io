It has to be something on the subconscious level that makes us say WOW this sound is cool, or this sound is meh. So you sound guys have probably studied hard and scientifically determined how to make the best sounds .... right? \n\nBut yeh some sounds send shivers down my spine or puts a huge GRIN on my face. I urge you guys to make all ULTS sound distinctive and satisfying to use. Basic abilities can maintain their mundane audio, but i think ALL ults should have some sick/ spectacular sound effects that raise some sort of emotion.\n\nObviously I have no idea how any of this sound production work.

The whole team remembers the sounds of games when we were younger and it's such a huge privilege to be in the position of creating those aural blueprints for others.\n\nBut trust me, no sound is mundane.
