I have downloaded the hextech repair tool, re-patched, repaired, flushed dns, followed all the articles in the support section and after no results I've made a support ticket and I'm posting this.\n\n1.) It takes up anywhere between 1-2 Mbps bandwith (never seen that before) while I'm logged in and the client is doing nothing(not streaming videos in the client or thereof)\n\n2.) When trying to create games my screen freezes quite often, I get dc'd from pvp.net, my chat lags.\n\n3.) When I click accept the screen often freezes till end of champ select. Sometimes even after I've dodged(not intentionally but due to the freeze) my screen remains frozen.\n\n4.) I can't even view my own profile, it takes too long to load and then I get a \"Unknown Error\"\n\n5.) Sometimes even viewing what my friends have put up as their status takes forever to load and leads to an unkown erorr.\n\n6.) When I start a ranked or draft game it takes forever for the game to process my roles (just selection my roles in the pregame lobby) and it usually lags out.\n\n7.) After I start que'ing for a game, once the \"waiting for other players\" sign comes up, where you click accept. Even though I click accept, the boxes where it shows the other players who have accepted/denied never shows up. However the clock keeps moving until it stops. It stays this way for a minute or so before the game get's disbanded even though I spam click accept. Usually results in an \"unkown error\" message showing up.\n\n8.) I cannot access the store. Every time I click on the store I get either an unknown error(This error spams itself on me like one of those annoying mackeeper ads got to closes it 3-4 times before it closes) or I disconnect from pvp.net.\n\n9.) Once inside the chat room of a game (so far tested only on aram) I can't swap champions (Icon not available), enable skin boots (Icon is disabled), and I stay in the lobby even though the game count down has ended.\n\nOnce in game there aren't any problems whatsoever (No FPS drop, no lag, no problems at all..), but everything till there creates errors.  All my drivers are up to date (Nvidia, BIOS, etc. Updated yesterday through the dell/alienware website) All requested logs have been attatched in a support ticket (uploaded a day ago with all information). I have also posted the same on forums under support, another player also confirmed he's facing similar issues. \n\nKindly help soon! \n\nThank you!\n\nTl;dr: Client keeps crashing, taking up high bandwith even though the client seems to be doing nothing ;3\n\nEdit: Have been reading all the posts(tried the past 3 pages of red advice) on the support forum since this has started as well as googling this problem and trying solutions. No solutions so far\n\nEdit 2: Point no. 9.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-25T23:13:38.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a rather complicated list of symptoms.

For the life of me I can't figure out why any of this is happening..\n\nHowever I have come across a few posts that mention similar problems. I'm not sure if they face all the problems listed above(which would mean this isn't just my client but perhaps a bug of sorts) or if the just face a single problem. \n\nI hope they're able to find and fix it!","replies":[]}]}]}
