None.  Everything that has to be communicated can be done through a ping.**\r\n\r\nThis is the only thing I can think of that would improve the atmosphere in ranked games.  In the current iteration of ranked games with chat it is always the same two scenarios:\r\n\r\n* **Win** - Everyone congratulates the team, some honor is given out, everyone moves on.\r\n* **Lose** - Finger pointing, rage, name calling, people being called &#039;bad&#039;, some get reported, no one gets banned, everyone moves on.\r\n* The only variation of this is when the team rages at each other during the game, but still manages to win.\r\n\r\nI play ranked because I want my time spent to have meaning.  Normals are great to have for learning a champion, but I would rather try to climb the ranks.  Something I noticed was the difference in attitude in ranked v normal.  Normal games seem to be better all around with communication, teamwork and keeping the rage to a minimum.  Ranked games are the total opposite.  If you have played more than 5 ranked games, you know what I am talking about. \r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that it all stems from chat.  If we removed chat, then the players could focus more on their game play.  This only needs to be done in Ranked.\r\n\r\nMy Proposal:      \r\n\r\n* **After minions spawn, remove chat from the game.**\r\nOR  \r\n* **Give the players an option to remove chat in their settings.**\r\n\r\nI know I could just mute people pre-game, but I would rather see Riot acknowledge and address the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-15T23:14:04.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay this is all a rage post.\n\n\"No point in communication, it can be done through pings\" Really which ping is there for when TP is up? When a flash is down? When you need to back for big item? How do you communicate you need the person with TP to push bot and be ready to TP to baron if they check the pit? Same for dragon? How do you communicate if you need your next powerspike before you fight? Yes some people make chat crappy, but there simply will NEVER be a ping system to include every ping needed, because if you ping something that \"should give the message\" you leave lots up to chance and interpretation","replies":[{"poster":"ezAction","date":"2015-04-15T23:25:42.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TP and flash can be done with an update to the HUD.
