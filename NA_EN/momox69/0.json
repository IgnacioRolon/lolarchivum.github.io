And when I switch on my computer, the first game I do, always makes my computer freeze at 19 minutes of the game. So I reboot my computer and i loose 7 minutes in the game. And it happens everytime i switch on my computer.\r\n(Sorry for my bad English)\r\nAny answer ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T21:07:51.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm that's an interesting mark to have your game always freeze at. Baron first spawns at 20, so I'm curious if that file is damaged somehow and causing your game to freeze when it's loaded. Try running a repair through the client options and let me know if that helps out!","replies":[]}]}
