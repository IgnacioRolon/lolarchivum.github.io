Singed has pretty good AP scalings. If the choice is between AP and Immolate, AP does more damage. At level 18, the item needs to give 50 AP for his Q to outdamage Immolate passive, and thats not considering his E damage as well. \n2. Sunfire doesnt do anything for his mana problems or his mana scaling. \n3. Sunfire has shorter range at 400 (though it goes around his model, so its good if he is surrounded). Proxying as Singed requires being in aggro range but not in damage range from Melees, while also kiting the Ranged. Singed has a base 345 movespeed, and his poison lasts 3.25 seconds, meaning he can spread his poison over 1100+ units of distance instead of just 400 units around him. If you take Movespeed Quints and get Boots2, its 1300, so the effective range is 4x as large. Once he pops Ult + Ghost+ Rightous Glory....,well, you get the picture. \n5. Once he gets his damage/mana items (whether it be RoA or the 3x dark seals thats popular), Sunfire doesnt help his worst weakness - getting kited.
