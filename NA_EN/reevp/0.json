Unless you're getting error messages, it's best to let it finish.  Cancelling before finishing can result in the client rescanning all your game files for corruption.  When you're caught up, check out the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your connection and resolve whatever is causing your network to drop like that.
