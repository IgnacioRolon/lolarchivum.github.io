This, however, fucked vayne over because her condemn increased the travel distance of my mid-cast stun, thus stunning her for much longer than it would have (I had been at 1x-2x melee distance at cast start) and this allowed enough time for me to cast q AND w, resulting in me killing her when i otherwise would have died very quickly (was retreating from a roam with ~1/4 hp).
