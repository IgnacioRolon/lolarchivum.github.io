Give him back his passive no unit collision or otherwise make his passive good more often. My idea for his passive is to make the AD calculation unaffect by soft caps to movement speed.

But if you&#x27;re saying this as a genuine balance opinion, then why?\n\nAs someone who was around since his release, he was in fact intended to build damage. Back in that day there was no \"diver\" no \"vanguard\" no other bullshit. You didn't deal damage if you didn't build damage. Additionally, at that time, there were very few champions that actually scaled with ad on an ability. His Q scaling with AD was Riot's indication they wanted him to build AD. Additionally, back then, he wasn't just a diver, he was a hyper carry (some argue nothing but adcs who build as AD can do this nowadays, I digress). \n\nHecarim has always been balance around triforce plus AD. After the 20% cdr, 200% base AD ratio, 40% attack speed changes, not to mention triforce being mad to give bonus movespeed on hit instead of its slow back in the day, hecarim became a monster for obvious reasons. Alongside sterak's increasing his base AD by so much, Hecarim really stopped needing to build anything else for damage, which goes contrary to the intentions prior. \n\nWhile it does benefit the assassin playstyle, which I do admit enjoying, the reality is reduction to his base damages and increases in his capability to deal damage if he deals damage will make him more manageable, and less insanely dependent on triforce. Currently, his Q is a glorified triforce proc, his W gives him insane healing from his teammates. His E doesn't even scale with AD besides it being an auto attack modifier. His ult scales with AP. If he was retuned to be the sort of speedy AD champion he's supposed to be, with sacrifices to him building tank, there are only clear benefits.","replies":[{"poster":"Fefnil","date":"2017-06-22T11:36:27.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but Riot retconned his entire game some time after the first seasons. It's when they created the subclass system and started to make specific role champions instead of generic ones. While doing this, they took a look at the old champions and started slowly pushing where they deemed right. So, even if Hecarim was supposed to build damage at release, he doesn't anymore. It's always the same old problem of old Galio building mage. Riot puts scaling here and there for different reasons, but people end up focusing on that instead of taking it as a form of natural compensation. Hecarim ended up building Triforce since his scalings are not high, then full tank since he needs time to do damage. It's true, maybe a speed/ad build would be natural, but I don't if there would be only benefits. As I said, Hecarim's kit makes it so an assassin bursty build becomes unfair for any squishy targeted by him. Look just how op was the Hecacopter in the first URF. Sure, his problem was in Q fixed cd reduction that made it instant and the W constantly healing him, but all of this things would be useless if Hecarim wasn't sticky and didn't have a huge engage power. Which he has.\nJust imagine, what would he do if he was assassin? He comes speedy gonzales from the flank, ults in Unstoppable, shots someone then dies right after since he's squishy and W doesn't help him. It's not a true assassination since assassins have ways in an ways out and it's not a true diving since he pops right after.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-06-24T01:04:44.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with urf Hecarim was that he was able to build tank and still deal tons of damage cause his Q had 0 cooldown. \n\nAssassin Hecarim plays a bit like a melee carry assassin. He tries to catch someone out, kill them, and turn around and fight/run depending on what he can or cannot do. His suvrivability is dependent on his team and his damage. And his weakness lies in having to actually run at you. \n\nHis w heals for 20% of all damage dealt, not reduced for AOE spells. So if his Q deals 300 damage to 5 targets, that's 300 health from his Q cast once. So it's not like assassin hecarim lacks survivability. \n\nThe changes wouldn't need to be much. Up Q AD scaling or perhaps even give it a direct movement speed scaling, nerf its base damage, reduce its mana cost so Hecarim can actually have the option to ton lane again. \n\nW: turn it back to 10/15/20/25/30%.

Nobody defends Hecarim's current hyper mobile juggernaut state except perhaps you. In this form Hecarim cannot be allowed to function on a high level. If he is forced to build at least a little more offensively, by having actual rewards for building so, it would open up new playstyles for him, while also shaking him off from the magical 1 item triforce fighter. \n\nLookig at your play history, and champs played, it seems you don't ever actually play Hecarim (except one time you lost as him).

So what I want to say is, even if I didn't play him at all this season, I know how he works since I played him plenty during season 3 and his gameplay hasn't changed, so my experience is still valuable.\nTriforce has always given him all he needed, even more than many other champs that use it. He got ad, ap (not anymore) and Heca has both scalings. He got mana and cdr and he is a spam caster with his Q. He got as, and being an ad champ with only one skill scaling ad it's actually a nice gift. And then he got mspeed, which is his most thematic stat. He got the passive to stick to enemies while autoattacking, and he does that a lot. Last but not least, his high base ad and the Q mechanic are pretty much made for Sheen. Because of how incredibly well Heca scales with Triforce, it's often the only thing he needs to do enough dps to be a treat, and the tank stats thereafter are needed to magnify Triforce dps.\nWith that said, what else could he do? He doesn't scale well with 2 or 3 items that are not triforce, then 3 or 4 tank items like most other divers. His scalings actually suck and his power lays in quantity of hits, not quality. So going for example Black Cleaver, Youmuu, Boots of Swiftness then full tank actually gives him less dps and less tankiness than Triforce then full tank. To say how much he sinergizes with Triforce.\nThe point is that, even if they wanted to follow your suggestion, you can't give him options without breaking his sinergy with Triforce (unless you either nerf it to the ground and/or buff other items, but this will clearly bring many other problems). But what can they do this to break it? Heca sinergy with Triforce doesn't come from numbers, it comes from his very kit design. This means they will need to completely overhaul at least one of his skills. Maybe they could reduce is base ad, but he would still buy it because of the Sheen and all the other stats, unless they reduce base ad to abysmal levels, but they can't do this.\nSo, in the end, if you want to give him options, what they will be forced to do will be probably to completely rework the Q into something new.
