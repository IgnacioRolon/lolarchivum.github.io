Once the Bot's spawn they will join you there and you should have fun we tend to go first Penta or most kills wins. \r\nWe have done a few changes also. It's not meant to be a serious game since it's vs intro bot. It's just plain fun. \r\n\r\nIf you have just had a tilt game or need a break just try it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-09T22:11:49.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you mentioned not really knowing where topics should go, I felt pretty bad simply removing this one. Keep in mind these kinds of posts would be best over in Gameplay or General Discussion since Help & Support is primarily used for troubleshooting the game or client when issues happen.\n\nThis * does* kinda sound like fun tbh xD! Please keep in mind that co-op games should usually be played like normal games, so be sure to keep this kind of gameplay only between friends in something like custom games possibly.","replies":[]}]}
