For your specific issue, though, the screen disappearing could be due to a corrupt patcher.  I recommend going over our[ Patching Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this.  \n\nKeep in mind that it may take a few moments for the patcher to scan and update your files since you haven't played in a while.
