I&#039;ve noticed some people have posted LoL client screenshots of notifications they&#039;ve received following Riot&#039;s investigation of a player they reported. However, I&#039;ve never received this notification myself despite reporting negative/toxic behaviour. Does this mean none of my reports were deemed warranted? Am I even supposed to be receiving these notifications that other posters speak of? I&#039;ve never submitted a frivolous report so that&#039;s why I thought I would ask. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-01-29T23:28:02.747+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great question, and just because you haven't seen a punishment notification does not mean players have not been punished for your reports.\n\nThe system only sends notifications to players that reported the offending player in the final game before their punishment. This does not mean your reports weren't considered for the punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Penns","date":"2016-01-30T00:07:22.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">The system only sends notifications to players that reported the offending player in the final game before their punishment.\n\nAre there any intentions to change that?
