However, Pentakill Yorick seems to be the rare case in which he&#039;s obstructed by the sidebar. I wanted to look at the larger picture of his skin but was unable to do so. I don&#039;t even own Yorick, but this seems like something the splash team can hopefully remedy for those interested in looking at his skin :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-25T18:22:55.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey lildyo! \n\nThanks for the report!

Yorick's has never been a priority for any promotion, advancement or work for Riot and that won't change until the rework... and possibly after the rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silat","date":"2016-02-25T18:34:05.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noooo, don't fix it, it's hilarious and fitting!","replies":[]}]}
