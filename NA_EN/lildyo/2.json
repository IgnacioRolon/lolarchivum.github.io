We've come to see these splashes represent their respective skins and they've all taken up spots in our hearts. I feel like many of the Chinese felt the same way with their splashes; it wasn't just us World players who lost some splashes dear to our hearts.\nDespite this connection we felt for our splash arts, Riot still had to normalize splash arts across the globe. So they took a look at all the splashes that differed between regions, and they chose what they thought was the better of the two. Not all of the decisions were the right ones, but I think that the community backlash was too strong. In fact, I feel like the community backlash would have been just as strong if we had the Chinese splashes and switched to the World ones.","replies":[{"poster":"PixTron","date":"2016-04-06T21:00:42.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, I admit, a lot of the Chinese splashes ARE really good ones. Cho'Gath's is decent (though I prefer the old one MUCH more, not only for nostalgia, but because it represents the skin much better and is a lot more well made).\nBut then there's some insanely good ones like Acrolyte (I can't spell that) Lee Sin's, Winged Hussar Xin Zhao's, Commando Xin's, Pirate Swain, Kin Trynd,  they're fucking amazing!\nThen we get shit like Groovy Zilean, PAX Sivir, Greybeard Veigar, the Twitch ones (though still better than the blocky old ones), Musketeer TF, Vayne's, Butcher Urgot, Granny WW, HexTech Sion, etc.\nBut yeah, if Riot would let us actually pick which splashes stay or go, I think it would've been a lot better of a choice.\nI would have to disagree with strong backlash on most of the better splash arts that have been replaced. Our splash art have definitely aged better than most of the Chinese splashes.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-04-06T21:34:23.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it would have been nice to let us pick, but the thing is is that it wouldn't have been fair to the Chinese players. If we did a poll, World players would more than likely favor mostly World splashes and Chinese would favor Chinese splashes, and because World > China, mostly World splashes would remain in the game. I can't think of any way that Riot could effectively get player opinions on every splash they planned on changing while being fair.\n\nI feel like what they did do is they communicated with Tencent, their artists, and _maybe_ a few trusted players (other Riot employees?) on the splashes to see whether to change to the Chinese version or to keep the World version.\nI think it's clear that the artists prioritized quality of art in a majority of cases; many of the changes I saw were poor quality arts that may have been thematically strong being replaced by higher-quality arts that didn't have as strong of a theme, or had a completely different theme. An example of the former is Re-Gifted Amumu: the emotion is stronger in the World version, but the quality is pretty bad compared to the Chinese. An example of the latter is Toxic Dr. Mundo: World had terrible quality but felt like Dr. Mundo, Chinese was medium quality but felt absolutely nothing like Dr. Mundo.\n\nSpeaking of Butcher Urgot, I felt devastated when I saw that. The first Surrender@20 post I was actually happy about because I didn't see much that affected me besides the Irelia splash changes which I really liked, but the second one had Butcher Urgot in it and he looked so different...\nI bought Butcher Urgot because A. the skin seemed rare as hell and I wanted to show my dedication to Urgot while being miserly (got it during the Snowstorm sale) and B. the splash art was _sick_. \nLiterally and figuratively, that splash art was _sick_.\nIt was the creepiest splash arts I had seen before (well, there's Lollipoppy, but that's unintentional), and I loved it for that. I could actually think of scenes to put into a horror movie about Butcher Urgot.\nNow the splash doesn't have that feeling at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"B1naryB0t","date":"2016-04-06T19:16:27.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have to go deeper!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DylboScratchins","date":"2016-04-06T18:18:46.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And people say Riot doesn't care about us <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"McKeifus","date":"2016-04-07T01:00:16.860+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If this thread was about a female character...oh god the flame and hate.  \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
