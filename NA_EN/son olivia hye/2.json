They usually end up getting fed and carrying the game but others times they get fed but they still lose the game because of their teammates.  As a top main I usually go against AD Fizz and he does so much damage that its ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2015-03-09T16:02:57.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made it so his DoT which did an additional 8% missing healt damage was applied instantaneously.\nHis ult amplifies ALL his damage by 20%, so it allows him to go AD and tear into people.\nFizz is just problematic in terms of his design really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-09T17:17:02.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's strong because he does 50% Magic and 50% Physical. With a BotRK, you're essentially doing 8% of their current in physical to murder them down then finishing them with an 8% of missing as magic. Early on, most don't know to get a Banshee's or Spirit Visage THEN build into armor since he needs his Trinity first, which means he'll be reliant on his magic damage bases to do most of his damage for him. After he has the Triforce, you'd build into a Randuin's or a Frozen Heart since you need big armor numbers and reducing his AS so he's not shredding you by repeatedly AA'ing you. Just gotta go some one tanky who's got good sustain and possibly an HP steroid. Champions that you DON'T want to get in their face are usually ones who would destroy a Fizz. Akali, Viktor, Darius, Renekton.... All those huge bursters who can insta-gib or not care if you jump them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordDarkshayde","date":"2015-03-09T16:06:25.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is annoying sure, but by no means broken.
