Sometimes, usually in champion select, but it has happened on the home screen, my computer will just shut off entirely. No blue screen, no message of any kind, it just shuts off and restarts itself.\r\n\r\nIt never happens in-game, only while using the client. I have already limited the problem to the new League client, (it only ever happens when the league client is open, as the focused window). It has happened a total of eleven times since the client beta some months ago. I've tried to solve the problem myself, both repairing the game and completely uninstalling and reinstalling it, but that did not solve the problem. I tried to look at the client logs, but I have no idea where to look there.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do at this point, any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10 64-bit\r\nCPU: Intel i7-4790K Quad Core 4.0GHz\r\nGPU: Sapphire Vapor-X Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition 6GB\r\nRAM: 16GB (2x8GB) G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series DDR3 1866 F3-1866C9D-16GXM\r\nMotherboard: GIGABYTE Z97X-Gaming 7 BIOS rv8","replies":[{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2017-05-13T05:25:07.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually had this happen to me before a few years ago, and it was because my computer's graphics card was overheating due to its fan being damaged.
