My client kicks me out. I then get this message. \r\n\"We have resorted this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now We'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" \r\nAll that did was make the game legit forget what my password was. I know my password, and it pops the \"username or password is incorrect\" message. I reset my password, still trying to get into the game I have now most certainly lost due to never connecting. I change my password, and I am able to log in as I am right now to post this post. It says that my password is incorrect still (on the client). Not only did i lose the ranked game, lost my lp, but now I can't even log in.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T22:48:28.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing more and more of this weird login issue.

But this whole saying my password was wrong when I know it wasn't \"thing\" was quite random and a bit of a pain when you lose series for that sort of issue. I can't honestly tell you what fix worked, since I didn't do anything. The client just updated and then it all worked (after 10-20 times of opening and closing had no affect). Weird bug to say the least.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T23:48:21.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! We'll be able to figure out what is working and what's not as we get responses from you guys ^_^.\n\nI'm glad that patch finally happened and the client started letting you back in. That gives us a little more info to go off of. It seems like this issue could actually be happening because the last patch that was deployed was never installed correctly for some people. \n\nIf there's anyone else you know who could use a fix for this issue, try having them grab the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with *Force Repatch* to try and get that patch working.","replies":[{"poster":"Old Man Winter","date":"2017-05-22T00:08:34.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a problem, and thanks for the repair tool link. I've never seen that before, so it might be handy moving forward. It is weird tho, i play pretty much every day and had no issues until today. Thankfully all seems fine now, knock on wood, and I was able to win 7 in a row and get into P3 after the issues fudged me out of my series. Silver lining I suppose right? :) \n\nFeel free to let me know if you guys find the issue and a true fix, aside from the Gods gracing me with a patch randomly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LeBlanc Jameś","date":"2017-05-22T00:51:30.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=xLlvataU,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-21T22:48:28.603+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m seeing more and more of this weird login issue.

I had the exact same issues and I followed it and it worked the next game with no issues.
