The issue is that this is a mastery _for_ Ezreal and champions like him.  If the interaction is broken, the mastery itself needs to be reconsidered.

It's very plausible for OP to have gotten that 2k gold lead but by the time the game ran 50 minutes in that lead should've been nullified by everyone having items and Ezreal falling off.\n\nGetting 2k gold in a 50 minute game is plausible, I often get over 1k gold in ~20 minutes in my Ezreal games so I can personally tell you it's possible. That being said OP's anecdotes are questionable. Also, learn what Klepto does because\n\n> \"Well, you just get more than just gold!!!\"\n\nhe's not saying you get more items, he's saying you get 5 gold per proc of Klepto PLUS the sacks.

At a 5% drop rate, that's still a 0.75x modifier added to your Klepto earnings. \n\nWhich, despite his evidence being anecdotal, he's right about.\n\nI did read his comment.

But Ezreals w has always been a powerful attack speed steroid but adcs dont ever want to think about helping other people do dps and with e he can self proc it so he has 2 attack speed steroids running at the same time but then he used his cheezy blink which he uses for excapes offensively even though its gonna be back up in 3 seconds with him spamming q. you should be in auto attack range anyway as ezreal to up your dps. But the potiental higher dps isnt recouldnized as an ezreal because you can sit back and never be in danger . \nHaving an excape on a long range poke mage adc doesnt synergize with his kit either. But what doesnt synergize with his kit the most is the part which is focused on the most by players his q.  ezreal has 2 attack speed steroids  (aka the majority of his kit as in the e is also needed to acess the w ) but he has a q spamable q that far exceeds his attack range which is the odd spell out in his kit (aka not the majority of his kit but the most common part of his playstyle as seen by the masses)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChizPizaZane","date":"2017-12-22T04:17:46.010+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":10,"body":"NO NO NO, they already nerfed his Q damage and gutted his attack speed growth.
