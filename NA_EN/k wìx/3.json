Each time you die, go back and examine what happened in your mind, and find out where things went wrong. Lack of vision caused you to think there was only 1 opponent, maybe you overestimated your damage potential, or underestimated your own. Maybe you depended on a teammate to do something and they did not do it, maybe you simply got caught and got chain-cc'd into oblivion. All of these things are common, and they happen to every player. The trick is figuring out how to avoid all of them.\n2. Always hold tab to check out the opponents items, kills/death ratio, and CS scores. The goal here is to figure out who is doing well and who is doing poorly. You always want to be very aware of who is 'fed' and who is not. Enemy players who score a lot of kills become very powerful and you'll want to avoid them or be very afraid of engaging them. Some characters in league can straight up win games if they get really fed early in the game. {{champion:55}}  is a prime example. In an experts hands, going 8/2 or 9/0 ... She is pretty much unstoppable by the mid game.\n3. Vision is probably the most important skill to master in the game. Like, its absolutely critical to have as much vision as possible at all times. No matter what your role is, If you are not buying wards, you are simply doing a disservice to your team.\n    A very new player friendly way to take care of your vision game is to buy a {{item:3362}} . This is cheap, so it won't impact your build much and the purple wards not only last a much longer time than the basic wards, but it ensures that no enemy has vision in that specific area. This is no substitute for good, proper warding - but it's much better than simply ignoring vision, and its practically free.","replies":[{"poster":"seXo Jon","date":"2015-03-19T16:13:55.663+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"unlock the damn camera and use quickcast","replies":[{"poster":"DrathTurtle314","date":"2015-03-19T16:43:06.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"use quick cast unless playing nami or thresh or Leona or ahri or victor or rumble or...(for the first two or three times at least) \n\nyou can use quick cast on garen, soraka, sona, Cassiopeia...\n\nUntil you get used to skillshots, and the abilities of your champion, I would suggest leaving quick cast off, but that is really up to you.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedSoul420","date":"2015-03-19T17:19:15.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do fine with quick cast on all of those champs..the only one that gives me trouble sometimes is thresh's flay.

It has nothing to do with what certain player groups are favouring at the moment.\n\nPros actually break the meta constantly because if both team were to follow the meta exactly neither would have an advantage. So you not only need to know the meta, you also need to understand the reasons for why it is the way it is so that you know when to follow it and when to break it.\n\nMetagaming means looking at the rules and setup and determining the best approach to a game. On Summoners Rfit these are things like:\n- mid has a short recall, and gets the most XP. So should have a level scaling champ\n- duo lanes get less XP but more gold. So should have item scaling champs\n- top is often alone for some time. So should have savety and sustain.\n\nThe meta tells you that taking a Tank top is probably best, but when you know that the enemy is probably gonna bring a Tank, you can also break the meta an take a Tank Buster top.","replies":[{"poster":"AGJS","date":"2015-03-19T21:52:23.767+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great advice.

Hit Tab, look at the speech bubble on the right by each player.  If someone is giving you a hard time, click that button, muted.  It is your best friend.\n\n2. If you want to play this game seriously, look up meta videos and tier lists, Jeremy Curios is one youtuber I suggest as a good channel to learn a few things about the meta and tier lists.\n\n3. Do not let the meta control you!  You don't have to pick the fotm champ every game, learn your champs, learn who is strong, learn who is strong against meta picks.  You'll quickly find out that the meta is much bigger than people think.\n\n4. Relax.  You won't win every game.  You don't have to win every game.  When you queue up, play music, chat with a friend, put a relaxing tv show on.  Learn to have fun and poke at yourself any time you make a mistake.  There is no sense in getting upset over a game.\n\n5. Always look at any death and lose as a learning experience.  It may be true that the game was unwinnable, but that doesn't mean you couldn't have done things differently and perhaps done better in that game. \n\n6.  Learn locking and unlocking and quick casting.  Play your champ, learn what skills are good for quick cast.  Learn when to lock your camera and when to unlock your camera.\n\nThe biggest tip I have is this.  Have fun!  If you find the game is becoming stressful or is upsetting you.  Walk away.  Go out side, call a friend, watch a movie, do something else!  This is a game, it's meant to be fun.  It is not worth messing yourself up over just to win.  Learn to have fun, break the meta, laugh at your mistakes, challenge yourself, but don't let is stress you.  It's just not worth it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-03-19T22:07:55.149+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy freelo trinket\nlike always\nasap\nlvl9 u mtherfkers\n\nhttp://puu.sh/gHi8w/ab339ffb0b.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"tkmteam5158","date":"2015-03-19T17:17:53.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"~ Focus alot of your play time on map awareness until your checking it naturally.

Above all though, make sure that whenever you build an item you think to yourself \"why am I buying this?\" If your answer is \"because I saw a pro build it\" or \" because it is on my list of items to build\" you should stop for a second and analyze the game.
