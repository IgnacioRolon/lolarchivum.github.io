I forgot to mention it, but I posted the same question at the forum EUW - then I saw, that some other guys out there face the same problem so I commented here.\nI alrdy tried everything on ur list: repair, reinstall, IP-Helpservice, TCP/IP6, DNS (8.8.8.8), stopped Firewall and Antivirus, even reinstalled Windows, tired Wireless and Cable. Nothing changed. still the same problem. And I also very often (9 out of 10) I cant accept the Readycheck before Championselect. It just suddenly says I declined, although I didnt see anything - respectively the Button to Accept appears for approx. 0,1 seconds.\nAny ideas left?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-30T22:55:59.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your connection may have had a hiccup and lost sync with champion select, so you got left behind instead of reaching the game server.
