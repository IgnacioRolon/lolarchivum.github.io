Some players have noticed that the new animations in the client are causing some issues with disconnections in champ select. I'd like to have you try going into the client options, and turning on low-spec mode. Most often, this is able to help stop champ select interruptions, but hit me back up and let me know if it helps!","replies":[]}]}
