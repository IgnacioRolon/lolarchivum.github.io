For example, if I take this on blitzcrank, will it be thrown to where they were, or will it land on me because that&#039;s obviously where they will be?\r\n\r\n2: Does Aerie shield you if you apply a shield to yourself? \r\n\r\n3: How will Aerie interact with Soraka, since she can heal everyone at the same instant. Does Aerie have a maximum range?\r\n\r\n4: Electrocute deals adaptive damage, it says. Does that mean it can deal physical damage, and thus interact with Zed ult?\r\n\r\n5: Does Approach Velocity (inspiration tree) work on slows, or just hard CC? I hope it works on slows, otherwise it would be very niche.\r\n\r\n6: Does Bard&#039;s Tunnel proc Sudden Impact for anyone who uses it?\r\n\r\n7: Dark Harvest causes souls collected to deal bonus damage on your next (basic attack?) within 20 seconds. Does collecting souls refresh the 20 seconds, or is it like if you collected 1 soul 19 seconds ago and get 1 more soul, the other one like decays away and you still only have the 1 new one?","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-29T20:58:29.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"7: dark harvest is like thresh souls. You collect them and the count never resets.\n\nFor example you could be at 10 stacks and not have the proc available in lane, then the enemy cannon minion dies and drops a soul. You collect this soul (which brings your total to 15 because cannon minion souls are worth 5 stacks) which activate the buff for 20 seconds. Now you auto you lane opponent and consume the proc but keep your stacks. A few more hits and you kill the opponent and the drop a soul. You collect their soul and get stacks (I believe it is 10 for champ souls?) Raising your total (to 25?) And reactivation the buff for 20 seconds. If the buff runs out of time and you do not auto a champ or structure, you still keep the same soul count.\n\nIt is one of the many new uncapped scaling runes.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"l Joe Rogan l","date":"2017-10-01T02:38:43.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!!!

Does Aerie have a maximum range?\n\nIt won't.  Aerie's allied interaction only works off of shielding.  So if you are Janna, Lulu, Karma, Morg, ect you can use it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-29T21:07:26.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although the tool tip is certainly not clear on this, the spirit can proc off any ally-Targeting spell or an enemy-Damaging spell.
