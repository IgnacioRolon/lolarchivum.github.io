Do you think it was justified?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"TL;DR: I talk too much. I like to express myself. That's the only thing I'm guilty of. \r\n\r\ngame 1 TL;DR. I asked for adc because I got autofilled. Didn't get it, so I decided to play something fun and chose fiddle. From that moment on my team insulted me 50 times and even went on to tell me to kill myself. I did not throw back a **SINGLE INSULT.** I did however tell him multiple times he'd get banned for telling me to kill myself. Yet eventually I ended up getting perma banned. My own ADC even started to back me up because even during the game I did exceptional in lane and tried my very best the whole game.\r\n\r\ngame 2 TL;DR: I don't remember honestly, All I know is I called someone a loser for harrassing me, and then I told him he's a terrible person for all the insults he said to me.\r\n\r\nDoes this honestly deserve a perma ban? I can understand a mute for typing too much... But permanant ban?\r\n\r\nGame 1 \r\nPre-Game \r\nMagic Wizard Joe: been playing support all day \r\nMagic Wizard Joe: the one time I pick a different role \r\nMagic Wizard Joe: get autofilled support \r\nMagic Wizard Joe: I'm just not feeling it \r\nMagic Wizard Joe: can I adc?
