This champ was based off of that thread a while back asking about a boisterous and large-ham-y ninja like Bang Shishigami. She wields sai, and her sleeveless ninja robe reveals well-defined arm muscles. Her attacks tend to have a flaming flair to them, her arm ignites whenever she gets a critical, etc...\n\n**Lore (not entirely content with, please send help)**\nReina was recruited into the Kinkou from an early age. During an attack by raiders, her small home village was entirely destroyed, and her parents killed. The Kinkou sent assistance as soon as they knew what was going on, but the attack was too fast. The Kinkou treated her as a permanent guest, as a way of rectifying their failure. For the first few years, Reina was given a simple, relaxing stay in a Kinkou temple, no requirements but to sweep the floors and help prepare the food, but quickly Reina decided she wanted more. Hiding behind pillars and practicing the martial-arts techniques the masters taught, and staying up until the crack of dawn running laps through the halls. She proved to have not only great determination and force of will, but talent, too. Eventually, the masters decided to make her a fully fledged student, but still, her thirst to prove her worth remained unquenched. After finally becoming a master herself, at a fairly young age, she entered the League of Legends to show off her talent, passion, and flair for fighting and glory.\n\n**Stats**\nHP: 420 (+90)\nHP/5: 4.25 (+0.55)\nEnergy: 200\nEnergy/5: 50\nAD: 48 (+3.4)\nAS: 0.651 (+2.5%)\nAR: 19 (+4)\nMR: 30 (+0)\nMS: 340\nRange: 125\n\n**Passive: Hot Blooded**\nEvery time Reina hits a target with an ability or attack (excluding from items), her cooldowns decrease by 1 seconds, and she gains 30 energy. This ability cannot be triggered on the same target more than once every 5 seconds, and this effect is halved against minions. \n\n**Q: Ancient Seal / Ninja Dash**\nReina throws a seal at a target location. Enemies struck by the seal activate her passive, but have no other effect. The seal remains, and every time Reina enters it, she gets a buff to MR and Armor for a few seconds. Up to 3 seals may be in the game at a time.\n\nIf this ability is cast on an existing seal, Reina dashes to it, dealing physical damage to every enemy she hits. (Because of the cooldown, you need to plan ahead, place a seal, wait, then dash to it)\n\nCooldown: 5 seconds\nEnergy Cost: 0 to place a seal, 70 to dash\nSeal Silence Duration: 1 second\nSeal Diameter: 125\nProjectile Speed: Roughly the same as Galio's Resolute Smite\nDash Damage: 30/45/60/75/90+80% AD\nMR and Armor buff: 15/20/25/30/35+25% bonus AD\nBuff duration: 2 seconds\n\n**W: Blazing Rushdown**\nReina's attack speed and movespeed increase sharply for a very short duration.\nEnergy Cost: 80\nDuration: 1.5 seconds\nAttack Speed Boost: 35/45/55/65/75%\nMovespeed Boost: 30/35/40/45/50%\nCooldown: 6 seconds after effect ends.\n\n**E: Energetic Strike**\nReina dashes through a target in melee range, knocking them up and dealing physical damage. This ability applies on-hit effects.\nCooldown: 11 seconds\nEnergy Cost: 90\nRange: 150\nTotal dash length: 300\nKnockup Duration: 0.5 seconds\nDamage: 0/25/50/75/100+120% AD\n\n**R: Flaming Fists of Fury**\nReina does a slow leap through the air, dealing magical AoE damage where she lands. Enemies struck are slowed, and Reina gets a flaming shield that scales off her max HP and adds flat bonus damage to her spells and attacks as long as it exists.\nRange: 425\nAoE radius: 100\nAirtime: 0.75 seconds\nMagical Damage: 100/225/350+150% AD\nSlow amount: 25/35/45%\nSlow Duration: 1.5 seconds\nShield amount: 25/30/35% of Max HP\nMaximum Duration: 7 seconds\nAA boost: 30/40/50 Damage\nSpell Boost: 60/80/100 Damage\nCooldown: 210/195/170 seconds (keep in mind, it benefits from her passive)\n\n\n\n**Quotes**\n\nChampion Selection:\n[#] I'm going to prove my strength to everyone!\n\nMoving:\n[#] They're toast!\n[#] The tables have turned!

It was very strange to come across.\n\n\nI don't have as much commentary on your kit itself, though I would like to mention that it's difficult to read out the purpose and goals behind each ability.\nTo scope that to a specific ability, as an example, I would say that it's difficult to figure out why the kit has the silence area since it reads as inconsistent. Is there a specific play pattern you wish to accomplish with this, or a specific use case you want this to setup? Is the inconsistency important? These are questions that were difficult to try to read out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Varkarrus","date":"2014-09-13T01:01:53.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This same message can be considered a reply to Daen, who said sorta the same thing.  Before you posted that comment, I had actually removed the silence area effect, something I figured shoulda been removed anyways.\n\nHer general idea is supposed to be a mobile bruiser-y fighter like Wukong. As for that situational energy recharge thing, there is something that needs pointing out: the costs of her abilities. In order for her to use all 3 abilities, she would need more energy than she has. If she wants to use em all, she'll NEED to be working her passive, which is weaker against minions. There is a different purpose for every attack, though.\nHer Q gives her some mobility, but with the need for preperation, and some defensive potential. Her W is her moneymaker, her greatest source of damage, and an excuse to build pure AD as opposed to AD and AS, while her E is a good followup to outmaneuver her opponent. Finally, her R has it all. While lacking the damage of other AD ults, she gets a shield AND a buff, and because of the AoE she basically can refresh all of her cooldowns if she uses it to initiate. If you have any suggestions, though, I'll be happy to hear em.\n\nSome hypothetical play patterns include:\nUsing her Q to get close to an opponent, W to chase them down as they flee, and then E as a way to duck to the other side of them and prevent their escape.\nWhen attacked, drop Q on self, E to start the fight, then W to finish the job. If it turns out to be too hot to handle, she can dash back to the seal she placed earlier and W or even R to run away.\nIf she's seperated from a team fight, in trouble, and needs to escape, she can R straight into the teamfight, get some shielding, cooldown refreshes, and energy to be prepared to help finish the fight and not die, assuming some health has been built on her, of course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-09-13T00:59:59.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've got a point.

I try my best to be a good summoner and a generally nice and supportive person in most endeavors...\n\n...but I don't really see this working without some serious edits, either conceptually or systematically for a few reasons (I'm not gonna touch the lore since it's not really fair to judge a character entirely by something as potentially fluid as their lore).\n\n1.) Standing silences. For the most part, champions have been trending away from status effects as utterly stifling as silences. Why? *Lack of engaging counterplay.* Regardless of if you're an ADC and you're putting out the deeps for days, those abilities of yours are still important for that little extra burst to secure kills and end fights quickly. Silencing, even for a DPS character, is like slicing off at least 25% of your damage for a couple of seconds, which is really bad. For ability based characters, double or even triple that percentage. It's like being in a waking nightmare.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g4HSUpL.jpg\n*Yep, like this guy's. Yes, I did just go there.*\n\nYour character is proposing to have an ability that could, more or less, chain silences together along with having the same mobility as Vi. That's just a little bit nuts. Maybe you could try swapping out the type of CC for something else, perhaps a slow or something. Either way, though, the cooldown needs to go up pretty substantially. And speaking of cooldowns...\n\n2.) The passive. Not only is that a HUGE energy gain, regardless of having to switch targets, but most of the cooldowns on this champion are so short that you'll never run out of either cooldowns or resources unless you never basic attack anything between ability uses, which is rare. It's very possible with just what I've mentioned here, you might be able to do some tweaking and make things a bit more reasonable. I'd honestly like to see the end result.\n\n3.) His/her personality. To be perfectly honest, while the abilities of the ninja in League of Legends, more or less, aren't very sneaky, the Kinkou, and especially the Triumvirate, stress balance in all things. An incredibly boisterous, fight-happy brawler wouldn't really fit that picture of balance that they're looking for. If anything, this character is more likely to be allied with Zed, as their intense passion would fall more in line with his drive towards a single personality aspect or goal.\n\nThose are just a few things that I noticed. Hopefully, this feedback might provide some ideas for further refining this concept.\n\nAlso, please check out my Energy-based ADC/AD Caster with his unique Shadow Possession ability: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/BxIn84WU-champion-concept-valruk-the-jungles-revenge","replies":[{"poster":"Varkarrus","date":"2014-09-12T23:17:02.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right about, I guess, all of these points.\nI was waiting for someone to comment on the Silence on the seal, figured it might have been too much for her kit (I mean, a 125 Diameter AoE IS really hard to hit with. I figure it'll just proc her passive and have a slightly larger AoE)\nThe passive IS only half-strength for minions. That DOES make it harder to fully regain energy from. On the other hand, maybe I should bump up her cooldowns and energy costs a bit, especially the cooldown on conflagration.\nAs for the personality, well I'm keeping that for sure, but you are right that it seems out of place for a Kinkou ninja, but at the same time I don't see her as a flat-out villain. Her origins DEFINITELY need to be tied into their order, but hey, I was complaining already that her Lore felt kinda flat. If we can figure out a good in-between for her Lore, that'd be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Dokueki Kenshin","date":"2014-09-14T23:47:46.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps you could just have her be a Kinkou dropout or something like that. It's not like there isn't any middle ground. Lee Sin is an Energy champ, but he bears no allegiance to the Kinkou and is still a good guy. Remember that Energy really represents the transcendence achieved through martial training, used to harness inherent abilities. Once you realize that, it's not super difficult to come up with lore that would make that work.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-09-12T20:35:25.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it but I don't know if being *Hot-Headed* is a quality that would be best for a ninja.
