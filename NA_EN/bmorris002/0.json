After playing Bot games for about 4-5 months I transitioned onto normal PvP games. This is where I started to get put off by this game. Now, I understand I can make stupid gameplay mistakes and there is always room for improvement but without much experience playing PvP the only way to gain knowledge is through trial and error. Instead of offering constructive criticism like: \"Next time do this\" or \"Go for this item\", I often get the classic \"Go unistall\" or \"you're ****\". Yes in a large way I am bad, but mostly due to lack of experience, no one is perfect at the game from the offset. \r\n\r\nI think the crux of my point is simply, why is a percentage of the community so toxic all the time? We all have bad games or make bad calls at some point, but we learn from these and adjust our play style. If it were ranked I would completely understand where they are coming from but this is Normal PvP. I then spend the rest of the game annoyed, which makes me make even more bad calls or they simply refuse to help, and then I get blamed for losing fights or a lane when I have no aid from teammates. Since this is a team game, when your team starts to split, it often means GG for that game. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone agree with what I'm saying or am I just really unlucky at coming across toxic players?","replies":[{"poster":"TerribleTheHero","date":"2017-03-10T12:48:26.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is a game that should often be played with friends for toxicity relief, especially at lower levels or when you first enter PvP.\nThat way you can make an agreement to not flame and learn to cooperate and grow. You can try to be serious or mess around with fun compositions, so that's a good place to start: finding gaming partners.\nI didn't start playing Solo at all until I went into ranked last season unless it was for an ARAM, practice bot game, or Riot Event Gamemode, and I've been playing for years.\n\nThe community is very toxic, and while it gets better around Gold/Platinum ELO, it doesn't completely improve by a landslide. Muting is useful, but I'd suggest just not replying. I often learn from my mistakes through other people, because not all toxic players are the worst players (in fact, a lot of them are old players with new accounts), but I never say it to them or interact with the negative environment they're creating. Plus, not muting them gives you more incentive to report them after the game if their attitude doesn't improve over time. \n\nNot replying to (or muting) toxic players is the best thing our community can do as a whole while in game.\n\nYou're completely right in what you're saying, and I agree. My advice is to get comfortable playing in PvP when you're alone with a positive attitude. Recognize not every player is going to be cooperative and kind. Start games by saying hello, be supportive of your teammates, and remind them that you guys are still learning if someone is doing bad. Realize that your Riven top may be still trying new champions, recognize and understand that your Master Yi isn't giving buffs to your carries because they may be new at jungling, and treat everyone with respect (even if they're flaming).\n\nToxic players aren't always the best players even if they're doing okay in-game, so don't listen to them or take their insults to heart.\n\nStand up against toxicity towards yourself with strong silence, and stand up for others who don't deserve it with courage.\n\nIt's rough out there in PvP.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"BMorris002","date":"2017-03-11T09:39:14.760+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the good advice. I 100% agree with everything you said, and am beginning to play with a few gaming friends to improve the overall experience. As for the toxic players, I tend to ignore them, tell them I'm still learning  and recently asking them for what I should have done. Granted this does give mixed replies but I have found that my fellow teammates are willing to offer advice and bring the team back together. I think a major part of the game is recognising where you went wrong, then going back and analysing your potential options, that way when it happens again you can be more prepared.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-03-10T14:17:41.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is toxic.\nBut if your positive you can norms get a generally speaking positive situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-03-10T12:12:47.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lower levels is a pocket for higher toxicity.\n\nThese guys get their account banned for toxicity, so they start a new account while waiting it out. \n\nThey bring the same attitude and toxicity into their low level games and expect everyone to perform at their level.

Lower elo players will ban teammates champs, blame others for no reason and refuse to cooperate if they don't agree with something, frustrating the other players. There are a lot of non toxic people too, its just the horrible ones that stick out the most.\nJust ignore it and have fun :) !","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaxlikeseggs","date":"2017-07-19T23:58:48.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you on this I've had two games today in a row with toxic players just because I've made bad mistakes.
