He sort of acted like it was no big deal (non-committal), but he couldn't deny he got the classic int feeder, lol.\n\nBut seriously, the nature of the Silver and Bronze makes for a different META than high ELO and high ELO players can suddenly find themselves like a fish out of water because they've adapted to the refined air near the top and aren't used to the shenanigans of Silver and Bronze.  Another phenomenom that can throw them is that some players in Silver are better at the game than their rank implies - they simply choose not to spend the time to climb to high rank because it's too much of a grind for them.  They may have aspirations to get to Gold and then stop.  So this creates a situation where the true rank of players in Silver ranges from unranked to Gold (or even higher since those players stop climbing after they reach Gold).\n\nThat said, if high ranked players aren't climbing on their alt accounts, it's probably because they don't care to spend the time to climb those accounts by adapting to the META of Silver and learning habits that will make maintaining their rank on their high ranked accounts more difficult.  They might not even take those alt accounts as seriously.  Alt accounts can sometimes be used to try out things at a lower rank rather than take them immediately to a higher rank.\n\nThe OP's anecdote really captures the elephant in the room though.  There are so many 'problems' that I could go on and on about Silver.

When Gold elo was the holy grail of elo to me. Players actually had respect for each and every tier and macro play was something only Diamond players knew how to do effectively and not every single elo like now.\n\nI was a scrub, ok? I only played easy champions, my computer ran the game at a whopping 15 FPS (Thanks, Stalin, i inherited your pc it seems.) but at least my internet was good. I didn't know item builds, rotations, animation cancelling, orbwalking, champion counters, all champions for that matter, damage numbers, champions abilities, item actives, buff effects, last hitting, attack move. I didn't even know that an Esports scene existed. I also thought that buying several components for an item of the same kind reduced the price of the item faster. Maths fail but i was pretty convinced for a time.\n\nI played my very first 10 provisional games as Veigar Support. I stole as many kills as i could because i thought if i get fed, i can carry. Typical Lux Support mentality i guess but i was never toxic. I was still innocent. I won 6 games out of 10 and i later found out i was playing against actual Gold players. I landed in Silver I which was higher than all of my friends' accounts had ever been at that time.\n\nI climbed out of Silver I in a week because i was struggling with the promos and i literally, i mean LITERALLY could not do anything in teamfights because my computer couldn't handle them. All it took for me to actually carry bot lane was just some mechanical input. I didn't have to stress my ass off because someone sucked on my team as i could make up for it by capitalizing on the enemies' overzealous playstyles.\n\nI later ended up in High-Platinum in Season 5 and i left the place for EUW as my Diamond II friend said that EUW was much better in terms of competition as no competitive teams exist on EUNE nor are there any regional tournaments in there. I had tried getting into Esports on EUNE for quite a time and he basically told me that the tournaments i was in didn't have any significant rewards, nor did they use a well funded host to do so. I was basically competing with people who were playing just for practice for real tournaments.\n\nNot to mention i won a tournament as a Gold V against Challenger/Diamond mixed team. All of them were from EUNE.\n\nAfter i left for EUW, things got serious. I was placed in Gold IV, i think. A tier lower than i had been at Platinum IV when i transferred and everyone was highly self-aware of their personal limitations on the champions and my limitations. They knew how to coordinate, communicate and execute devastating combos, often with the help of a faster, more skilled jungler.\n\nIt's still the case today except that now, this level of skill reaches out from Mid-Silver through Low-Diamond. The only difference being that the higher you climb, the faster your reflexes have to be. The game's now extremely heaviy oriented towards mechanical skill rather than strategic skill that it rarely matters if you're a good tactician or a team-player. If someone loses, it snuffs you out of the game together as a team.\n\nI have 2 smurf accounts on EUNE. People have gotten a little better but i still reach Gold effortlessy in like 15 games after the first 10 for the provisionals.\n\nYou are also Silver IV right now so i can see why you find it difficult because obviously, we are at completely different levels but that's just my experience with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChallengerTier","date":"2018-05-06T06:01:34.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"700 games silver 3 49% wr, this is not a coinlfip this is 100% you dude, don't be delusional","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2018-05-06T13:47:36.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been this way for all the last season and until some days ago in this one.
