Since exercises or questions or wathever in the exam is randomly assigned you can't decide your result by yourself, but you can influence it with your decisions.\n\nSo it happens that people that are underprepared get better results than people that are more prepared, but overall who is more prepared gets overall better results than who is not.\n\nThe exam makers does not decide this. Riot does not decide its own neither. No one decides anything, except how this stuff is generated which has nothing to do with specific people promos. The only thing you can do is be yourself.\n\nIf shit hits the fan - well happens, so is life.\n\nEDIT: so also i might add, any system is pretty much equivalent to the other, the only thing changing is the reward. If Riot were to make more \"fair\" to get to gold then it would be easier to get to gold, that then would reduce the value of being gold, that then might push Riot to increase the requirements to get rewards from getting on a specific ranking otherwise the community reduces the value of being gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-07-09T01:28:57.451+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \n\n\"Okay Class, 2 + 2 = 4.

This test doesn't really test the rest of your classmates skills, you're the only one that can determine your grade. \n\nWhen it comes to Promos you can't depend on **your** individual skill because this Is a team game. If one of your teammates decides to troll or afk then it's done, one of your 5 games is lost, on the next match, you notice that everyone on your team is silver 1-3 while the **whole** enemy team is gold 5-4, who would you put your bets on? I'm not going to say it's impossible ok, but that fact alone is tilting enough.\n\nI believe that the only thing you can do to \"influence\" like you said is not feed. That's it seriously. You can try to influence by getting objectives like drag... seems as if the enemy team has more pressure on your other lanes and on your jgler. You can roam... seems as if your team is overextended, nope. You can work your own lane focus on winning your lane but as soon as you see ten \"an ally has been slain\" pop up before the 10 minute mark you're getting frustrated and tilted out of your damn mind. \n\nI just find it hard to see how in these promos you get to show skill expression. There's just no room for skill expression in my opinion. \n\nListen, I agree when you say this \n>  any system is pretty much equivalent to the other, the only thing changing is the reward.

I agree that there can be nothing absolutely objectively fair in life, and so just happens promos to be into it.\n\nThe only thing you can make to be \"fair\" is to detach as much as possible personal choices to a judgement ( in this case - promo ), so at least the outcome does not depend on the test maker.\n\nI agree it is not an individual game and in that it differs from tests, but does that change the scenario? In a test you have different problems posed in front of you, in game too - and that problem can also be ally management. You don't play only against the enemy team, you play along your teammates in the bad or good.\n\nSure thing afkers or trollers are bad and ruin your game, granted, but then what should you do? forgive games with trollers and afkers ( besides retry)? you know it would be very abused then, and at that point it would be extremely unfair for every other (including the winning team, that loses a win and a lot of time just for this).\n\nThe problem here is not riot, the problem here is those shitty players. other than reporting them and reply there isn't too much you ( or Riot) can do.","replies":[{"poster":"SleepingVictors","date":"2018-07-09T17:33:29.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true though there's just nothing we can do or riot can do, If a player is bad then he's bad, you cant report him unless he admits to intentional or trolling. ~~Even though I believe that the report system is complete shit~~ \n\nThe unfair part in this is that Riot's matchmaking is set to completely mess you up in promos, the skill difference between your matchmade team and the matchmade enemy team is easily noticed. I'm not saying this just cause I want to its because there's proof, you can see it or test it for yourself, I believe its meant to be there anyway because they wanna test if you're able to carry 4 other bozo shit players against 5 Fakers.\n\nYou're right we can retry, but till when are people gonna take this tedious grind? I think players just want to show that they belong in a higher rank and they're not being allowed to show their skills. \n\nI'm going to say it again and I believe that some players don't deserve that rank they really want, but there are players who do and can't because they can't demonstrate that they can.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2018-07-09T19:58:14.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it is sucky when it messes you up in promos - i mean, look at me, i am silver I and i am exactly the kind of player that gets into that.\n\nIt's arguable that Riot should treat you any better if you are in promo. And you actually get a retry bonus when you are into a promotion a second time, so you actually have some things already set in favor from your own idea.\n\nI just take it as it is for a simple reason - you are playing with randoms. Of course you can get fucked up by randoms on a team game.\n\nLet's be clear one of the main reasons LoL got popular is soloQ on casual level and it's all fine and dandy, but it's still a team game. You can't expect a quality competitive game if you play only as a solo on a team game. That's true for every kind of game that is a team game, MMOs included.\n\nThat's also why they pushed and hyped so much Clash - it was for them the occasion to actually provide a quality team competitive game that was able to be mantained. Too bad on some servers it did not work well ( included mine *ahem ahem* ).\n\nWhat i mean is, if for you soloQ is not \"fair\" enough, given your interpretation of \"fairness\", then you kinda deserve it because you are not playing the way the game should be set for it to be competitively viable. \n\nAnd even if you value \"solo skill\" well that is also pretty much unreasonable to witheld on a team game too because \"teammaking skills\" are also an important part of the game, and that important thing is substituted by another one while playing solo - \"influencing skills\", which are of different nature and effect.\n\nSorry if my english is a bit broken here and there, hope the message gets throught.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheUrbanKitsune","date":"2018-07-08T10:00:17.588+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oof...
