People can play it, and they can feed, afk, and be as toxic as they please without repercussion. This would not only give people who might have to afk somewhere to play safely, but it would make regular normals much better, with less toxic trolls and AFKs roaming around, since they&#039;re playing where they belong.\r\n\r\nAlso, if this were to exist, current punishments could require people who have AFK&#039;d recently to play in low-priority queue for a set number of games. That would teach them a better lesson than &quot;Making them wait five minutes..\r\nor two weeks, you know.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-19T22:11:05.740+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would any troll, afk or feeder in their right mind intentionally join a low priority queue?\n\nTrolls want to troll, afks and feeders dont think they are doing anything wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vilgax","date":"2016-09-19T22:23:45.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This would honestly be a huge waste of time.
