A wall that breaks projectiles seems perfectly fine to me. He's a melee slayer guy, and if he's jumping feet first into danger, there's nothing wrong with a tiny bit of safety. But there are two main issues that come with it that can be changed.\n--------------------\n#Firstly, his wind-wall is _thicc._ \nI don't mean it's long, but actually thick. It's wide enough to stand in, which he makes people do. He can put his wall on top of the enemy ADC and use it as a literal Teemo-esque blind until the ADC walks out of it. it's kind of like Grave's smokescreen, but without the range, slow, or debilitating nearsightedness it causes. So if you're trying to engage on him, he can run up to you really close, lay it down, and get some free harass on you, all while you're forced to run away to even manage to break his shield. If a Caitlyn, Ashe, Jinx, Miss Fortune, etc, is trying to ult him, he deserves to be able to block it with a well-timed wall. But if a ranged champion is simply trying to use an auto attack, putting a wall right on top of them to banish them from using any attacks or skill-shots is just cruel. INVERSELY, once the ADC walks away from the wall, Yasuo himself can stand inside his windwall, attacking freely whilst negating attacks from all sides. Like, ew.\n#Solution: Make the wind-wall thinner. \nSo Yasuo can't abuse its massive hitbox.\n\n-------------\n#Secondly, when Yasuo casts the windwall, it shoots out from within him as a cone. \nWhy is this bad? Well, it turns his mere \"Wind-wall that blocks abilities\" into a \"Free spell-shield that then turns into a wind-wall that blocks abilities.\" You've seen YouTube videos where a Yasuo blocks a Thresh hook by casting his wind-wall *sideways*, haven't you? It's because of how his wall is designed. Since it casts from within him, any skillshot that's **almost** about to hit Yasuo will get negated, as if it did hit him, but Yasuo just used a cleanse to physically push the projectile away from him. It's too good, and it's too safe.\n#Solution: Make Yasuo cast his wind-wall from left to right, in the way Victor's E does. \nGive it the same length, distance and parameters that his current wind-wall has, but change its summoning from coning out from him to coming in from a side. You can pick the side; I don't care. Probably from left to right, because that's how he would naturally cast it when unsheathing his blade. Aesthetically speaking, of course.\n--------\nSooo, what do you y'all think?","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-09-04T00:20:28.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thread Approved","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-09-04T04:16:20.713+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make it disappear if Yas walks through it.

It is an extremely polarizing strength. It is (literally) useless against melee champions, but it's (somewhat absurdly) powerful against ranged champions. This means that if Yasuo gets into lane with a melee champion he will really struggle, but if he's versus a ranged champ, he's a serious problem (compare his top lane VS bot lane win rates on this. 48% win rate top, 55% win rate bot). This means that Yasuo is a champion where the lane is decided in the champ select, rather than the lane itself. Projectile and skill shot champs feel almost powerless, when mixed with his ability to run around the minions and effectively dodge skill shots.\n\nThe larger issue with the windwall (and with many champion designs) is that it seemed to be designed based around why Yasuo needed it, but with a failure to consider the larger implications. The ability is one of the most team-fight warping skill sin the entire game. If used correctly, it can literally disable many ultimates and decide an entire teamfight. For as long as Yasuo has this in his kit, the rest of his kit has to be kept deliberately behind because of the sheer power the one move brings to his kit.\n\nI think that windwall would work a lot better if:\n1) It was primarily a self-defense mechanism and\n2) it was less specific to fighting a single type of champion (ranged). \n\n\nGood examples of similar defensive abilities include\n1) Pantheon's passive\n2) Fiora's Riposte\n3) Vladimir's pool\n\nSuggestion on reworking Wind Wall to be healthier\nWind wall now protects a portion of Yasuo (think Fiora's vitals) from damage for X seconds\n\nThis would make the skill more based on skill expression, less of a team-oriented thing less emphasized on ranged-only defense\n\nI'm sure someone else can come up with something better, but I wanted to throw out a suggestion to demonstrate my point, on what a healthier defense would be.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-05T23:39:05.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I did not read the whole thing, but to say that its useless to melee champs is just wrong.

You can't just \"Back off\" in the middle of a teamfight, or if it means running away from your turret and into minions.

Further, fix the cone so that it is off-center from yasuo, placed slightly forward instead (Perhaps where his sword is visually placed during the animation, for simultaneous Aesthetics and function).

It has counterplay but it could use a little more room to counter, possibly even a health bar. \n\nI'd be fine if they left WW alone and removed the shield part of his passive personally. I don't understand why they offered yas a poke counter in his passive when he has a poke counter in his W, if he really wants to farm without poke I think making his W more urgent would open up more counterplay (poke him as he farms to force WW more often, then attack him when it expires)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-09-04T11:06:30.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a really cool way to change it would be to make it like viktor's Death ray in the way he aims and casts it.\nSo he'd slash is sword making a windwall from start point to end point (it would also be thinner)\n\nThis will fix several issues:\n1. panic windwalls that eat your pejectiles as they hit yasuo (since it generally won't start in yasuo's model)\n2. he'll be able to stuff it up as opposed to blocking projectiles coming in the opposite direction to the cast\n3.
