I suggest lowering poke damage, which fixes both this specific issue, as well as more general issues (especially in ARAM).","replies":[{"poster":"Cats Are Food","date":"2018-12-23T02:28:28.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't really have any effect on gaining a stack at 50%, though.
