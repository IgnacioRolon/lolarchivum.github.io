I find bolstering the ADC who still lets you down, is a waste of time. You can't nurture someone who is that suicidal. And in OP's case, the fact he had a Xin, meant that they weren't relying on the ADC to be their only source of DPS. \n\nSecondly, the ADC doesn't need the help from the Support specifically, they just need protection from anyone. And as the support, it's difficult for me to provide more team oriented support, (Such as Vision) if the ADC demands that I baby sit them. And frankly, I think the ADC makes the worse shot caller. \n\nIt is just as much the responsibility for the ADC to be with someone who can protect them, as it is for the team to protect the ADC. If your ADC doesn't gravitate towards the mid lane once laning phase it over, it becomes a problem for anyone who may need to protect you. If the supports stuck bot lane, he can't provide vision on the top side of the map. And it may not even help if the support is just as glass cannon as the ADC. (Which is often the case with most enchanters) Yet I find the ADC will bitch about staying bot lane because they are \"under farmed.\" 1) there's no reason why you couldn't do that from mid lane. 2) Your top laner (or a mid laner with TP) is a better option for side wave management. and 3) you can get away with side lane farm yourself, so long as you don't push past the teams vision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dorans Pants","date":"2017-08-31T16:12:17.032+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron Barian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ix6npocj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-31T04:57:13.254+0000)\n>\n> You see, it&#x27;s terrible advice like that that creates so many bad support players in the first place.\n> \n> Whether you like it or not, the growth of the adc is the most important out of anyone on the team, and as supports, our job early and partly during mid game is to do whatever we can to make our little monster grow.

It´s about time and resource management. contrary to popular belief playing adc is actually not that easy and you can see almost immediately, if an adc is good or a potato. A bad adc will be bad early and stay bad until the very late game, where your only hope is to have such a good teamfight that your adc just has to clean up. ofc you don´t abandon your adc after the tiniest mistake and op stayed with his adc till the mid game. But after you lost your tower, there is not much for you to do at botlane. You put some wards in the jgl/river to make sure your adc doesn´t get dived and then you have to decide, if you want to stay by your adc wasting your time by watching him farm or go around the map and see, if you can set up some kills or help to push somewhere else. \n\nAnd mf is imo a terrible pick into janna, because janna has not that kind of cc that helps mf hitting her ult and you always run the risk that your ults cancel each other out. Additionally why would i pick a lane bully into a support with such a low engage potential? Usually, I ask my adc what he is going to pick and pick accordingly. I bet op is on the janna freelo train and got mad that his adc didn´t pick twitch, tris, kog´ or jinx. \n\nroaming supports are a delicate topic in general, since it provides a way for supports to really shine and have an impact early, but it´s not worth most of the time and many supports fuck up by roaming too much. In the end you lose out on xp, your adc loses farm or maybe even dies and it´s not even guaranteed to get a kill out of it. It´s high risk low to high reward, but it separates good supports from great supports. I just hate when people think supports have to be glued to their adcs at any given moment and this ardent cens. meta enforced this mentality even more. \n\nto wrap this up ( and i have already written way to much ) i would like to say you are right in 90% of all cases, where you have a terrible adc. Usually they are not that bad that they can´t fullfill their role atleast in the late game, but in the other 10% you will lose if you keep pumping resources into a person that can not utilize them. I also wanted to add that identifying and playing around your carry is a very important skill especially for support, who have to rely on teammate and can´t solocarry. Most of the time your carry is your adc, but sometimes you have to give that other guy more attention than your adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-09-01T05:08:01.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dorans Pants,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ix6npocj,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-08-31T16:12:17.032+0000)\n>\nI bet op is on the janna freelo train and got mad that his adc didn´t pick twitch, tris, kog´ or jinx. \n\n\n\n\nyes\n\n\"can you use someone with dps\"\n\"is mf dps\"\n\",,,, no\"\n\"ok i go mf\"\n\"rip\"\n\"mf is good trust me :^^^^))^)^)^)^))^)^)^)\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-08-31T05:37:41.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well if you were a support and your ADC was something like 0/10, would you still try to support him/her?

Even a bad adc I played with recently with ended the game at 0/4, which is recoverable. \n\nHell, I once played a game as Draven against another Draven, died 4 times before my first kill, and won the game with 17 kills, outperforming the enemy Draven overall. Just the other day, my team's adc gave up first blood by afking in the bush, died again shortly, then again...it was a tough game. But as the support, I never abandoned my adc, did everything to keep him farmed and killing, and sure enough, even with my doubts, I was able to lead my adc and my team to victory.\n\nThrough my experience as a support main, who have learned the adc role almost specifically to improve my support game, and it helps show just how important each role is too each other. The adc MUST rely on their trusted support. When they're behind, they have to trust their support even more. And sometimes, the support needs to carry that extra weight.\n\nBut regardless if the adc fails in the end and you lose the game, there is only one true way for a support to fail in a game, and that is to give up on any member of their team, and this goes double for their adc.  League is a team game, and of all of the roles, none symbolize the teamwork aspect better then these two. That alone is why a support should never abandon their adc, or them fail willing be just as much your fault as theirs.\n\nThis rant went on longer then I expected.

Letting your adc afk farm, while you go and support someone, who can actually play the game is the right choice, but most of the time it´s not enough. Adcs are just too important especially in the late game, that you can´t afford playing without one. you basically have to snowball the other lanes so hard that you win the game before, the enemys competent adc begins to outscale you. And that´s assuming your adc plays passive and just farms. Most of the time they won´t care that they are alone and will just overextend over and over, while blaming you for not beeing there AFTER they got themselves killed.","replies":[]}]}
