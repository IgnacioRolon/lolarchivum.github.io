It's not \"part of the game,\" it's what players are making _of_ the game--there's a difference.\n\nSure, when you dodge you _do_ deny the enemy team a chance to play but they have no penalties. Nothing is stopping them from simply requeuing but on the other hand, you will have a leave timer and a loss in your promos.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2018-07-16T09:35:57.351+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove Promos","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smooth56","date":"2018-07-16T13:51:49.403+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The free win you get for your second promo is already a kind of \"free dodge\", but better.
