That's the kind of thing that heavily favors well-coordinated teams while being completely useless otherwise. Things that are super OP on pro-play and high elo but trash everywhere else are a huge source of headache for Riot (things like Azir, Kalista and Rize), and this would likely just be another case. It would also make shielding even more ping-reliant, increasing perfomance disparity in solo-queue. \n\nThose are all things that Riot has already acknowleged and stated they are trying to avoid as much as possible, so don't be quick to dismiss it as just pointless qqing.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-09-05T18:08:51.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its either reducing duration or increasing CD, either way, theres gonna be complaints. Short duration requires skill, making people complain about actually having to time shields. Increased CD will make people complain about not being able to have 100% uptime with shields anymore. It doesn't matter what riot does, there's gonna be QQ regardless. There's no solution I can think of that would make her balanced where the masses of Janna players aren't going to endlessly complain about their 57% winrate champion getting a nerf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-09-05T16:19:18.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Pls nerf shield QQ\n\n classic. If you take away the duration, it makes the entire purpose of her bonus AD null. Other supports give bonus attack speed, movement speed, etc, for longer than 3 seconds, and making Janna an exception is just pitiful and petty.","replies":[{"poster":"Final Spark Lux","date":"2017-09-05T18:02:47.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cute how you made up your own quote. Her bonus AD isn't the problem, the long lasting pre-emptive shield ontop of the bonus AD is the problem. I wouldn't expect you to be logical about it, since you're clearly on the Janna hype train right now. The shield duration could be reduced and turn her shield AD into something akin to ardent passive, so it stays for a set duration. Makes her AD still useful, makes shielding require skill. No more auto winning trades because you pressed E on your ADC long before the fight even started. The only thing pitiful or petty here is you if you think she's currently healthy to deal with in this meta.\n\n Riot tries to aim for a 50% winrate. People can of course do much better or much worse than this, but when it comes to the statistics of everyone playing a champion, the goal is around 50%. She's at 57% in gold and above. Complain all you want, but something needs to be done, regardless if you don't like it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2017-09-05T16:39:49.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Instead of releasing glitchy, boring champs with unimaginative passives and low winrates, why not contribute some more time and effort into itemisation?\n\nBecause riot is a business, and why would you remove people off of things that generate revenue to put them on something that doesn't, when you can have both running at the same time?","replies":[{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-09-05T16:43:37.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because when they ignore items to make buggy, boring champs, they're basically doing neither.
