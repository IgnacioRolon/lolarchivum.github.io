{"poster":"Sayath","date":"2014-12-18T08:45:14.163+0000","title":"[Gameplay] List of Akali Bugs","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":24,"down_votes":6,"body":"**I) [Bug] Mark of the Assassin - top indicator missing:**\nSince patch 4.18 Akali's Mark of the Assassin (MotA) no longer applies the 'Mark' on the enemy unit that is affected by it.\n\n**Expected behavior**: Once the spell is activated, Akali launches a Kama (projectile) towards the targeted enemy unit. The Kama remains in place and spins over the enemy's head for the whole duration (6 seconds) or until the Mark is detonated by auto attack or Crescent Slash. Also, there is an additional bottom indicator at the feet of the targeted enemy that is removed in tandem with the primary Mark.\n\n**Current, incorrect behavior** (4.18, 4.19, 4.20, 4.21, PBE build as of 18th Dezember):\nOnce the spell is activated, Akali launches a Kama towards the targeted enemy unit. Despite no detonation taking place, the primary Mark immediately fades after approximately 0.25 seconds once the projectile has reached the enemy unit. Only the bottom indicator remains in place for the correct duration (either full 6 seconds or till detonation).\n\n**Reproduction** (100%):\n1) Pick Akali.\n2) Level Q (Mark of the Assassin).\n3) Activate Q on an enemy unit.\n4) Notice the prior described incorrect behavior. The Mark (top indicator) is missing.\n\n**Visual comparison**:\nI've attached an image to showcase the difference.\nhttp://puu.sh/dzuY9/89cc55cbcf.jpg\n\n**Impact**:\nI find the above bug to have a definite, noticeable impact on game clarity: Everyone should be able to recognize at a glance whether MotA has been applied to any unit. The current degraded visuals clearly undermine this goal. Consequently, fixing this bug once again enables easy tracking of the hovering MotA and an accelerated reaction by the opponent to the looming detonation threat.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n**II) [Bug] Shadow Dance - range indicator incorrect:**\nThe range indicator for Shadow Dance is incorrect when it has not yet been learned (PBE - 11th December).\n\n**Expected behavior**: To accurately depict Shadow Dance's range of 800 units.\n\n**Current, incorrect behavior**: The radius of the range circle is approximately 350 units. 450 units short of the actual range (800).\n\n**Reproduction** (100%):\n1) Pick Akali.\n2) Hover over Shadow Dance (R) prior to putting any points into the spell.\n3) Notice the extremely short range.\n\n**Visual comparison**:\nI've attached an image to showcase the difference.\nhttp://puu.sh/dzvBc/a574b95bd1.jpg\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n**III) [Bug] Twilight Shroud tooltip upon level up:**\nThe tooltip for Twilight Shroud showcasing the difference (e.g., lvl 1 vs. lvl 2) exceeds the bounding box.\n\n**Expected behavior**: The text should be aligned properly with the respective stat and be contained within the bounding box of the tooltip.\n\n**Current, incorrect behavior**: The text is misaligned and exceeds the bounding box.\n\n**Reproduction** (100%):\n1) Pick Akali.\n2) Level Twilight Shroud (W).\n3) Gain two more levels, not placing the second point gained in any skill.\n4) Hover over the tooltip of Twilight Shroud.\n5) Notice the misaligned change values (as indicated by the arrow ->) and the final row exceeding the tooltip box.\n\n**Visual comparison**:\nI've attached an image to showcase the problem.\nhttp://puu.sh/dzvCw/5aa540a6ec.jpg\n\n[PBE Thread](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bugs/uq6iU0Xp-akali-list-of-current-bugs)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2014-12-18T22:07:24.054+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for putting in the time to make this report.

It's such a crucial component of MoTA's animation, yet it has gone unnoticed for far too long.\n\nSince having high clarity is important for a game like League of Legends, MoTA's debuff needs to be clear on targets.
