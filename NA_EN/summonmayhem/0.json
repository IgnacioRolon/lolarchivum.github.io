I think its almost time to quit and find a game that doesn&#039;t have such a negative community. I have played for 4 years and it is the best video game ever, but the negative attitude and play by people over the past few months seems to just be getting worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Droverson","date":"2016-12-17T23:43:17.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest, toxic play is no where near where it used to be.  I have played since 2010.  People who think it's as bad as it ever has been.....have not been playing the game very long OR are toxic themselves.  I'll agree that toxic CHAT may be bad (still not as bad as it once was).  Fortunately, we can mute people. \n\nPeople are getting better at the game, and there is less room for error.  That's why people can get so upset and angry.  One mistake can lead to defeat.  It can be very difficult to come back from those mistakes.  Hence why people can simply \"give up\" easier.   \n\nJust my opinion tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrimeWraith","date":"2016-12-17T19:22:39.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Toxic Play Is At An All Time High\"\n\nBecause players like me came on PB&M to post asking for advices/suggestion for less toxicity and the response of the PB&M community make their comments saying I am trolling the boards and seeking attention and all that nonsense.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-12-19T05:21:35.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suggestions for decreased toxicity would be to report toxicity whenever you encounter it and avoid fueling the toxicity. \n\nAlso: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874-Behavior-Worthy-of-a-Champion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Galuxy","date":"2016-12-18T22:08:50.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I don't play ranked at all (not high enough level, new player). I rarely play PvP because the people are so vile, even on ARAM which is supposed to be fun, people grief so badly and threaten reporting me! It's quite easy to get a character that is new to you in ARAM, this results in: Are you a bot lol? What is this .. doing? lol this... REPORT ... REPORT. -_- ....for what learning? \nYes I'm new. Yes I'm not brilliant, but how do you learn... you play.  I'm not terrible, I understand how frustrating it is when you are clearly being let down by the same person over and over. The verbal abuse you can get is crazy! Someone once called my teammate a kid raper! It's vulgar and disgusting and ruins the game completely. Its not like you lose anything for the games I'm playing, I'm not threatening someones rank or score. Its ridiculous. Where is the fun in basically getting bullied for being new or trying something different? \nThere really needs to be some change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2016-12-17T21:02:42.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of the toxicity is because a large portion of the playing community have fallen below the tiers that they think that they should be at.  Think of it as one of the consequences of the new ranking system overhaul in Season 7.  When people take such a self-esteem hit (even by the fairly arbitrary early ratings in Season 7), then the players could be expected to become more defensive, more likely to blame others for their faults, more frequently picking up and pointing out others' errors, and so on.\n\nSadly, some people seem to be reveling in the others' pains - which is like poking injured animals.  Hopefully, this stops soon.  And with that, here's also hoping that the pain ends soon. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ixoziel","date":"2016-12-17T20:06:32.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they should stop forcing people into roles they don't want, then?
