When I first started this morning I was really peeved at getting the 1 gold from the first set of monsters. (or 2 from the 2nd 5 from 3rd etc etc etc)  But then I just started treating as a shift in how I played the round. Yeah not getting the item sucks but on first pick of 5 if you get that one gold you now have 3 to buy with if a good set comes around or even 5 to buy with if you want all 5 and your first champ from merry-go-round was at least a 2 cost. If I ended up getting gold from all 3 starting minion waves well that's 8 gold and a good start to a income build. Yeah items will generally be better but most games I win I could have any where from 4 to whatever number of items.Just make the best you can with what you get and maybe wait till Krugs to start using your items to build better.\r\n\r\n2- Biggest Con I personally have. That stupid Cursed Blade...  I use it, everyone uses it..I just feel it kinda defeats the purpose of the game. If you have the luck/income/ability to check if there should be a good amount in pool for rerolls etc etc what ever you wanna call it to get a 3star it sucks to have it just dropped down to a 1 star and completely ruin your comp. I agree its a damn good feeling when you do it to someone else...but it is just the worst when it happens to you. If I think anything should be changed/removed I would pick this.\r\n\r\n3- This one I'm not exactly sure how I feel. But being able to see what rank others you are playing against are. Part of me enjoyed not knowing. everyone was even so to speak. But also in the back of my mind just always wondering. What do you think they should do? Leave as is or let you see every ones current rank?\r\n\r\n4- Getting DC'ed at the start of game due to crash. Beta is beta. Crashes happen but I had a few games where my loading screen froze and by the time I got back in either minion waves just finished or was already closer to next merry-go-round. You still got all gold/items your single unit managed to kill which is good and maybe just letting gold build up is the best option but part of me wishes the game would auto buy like the farthest left minion or something if someone is DC'ed. At least this way you won't take damage to minions and still get a body. Just a thought I had. Out of the 26 games I played today only was a issue in 2. \r\n\r\nWell that's at least a general summary of my thoughts. Like I said I just got done playing for 18 1/2 hours and headed to bed! :D If anyone has any questions or suggestions I'll check on this tomorrow. The added picture is my record of the games I played today. \r\n\r\nTake care TFT'ers and good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"A Sutpid Idot","date":"2019-07-18T05:56:30.787+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main con. 90% of the game is luck based.","replies":[]}]}
