Except for Draven they are all melee and they aren't exactly tanky. Other melee champs gets some surt of defensive buffs, but blademasters doesn't. So they die quicky. Some of them has strong defensive ultimates but they die too quickly.\nProblem  #2. Except for Fiora they are all gold2+ units and thus you cannot realibly get rank 3 on them. Fiora is also noble so lots of players will be buying her which further lowers chance of getting her to rank3. Whereas other players will have several rank3 units and faceroll you (rank3 carries are going to melt your rank2 blademaster frontline)\nProblem #3. The buff doesn't seems to be so good with just two or four of them. And to get Draven and Yasuo or Spatula+recurve bow is just a lottery. You cannot rely on that.\nProblem #4. Fiora, GP, Aatrox are considered the worst units in game based on their stats or spells or both.\n\nPersonally I really do like Fiora and Shen but I stopped trying to build synergy around them. And if I don't get enough fioras early to have a chance to make her to rank3 I will just sell her. With just single rank2 Fiora around raptors you will never finish her and if you don't have her for noble buff then it is better to sell her.\n\nI had really cool games with Fiora carrying them though. I am trying to get her with lulu and nobles and trying to get her {{item:3161}} . If she gets the noble buff she is able to tank longer than any other champion because her ultimate grants her 100% immunity to everything and will also stun for 1.5 second (well sometimes she uses it on dead target, but there are more champions with this problem). And she is sometimes regaining mana while in ultimate (not 100% sure about that).\n\nLast game I had 5 Nobles, rank1 Kayle, rank2 Lulu with {{item:3161}} and rank3 Fiora with {{item:3161}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3083}} (I would probably gave her phantom dancer instead of warmogs or frozen heart if I could but I had to work with what game gave me). And she was able to tank level 2 Draven with 3 items for 25 seconds. Ultimate every 2 seconds, Once she got saved by Kayle ult, 8 times ulted by Lulu which gave her tons of hp back. Just awesome.\n\nBut she feels really useless without Lulu or Noble buff as she is very squishy and while she her ultimate is really strong, she dies instantly if she eats two crits from 3item Draven or Tristana. And glacials counters her hard as well. Bloody glacials :)","replies":[]}]}
