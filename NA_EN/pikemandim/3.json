Thats not the problem.\r\n\r\nThe Issue with my &quot;Low Priority Queue&quot; was supposed to be 20 minutes well as you can see by the link my wait times to find a match have been going up into the 50+ minute areas. As I type this I am still in that same queue it has reached 71:42. \r\n\r\nI have tried stopping and rejoining. Sometimes a game pops around 20-25 mins all other times it has done this. \r\n\r\nI all fine with taking my punishment but this is getting ridiculous. Over a hour waiting in queue&#039;s not sure when its gonna pop. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if this is a bug or if Im missing something, if I am please let me know!","replies":[]}
