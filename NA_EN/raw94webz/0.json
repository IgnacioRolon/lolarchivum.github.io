This kind of behavior is definitely not something that we want to consistently see.\r\n\r\nYour account was only suspended following your behavior after a final warning was given during its two week suspension, and I will not be lifting this suspension and it will not be lifted under any circumstance.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to let me know any other questions or concerns that you may have.\r\n\r\nGunny\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\nMay all your hits be crits and all your fails be tales!\r\n\r\nRAW94WEBZ\r\nNovember 11th 2017, 2:47:25 pm\r\nYoure not even looking into the chat log as a whole, youre restating what the insta feedback system would be saying with the clams of toxicity. The game 2 chat log had no argument at all within the text, i was talking with my team or the enemy team about my opinion on an enemy champion or of the actions of my team, which no where in the summoner code is that considered toxic or re portable behavior. I have been playing this game for many years and have never been punished in any ways until this year, The report system is flawed on so many levels and the support provided does nothing to alleviate these problems as you, the support team, blindly follow what your flawed system has passed as judgment. it is understandable because if you did not do this then it would make it so you, as a support team, would actually have to but some type of thought into each case which im sure the majority would be overturned.\r\n\r\nI do not except this unthoughtful response in anyway, as there is no legitimate thought placed into your response or even any reference to the chat logs which would back your claims.\r\n\r\nThe only way which i will except these claims is if a more fit response is givin, other than that this banning is most likely due to the greed of riot which would most likely want me to create another account in an effort to re unlock all the champions and skins, as well as mastery levels i have worked so very hard to unlock over the years i have put into this account.\r\n\r\nFeel free to send another generic response which i will respond in kind with a request at another possible more thoughtful support team member.\r\n\r\nOPTI\r\nNovember 12th 2017, 8:20:18 pm\r\nHi there,\r\n\r\nOpti in for Gunny who is out of the office. I&#039;ve taken a moment to go over your ticket and account to get caught up. This action was only taken after several warnings to improve your behavior via a chat restriction and a two week suspension. Seeing as negativity continued despite these warnings, appropriate action took place on your account.\r\n\r\nI went over the chat logs on both sides but I will say at the end of the day you&#039;re responsible for what you&#039;re saying in chat and not what others do. While I get that there was another player in the game creating a bad and negative experience initially, that&#039;s never an excuse to be negative back. Sportsmanship in League is very important and something we take very seriously. While we do encourage players to reform through the varying degrees of punishment, we do remove players who continuously create negative experiences for other players.\r\n\r\nI know this isn&#039;t what you were looking to hear, but if you have any other questions or concerns please let me know.\r\n\r\nRAW94WEBZ\r\nNovember 13th 2017, 10:28:52 pm\r\nseeing as you have taken the liberty to submit my ticket as &quot;solved&quot; shows that in no way anyone in the riot games support team has any intention of seeking any other type of solution besides this perma ban via the flawed system riot forces you to blindly follow. \r\nAlso how can a perma ban be warranted after i have played this game for years with no punishment, then all of a sudden i receive two (2) warnings via a chat restriction and an initial banning, both being within reason and i admit that. Yet this perma banning is in no way warranted, i did not engage in any racial sexual or any other abusive language to either team, these being the biggest problems outlined in the summoner code. \r\nMy &quot;continued&quot; negativity can hardly be describe as such as over the course of the roughly 5-6 years i have had this account i venture to say that only as of late is the only time i have ever been reported, yes of course the report system was implemented in the past 2 years or so, but i have not been sucked into the highly toxic nature of this game in the previous years. \r\nBut as i was saying over the course of the 6 year life span of my account i do not believe something which has happened over the course of a month be the deciding factor of a life or death sentence. \r\nI have also noticed from other players which i am friends with accounts going through the same problems with this report system which can be defined as a slippery slope. what i mean is that as soon as punishment is given out, the account slips further and further into more negative and toxic situations which in turn leads to being reported in increasing amount by truly toxic players trolling others. I can only assume that through the system players of equivalent &quot;honor&quot; ranks are placed in matches together which you the support team then proceeds to give them the ban hammer. \r\nI appreciate the apparent thought of you being a potential new set of eyes on my case but i can say that you have not given anymore of a thoughtful response as &quot;Gunny&quot; had previously.\r\n\r\nTHE 0RPHAN\r\nNovember 14th 2017, 4:39:53 pm\r\nHey there,\r\n\r\nAny time an agent replies to a ticket, the system automatically changes the status as &#039;solved&#039;. Sorry for the misunderstanding there. You are free to reply to tickets even when set to solved.\r\n\r\nBecause you recently were banned for 2 weeks, our system was looking to your account for immediate consistent reform. The games we audited showed us that reform did not happen. You chose to continue to behave in a negative manner in games over the past 30 days which escalated you up our disciplinary ladder- while I understand your point of the account slipping into this slope of punishments, you had the power to mute negative players and ignore them and not use chat to argue back or add onto the negativity others started. A 2 week ban is a final warning that any future negativity would lead to a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nThat said, good behavior over the course of the many years you play doesn&#039;t excuse negative behavior, even if by comparison is just a handful. Let me know if you have any other questions, otherwise I&#039;ll be closing this out.\r\n\r\nRAW94WEBZ\r\nNovember 15th 2017, 2:26:16 pm\r\non the mute feature, i have considered doing such, but i have been apart of games which players have seemingly done this, but in doing so they would mute the entire team or simply not reply to any chat in general. doing this would lead to a loss the majority of the time, as the player would not try and cooperate with the team or be able to &quot;hear&quot; pings. \r\nAnd in terms of reform, i still do not know what you mean by that as in my &quot;game 2&quot; i still believe i was in violation of the summoner code, as i did not curse at, use racism, or any other type of hate speech towards a player. In terms of &quot;non-reform&quot; speaking to the enemy team in a way to &quot;tilt&quot; them or throw them off their game is even encouraged via pre game load screen tips. Informing a team member to not assist me is not abusive, while them continually &quot;assisting&quot; me when the assistance is neither needed nor requested in my opinion is toxic/trolling nature. \r\nThis all come back to what i initially said with the toxic/trolling players reporting others in order to have them incur punishment through the flawed report system. \r\nIf your only suggestion for this kind of problem is to mute said players, i will gladly implement this strategy and fall further down the ladder of ranks, if you would kindly remove the punishment applied to my account. \r\nI am also curious to why my ticket is so special as to receive 3 different support team member&#039;s replies over the course of the only 3 responses issued?\r\n\r\nTHE 0RPHAN\r\nNovember 15th 2017, 4:58:10 pm\r\nHey again,\r\n\r\nDifferent agents will pick up a ticket if the previous agent was not available to reply to you.\r\n\r\nOften I&#039;ve found is a player is misusing chat to be negative, they won&#039;t have anything beneficial to say for the rest of the match. I would not be removing this suspension, and I understand you simply don&#039;t agree your behavior in these games were negative. However they do show unsportsmanlike behavior for the reasons we&#039;ve stated. Using chat to argue with others and pin blame on teammates isn&#039;t positive behavior.\r\n\r\nChat is there to be a positive force for your team and give information where pings fall short. Chat is not there to berate, argue, or blame others. If other players are misusing chat, then it stands to reason to save yourself any headaches or distraction from the game at hand, you mute them!\r\n\r\nAs you have no new concerns and we have explained all we can about this issue, I will be closing this ticket out.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-03-22T07:14:12.614+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

They know it’s fine to piss off  the small percent player they ban. They know this is their game we can’t do anything about it.
