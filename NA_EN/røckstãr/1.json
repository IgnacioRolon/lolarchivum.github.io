Those chunks of missing data are what cause all the lag spikes and such. Since this happens before it ever reaches our server, but it happens *after* it leaves your network, there's not a lot that either you or Riot can do. This means it's basically up to your ISP to either repair the damaged node causing the packet loss or send your connection in a better route.\n\nReach out to your ISP with the proof of packet loss and that should be enough for them to realize something is going wrong. Other than that, you can try using a VPN, but it won't be a permanent solution.","replies":[]}]}
