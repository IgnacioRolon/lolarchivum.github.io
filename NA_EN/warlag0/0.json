It gives decent stats IMO, some mpen, health and AP. However, its passive seems really bad, even if boosted when applied to a slowed target, it seems like it doesn't do anything or close to anything, it just feels like stopping the enemy health regen for 2 seconds. Has anyone else thought this item needs to get better? It's quite expensive for an underwhelming passive.\n\nEdit: thanks for your opinions and info. After reading a bit guess it is a good item with the right champion. For example I like it on Galio, since his Q applies a slow for a stronger effect and you can spam Q almost every 4 seconds, but it doesn't seem to do much, hence my question. Maybe I couldve been biased here?","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2015-01-18T10:23:56.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"More magic pen plz.

And of course Brand's passive with it is a bit silly at times. Also, Singed is hilarious with Liandry's.

It deals damage every half-second equal to 1% of the target's current health. It still is a bit overly powerful on DPS mages who keep Liandry's torment going for much longer periods of time. Normally, I'd say they could just double it's damage for non-DoT spells, but then they'd have to nerf Cass's E or risk her becoming overly strong, but nerfing it back to not counting as a single-target ability/DoT spell would make Rylai's go back to what it uuuuuuuse to be prior to the QoL buff they gave it a while back where Spell Vamp and Rylai's would properly treat it as a single-target burst spell rather than a DoT spell.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-01-18T18:34:51.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes buff my ap amumu plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-01-18T09:48:24.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:69}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}}  No thank you......","replies":[]}]}
