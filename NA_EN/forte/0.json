You climb by winning games. You win games as a team. 1/5 of a team is not always enough agency to carry a team. As shown by your challenger example that lost a game to bronze players. As shown by the complete absence of evidence for people winning a 1 v 5.\n\n> and statistically the enemy team will have a disadvantage, chance of 5 trolls vs ur team chance of 4 trolls\n\nStatistically, the enemy team has a greater chance of having higher ranked smurfs.

I've put some thought into it but not enough. I have come up with a couple of issues.\n\n1. Seldom do teams stick together in league. Mainly only happens in professional play.\n2. There are no coaches. So hypothetically I'm amazing but being brought down by my team mates. A coach could see that and move me to a new team. (Lebron James leaving Cleveland to attempt to win a championship.)\n3. (As close to a suggestion as will happen) The grading system could be a factor in LP/MMR. I don't know how accurate the grading system is though. So playing super well but losing could result in less LP/MMR loss than someone that played super poorly.\n\n> I think I&#x27;ve managed to change your mind a little bit, I think this was actually a constructive conversation.  do you have a main acc?

It would be easier to punish than trolling.
