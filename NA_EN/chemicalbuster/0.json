Said it had problems with ascension and shaco and ended up giving me 20 minute ban. Is it my fault if there are some missing files? \r\nSecond is if someone didn't load in game and we had to remake the match, why do they still reset the leaverbuster?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-16T23:00:53.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your match history to see if I could track down what went wrong. The game that caused you to have the Leaverbuster penalty was a Summoner's Rift match. \n\nEven if this was a result of the Ascension issue, leaverbuster only happens after several left games.","replies":[{"poster":"ChemicalBuster","date":"2017-03-18T04:37:51.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I started playing in season 6 I went afk a lot. After that I went clean for about 10+ games and then it crashed with the missing file error window once and gave me leaverbuster. After that I binged it out and then it happened again. Does the leaverbuster reset time when you havent afked for months?","replies":[]}]}]}
