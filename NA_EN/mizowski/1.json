In my 3-5 years of playing I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been this unlucky so many times. I just want to point out that in the games I go negative my team is feeding to all hell as well. Disregarding that 1 wukong game (which btw I had ap runes on), I played very well for the most part in all of them. I&#039;m not saying I should have won them all 100% because you can&#039;t win this all, but this is just ridiculous.\r\n\r\nevery game people get caught, throw, feed hard, or just refuse to group\r\n\r\nnotable games include\r\n\r\n8-2-11 loss, 4-2-8 loss, 8-4-4 loss, 9-3-17 loss, 11-2-2 loss, 10-6-12 loss, 4-2-4 loss\r\n\r\nAll in my last 20 games. I got demoted from D1 all the way to bottom of D3.","replies":[]}
