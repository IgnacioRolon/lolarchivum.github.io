The less aggressive you play, the higher you rank up. Now of course playing safe doesn't guaruntee you a spot in the top ranks but if you're doing it right and you play smart the whole game instead of trying to get kills and carry you will rank up so much higher.\n\nEvery rank from bronze to diamond that I've been to I've played safer and safer focusing more and more on farm. Now I can sweep every diamond player. I can't remember the last time I actually \"lost\" my lane. I'm ranking up so fast right now. Playing safe, last hitting minions, it's so easy! Everyone pushes lane top and mid because they get impatient. This leaves them open to ganks. Forcing them to be close to your turret. Also it protects you from their jungler. Even when you can go in, don't. Just play safe. Even when they run and are low. Let them. Take the extra farm. Most of the time anyways, they'll just come back because they realize you aren't going to go in on them. That's when you burst them down and kill them instantly. If you can't then don't. Just outfarm them. \n\nCome watch me stream. You can follow my stream and sign up for updates for when I go live.
