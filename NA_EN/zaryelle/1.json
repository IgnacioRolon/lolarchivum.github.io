Anytime someone mentions ELO hell, everyone replies &#039;get gud&#039; type responses, but I don&#039;t even see most of them complaining about that, I see them complaining about the horrible matchmaking (Which sometimes can in itself make it harder to climb) but people automatically assume this means they&#039;re blaming their team, when they&#039;re actually blaming the huge imbalance in team skill levels. They want the wins and losses to be decided by who gets outplayed, not whoever has the more golds+ or smurfs on your team.\n\nIt&#039;s about the huge skill gap Bronze/Unranked can get with random people on your teams. If you took a random person who never played LoL, and gave them enough AI games to reach PVP (level 6 i think), and then matched them against Golds, you would call this unfair right? Wrong, matchmaker says otherwise. Any person with common sense can see these players should not be in the same game for a very long time, but this is the common experience for brand new players. A bunch of brand new players scattered with silver and golds and plat+ smurfs mixed in makes the first 30-40 games of their experience a hugely imbalanced joke.\n\nThe thing is people always laugh at the guy who is Bronze and gets a bunch of golds+ on enemy team and just say he needs to carry harder.. but when it's a Plat with a bunch of Bronze on your team you're not laughing anymore, this matchmaking is much too lenient and instead of blaming your team we need to blame the matchmaking for what it is doing.\n\nI for one don&#039;t give a shit about ELO hell, or climbing, I play for fun alone, but I do care about matchmaking being epically broken and matching new players with Gold+.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2017-04-03T01:13:25.253+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty much this.

The games that would show evidence are too old to see now anyways. This is a smurf I only play bots and ARAM on. He's not going to reply to your evidence because it works against what he is saying and if he does he will just call it an outlier.\nI may make this account ranked since it has no record yet just to provide lots of evidence and see how these people will react the exact same way even with evidence. I did it on my other account with a trial of first 30 games but no longer have the screenshots and the games in question are too old to view now","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SlaktarTasken","date":"2017-04-04T00:01:36.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Horsecrap, I went straight to bronze 5 after the S6 reset and I'm quite sure I made hundreds of silver/bronze players miserable before I got to gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-04-03T16:06:41.498+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Wrong, matchmaker says otherwise.\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/9/99/The_matchmaker_Mulan_.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151211005045","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-04-04T02:37:19.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually was thinking of that when I wrote it lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2017-04-03T16:13:20.776+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo hell is where you play godly yet you lose not because the enemy team was better but because those 4 retards on your own team managed to do everything was in their power to intentionally lose the game giving a free win to 5 incompetent idiots that otherwise wouldn't have won a game against intermediate bots.\n\nAKA, any elo below D2, at least up there they troll in creative ways and they have a little pride to at least try to play the game and not have autistic meltdowns where they start squealing and screeching because things are out of their comprehension.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-03T19:50:24.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can respect a little highbrow trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2017-04-03T23:19:11.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Explain yourself please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aetherial","date":"2017-04-03T18:39:21.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preach, brother.

For actual golds vs actual bronze riot needs to look into that maybe make ranked and norms only allow you to go against people in your ranked tier.  For pre 30 and unranked i havent thought of a solution yet but suggestions would help.\nAs for smurfs this is difficult my first instinct instead of the integrity check when you make an account do a 1v1 placement game against a bot and see were u land on a spectrum.  A challenger smurf should crush a bot right.  Well the answer isnt as simple people can game this system and purposely do bad to be lower on the spectrum than they really are.  \nMy second suggestion for this is make mmr gains more based on your performance in game rather than just flat out win or lose.  If you lose with a d you deserve to lose a lot of mmr you probably fed and have horrible cs and did not contribute to the team having a chance to win (not saying im perfect and never had a game like this dont take it like that just being honest)  if you lost with a s lose significantly less mmr because honeatly if you got an s and still lost and are not the sup you team probably fed and your carry wasnt greater than four feeder.  Same with wins if you win with a d you only gain a little mmr and lp. But if you win with an s+ you gain a lot.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khadaver","date":"2017-04-03T21:00:33.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would all be better if mmr was gone and we just faced people in our ranks.

(Experienced both sides of this enough first hand to know.)\n\nSo while you might feel like your teammates were garbage at the game, the reality is probably that they played poorly that round (even though they probably didn't intend to, sometimes you just mess up...more than once...in a row), and they probably know it, even if their pride won't let them admit it. If you played like 5 more rounds with those same people, you might win 2-3 of them, maybe even in blowout fashion.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaryelle","date":"2017-04-03T05:39:19.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, an individual player's mood, rest, etc, all play a factor.\nBut what I'm talking about is when you can see the matchup online and easily determine who wins before the game even starts. It's no surprise at all when that plat guy on the team of bronze ends with a score like 20/0/10 and they stomp. Or a team of brand new 30s vs silvers can be just as ridiculous, but at least silver and bronze are somewhat close. A bronze and gold player should almost never be in the same game.","replies":[{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-04-03T06:32:01.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can do that same with compositions in ARAM, and I have a pretty high ARAM mmr. Sometimes teamcomp matters...a lot. You might try and put your idea to the test, go spectate some ranked games, and look at compositions and current ratings of the players, then try and predict outcomes for each position as well as the game. Then see if your predictions prove true (record the results to help you filter out your confirmation bias; we all have confirmation bias, it's human nature). I think you might find that your predictions, especially about overall game win aren't as accurate as you might expect.","replies":[{"poster":"Shaco Psycho","date":"2017-04-03T14:51:06.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you just compare random team comps in a single lane ARAM to that of ranked match making??","replies":[{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-04-04T02:10:49.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point was this: The outcome can sometimes have little to do with player skill, and far more to do with picks and lane matchups as well as variance in individual performance.

Even people less skilled than their opponents can win convincingly off of just having a better composition (ty dice rolls).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gankerjack","date":"2017-04-03T04:48:23.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The amount of games you have to play in order to actually climb can be pretty demotivating too. \"Yeah great I got from bronze V to gold I with 86% win rate on this account,  getting plat should be a breeze!\"   - insert rito matchmaking  - your opponents are now plat III where you probably belong while your teammates are gold III to compensate!
