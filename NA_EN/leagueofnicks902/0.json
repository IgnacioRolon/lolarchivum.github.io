Because disconnections negatively affect everyone in the match, regardless of reason, they're all treated equally by the server. This is also a factor as to why penalties cannot be removed or modified.\n\nIf you experience any other issues with disconnecting from the servers, please let me know and we can troubleshoot the cause.","replies":[{"poster":"LeagueofNicks902","date":"2016-09-01T20:22:45.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is understandable, and i will for sure, how many more games before I get low-priority again? or is there a set number?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-01T23:53:31.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no set number.
