Which is kinda eye gouging when you compare what changes in other areas, and its not like ballance team cant somewhat change their stuff, the pbe enviroment is still unable to support ballance testing, thats an easy example and it doesnt seem like anyone is working on it, they just created it and whatever can be done there is done there, those who cant find any use for it just need to handle it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just feel like there is improvement everywhere besides the ballance department. And im aware of the fact that ballance team is doing their best.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-06-10T17:52:00.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GAASSSSSP!
