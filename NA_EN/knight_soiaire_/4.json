I think the important thing with him is to proritize damage and cooldown reduction rather than attack speed like most marksmen to use his passive. I would imagine a good end-game build would look like:\n\n{{item:3158}}{{item:3031}}{{item:3087}}{{item:3071}}{{item:3004}}{{item:3072}}\n\nThis is to use his abilities as much as possible with extra mana regen and CDR to use his passive more, which often is more efficient than relying on autos only. You can often burst combo enemies down with this (though I still can't fight Vaynes with it...) and your attacks have more punch than others. One AS item is only to cancel auto-animations faster to use spells faster.

I think a few minor tweaks would have him back in action. He's not that far from being competitive again. Maybe add the slow removal back to his dash, and ramp up the damage on his casted abilities if they want to push him in the direction of being a caster.
