I apologize for any typos and other errors in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor starters id like to clarify that im fine with adc's no longer being the \"carry\" role but with how restrictive the marksman champion class became there is actualy very little to do in order to adapt to the new meta...  quite franky a lot of the marksman champions seem completly unviable due to how easily it is to kill them right now and how hard is to not fall of while playing them, either you pick an adc that can somehow run for safety or you are a walking gold sac for the enemy to plunder.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that people in my games seem to be aware of that, supports tend to go for damage oriented mages much more often than traditional supports and its quite common for them to outdamage their adc's even thou they have much less gold. sometimes people dont even bother picking an adc botlane and go with a duo mage bot or some speficic combo for synergy. peeling doesnt even exist in current lol terminology... either the adc survives by himself or dies by himself even if its in the middle of a teamfight.\r\n\r\nin the end my games wiith adc feel like im playing a champion ballanced for being a glass cannon but only functional as a bait. either ill do no mistakes and mantain some sort of relevance... or with a single mistake ill fall behind for far that there is just no place on the map for me. \r\n\r\nAnd i have actualy tried to do the same think as my opponents did and pick some mages bot which seems to actualy confirm my assumpions. Picking something like syndra bot allowed me to simply click on enemy adc to score some easy gold, i diidnt run out of mana trying to farm and push the lane. all of this while i didnt have to worry that if i wont hoard gold like a madman ill fall out of relevance","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcCarry","date":"2020-01-26T13:23:50.442+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marksmen rely on their supports throughout the entire lane and midgame, and their team in late game.\n\nUp until a few seasons ago, most supports were focused on team utility, shields, peeling and buffing, ever since {{champion:555}} and {{champion:235}}  tho, i see more and more supports just ditch the word \"support\" out of their role and just play 2nd assassin/marksmen.\n\nWe had this in earlier seasons too with mages, but even those Mages offered some forms of peel or utility (Annie AoE stun, Lux snare + slow + shield, Brand stun + slow after {{item:3116}}) But when i look at {{champion:235}} , nothing about her tells me \"okay, i can rely on her to have my back in a fight\" because they 90% of the time dont, they build full lethality, use their Q to damage and ult to snipe kills, while not even sharing gold like pyke.\n\nI guess it's fine, supports can play w/e they want, but they also need to realise that would usually mean their marksmen will be behind in match ups where the enemy marksmen has an actual support ({{champion:111}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}}  etc..).\nBonus points of your team has 0 tanks and all assassins/squishy fighters and hide behind you while taking objectives, then flame you when you the entire enemy team jumps on you, because even if you're 0-5-4 you'll be the easiest target in the game (excluding SOME marksmen).","replies":[{"poster":"Killer of Night9","date":"2020-01-26T14:09:59.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a champion build doesn't make up for what they are.\nSome clear example would be sona and yuumi (pre-change) who both build damage item but weren't truly mage (they had no waweclear) and still acted like an enchanter with some dmg.\nThat is because it's their kit saying that and not the build (eg heal/shield, ms boost, and a CC)\nSenna is like sona except with a bit more damage.\nShe has still an shield,heal and a cc which are some traditional support ability and even if she pick only lethality item ({{item:3179}}  which is also support item since vision control is a job that support has already done in the past {{item:2055}} {{item:3364}} ) she still has that heal and shield and that cc, they don't just stop existing, they're weaker but they're still there.\nPyke design is somewhat made so he can be another hooker with risky plays and better reward.\nCalling pyke a not support is like calling {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} not support.\nHook was suppose to punish low hp target (ADC on particular) and also offer hard ingage.\nAlso support can be roamer (the whole existence of pyke W) and his E is a cc.\nThe only thing that doesn't make any sense it's his execute because it is suppose to be a carry ability (probably it should have been a diver ability) but riot put a gold bag so they make it.\nIn my opinion those two champ are at the same level of utility of a {{champion:25}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:43}}  and if they are support because they have Cc,dmg and a shield then why senna who has a heal or shield should make the difference?\nMorgana,lux,sona are all support who build dmg item and still have peeling as senna.\nXerath,vel'koz,brand (if it wasn't for his passive then he would not be played here since his kit is based on AoE),zyra are not traditional support because despite they have some cc, the entire point on their kit is based on having base dmg and that's it, they deal dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcCarry","date":"2020-01-26T14:52:39.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess ill make my point more clear, Pyke and Senna give their players the solo carry mindset, which is fine -
