Someone mentioned it's the mid role to waveclear. I notice that in a lot of my games (through silver and gold) the adc is always trying to last hit during that \"dance\" before a team fight or a skirmish, and the losses usually occur because they get focussed by engagers, like Vi or Malphite. \n\nFrom my experience, low elo adc's want that waveclear more, but more to cs steal from mid during the mid game or if they come mid to gank early. I'm not saying wave clear is bad, but it's not the goal of the adc, I agree that mid (or mage supports and other champs) should wave clear, or have tanks at the front while the adc safely farms as you slow push forward. Having the adc trying to waveclear is why they're usually out of position. I'd rather have my Vel or Lux waveclear from the back, than have the adc at the front trying to do it, trading 200 gold in minions for a 1000 gold in a lost team fight\n\nSame goes for turret pushing. I've often been mid or supp mages, sieging a turret. While I can clear the minions and even hit the enemy from outside turret range, my adc is trying to do that instead. So instead of dealing turret damage (more so mid - late game, and i find it most annoying if it's an objective losing game and we REALLY need those turrets) the adc is trying to farm still, and by the time they do, the enemy has respawned or whatever. I often end up attacking turrets myself, and have even seen fights lost, because while it takes me 3 seconds to kill the turret, the adc could do it in 1.5 but would rather chase and dive. We have two guys die to turret damage, and 2 more trying to escape turret damage, when only one more hit would have killed it.

While I think Crit should go completely, or be changed to improve dps rather than the burst feature feature it is (if crits did \"some\" bonus damage, but focussed on armour shredding - tanks would still melt to ADC's but they wouldn't be able to burst other classes) \n\nWith life steal (+ crits) many adc will burst, sustain damage and heal at the same time. Many adc can recover from being out of position or caught out because they can land some slow, use a dash or in some cases root or stun, shoot three minions or hide in jungle and come out with full hp. If adc didn't steal so much life, they'd be forced to focus entirely on good positioning and sustaining damage from a safe distance. An adc the messes up can be saved it they are not 100-0 by any other cc champ. I know some ADC's focus on AD caster or pure burst (some graves, not all) but most go with Life steal and crit builds for sustain, dps, burst and objective control all at once. \n\nside note:\nThematically speaking, a ranged carry should have less damage then a melee one. The difference is meant to be the \"safety\" and \"speed\", individual hits SHOULD be higher on melee champs, but crit is focussed on ranged champs, but they also keep their other advantages of safety and AS. \nThe only other edit (while I think it makes sense for ranged carries to have cc) would be to remove mobility. It's the one thing a ranged champ shouldn't and wouldn't have. Moving goes against AS, from a literal stand point, it weakens accuracy (and therefore damage and especially crit chance) and physically a ranged champ would lack burst movement anyway. Usually they have a higher base movement speed due to light equipment, but low burst movement due to weaker bodies and awkward equipment. League doesn't follow those laws, and pack out too many overlapping advantages on a single champion type. The ONLY thing they don't do in league is Tank, but with a late game build they can even do that sometimes (without hard cc to stop them)","replies":[]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2015-05-28T03:29:56.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, if I build one crit item, it's for the burst damage on kogmaw, but otherwise, I prefer lifesteal over crit and then runaans for hitting multiple enemies\n\nunlike Jinx (who only hits enemies close together with her Q), runaans on carries other than sivir allows you to hit them with 50% of your damage and ALL ON HIT EFFECTS\n\n\nwith kogmaw's W and blade of the ruined king, this means hundreds of damage just on the extra bolts, much less his actual damage, then having at least 30% life steal with 400 AD or more lets you survive easily while you peel the enemy down\n\n\nkogmaw is the answer to the tank meta!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Davy Crockett","date":"2015-05-28T02:14:18.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What really annoys me when I was starting to play adc that everyone rushed IE while I rushed a BT and a PD instead.

So when it comes to late game, crit is the defining stat on ADC. That said, mid game power spiking ADC use to be a thing. Champs like Graves and Sivir would get Bloodthirster (back when it gave 100 AD) and Corki and Ezreal would get Triforce and those champions would spike really hard mid game. But after Riot normalized the max AD you could get from a single item to 80, it just became more efficient to build an IE for mid game and late game power. You can try doing a no crit build to try and sneak more utility into your build but often it's not really worth it because you have allies for utility and your mid game power spike wont be much greater than it would be if you went a crit build.\n\nKalista also happens to be a special case because of how her rend mechanic works.
