CC also gets a lot more dangerous if you're pushed too.\n\nWell,the easiest way to explain it is just watch any competitive game(or stream,whatever) without a lane swap,going more into details:\n\nthe jungler generally won't gank at level 2,so pushing early(levels 1-3) means you get a power spike at which point you can zone them and maybe kill them,once they are shoved to tower the adc will be forced to expend mana to cs(meaning he won't poke you) and his movement will become more predictable(to cs under tower) meaning it will be easier to poke him down,whereas the support will have issues doing much due to dragging creep aggro and a busy adc,poke them hard enough and depending on the jungler you may even be able to win 3v2,but regardless even if you let the lane even out later you will still have a cs advantage and some damage on them,note that if the jungler does come for any early gank that early in the game a big creep wave can be an  issue for him,so you just shove early.\n \n> Telling someone to git gud while two minions are dying at the same time does not enable them to shoot twice instantly. Asking them to waste mana for aoe skills is not a viable alternative.\n\nwell if you shove your enemies they will have to spend mana for aoe skills as well...so...(or since the situation shouldn't happen too much,you will end up taking 2 cs from him,and your opponents will lose both more cs hp and mana farming under tower)\n \n> Reducing her snare would mean that you would need her ult to slow more or activate slightly faster. But doing either could make her op with zhonyas.\n\nI don't really think that's the case,her ult is aoe anyway and her snare can only target one guy,so giving her a bit higher slow on her ult shouldn't do much.\n\n> Morg has a range of like 475. It's not like she depends on aa's do do her damage anyways, so it's not really a strength. The thing is, leo gets hard cc instead of soft in return for her committing.\n\nCalling a snare soft cc(although techincally true) isn't very appropriate,the ability is very often a death sentence when it lands,and being ranged is being ranged,take away thresh's 450 range,see what that does to the retarded trash,but seriously 475 range is still a very big advantage over being melee,morg can and will bully leona with autoattacks.(among other things)","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-02-24T01:11:43.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that if the support also focuses on farming with the adc and they synergize, it's trivial to farm under turret.

However they were meaningful nerfs because they nerfed his damage, and his support capabilities. I understand why they did it. It was justified. But it was also very meaningful.
