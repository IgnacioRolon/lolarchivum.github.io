Once again, we would both get stutter at same time and we were using discord.\n\ni7-5930k and 1080ti\nnot sure about his rig.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hotrodoli","date":"2018-06-14T23:12:12.984+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same issues (explained above), I did a clean install of my drivers and it is still giving me a choppy experience.
