Waited about 10 minutes to play another game and won, team had 430 cs but my mission didn't complete still says 0/1.\nThe mission was open and in my mission list before I went into game but after game it did NOT complete..  (this was twisted treeline btw; SR WutFace)\n\n\nRito pls","replies":[{"poster":"Wilsonson Jr","date":"2017-06-20T23:01:05.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/cabb27285a4bc8a76a334fcdd99071b6.png\n\nThis link shows that I've won 2 games today and the first picture shows the first mission complete.. That means the second game was the only game I could have played after the new mission, therefore should have completed the mission.
