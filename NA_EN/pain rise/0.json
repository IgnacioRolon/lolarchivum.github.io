I've been experiencing some problems with league since yesterday; first of all, I had the infinite loop problem but a lot of people had it too. I decided then to unistall and reinstall the game again. That's fine. Ever since this morning everytime I enter my user and password the login button remains grayed out, and i can't access the game. I've tried everything (i'm sure i'm connecting to the right server). HELP!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T21:32:30.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that login button grayed out it means that your network hasn't been able to establish a reliable connection to our login servers.
