Let's check for that first to try and figure out exactly what's going wrong here. Use a tool like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to run a traceroute to the EUW servers at 192.64.170.252 then reply here with what it gives you. Should be able to see where your connection is having problems with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Built to Tylt","date":"2017-10-30T13:21:44.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! Having the exact same thing! The HP bars (on everything) is a really old bug I thought they'd solved and I was disappointed to see it re-emerge. I have recently created a post about this very thing but glad to see others showing up. I tried a search before but I guess I didn't include the 'right' words; hate to make duplicate posts.
