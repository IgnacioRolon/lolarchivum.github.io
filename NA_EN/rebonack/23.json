Everyone else barely utilized it, with the exception of on-hit builds that had already bought the core on-hit items.\n\nBloodrazor was phased out for BotRK, which does the same job with better gold efficiency, better damage and an active that justifies the stats being under cost-efficient. The sustain is nice touch that makes it a fair competitor with Bloodthirster.\n\nThe main problem with that idea for Atma's Impaler is that it's a duelist's \"Fuck you\" card. Every single bruiser thanks you for giving them a tool that specifically increases their DPS when fighting the enemy Marksman. Or Fiora mid-Burst of Speed, or Evelynn mid-Ravage. Take your pick, there are a number of AS steroids that they could abuse by stealing AS, considering an AS slow is calculated after steroids.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kanacho","date":"2014-12-21T21:17:25.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First two items got replaced. However a New Atma's with that effect could work if it stole BASE attack speed and not overall AS. It would still slow down enemy bruisers and AS utilizing champs, but not give a ridiculous boost to the holder of the impaler. Better yet, make it an ACTIVE effect too. That way you can get that burst of AS slow similar to Randuins, but it could last quite a bit longer providing a more of a burst of tankiness against the lost who use AS in the core of their kit.\n\nOf course the numbers would need to be adjusted. The 15% would need a serious buff, and the Active would need to last for the proper amount of time. Magic damage on hit could scale to level to prevent early game rush abuse to shut-down champs like Fiora/Yi instantly. Not sure though. It's up to Riot to see if they want this type of item or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-12-21T17:32:03.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I vote Walrus...\n# #BRINGBACKURF2015!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-16T09:21:36.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer this:\n\n {{item:1042}} + {{item:1042}} + 200g = {{item:1043}} \n\n30% AS\n\nUnique Passive: +10 bonus physical damge on hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2014-12-21T21:27:40.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's up to Riot to see if they want this type of item or not.\n\nVery true!\n\nObviously any exact numbers are just filler.  It's the concept behind the item that matters here.\n\nAnd on the stealing base attack speed thing, I'm pretty sure that's already how attack speed reduction items work already.  Nerfing the base attack speed by 15% reduces total attack speed by 15%.  Gaining that much base attack speed wouldn't give a GIANT IAS buff unless the champion doing the stealing had just as much increased attack speed as the person poking them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2014-12-21T21:16:39.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Static Shiv is very much an ADC item.\n\nIonic Spark was meant to be Bruiser/Tank item.  The thing was a lot of fun on Shen and Volibear.\n\nSaying 'oh, we don't need Spark because we have Shiv' is pretty silly.  It would be like saying that we don't need Wit's End because we have Abyssal Scepter.  They're two completely different items with similar effects meant for different types of champions.\n\nBlade of the Ruined King *used* to be a Bruiser item since it dealt magic damage OnHit.  But then it got turned into a Ranger item to appease the almighty ADC overlord.  Bringing back Bloodrazor with no AD and more focus on defense would make it unattractive to ADCs, but a solid choice on a tanky champion looking for one offensive item to keep themselves relevant.\n\nOne of the problems in League is the fact that if an offensive, auto-attack enhancing item doesn't get built by ADCs Riot throws up their hands and removes it or remakes it into something the Rangers *would* like.  And that's a real shame.  I think offensive itemization would be *way* more interesting if OnHit items were focused on mixed offense/defense and AD/IAS/Crit kept to the glass cannon side of things.  That way both itemization paths would have valid strengths and weaknesses to consider.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2014-12-21T17:51:45.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like this idea\non-hit champions have damage that doesn't really scale that well but wit's end is an expensive, awkward build path that doesn't give much until you finish it.","replies":[]}]}
