They already have absurd sustained damage to keep up the hurt.  But on Mages?  Mages typically drop their rotation and then back off.  Wouldn&#039;t %Missing make more sense with their play pattern?  As it stands, Torment mostly just makes poke that much more obnoxious.  Not to mention making Teemo&#039;s mushrooms so awful they needed their AP ratio cut in half and their base damage neutered.\r\n\r\nObviously the values for %Max or %Missing HP would need to get tweaked if Torment used those instead, but I suspect it would make for a far less degenerate item.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-08-01T16:02:00.990+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"% missing health you say? {{champion:82}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:17}} \n\nhttp://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/862/065/0e9.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-08-02T00:02:01.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:25}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:69}} would all become OP if it did %missing or %max","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-08-02T03:14:58.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False. Fizz's W already has a % missing, a quite high one at that, and even it lacks in killing potential, not to mention his job is to kill you without the DoT passive unless it's very early in the game. Cass wouldn't get much of a change since her damage, despite supposedly being a 'DoT Mage', is all burst. She'll kill you before the poor thing even has a chance to proc. Morde wouldn't become OP if it did 10% max health anytime you did magic damage because his damage is sub par and him even getting close enough to do it considering he has absolutely no way of getting anywhere near anything to do his damage since he has no CC, no mobility, and very limited range on top of CD's that are laughable for the damage they do. He needs a lot of love before he could be considered anywhere near OP and items won't fix it. Rylai's was supposed to help him with the slow it gave and even THAT hasn't brought him enough power to be good enough to compete with anything. \n\nOut of them all, Malz could potentially make use of it with missing since his E tossed on a low health target, which is common, would actually become a frightening thing. Satan's Shrooms with % missing health or max would definitely be a sight to see. I do miss the old shrooms at 100% AP ratio and such... Made you actually need some pinks or an oracles, though no more oracles. Morg would become somewhat good with it since her Q does a lot of burst and it'd add to her W's damage, on top of ticking afterwards. Would bring back laning Morg, something that I personally would love to see.\n\nAbove all else, I see Swain REALLY putting this to use. He is an AoE DoT Magic Damage Drain Tank. Could skyrocket his damage dramatically since he does constant damage to multiple enemies. It would be worse than a Satan Shroom!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lB2kGRlc8y","date":"2015-08-01T23:10:58.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you consider just how weak torment is in comparison to BotRk, it doesn't end up mattering so much. Yea it makes poke obnoxious, but consider how that's the only ability type it works well with. Its got a very small champion base who buy it in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJ Siamak","date":"2015-08-01T16:15:55.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Liandry's isn't supposed to kill you on its own.

Usually current health feels bad for the user because it's like going up against an entire enemy team of poppy. % missing health feels bad to go against because what would be close calls turn into guaranteed death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-08-01T16:06:29.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:63}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-08-01T22:49:20.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's meant to be an anti-tank item.
