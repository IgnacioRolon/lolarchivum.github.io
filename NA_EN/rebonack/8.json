And aditionally also magic shred. \nThe problem is that (tanky)magic-onhit isn't exactly well supported outside of jungle with devourer, More ap-focused champs have the problem that nashor's with the low base and high scaleing doesn't support tanky builts that much, and Wit'S overall is just a bit weak(and has a needlesly bad builtpath, it would be easy to replace the nullmage with a negatron)\n\nYes, most of the potential users can work perfectly fine with other builts, but what about item diversity? Haveing a mr+off options for champs that scale more with as than ad, and also haveing the option to support magic damage from other champs on a more AA focused champ are imo a good niche for it, aswell as it supporting magic on-hit builts and i don't see how buffing it to serve it's niche well was a bad thing.\n\n>...that its use rate will stay low with buffs until it's just better than the other items, then it will straight replace them. \n\nWhat's the big issue with it haveing a low use rate if properly balanced? Why not doing the minority that actually uses/wants to use the item a favour and buff it to an reasonable state that isn't just better than other items? If it's not objectivly worse anymore, maybe more people start to notice it as an niche pickup? It may not have a much bigger use rate directly after the buff(though the fact that it apears in the patchnotes will probably increse the userate alot allready), but if it's viable(which includes magic-onhit beeing viable as a whole), it will probably find some increase in it's use rate over time.\nAnd even if not, as long as it isn't problematic in some way like DFG was, why not make only a few happy? \n\nThis is a problem that i generally have with the item policy, many niche items get removed or 'reworked'(though replaced fits better for many) just because they aren't used often.\nThere are many items that i miss by now, and i honestly still didn find a good reason for why they have been removed/replaced.\nER for example. I haven't heard any comlaints about it in terms of balance or gamehealth. It was considered very niche and/or to weak by most, though some includeing my self used it rather often and with great succes, it was even used in competetive play. So why not keep it and add a new item for crit champs, instead of destroying old ER and replaceing it with a crit item? \nThe adc-item rework killed many off-builts that didn't use crit, and with that it killed most ad champs for me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-01-30T00:07:06.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Axes,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6E9yjbVj,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2016-01-29T21:59:43.614+0000)\n>\n> Do they really overlap that much?

That would make it the go-to choice for pushing and lane pressure, which would be a good purpose for it.\n\nYou would also gain a beetle buddy.

When an item is being pulled in too many directions, it has trouble feeling really impactful in any one of them.  That's sorta the problem BorK has, too.  Do I get this for lifesteal?  The OnHit damage?  The kiting passive?  Items should be about clear choices.  They do one, *maybe* two things really *really* well.

Then we've got three options.  Improve its tankiness, improve its teamfight utility, or improve its pushing power.  Improving is tankiness is dull.  In the best case scenario, it's nice for items to have similar raw stats but differ in the passives they offer.\n\nImproving pushing power?  Well, most Juggies already boast pretty good AoE damage.  They're aren't in a great deal of need for more when it comes to pushing.  Tanks like it a bit more, but we've already established that pushing/lane pressure is Portal's thing.  And Portal is already a criminally under-used item.  Hence the beetle-buddy suggestion.\n\nSo that leaves us with team fight utility.\n\nIf we don't want to simply up the aura damage on Sunfire (likely a poor plan).

Most people that get it are heavy tanks that lack significant damage (if they had damage, they would just build items to scale it). If it had a % max health ratio it would be near perfect (something like 1-2% of max health to extra damage?) \n\nZzrot is better for placing and roaming around so it makes it a lot more independent.

Deadman's Plate and Randuin's Omen both have really powerful passive/active effects for combat against champions.\n\nMaking the passive on Sunfire deal bonus damage to minions makes it compete less against DMP and Omen because it is better for minion pushing, in particular splitpushing, which is something the other two don't really help with.\n\nComparison to Zz'rot Portal is fair, but in reality they don't really cover the same niche. Portal helps you in pushing down a turret regardless of whether you splitpush or siege while Sunfire is better for pushing the minion wave up to the turret, but not in taking the actual turret (due to aggro issues (that should really be fixed in the item)).
