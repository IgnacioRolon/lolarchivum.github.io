Far from it.  But even when he *was* hilariously over-tuned, his pick rate wasn&#039;t particularly amazing.  The problem, I suspect, goes beyond him simply being a risk for his team (totally immobile, no hard CC).  Kog&#039;s problem is that heavy damage is *all he does*.  And unless that damage is leaps and bounds beyond what any other ADC can bring to the table (eg, Kog is hilariously over-tuned) there&#039;s absolutely no reason to pick him over ADCs that deal slightly less damage, but also boast mobility, utility, or more potent burst.\r\n\r\nIn other words, when the main draw of a class of champions is &#039;deal lots of damage&#039; then having a champion *in* that class with &#039;deals lots of damage&#039; as their only perk really isn&#039;t very compelling.\r\n\r\nWhat Kog *needs* is some aspect that helps him to really stand out from other ADCs.

However, with this mid game oriented meta, you want to use an ADC that does not fall behind easily, does not take too long to scale, and preferably has early game power. Kog'Maw does not fit into those characteristics, and is only picked when he does. Same reason to why ADCs like Tristana, Jinx, and Twitch are not picked either, leaving Vayne as the only hypercarry that is commonly picked and even then she cannot compete well with Lucian.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-05-30T20:03:26.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=StickyOctopi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LhXHAA05,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-30T19:57:40.039+0000)\n>\n> I mean kog maw was definitely the top picked adc in all elos for a patch or two.

Though that might have had something to do with the ban rate.\n\nAoE OnHit is still just 'does damage to things' as a niche.  Twitch does that, too.  Arguably better.  's why he gets more play.  What I'm saying isn't that Kog needs to get *stronger* (he doesn't.)

Kog's damage peaks at mid/early late because he runs out of items to buy.  He doesn't get the overlapping layers of multiplicative damage that the true hyper-carries have access to because his kit only multiplies OnHit effects, nothing else.\n\nRiotRepertoir stated during the post-preseason patch fiddling that Riot's idea that Kog should only work with 5-man premades was inherently flawed because it's unfair to every Kog player who isn't in LCS.  And beyond that, there are other ADCs you can build a team around who have far more impact while also being more self-sufficient (hi {{champion:21}}).\n\nBasically, Kog's partial remake shoe-horned him into a single play style that's *absurdly* difficult to balance, that most of the player base finds unfun, and has no place on teams unless it happens to be hilariously over-tuned.  Hence why this topic exists.  Kog needs another remake.  Ideally focusing on the interactive parts of his kit that are actually fun to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Manadar","date":"2016-05-31T18:02:13.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All wrong.

Any champion with a full AD/IAS/Crit build will do lots of damage, but the massive steroids that Twitch and Vayne get both out-strip Kog's.  Kog can approach their damage if he's running an OnHit build, but it takes him a little bit of time to ramp up.  Vayne and Twitch can both come out swinging without any prep-time.\n\nI can run the numbers on this if you want.  I've done it before.  The only time Kog has beaten the late game, full build damage of the other hyper-carries was early in the remake when his %HP damage had a total AD ratio.  The ramp-up on his damage puts a pretty major dent in how much hurt he can dish out in six seconds.\n\n>Also kog needing a premade is pure nonsense, my win ratio is over 80% in solo que.\n\nI suspect people are still stuck on where Kog was prior to his attack speed moving from Q to W.

Though, sadly, it apparently wasn't enough for Riot's taste.  Corki ended up as the more blasty poke-ADC while Ez became the chip damage guy.  Kog would (again, assuming no other changes) still be a chip damage guy with better sustained damage but (obviously) less mobility.  Riot apparently didn't think that was enough of a difference.\n\nBetween you and me, one of the things I pitched for Kog back before the remake was more or less what they ended up doing with Cait.  Make Koggy's skills mark targets, allowing him to make a single super long range auto-attack against them.  \n\nI liked Kog's artillery aspect more than his machine gun aspect, but unfortunately in nearly every straw poll I ever ran, most respondents liked Kog's machine-gun play more.

But even then, his pick rate was low when contrasted with how silly he was.  So clearly Kog can be strong enough to get picked with the kit he has now, he's just going to get perma-banned as a result of it.\n\nAnd that's a bad combination.  Which is why this topic exists.  If Kog is only a good pick in SoloQ when he's *obscenely* over-tuned, then there's something fundamentally wrong with his kit.  I don't know whether Don's idea would be the way to go (still love the idea of dialing turret kog up to 11, it would be funny) or whether something else would be a better plan, but it's clear something needs to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"BloodyTompon","date":"2016-05-31T03:55:07.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rebonack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LhXHAA05,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2016-05-31T03:29:59.033+0000)\n> \nIf Kog is only a good pick in SoloQ when he&#x27;s *obscenely* over-tuned, then there&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong with his kit.

He isn't likely to be a good SoloQ champ because he needs a comp and co-ordination to be function well. \n\nIf you're point is that he isn't that fun, I'd somewhat agree.

He still doesn't have a niche.  Dealing lots of AoE damage as an ADC really isn't a niche, especially when there are so {{champion:222}} many {{champion:21}} options {{champion:29}}.  Basically, I would like to see him be able to do something that's actually unique.  The simplest solution would be to place WAY more emphasis on his resist shredding, which would be something befitting for an acid-spitting voidpuppy.  And something that no other ADC brings to the table.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper Review","date":"2016-05-31T19:29:57.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rebonack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LhXHAA05,comment-id=0009000000000000,timestamp=2016-05-31T04:09:38.359+0000)\n>\n> The simplest solution would be to place WAY more emphasis on his resist shredding, which would be something befitting for an acid-spitting voidpuppy.

The reason being he was fun to play, and had a few things that actually defined him as a hyper carry. Right now Riot made him just completely focused on high and consistent damage that doesn't promote varying styles of play. The old Kog' Maw however didn't just offer high consistent damage, he offered mixed damage, percent HP damage in abundance, and the use of his spells for some nice added in burst. Before the rework you were not just standing in place auto attacking and relying on your team to peel, sure you did get peel, but the main thing was kiting efficiently, positioning correctly, and weaving in spells to take advantage of their burst with trinity force. Right now with his current state I can't really see a big way to make him like his old state. Perhaps a change to help out this new \"stand and auto attack\" play style would be to promote it and give him a movement speed buff while moving on his E and increasing his ultimate's AoE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-05-30T20:21:44.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"untrue,\n\nkog isnt popular becuase he sucks on shit teams","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-05-30T22:18:59.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CerealBoxOfDoom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LhXHAA05,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-05-30T20:21:44.744+0000)\n>\n> untrue,\n> \n> kog isnt popular becuase he sucks on shit teams\n\nIs that why he has a 1.5ish percent pick rate at the Diamond level?

Because as said before, Kog really doesn't do anything aside from 'lots of damage'.  And because that's the only thing he does, his damage has to be amped to an unhealthy level for his niche to really stand out from other AoE damage ADCs.\n\nOr in other words, he needs another remake.
