It does heal off a few OnNextHit abilities, though.\n\nRight now it doesn't heal off, say, Koggy's W or Nashor's passive.  With the changes Riot has in mind it would.\n\n>{{champion:39}} \n>It was a thing on her back when BotRK didn't exist.\n>\n>Though still not sure would warrant use over BotRK just thought worth noting. \n\nIf Gunblade where a problem I could see Riot just totally removing her AP ratios so it isn't attractive at all.\n\nOh!\n\nAnd one other thing.\n\nHas Riot considered the possibility of making AoE spellvamp heal 100% off the first target hit rather than 33% from everything hit?  That would lower the mindless sustain side of things while improving the dueling ability substantially.","replies":[{"poster":"Divewing","date":"2015-08-13T16:45:59.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cannot buff spellvamp because {{champion:8}} exists","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-08-13T17:22:05.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lancir,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=R7Zd7tnU,comment-id=000000000000000300000000,timestamp=2015-08-13T16:45:59.629+0000)\n>\n> Cannot buff spellvamp because {{champion:8}} exists\n\nThat can be fixed pretty easily.\n\nJust make all of his skills cost 100% of his current HP until he gets a remake.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-08-13T17:26:32.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess the reason i say that is because true damage (and more recently the popularity of adding % Max HP true damage) means that there is no way to counterbuild them. If i build HP to survive their damage then they get more healing because of it, and there is no way for me to mitigate their damage (it being true and all) so their healing can't be reduced through counterbuilding armor or MR. The result could easily transition into a point where the item synergizes with full offensive builds and makes them squishy, yet unkillable. Tanks could be left with no options and just be a liability to their team if any champ gets a reason to build this and has reasonable amounts of true damage in their kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-08-13T14:08:08.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:39}}\n\nIt was a thing on her back when BotRK didn't exist.\n\nThough still not sure would warrant use over BotRK just thought worth noting.
