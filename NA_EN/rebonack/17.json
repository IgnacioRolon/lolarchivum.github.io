Kog players were *screaming* for Riot to just undo the Q nerf/W buff, but Riot in their typical heedless fashion blundered forward and made things worse.  They replaced it with base OnHit damage, and he was still broken.

That would have shot down the scripting issue pretty easily.  And if Riot just reverted Kog back to his post hotfix buff state (no base damage on W) then going Wit's first before any attack damage would leave his W hitting like a wet noodle.  That would probably result in Kog going Rageblade first for the attack speed and AD (and ability to stack it quickly) but that slows down his first item spike considerably and back-ends his damage.

You win with Kog by knowing where and when to start fighting and when to cut your losses and waddle away.  It's about knowing his matchups and being able to mind-game people into getting nailed with his Ult.  Probably the most mechanically intensive thing about Kog is kiting people into his ults while slowly scooting away from them.\n\nI don't have any real preference between machine gun Kog and massive damage W Kog.  They both do *effectively* the same thing.  I'm just pointing out that the fundamental idea of machine gun Kog wasn't broken.
