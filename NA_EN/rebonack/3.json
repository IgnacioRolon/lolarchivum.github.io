For the Juggermaw comp to work, Kog *needs* a powerful mid game power spike.  If his team is going to hedge on Kog doing all their damage, that damage needs to be formidable by the time team fights and larger skirmishes are beginning in earnest.\n\nWeak early, very strong mid, solid late (weaker than Twitch or Vayne but stronger than lane bullies) is the ideal success curve for Kog to let him do what he's supposed to do.","replies":[{"poster":"NubNoobNewbie","date":"2016-10-31T09:04:47.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is the point of kogmaw then... twitch actually has a good early.

As long as he isn't comparable in strength to the lane bullies he's fine on that front.\n\nDifferent champions have different power curves.  Being an absolute monster with just one item (Trinity most recently, old Madred's if we look back further) meant that Kog could function as the damage centerpiece in a team that otherwise lacked damage.  He supplied enough to make up for everything else when he was working properly.  Ideally Kog's team would dominate the team fight phase and close the game out before the 40-45 minute mark when actual hyper-carries really start coming into their own.\n\nWith actual hyper-carries building your whole team around them is a terrible plan since they typically aren't game changing enough by mid-game.  In an organized setting, champs like Twitch and Vayne are more or less the back-up plan.  You draft a team with plenty of damage that can hold its own.  Hopefully you win the game before they kick in, but if the game stalls then you've basically got an auto-win once they hit a full item build.\n\nAnd Kog has never been a hyper-carry.  Or at least ADC Kog isn't.  The fact that Riot keeps saying that only makes it clear that they don't really understand what makes Kog (or the Juggermaw comp) work.  If Riot wanted to totally cast aside the whole Juggermaw concept then yeah, sure, make Kog an actual hyper-carry.  Give him a new passive that allows his OnHit effects to crit and lifesteal.  That would be more than sufficient to give him an actual hyper-carry curve.\n\nThis is why I've been trying to strike up actual dialog with Riot on Kog.  There's a great deal of confusion over what he is and what he's supposed to be.  The two visions they keep describing for him (super late game scaler and Juggermaw) are mutually exclusive.  Unless, of course, they give him a super-powerful mid game and an even *stronger* late game.  But that would just net him nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"NubNoobNewbie","date":"2016-11-03T18:28:17.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the identity of kog is solely dependent on Riot... there is no \"suppose to\"..there is no \"properly\"...\non hit kogmaw late game is literally crazy, other than bursting him with insane crits or just stun locking him, not many can stand against him.\n     I know hyper carrys should have a very weak early game due to their late game dominance.. but coming online at the 40 minute mark is just ridiculous. Basically all adc come online when they hit 2 or 3 items disregarding boots, if a twitch is going ghost blade, then he can either get online after hurricane or after hurricane + ie; a vayne is not that diffferent, she can get online with only 2 items, or 3 to make it save (if hes going bork instead of static ie). \n    With so many early-mid game dominate adc, it is nice to see some resurgence of late game carrys. It will be nice if kogmaw is included.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2016-10-27T19:09:15.340+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Could I hijack the post to ask if you also keep your eyes on Teemo?
