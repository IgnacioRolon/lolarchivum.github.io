He&#039;s weak to dives.  He&#039;s weak to disengage.  He&#039;s weak to flat damage reduction.  He&#039;s weak to flat damage return.  He&#039;s weak to CC.  He&#039;s weak to short trades.  He&#039;s weak to long team fights.  He&#039;s weak to attack speed slows.  He&#039;s got the weakest mobility in the game, which makes him weak against skillshots.  Four of his five abilities are skillshot-based, so he&#039;s doubly weak to mobile opponents.\n\nAt the moment, his Passive is (sort of) covering one of his weaknesses.  His weakness to dives.  If you dive Kog, he&#039;s probably going to explode on you.  It&#039;s a fairly strong (and hilarious) Passive.  So instead of going the usual route and suggesting the replacement of Kog&#039;s Passive with a new Passive that augments his strengths, what about changing it up a bit to help cover a few of his weaknesses?  What if he could share his Passive with his foes?\n\n>**Icathian Surprise:** Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s skills and basic attacks attach Void Spores to enemy units for four seconds.  Void Spores stack, refreshing the duration.  After four seconds, the Void Spores catalyze, dissolving the victim for (amount) True Damage per Void Spore.  If an enemy Champion is killed before the Void Spores catalyze, Kog&#039;Maw is healed for (amount) per Void Spore and the cooldown on Bio-Arcane Barrage is refreshed.\n>\n>Upon taking fatal damage, Kog&#039;Maw remains active for 3 seconds, losing the ability to use abilities and basic attacks but becoming untargetable and invulnerable and gaining bonus movement speed over the duration, increasing to up to to 40% bonus movement speed. At the end of the duration he bursts, inflicting all enemy units hit with (number) Void Spores.\n\nSo what does this do?\n\nWell, for one, it adds absolutely no additional damage to Kog&#039;s already impressive raw DPS.  It *does,* however, patch several of Kog&#039;s weaknesses.  Tagging a foe several times in a quick trade would hurt more.  Enemies who use mobility spells to launch themselves out of Kog&#039;s range when he uses Bio-Arcane Barrage would take a little extra damage.  The heal and Bio-Arcane refresh on decisive takedowns would allow Kog to bounce back from failed dives and continue to sustain his damage through protracted battles.\n\nHe would still be weak to dives.  And early game.  And damage return and damage reduction and mobile champions making him sad and heavy burst and assassins and large AoE effects and basically everything else.  But!  Now he would have an answer to some of those things!\n\nAnd best of all?  Those Spores are digesting stuff for Koggy!  He would finally get to eat something!  Considering it&#039;s been over five years since Kog was released and he still hasn&#039;t gotten the chance to eat anything, I figure it&#039;s high time Kog gets a snack.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-02-04T23:11:23.396+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not actually following the line about how it adds no additional damage to his damage output, as it seems to blatently add true damage to his trades.\n\nStill, his current passive is quite lackluster, so alternatives are welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-04T23:17:59.005+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mysticman89,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bgL2QXH1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-04T23:11:23.396+0000)\n>\n> I'm not actually following the line about how it adds no additional damage to his damage output, as it seems to blatently add true damage to his trades.\n> \n> Still, his current passive is quite lackluster, so alternatives are welcome.\n\nAllow me to rephrase slightly.\n\nIt adds damage to Kog's trades.  It has the potential to add to his damage output.  However, it adds *no* damage to his raw DPS.  If Kog burns someone down with his basic attacks in two seconds flat as he tends to do with a full build he won't get any extra True Damage to help him kill stuff faster.\n\nThat's the idea here.  Kog gets no extra damage in his ideal use scenario (focus someone to death really fast).  However, he *does* get extra damage to patch up his poke, trades, and ability to revenge-kill.  And if he plays well, he nets a small heal and refreshes his W to keep up the fight.  His strengths don't get stronger, but his weaknesses get less weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2016-02-05T04:52:48.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, while you are at passive try and think a way to bring back AP kogmaw (not AS-OnHit) ;)","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2016-02-05T14:35:58.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make the spores scale with AP?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-05T15:40:56.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kile147,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bgL2QXH1,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2016-02-05T14:35:58.025+0000)\n>\n> Make the spores scale with AP?\n\nThat would (technically) be a buff to AP Kog, but I really doubt it's the sort of buff to AP Kog that AP Kog enthusiasts would want.\n\nPeople played AP Kog for his relentless Ult poke grinding the enemy team down.

At the moment, the only difference between AP Kog and AD Kog is: \n\n'AD Kog burns down his target with W and then finishes them with his Ult'\n\nvs\n\n'AP Kog bursts his target with QE and then finishes them with his Ult'\n\nIf Kog's Ult had a flat AP ratio rather than an amping one, that would help to resolve between the two builds.  AP Kog's Ult would be much better at poking full health targets while AD Kog's would be better for execution.  That, I think, would be a compelling difference.  But I'm not sure if Riot is interested in leaving design space for AP Kog to function.  They probably want 'poke Mage' to be covered by Lux, Ziggs, and Xerath.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-05T05:57:41.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saianna,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bgL2QXH1,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-05T04:52:48.422+0000)\n>\n> Now, while you are at passive try and think a way to bring back AP kogmaw (not AS-OnHit) ;)\n\nSmooth scaling on his Ult's bonus damage would do it.\n\nAlternately, give him a flat AP ratio (0.5?  0.6?) on his Ult and leave the execution to AD Kog.\n\nEither of those would allow AP Kog to be a bit more poke focused that he is right now.

When his W had a total AD ratio it let him build AD without feeling bad about it.  If you aren't spamming OnHit for his W, then you may as well be picking Trist or Jinx instead.  Reverting the last change Riot made to Kog's W, but keeping the 15 minimum damage, would help him out tremendously.\n\n> Kog'Maw falling off late game is the biggest issue imo and it would be really great if they brought back the AD ratio on w.

So if you hit someone ten times at level 18, that'll be about 550 extra damage if they somehow manage to escape.  Because let's be fair, aside from a pure Tank that Kog is attacking with no team support there really aren't that many champions who will *survive* ten auto attacks from a fully built late game Kog.\n\nKog's self-destruct would inflict the target with four Void Spores.  So to get the same damage from Kog blowing up, you would need to hit the target at least 6 times first.  That means Kog's self-destruct would be quite a bit weaker if you manage to jump the Voidpuppy and kill him before he has time to react.  Which, I think, is a good thing.  Players should be rewarded for quickly neutralizing Kog'Maw.\n\nAs far as the heal goes, that one I'm not as sure about.\n\nWhen it comes to late game champions sitting on two Lifesteal items, healing for over 50 health on each attack really isn't unheard of.  And Kog can't use his passive to sustain off minions.  Nor to sustain in the midst of a beat-down.  He only gets the heal if he *wins*.  I have the feeling that healing for the full amount would probably be fine, but if not then half or even a third would be workable.  The main draw of fast take-downs is refreshing his W, the heal is just supposed to be a nice bonus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jalkan","date":"2016-02-05T06:07:03.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an idea: Make Guinsoo's his passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-05T06:38:33.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jalkan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bgL2QXH1,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-02-05T06:07:03.784+0000)\n>\n> I have an idea: Make Guinsoo's his passive.\n\n**Passive - All the Rage:** Kog'Maw begins the game with Guinsoo's Rageblade in his inventory.\n\nI'm sure that would go over well.\n\nOr do you mean something like a Hybrid version of Orianna's Passive with MOAR stacks?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-02-05T03:31:05.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious here.\n\nTotally disregarding how strong it is or how well Kog's Passive fits with his kit, how many people *enjoy* using it?\n\nI'll say I do.
