She doesn't have very good burst damage anywhere in her kit compared to her ability to stick and the big shields she can get in team fights. Even with her passive to show up at unexpected times and places, she can't get close enough to an enemy champion to do much before they see her unless they're really squishy and have no escapes, or she uses her ultimate to stick to them for a little while. I actually think this change to her W would make her a much BETTER assassin, 3 seconds would be plenty of time to go from out of vision to a great place to wreck face. You could even add something to her ultimate so that it still gives her the big shield on groups, but on smaller numbers it starts dealing more damage; it doesn't have to necessarily be a super nuke, but it would give her some versatility to do some bruising during teamfights (e.g. stealth in with new W, ult the enemy team for the shield, burst a squishy target while the shield keeps you alive, then stealth out with the W reset) while still having a better chance to assassinate a lone target.\n\nIt would make her a tiny bit less unique though, that ability to simply be anywhere on the map with no way for your enemy to know is huge... unless they ward your camps instead of just your paths.\n\nA rework that gives her real lore and giving her abilities more cohesion with each other and a common theme from the lore might be nice. Maybe if you leave her passive mostly where it is, possibly remove the random tons of mana regen part, then have her W enhance the stealth rather than break it, let you close in without having your enemies spot you and letting you re-stealth on reset so you can get more, or get out... I guess increase the burst on her E? Maybe reduce the AA steroid for it, and add in a bonus if you use it to break the stealth. Basically make her an assassin that may not easily 100 to 0 somebody, but could finish off a maybe 50%, or if that's too much even lower, health target reliably and without too much risk even if they're surrounded by the rest of their team.\n\nOr they could go a bit more bruiser with it, maybe add in some extra CC for sticking power or a way to engage without already burning the W that you need for if they slow you to run away. She's closer to that right now even if her character seems more like the sort that would want to be an assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2014-11-26T03:40:48.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I love Evelynn and I think her survivability is fine if you start of Krug.\n> \n> My criticism is that her kit lacks cohesion outside her passive and W (which is pushing it even).

Heavy burst out of stealth is awful to play against.  Riot was warned of this by much of the Eve playerbase back when they buried her in the Yorick patch.\n\n>I strongly disagree about reworking her passive however, that's her strongest attribute and reason she is played for, the difficulty of pinpointing her down and knowing where she is on the map.\n\nI played her back before her remake because I found her skirmisher play style (move in and eat some focus, get a kill/assist, heal up from Ult, back off and wait for cooldowns, move in and hit someone else) and her ability to stalk a target and set up a perfect ambush with her team.  That playstyle was erased when Riot remade her.  She's much more of an all-in champion than she ever used to be.  Much like the new Sion, the new Eve wasn't Eve.  It was some new champion wearing Eve's head like a hat.\n\nGiving her W active stealth and a new heal-y passive would at the very least restore her skirmisher playstyle that no other champion is really filling at the moment.  The closest thing is probably Kha with his R evolve.\n\nSo long as Eve still has her current passive Riot *can not* allow her to have much power in the rest of her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2014-11-26T13:15:32.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Much like the new Sion, the new Eve wasn't Eve.  It was some new champion wearing Eve's head like a hat.\n\nI dunno about you, but old Sion was a disastrous mess that had no cohesion within his kit and had no connectivity with his lore. His most defining feature was how absurd he was in every aspect of his design. New Sion actually took some of the defining features of his kit that made sense for his style of play in conjunction with the brutish brawler that his lore has always defined him as. Because, you know, an undead soldier who built and functioned as a mage made no sense whatsoever. So in that turn, new Sion scrapped a heaping mess of ill design and remade the champion with the vision his lore has always depicted him as. So in that sense, new Sion is more Sion than old one ever was. \n\nEvelynn, on the other hand, has only ever been defined by her voiceover and kit, which is an identity of demon dominatrix, so reworks hit her identity harder than most other champions. Until she gets an entire relaunch, Evelynn's kit is subject to dramatic overhauls that can remake her entire identity should they feel she gets too OP. So the push here should be for Eve to get concrete lore that defines her better so that her kit won't be suffering from dramatic redesigns due to her having the vaguest lore in the entire game.\n\nAs for what to keep, I think her passive is her most unique aspect, and should probably be the building block for a new kit. The rest of her kit needs to be streamlined so that she isn't building items all over the place. The one thing I cannot stand is hybrid kits, because item building just isn't as functional as pure AD or AP kits. Sure, hybridization works on characters like Taric and Leona who scale on Armor, HP, and MR as well as AP, but those are the secondary scaling stats that are available no matter if you're AD or AP. I think if Evelynn was pushed purely into a single offensive stat to build for, she would be much easier to balance and design a kit around.

Before that she was a Skirmisher.\n\nWhich... I'm probably going to have to explain.  Here goes.\n\nEveryone knows what a Bruiser is, right?  Bruisers are a subset of Fighters.  Specifically Fighter/Tanks (or Tank/Fighters).  These are all-in champions that are tanky enough to eat some focus and keep being a threat.\n\nSo what's a Skirmisher?\n\nA Skirmisher is an Assassin/Tank (or Tank/Assassin).  They tend to have decent sustained damage, less burst than a true Assassin, good durability, and most important a focus-break mechanic that all true Assassins share.  Old Eve's focus-break was her stealth.  The remade Eve's focus-break will (hopefully) also be her stealth.  A Skirmisher's job is to dive into combat, eat enemy cooldowns, and then use their focus break to back off before diving in again once enemy attention is somewhere else.  They serve to throw the enemy team off balance and pounce on weakened foes.\n\n*That* is the role I want to see Eve filling again.  Not just another burst Assassin.  We already have WAY too many of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2014-11-26T18:10:02.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I dunno about you, but old Sion was a disastrous mess that had no cohesion within his kit and had no connectivity with his lore.\n\nOld Sion was a fusion of aspects from Abaddon and Leoric with a built-in Armlet of Mordiggian to top it off.  He was a combination of a number Dota heroes that Guinsoo made and the kit-goal was to make an undead fighter who was a threat via his massive lifesteal helping to keep his allies alive.  The shield and stun where originally intended to simply help him do that job.\n\nMage Sion became a thing when it became obvious that melee champions without gap-closers had a *ton* of trouble getting within range of Trist, Ashe, and Ezreal to whollop on them.  He didn't need to get into melee range to drop respectable burst on a moderate cooldown.  Something as simple as swapping out the AP ratios on his skills for AD ratios ala Yi's remake would have preserved *both* playstyles that Sion players actually enjoyed.\n\nThis *game* is about *gameplay*.  And sacrificing gameplay for abstract ideals like 'cohesiveness' and 'lore connectivity' strikes me as somewhat silly.\n\n>As for what to keep, I think her passive is her most unique aspect, and should probably be the building block for a new kit. \n\nGoodness, how many times does this have to be said?\n\n**So long as Eve has her current passive the rest of her kit will suffer markedly for it.**  So long as she can freely bypass wards the rest of her kit is going to be a watered down mess.\n\nYou want some kit cohesiveness?  Here you go.\n\nEve is a Baobhan sith from the shadow isles, a seductive, razor-clawed undead monster that entices and beguiles unwary travelers before leading them to secluded areas and devouring them.  Push her visual appearance toward *elegant and predatory* and away from *BDSM*.\n\n**Innate- Malice and Spite:** Eve feeds on the life-energy of those she slays, healing herself for (large amount that scales by her level) HP on kills and assists.\n**Q- Hate Spike:** Eve spikes two nearby foes with malevolent magic, dealing damage and sapping their vitality.  (Prioritizes Eve's auto-attack target, has built in spellvamp).\n**W- Beguiling Kiss:** Eve kisses a nearby foe, clouding their mind with glamour.  The target is Charmed for two seconds, is removed from allied vision, and becomes invisible to allied minions and wards for 4/6/8/10/12 seconds.  During this time the Beguiled target can't send pings.\n**E- Ravage:** Eve lashes out with her claws, dealing damage and reducing the target's armor and magic resist.\n**R- Shadow Walk:** Upon activation Eve stealths for up to 6/8/10 seconds and gains a movespeed and attack speed buff for 10 seconds.  This ability refreshes on kills and assists as Eve feeds upon the vigor of fallen foes.\n\nThere you go.

New Innate that pin-points enemy champions ala Rek, but doesn't reveal them.  That would be the only thing the Innate does, just lets you know that an enemy champion is within range.
