(toxic/acid) rain\n5. sudden gravity crush\n6. hail of arrows?\n\nAnd these are just for a sky-falling aoe ability. I'm sure if you do re-use this ability, plenty more different shredding ideas can pop up.

Spam Qs and make it impossible to trade because your minion wave is dead, and if you do try to trade you get silenced and Soraka just heals right back up.  That was cancer to play against, and boring as fuck to play as.  It took no skill other than basic positioning/ map awareness, and was terrible gameplay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-01-10T15:48:35.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a tank skill it might be good as a toggle though, similar to amumus despair","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmightyT","date":"2015-01-10T07:30:12.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 bucks says its on Taric in some secret Riot testing bunker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-01-09T18:18:28.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FeralPony,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=870Rdrkm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-09T09:04:59.226+0000)\n>\n> Old starcall was indeed a pretty good tank skill.

We already have a fair number of Tanks of various flavors with %Ar shred and flat MR shred.  I think it would be really interesting to have a Tank who focuses on augmenting allied damage via shredding enemy defense.  Trundle can do it with his Ult (sort of) but that's more of a one-shot thing than a slow and gradual grinding down of any opponent.\n\nOne ability with a stacking AoE MR shred and another single-target %Ar shred, maybe?  Soften up the front line for your ADC while eating MR to buff your Mage.\n\nIn a lot of ways it's akin to aura-based Tanking, except far more active.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-01-09T16:55:03.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FeralPony,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=870Rdrkm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-09T09:04:59.226+0000)\n>\n> Old starcall was indeed a pretty good tank skill.

Ability can be cast on enemies to increase the damage they take by 5/10/15/20/25% and slow them for the duration. If cast on the tank himself he is healed and removes all cc.\n\n**For Support:** The support merges with ally champion becoming un targetable (like kalista's ult) and increase said champions AP,AD,AMR and MR by 10/20/30/40/50%. They can also increase the allies's mov spd and shout out of the a range of 700 units damaging targets for 55/100/145/190/235 +30% AP and 5% of the target's max hp as magic damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tin Tarantino","date":"2015-01-10T15:51:42.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if it was a combination of both old an new starcall, so that when enemies were hit some of the health would be restored to the tank?
