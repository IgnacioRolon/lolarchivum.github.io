But down in Solo-land that level of organization just isn't going to happen.  In Solo Koggy typically hovers around a 'balanced' win-rate about on par with MF whilst having his non-existent pick rate.\n\nBasically, he's got the same problem Azir does.  Amazing competitive presence, meh for mere mortals.  How do you balance something like that?  How do you make him attractive for Solo without making him an unstoppable monster in LCS?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is somehow divorcing his damage from his range.  A medium range, super-high damage mode and a super-long range medium damage mode.  That would let him be a bit more self-reliant in Solo while at the same time reducing the power of his ideal-use case up in LCS play.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-09-26T17:50:17.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so turn him into Jinx?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-09-26T20:09:29.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aI1IAEbe,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-26T17:50:17.852+0000)\n>\n> so turn him into Jinx?\n\nNo.\n\nFor it to work as stated on Koggy it would need to effectively toggle his whole *kit*.  Remember, AP Kog gets as much, if not more, play as AP in high level games.  Koggy's W would have to work like a transformation-type toggle.\n\nA Koggle-Toggle, if you will.\n\nShared cooldowns, but drastically different ranges.  Toggle off, Kog's %HP damage applies to his autos and skills, but range goes way down.  THey would possibly need to get swapped over to targeted skills, too.  Toggle on, range jumps up to what he's got on live, but with no %HP damage.  Base damage on his skills would probably need to go down a bit, though.\n\nThat would make him less potentially oppressive in high-level games, but upping his damage at medium range so he can peel for himself with raw face-melting damage as a fall-back play pattern would allow him to function more reliably in Solo play.\n\nProbably won't happen, though.\n\nIt sounds like he's just getting some number tweaks, which has got me a bit worried.  Giving Koggy straight buffs so that he's an attractive pick in Solo would likely break him for LCS play.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-09-26T20:24:29.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but that's exactly what Jinx has: self peel on E, long range ult, and a toggle to go from high damage medium range to medium (single target) damage high range.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-09-26T21:14:57.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BluePolarizer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=aI1IAEbe,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-26T20:24:29.491+0000)\n>\n> but that's exactly what Jinx has: self peel on E, long range ult, and a toggle to go from high damage medium range to medium (single target) damage high range.\n\nPart of the problem is that Jinx, from her inception, was already Kog 2.0.  Super long range auto-attacker with a poke that reveals the target, better self-peel, passive attack speed, and situational mobility (Koggy gets a speed buff when he dies, Jinx gets it when she kills stuff.  Which is more useful?).  Even her Ult allows her to Tankbust to a degree due to its execute, though obviously not quite as well as Kog.\n\nIt's something that has bugged me ever since Jinx was released.  Obviously Riot isn't going to remake Jinx from the ground up.  She's way too popular for that.  Kog is neglected with the likes of Quinn and Urgot, so he seems like the obvious choice.  But how do you do it?  He's great in super-organized LCS play, but he's just a shitty Jinx with a little more damage or a shitty Vayne with more range over in Solo.  AP Kog's Ult is overbearing in LCS play.  AD Kog's W is overbearing in LCS play.  But in Solo?\n\nHe needs to be altered so he's less dominating in LCS while also giving him a niche in Solo that isn't trampled all over by Vayne and Jinx.\n\nSo how do you do that?  I have a hard time imagining numbers tweaks that will improve his Solo performance without making him oppressive in LCS.  So it has to be something deeper.  He needs a remake about as badly as Quinn, though not for quite the same reason.\n\nI think the aforementioned Toggle could do it, but it would need to swap his whole KIT between medium-range high-damage and long-range medium-damage, unlike Jinx' which only changes her auto-attack range.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI really don't know.\n\nLike I said, I don't think this is an easy problem to solve.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-09-26T23:06:17.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"small changes to his kit would  let him be the premier long range single target anti-tank DPS marksman while still having the weakness of immobility.

Kog is only viable in one or two comps that are entirely built around Kog (Juggermaw). If Kog doesn't do well, they usually falter. Most other Marksmen don't need to be built around in this way, and don't carry as much risk. \nI don't know much about Mid Kog - haven't really seen it. Can't comment there.\n\nAs a support player, and having my strength tied to the Marksmen's to some extent, I'm looking forward to these reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"iamleburk","date":"2015-09-24T21:44:34.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that is currently one of the strongest if not THE strongest possible comp right now.

But yes Koggy can *potentially* win a duel with Vayne.  She holds most of the outplay cards, however.  All Kog can do is hope that the fight doesn't break out in a location with ample walls.\n\nWhile they may be on similar footing in the single-target damage department later in the game, Vayne's much safer *everything* is likely why she's a pub-stomper and Koggy only exists in LCS.  A champion that needs a team built around them isn't particularly reliable in SoloQ.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
