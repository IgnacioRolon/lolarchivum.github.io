Do we want more assassins and siege champions to find the mastery appealing as well? I don't know, but it seems worth questioning how much champion flexibility is good for that kind of mastery before making such a change.\n\nDoesn't seem unfeasible to tweak the idea a little though, whatever the goal decided on for such a change would be. For example, maybe adding in a radius limiting something like the proposed effect to proc on targets in close proximity would allow the mastery to extend more specifically to caster champions who also like to get in close and dirty, if that's to be deemed a wanted result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-06T06:33:06.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%.

But that's more or less what Deathfire Touch is for.\n\nI see the Ferocity tree as being the Sustain/Sustained Damage tree.  We've got one sustained damage capstone for casters and one for auto-attackers, but the sustain capstone *only* works for crit-based champions.  And that's just silly.  Why would we want to give the option of focusing on sustain to such a narrow range of champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-12-06T14:41:44.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} I don't think fervor is comletely useless on caster-y birdfolks","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-12-06T15:04:16.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his soilders don't apply on-hit, so it IS usless on caster-y birdfolks","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-12-06T16:57:45.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No the soldiers definitely apply ferfor tested it myself","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-12-06T17:24:58.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They give you stacks, as all abillitys give you stacks, but they don't apply the damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-12-06T17:41:48.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do damage...\nI tested this myself\n\nBrainfart and regurgitate popular opinion all u want in the end its still opinion and not a fact, at least i made sure to check it myself did you?","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-12-06T18:47:07.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's pretty odd, since they are the only damage source that applys this masterie, but not on-hit effects.\nIt's also pretty wiered that runaan's does not work with his W, even though it says on basic attacks just like the masterie.\nFuror enchant does work with W, even though it says only singletarget or on-hit, and his W is neither of both\nAnd guinsoo's see's his W as melee-attack, gettign two stacks...\n\nThere is alot wiered stuff going on on his W that is not really to be expected, so no need to be that offensive about this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"commit an hero","date":"2015-12-06T06:25:05.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"A lot of the ferocity tree is just jumbled nonsense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-12-06T20:53:09.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, because we all want Veigar to get a full heal when he ults.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-12-06T18:59:26.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would favor mages far more heavily as they can more reliably do that and could use the dual sustain + AP boost.\n\nI wish it was more like Fervor, a stacking system, so that tier is a choice of -- getting ramping damage on attacks, ramping sustain on attacks, or ramping magic DoT damage.
