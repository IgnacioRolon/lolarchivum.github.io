This Innate remake would solve that problem while also addressing two of the biggest barriers to Kog&#039;s success on Rift, his crippling mana issues and his woefully inadequate up-time on his W.  Due to Kog&#039;s habit of eating *anything*, allowing him to nom dead allied champions would make sense.

Of the top of my head, {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} all have Innates like this.\n\nNotice what they have in common?\n\nThey're all champions with super long-range kits that normally encourage them to stay FAR away.  But their Innates reward them for taking risks.\n\nThis is the same sort of idea I had for Koggy's Innate.\n\nGetting Snacks from an Assassin or Fighter who dives you would be easy.  They would basically be left at Kog's feet.  Same for a snack from an allied champion who died protecting you.  Picking up Snacks that are further away would be more difficult, more risky, but also rewarding.  Maybe increase the healing on Snacks that spawn further away from Kog to make them more attractive?","replies":[{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-12-25T20:28:41.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But all those Mages also have better ways of defending themselves than KogMaw (I.e. hard CC, mobility, or even shields) and even then they only need to get within distance to auto attack as opposed to standing on top of it.

If an ally sacrifices themselves to protect Kog, he can heal off that.  If his team protects him from a diver, he can heal off that as well.\n\nThe Innate that he has right now actually *rewards* him for getting killed by a diver.  That's the exact opposite of how Kog should work.  Picking up the Delicious Snacks would also be a risk for Koggy.

AP kog is basically dead (nashors kog doesn't count) and AD kog basically doesn't use his ult except as one last auto attack to execute an escaping target.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-12-26T22:46:10.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kryogen","date":"2015-12-26T08:12:24.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted.\n\nKoggers needs snacks.\n\nPlease, save the Koggers!\n\nMOAR SNACKS PLS @RITO FTW!","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-12-26T15:14:51.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kryogen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T58KU7ME,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2015-12-26T08:12:24.854+0000)\n>\n> Upvoted.\n> \n> Koggers needs snacks.\n> \n> Please, save the Koggers!\n> \n> MOAR SNACKS PLS @RITO FTW!\n\nThank you for your support, sir!\n\nWith your kind donation of an upvote, we can work together to make sure that no Kog goes hungry this holiday season.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2015-12-25T23:12:09.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

He can pick up the Snack and suddenly POW!  His HP is higher and his W just got refreshed.  It would give him an edge to keep up the fight.  Though I suspect the most common use would be to kill a diver and then heal up.  It helps to really hammer home the *kill Kog first!* imperative that Koggy is supposed to bring to the table.  Because if you don't he's just going to heal and eat your whole team.\n\nAs far as the vomiting and eating, a lot of arthropods spit or inject digestive enzymes onto things and then drink the soupy froth that results.  Because bugs are weird.","replies":[]}]}]}
