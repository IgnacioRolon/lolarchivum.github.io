This boards have many problems but until now, the thought that they are just stupid joke never crossed my mind. By the way, as the board developers always only do their job half, the images still work in notifications:\n\n![image description](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sgoec.png)\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2015-02-12T07:29:49.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was an intentional change we made as part of a larger Markdown cleanup.

This change destroyed all my posts.\n\nIt's really strange how you solve client problems on server and server problems on client. The former is of course even more dangerous for you (and more fun for me).\n\nThis disallows user to post an image description. It disallows you to post link to image when you want. I can see why you did it, but please note that other sites like StackOverflow have no problems with images from different domains. Your resizer script will also mess up many images, I'm pretty sure about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJRegs","date":"2015-02-12T18:12:31.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I doing this right?\n\nhttp://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130329201545/aceattorney/images/c/ca/Phoenix_Objection.gif","replies":[{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-02-13T16:28:32.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Am I doing this *wright*?\n\nFix'd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bluerex","date":"2015-02-12T17:05:56.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with MXXIV - the way you're handling the Markdown now is not very standard...
