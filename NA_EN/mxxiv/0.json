As always, it's kinda flawed. The image is a link image, but it's URL is fake and is overriden by javascript. This means that when I click any image with me middle button, I don't get to see that image in new tab.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this.\r\n\r\n**Technical note on how to fix this:** Give the images the real URL, not your fake one. On click, check for button and only trigger the popup (and cancel the event) when it's left button.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-02-24T00:52:47.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand it right, it has to do with the \"Facechecking the brush is dangerous, and so is facechecking the web...\" warning that pops up before you actually go to the link.\nIf you middleclick, it would normally skip the warning. So other than skip the warning, it redirects back to the page you're on...and..just opens a second copy of the thread.\nNot 100% sure that's a bug. I do find it kind of annoying though. But it might at least partly be there on purpose so you don't skip the warning/not see where the link is actually sending you before you go to it.","replies":[{"poster":"MXXIV","date":"2015-02-24T11:28:30.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the old boards, the warning was HTTP based and would appear no matter what button you used.\n\nMid click event can be caught and cause a popup to open. This popup can have the \"I'm going in\" link targeted in new tab (target=\"_blank\") to make sure it opens in new tab as user intended.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2015-02-24T00:23:15.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding this to the queue, thanks!","replies":[]}]}
