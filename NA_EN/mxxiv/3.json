In my eyes, that just causes more off topic chatter than the original reply had to begin with.  Right now I'm being pretty hypocritical, I'll admit, because none of this is related to the OP nor the board itself.\n\n---\n\nThe good thing about the Boards platform is that content is addressed extremely quickly.  If it doesn't belong, a report will get it removed with a ~5 minute turnaround.  I'm not sure how Stack Exchange functions, but generally speaking content here is removed fast enough that feedback on clear breaches in conduct is somewhat unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"MXXIV","date":"2015-02-11T23:04:47.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sometimes these fifteen people may just upvote first reply that explains why they downvoted.
