Not only is it not good, IT IS VERY BAD. \r\n     -When we look at a player and see that they are Bronze II, we (generally) consider them to be (pretty much) a scrub.  When we see that a player is, say, Gold II, the first thought is far from \"Must be bad.\" We may not see them as LCS gods, but we see them as, at worst, better than average. This brings us to the crux of the problem. I've now seen hours worth of videos and read countless articles on \"ELO hell\" and the like, and many people scoff at the idea, while others would preach its existence to no end.  The best way I have ever seen it put went something like this: \r\n> *\"If you are feeling stuck in 'Elo Hell' then what's probably happening is that you may be better mechanically, strategically, and communicatively then everyone on your team, and everyone on the other team, but not by a large enough margin to single-handedly carry your entire team\"*\r\n\r\n**So what does this effectively mean?**\r\n          -In reality, someone who in all aspects of their play should be in Silver II or Gold V may, through terrible placements or bad luck streaks, end up in Bronze.  AT THAT POINT they are NOT good enough to SINGLE HANDEDLY carry their team every game. Simple as that. What that means is that there are many players, who by all intents and purposes ARE silver or gold, that have to be branded as Bronze. Even if they can climb out, they cannot expect to win game after game after game. Those who are good enough to climb out have to play literally upwards of 50-100 games just to get close. That is SIMPLY NOT OKAY.\r\n\r\n**Why does League of Legends have this problem, and why does it seem to be (almost) unique in having it?**\r\n\r\n- It is because the League of Legends ranking system ranks ** *individual players* ** based ** *Absolutely, completely, and entirely* ** on whether their team *wins* or *loses*. \r\n- How incredibly well you perform in a game is absolutely irrelevant if you lose that game. You may as well have put ZERO effort into that game, because both you and the AP Riven support on your team **both lost the exact same amount of points.** Had you gone into the game, and from the first moment beelined into baron while watching t.v. with your friends, you would have had the **EXACT** same outcome.  This works both ways too. And that REALLY IS A BIG PROBLEM. \r\n\r\n\r\n-You, reading this right now, know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you really give a game your all, and it may be a video game, but it's still a significant amount of energy.  For Riot to reward or penalize those two players the **EXACLTY** equally is, to be completely honest, Not okay by any means. It raises the question: \"*Why do we even have Bronze-Platinum tiers?*\" I would assert that most Diamond players *probably are good enough to single-handedly carry themselves out of bronze.* And the current ranking system really does (for the most part) do justice by them. It works in those cases. Perfectly. But that means that EVERYONE in the middle basically has an irrelevant rank *that does not reflect their skill level.*  If they played 150 more games, MAYBE it would. but most working people, or people in school, simply don't have that kind of time to put into it. \r\n\r\n**WRAPPING IT UP**\r\n\r\n-I know full well that the kind of change that is needed would mean a complete overhaul of the current system, and I know that is something that we players cannot expect to happen overnight, or even in three months. But what I would wish for in a perfect world is for Riot to say:\r\n> \"Hello Summoners! We just wanted to let you know that we have heard your voices! And we have taken a step back to really analyze our current Ranking system.  We will be coming out with a series of very big changes to LP gains and losses and the criteria for those gains and losses in the next few months. Stay tuned and stay excited!\r\n\r\nit would truly mean so much to me, (And probably to a large majority of players if Riot were to simply **Acknowledge** what so many of us are saying.  Most of us talking about this issue feel completely ignored, and if Riot were to just acknowledge the problems they've created with this system, then a lot of us would be at ease once more.\r\n\r\nLike so many people, I love League of Legends. It's the only game I've ever been dedicated to for such a long time, and the only real complaint I have is this one. It is the only thing that has actually made me feel hopeless and made me want to quit.  I really do believe that this is the biggest issue in League of Legends, but maybe I really am almost alone in that. Regardless, thank's for reading folks.

If someone does well but they still don't help the team with what they gain over the course of a match, they deserve to lose LP for not doing their part of the team's work. However, this would also allow players who were legitimately trying to help in a match, even if it was a losing one, to buffer themselves against the mass loss of LP considering that one bad match can pretty effectively negate two or even three wins in some cases.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2015-03-12T13:57:31.862+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone mentioned the PBE is soon to be releasing a Champion Mastery system, in which players for honestly the first time can actually express their individual prowess in a single game and establish a consistent identity over the course of many games through their mastery of one or more champions. Yes I can understand you concern for the very real possibility of people only performing to beef up their individual stats, even the pros do it in stream AND during official games that matter for their career. That being said though not only do I find it a good thing for players want to showcase their individuality and  be able to market themselves individually this way; I think it's too heavy a burden and too far of an extreme to pretty much place all responsibility and reward on the \"team\" cause. As OP said many players are stuck in certain elo's simply because they are not heavily skilled to outperform everyone else in the game. \n\nThink about that for a second. It's one thing to have a good performance in a game but have a relatively tame and equivalent impact in respect to the rest of your teammates, and it's an entirely different matter to be the only guy on the map with 20/0/20, with the most wards placed and a huge CS advantage over everyone even in a bronze game! That means you are well above the skill level of those players and quite possibly do not belong in that elo at all. While such a system that heavily ignores individual performances to this extent forces you to stay this consistent over a very long grind, and accomplishes the goal of keeping higher elos not only distinct but greatly competitive; it severely punishes the average player and preemptively labels them as something that may be and for the most part is unfair and inaccurate.\n\n The current system doesnt give a player stuck in Silver the chance to be a low Platinum or high gold player based on solid consistent performances. It forces them to become so good to the point they have to stomp every game until they cannot stomp to that extent any longer. Keep in mind team dynamics such as disconnects, bad communication, feeding and ragers exist. **So against all odds they have to perform at an astounding level all the time just to move up marginally in a consistent manner.\n**\n\n It's also flawed in the sense that this is easily abused in duo queue settings. Many people are and continue to get elo boosted through the help of their peers because all that matters is the win, not your individual performance. If you were carried your LP gains should show that and vice versa. Consistent improvement and solid play should have the opportunity to be properly represented and that is best done by allowing individual performances to hold greater impact. I'm not just talking about KDA alone either, vision, objectives taken, time spent alive, and even CS should all have a factor in this as well. There are quite a few intangibles that are represented in the actual stat sheet after the game in which a base line or standard for a certain elo can be created, and based upon that along with a players consistent performance over a stretch of games they could be weighed against and accurately placed. \n\nI like where OP is going with his thought process and** if anything the new Character mastery feature on the  PBE supports his theory, it even gives ranks of S,A,B,C,D to GRADE your performance.** So even at that basic concept of grading can players be individually tested and appropriately placed. Not all games are equal, not all players are equal. Two players can be in Silver V and yet one may have the potential to be in higher gold, while the other may only have the potential to be in mid silver tier. These dynamics do exist and should be acknowledged.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-03-12T21:58:14.529+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">  The current system doesnt give a player stuck in Silver the chance to be a low Platinum or high gold player based on solid consistent performances.

It's supposed to be that way. If you don't have enough time to play alot of ranked games that's not Riot's fault. So many people (including you, apparently) share the misconception that because they think they deserve to be in a certain rank, they should have to put in no work to get there. That if their skill level is gold, then they should be immediately placed in gold and never have to play a game to get there. Yeah sorry, that's not how it works. If you want to rank up, be prepared to put in hours upon hours of play. Because that's what it takes. Instead of whining about it you can just man up and actually put in some effort. \n\nWhen's the last time you heard a pro player say \"man...why does it take me 100 games to get this account to challenger? I'm clearly at challenger skill level, I shouldn't have to make that grind!\" Oh, that's right, pro players never talk like that. Because they actually understand that ranking up takes work, no matter how good you are. And if you can't put in the grind, don't play ranked.\n\nI went from silver to plat with something like a 54% winrate. I didn't have to perform \"at an astounding level all the time against all odds.\" I just performed slightly better than the other players, on average. And here I am, two full divisions higher than I was about a year ago.

You yourself said, *\"So against all odds they have to perform at an astounding level all the time just to move up marginally in a consistent manner\"*. And I'm living proof that that isn't true. I maintained a winrate slightly above 50% by performing slightly better than the enemy team, and I moved up after many games.

That's alot of assumptions you're making about me just based off the fact that I'm a fan of a league team and enjoy watching one piece. And when I said \"man up\" I just meant that you need to put your head down, focus, and work on getting better rather than complaining. You definitely know that's what I meant, but I guess you decided to take it literally just so you could get on your \"high horse\" and give me some lecture about life.\n\nOh, and you not having enough time to grind out games isn't Riot's fault. They just make the game. If your circumstances don't allow you to spend very much time playing it (which is perfectly fine, there's nothing wrong with having good priorities) then there's no point in complaining to Riot that you don't have enough time to rank up. Just play normals then. \n\n> Get over yourself. A high rank is no reason for a high horse.\n\nI'm not on a \"high horse\" because of a high rank (I don't even consider myself high ranked, btw. IMO the only people who have a right to brag about their rank is master and challenger players). I only brought my rank into this in order to directly refute a false statement you made. *\"So against all odds they have to perform at an astounding level all the time just to move up marginally in a consistent manner\"*. Obviously not.

How many hours of your days, your weeks, your months, your years, were dedicated to trying to move up ranks? Considering that you maintained a steady 54% winrate there was no quantifiable increase in your skill as a player, not that I'm saying you didn't get better just that you weren't increasing enough to make a marked difference on average, it's safe to say that you ended that rise at about the same level as you began it. The only thing that changed was your rank. You didn't even gain very much within the realm of the game, as your skills didn't increase. Game after game, hours and hours and days and weeks of gametime, and there isn't even a way to quantify an increase in skill. Just a superficial rank on your profile. At least if someone is grinding in any other game ever made, they're getting something out of it in the game. Better understanding, higher ranked gear, yadda yadda. But going from where you were to where you ended up, all that you got was a different rank.\n\n>My summoner name doesn't really have anything to do with this conversation.\n\nNo, but I just find it hard to imagine Luffy sitting at a desk playing League.\n\n> And when I said \"man up\" I just meant that you need to put your head down, focus, and work on getting better rather than complaining.\n\nThen you might want to rethink your use of the phrase \"man up.\" None of those things have anything to do with the idea of manning up. Not to sound like a tumblrista here, but that's just a biiiit on the sketchy side of a discussion about gender roles. Doesn't contribute to what you're saying much and just sounds more derogatory than anything.\n\n> They just make the game.\n\nWhich means that if they've made it harder for players to show what they can do in a way that rewards them without requiring them to dedicate weeks of their lives in gametime to playing the game, then yes it is their fault that players don't have enough time to rank up. I love this game, but between their crappy matchmaking and their touchy servers I never even feel like it's safe to play, and when I do try I don't bother to do solo queue anymore because I'm stuck in a pit with Lee Sins who don't know they don't have to finish *every* Q and ADCs who still think wards are just for supports.\n\n>\"*So against all odds they have to perform at an astounding level all the time just to move up marginally in a consistent manner*\". Obviously not. I managed to rank up, so do many other people, and I'm not even close to being a really good player.\n\nNo matter which way you cut it, currently the system can rob a player of two or three wins' worth of LP for a single loss, meaning that even if on average you're winning more than you're losing, you're still having to win several times in a row just to make up for one loss in most cases. So in order to rank up consistently you have to hit a lucky streak of wins, given that on average most of even your own wins were almost a 50/50 split. And I'd call winning 8-10 games in a row (enough to go from 0-100 LP and then promos) in a row a pretty astounding streak.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-03-20T17:52:14.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> And not everyone has the time to invest in hundreds of games.

Plus, somebody has to be bronze. In any ranked system there has to be people on top and people on bottom. And it will inevitably be the people on bottom who complain about the system.\n\n> How many games though?

Then I realized that I really deserved to be there and started to just focus on improving my own play instead of worrying about my teammates. I didn't just wake up one day with higher skill and stomp myself into plat. I improved slowly by playing many games, hence why my winrate wasn't ridiculously high.\n\nAlso, do you not see the **incredible irony** with your post? You start your post by saying that it's not fair that players who don't have time to play are stuck with a low rank. Then you turn around and tell me that my rank doesn't matter and means nothing. If rank doesn't matter then why do people care that they're in low elo?

At least the ones who care to comment on rank, which is unfortunately quite a large majority of the people I come up against even while playing normal matches. I can't tell you how many times I've been given hell in the champ select lobby for being an unranked jungler then ended up carrying those same players.\n\n>Plus, somebody has to be bronze.\n\nYou can have the bottom of the list not be a cesspool. Someone has to come in last during a race but they're still much better drivers than the average joe on a road. The issue with bronze isn't that it exists, but that a player who's in it is fighting against their teams more often than against the enemy to progress.\n\n>I took me alot of games, a few hundred.\n\nThat is an absolutely obscene amount of games to expect from a playerbase to move up in ranked, and League is literally the only big name game that has this sort of requirement of people. In the time it would take me to play hundreds of games I could go out and play dozens of games with storylines that don't pit me against frustrating matchups. Rank is not an incentive to require hundreds of hours from your players. The amount of effort a player puts into a game should be rewarded with what they get back from it, but someone who's earnestly trying and is just having bad luck with teammates can get stuck in the same place no matter how much time they put in. Or get stuck in it for so long that the idea of playing another hundred matches on the off chance you might move up just isn't worth the gamble.\n\n>Then I realized that I really deserved to be there and started to just focus on improving my own play instead of worrying about my teammates.\n\nWhich would be great if that were the only answer. However, no matter how good one player on a team of five is, there are four other players who can just as easily balance out the skill one player has by hemorrhaging gold and xp to the enemy team. A plat 5 with two items is still gonna lose to a Silver 2 with six. There *is* a point where a single player can no longer carry a match, and more often than not in low elos that point is pretty close to the beginning of that match. This is a team game, and improving your play can only go so far when you've got a random chance of the four other teammates you're about to end up with and whether or not they've been doing the same on their own.\n\n>Also, do you not see the incredible irony with your post? You start your post by saying that it's not fair that players who don't have time to play are stuck with a low rank. Then you turn around and tell me that my rank doesn't matter and means nothing. If rank doesn't matter then why do people care that they're in low elo? Make up your damn mind.\n\nMake sure you're stopping to read for comprehension before you try to analyze irony. My point isn't that rank doesn't matter, it's that rank is not what determines a person's skill. Someone doesn't hit gold and suddenly upgrade to a gold level of play. A bronze/silver player will be at a gold level of play on a personal basis and have to grind their way up to the actual rank; actually having it doesn't make you any better or worse. Just helps you out during matchmaking. All I said was that with such incremental increases in skill, or such an even winrate, there is no quanitifiable way to judge player progression. And that holds true, as if player progression is partially dependent upon being able to play hundreds upon hundreds of games, only the players who can do so can be judged as having progress. **And that is inherently flawed.**\n\n\"We don't know whether you're getting better or not unless you play three hundred games. You can't play hundreds of games? How are we supposed to know whether you're a competent player or not?? BACK TO BRONZE WITH YOU, PLEBIAN!!\"\n\nRank absolutely matters, but only in terms of matchmaking and who you're getting stuck with. But in terms of what it's actually giving you? Nothing. Having your profile have that gold badge doesn't give you any benefits in game. You're no stronger or faster. And it certainly doesn't help you outside of the game in any way, there are no skills you glean from League that can apply in real world scenarios. Anything that's requiring hundreds of hours from someone should be giving them some sort of benefit. And in a game? That benefit should be in the game. Right now, there is zero benefit in game. The closest you come to a benefit from being in a higher rank is the chance to play with more competent players, which **if everyone had the same chance of there would be no issues with matchmaking.**\n\nGet it? This game is demanding hundreds of hours of commitment from its players and is not giving them a benefit that is in proportion to the amount of time its expecting. Either there needs to be more incentive to rank up to outweigh the cost to the player, or there needs to be less cost to the player to balance out the lack of incentive. Right now a low elo player has almost no incentive, and most of the success stories you see are people who, like you, say that they only made it out after hundreds of games (which a pattern amongst the playerbase so repetitive should be a cause for concern up at Rito) or people who say that they got really lucky and landed a solid string of teams. Nobody ever says they carried themselves out of bronze. \n\n>You only lose more LP than you gain if your MMR is low. I've been gaining 20-30 LP per win this season and only losing 10.\n\nIf that's true, and I'm deign to admit it is given literally everything I have seen and heard from every other source about this game since first picking it up, do you not see the inherent flaw in that? For someone who's talking about irony, that's a rather large thing for you to miss out on.\n\n\"Are you a good player? Congrats! It's now easy for you to stay a good player. Are you a bad player? GOOD LUCK GETTING OUT OF THE HOLE THAT YOU CLEARLY COULD HAVE ONLY DUG FOR YOURSELF.\"\n\nIt's like the credit system. The better your credit, the lower your payments on things. But it's the people with low credit who are naturally going to have a harder time with higher payments. Why should lower leveled players be losing more per match, when there's so much more than what they can control that can, and usually does, go wrong in a match, while higher level players, who are supposed to be much more in control, much more communicative, and have a much deeper understanding of the game, be punished less harshly for losing the game that they're supposed to be better at? Sorry, but in a situation where I'm looking at two groups of people, one who appear to be relatively inexeperienced and one who know what they're doing by heart, and both groups fail? I'm going to be much less harsh on the inexperienced group and expect much more of the experienced ones. From what you're saying, once you get to a certain MMR you no longer need to earn your rank, you just sorta float around it. Win one game, lose three, it's all good in the end. Win one game and lose three in low elos and you're being demoted.\n\nIf you can't see why that's inherently fucked up, this conversation is pretty effectively over.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-03-21T23:01:07.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I see from you is a lot of salt over your rank. Playing league for hundreds of games does give you something. Fun. If you're playing with the sole purpose of increasing your rank then that's the problem to begin with. I said it took me a few hundred games to go from silver to plat. I never said they were all ranked games. When I realized I wasn't good enough to climb out of silver I quit ranked altogether and only played normals for about 6 months. I probably played about 200 normal games, just having fun and practicing. When I came back to ranked I immediately shot to gold because my skill had increased by practicing. And I had fun while I did it. I was (and still am) completely satisfied with my game experience because even though I do try to rank up, that is not my immediate goal when playing league. I just want to have fun. Therefore, I didn't see 200-300 games as a huge deal to play, because I played them over a long period of time and didn't concern myself too much with rank. I wasn't sitting in silver saying \"Man, I deserve to be plat, but why will it take me 300 games to get there? No fair!\". I just thought to myself: \"I want to rank up, and in order to do that I need to practice. However many games it takes, I'm willing to put in the effort.\"\n\nDon't you see that if it takes you 300 games to rank up, it's not because Riot's system is broken, it's because you suck? And yes, I'm fully aware that what I just said implies that I suck, something I openly admit. I suck at league. You'll never improve if you don't acknowledge this. This is the problem with so many players. So many people convince themselves that they deserve a higher rank, and then they stop looking for mistakes in themselves. If a bronze is convinced that they deserve silver then they will always blame every loss on their teammates and Riot (sound familiar) and never realize their own mistakes. On the other hand, if you tell yourself that you suck and blame every loss on yourself you will improve very fast. I know it's hard to do, but I started improving right away when I became extremely critical of myself and not my teammates. For example, let's say your playing ADC and score a double kill on their bot lane. The average player stuck in bronze will think \"HAHA I'm so good at ADC. Get rekt noobs look how good I am, I deserve silver!\". On the other hand a player (in any elo) with the right mentality will say \"Fuck, I burned my flash in that fight even though I could have gotten both kills without using it. Why do I suck so much?!? Fuck fuck fuck me.\". One of these players will end up climbing, one will stay where he is until his mentality improves.\n\nYou're calling 300 games absurd because you don't have the patience to put in the effort, because you want instant results instead of steady improvement. You're like the guy who complains about having to workout at the gym everyday in order to get ripped, and wants to use those \"controversial new muscle gain pills\" that you see on click-bait adds instead. Yes, it takes hundreds of games to improve. Do you know why it took me 300 games? Because until I had played those 300 games, I wasn't good enough to be in plat. You don't gain elo just by playing lots of games, you gain elo by getting better at the game. And it takes many games to get better at league. League is a complicated game with a huge learning curve. That's why it's so fun, and also so hard to improve. I've said before that it's not Riot's fault that you don't have enough time to rank up. Let me rephrase that: It's not Riot's fault that you don't have enough time to get better at league. Would you like for Riot to just remove every difficult aspect of the game so that everyone can be in challenger and feel good about themselves? To be honest you're coming off like a middle-school PE teacher talking about how everyone has to be a winner.\n\nYour rank has nothing to do with how much fun you have in game. It's not like the game becomes more fun to play when your elo is higher. Actually, it could become more fun to play when your skill goes up, if only because you see yourself making cool plays that you couldn't make before. You keep talking about the chance to play with more competent players, but the word competent is completely relative. A  player who is competent in bronze would be trash in plat, and a player who is competent in plat would be utter trash in diamond/challenger. So where does competence start? At what elo do you have to be before you can say that the people in it are competent? I hope you can see that there's no right answer to this question, everything is measured comparatively.\n\n>You can have the bottom of the list not be a cesspool. Someone has to come in last during a race but they're still much better drivers than the average joe on a road. The issue with bronze isn't that it exists, but that a player who's in it is fighting against their teams more often than against the enemy to progress.\n\nNot anyone can enter a car race, you have to have at least some level of skill to drive a race-car. On the other hand, anyone can play ranked league. So it makes sense that the very bottom of the ranked pool will be a cesspool. Bronze 5 is filled with literally the worst players that exist. Don't blame Riot for that, it's not their fault that people who are just that bad choose to play league. It's okay to be terrible at league as long as you're having fun.\n\n> If that's true, and I'm deign to admit it is given literally everything I have seen and heard from every other source about this game since first picking it up, do you not see the inherent flaw in that? For someone who's talking about irony, that's a rather large thing for you to miss out on.\n\nIt is true that I've been gaining more LP than I've been losing per game. Your \"sources\" on LP gain are probably just the QQ threads on these forums form people complaining that they lose more LP per loss than they gain per win. Nobody who gains more per win complains about it so you never hear about it. It's inevitable that the people who are most frustrated will be the loudest and make it seem like everything is shit. These forums make it seem like everybody hates everything about league, but that's just because most people on the forums in the first place are here to complain. What % of the playerbase do you reckon even comes on these forums. Not much. I gain more LP per win, so do most of my friends. If you gain less LP per win than loss then that's because you've been losing to people who have the same or lower MMR than you.\n\n>It's like the credit system. The better your credit, the lower your payments on things. But it's the people with low credit who are naturally going to have a harder time with higher payments.

Win one game and lose three in low elos and you're being demoted.\n\nHow much LP you gain or lose is based on how your MMR stands comparatively to the other players in your league. It is not based on absolute MMR. A player in diamond can lose more LP per loss than they gain per win if they lose too often. And a player in bronze can gain more LP per win as long as they win enough. Also, if I lose 3 win 1 maybe it won't lower my LP by much right away, but if I consistently lose 3 win 1 then you can bet your ass I'll start to see my LP gains per win going smaller and smaller, and my LP losses per loss getting larger and larger.","replies":[{"poster":"Cale017","date":"2015-03-23T04:47:20.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">All I see from you is a lot of salt over your rank.\n\nAnd I refuse to read past there.

Too many variables to possibly program it accurately. You can't just count Dragon kills or anything tangible because the program cannot know the context accurately. Mostly because something positive 5 minutes ago might turn out to be negative now. Maybe that Dragon cost you a Baron. Maybe it cost 2 Towers which had a bigger snowball affect.\n\n- God I hate professional sports analogies. If Beckham constantly makes mistakes, he will absolutely be demoted in one way or another. Smaller contract, worse team, less playing time. One mistake won't make a difference in the entirety of his career (just like in LoL), but it made enough of a negative impact for you to remember it. You should not be rewarded for these mistakes. You should be punished. Just like how Beckham was likely indirectly punished for missing it (less jersey sales, less endorsements, etc).

Riot would have to create what would most likely be the longest and most complicated piece of code ever written in order to make it accurately measure every play \n\n**For example you place a ward in dragon pit. Do you get points or lose points?**\n\nThis seems obvious. Why would it be bad to have dragon warded? Well, here are a list of questions you have to ask to truly know if that was a good ward.\n\n**1. Where in the pit is the ward.**\nYou may have placed the ward in the back of dragon pit, meaning it gets you less vision of the river, but it is also less likely to get swept or found by a pink depending on where it is.\n\n**2. Was the ward just to check over the wall to see if they are getting Dragon?**\nIf the ward is just to avoid facechecking, is it worth any less than a regular ward, placed for vision? It may keep you from walking into a bad situation, or let you get the timer, but it could also just end up being a waste of a ward.\n\n**3. Will Dragon spawn within the time the ward is placed?**\nClearly placing a sight ward that will just fade away because dragon doesn't spawn for 3 mins is a waste, but if you didn't have the timer you may not have known that.\n\n**4. What role are you playing?**\nTypically it's either the support or junger who keeps dragon warded. However is your ward worth any less if you are the mid laner or adc? What if you are the top laner and you walked all the way down from top lane just to place a ward?\n\n**5. What was your team doing while you warded?**\n For example your team was grouping top and pushing for the inhib while you were warding, and loses a teamfight because you were not there.  Or what if your team was grouping for drag? Maybe a teamfight had just ended and you were placing the ward before you backed.\n\n**6. Did anyone find your ward?**\nIf someone got extra gold because the found and killed your ward that helps their team, but how does it affect your score? Maybe you placed it in a rarely swept spot and they just got lucky or misclicked. Maybe your ward was in the obvious place, but your team needed that spot warded.\n\n**7. What happened while you warded?**\nYou could have missed farm or gotten killed while warding. Maybe you went to ward as a support and your adc got hit by a blitz hook and died.\n\nThis is a quick list of different things to take into account even when all you did was place a ward in a specific spot. As you can see each of these questions also generated several more specific questions to go along with it. Now imagine you multiply this for every spot on the map you can ward. Some of those spots would have more questions to ask, some would have less. In the end though there would be a huge amount of programming to be done, simply to cover warding. You would have to do even more do calculate every aspect of a teamfight.\n\nNow you should clearly see that creating an accurate system that can thoroughly evaluate every aspect of a game would be ridiculous to attempt. Not only because of the incredible amount of time and resources that would need to be spent to develop this program, but also because of the godlike computer system needed to maintain it. Riot would need to have a system of servers running an unimaginably complex piece of code for every single player playing a ranked game all at the same time, for every single action they make. The data storage needed would also have to be gigantic.\n\nYou may be asking, \"Why can't they just do something simpler than this piece of god-code?\" The answer to that: expoitability. If the code isn't this complex then it would be too easy to exploit. For example if every ward a player placed gave that player 0.01 points, then people would just buy sightstone and sit in base for 20 minutes spamming wards. Even if you make it so that only well placed wards give you those points, then people will just race to the areas which give more points to try and place wards before anyone else can. It needs to be this complex to get rid of the potential for exploitation.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Riot needs to make the most complex piece of code in the world to accurately judge everyone's individual performance.\n\n2. If they don't people can just exploit it.\n\n3. They would also need a god-computer to run that code.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"VoxMortuum","date":"2015-03-13T02:31:15.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Izbiz,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3Bll9zBE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-12T14:21:38.473+0000)\n>\n> Let me start off by saying that I agree that the ranking system is horrible.

At 20 minutes 4 people who are semi competent should be capable of holding off a 5 man push, or slowing it down to a 8 or 10 wave crawl per tower. if his team cant protect towers 4 v 5 at 20 minutes his team is playing very poorly. for them to take 2 inhibs in the time he (Nasus Q takes towers really fast.) takes 1 with nobody trying to stop him? id say his team must be afk.\n\n1. Udyr has no real gap closer. did his team spend 40 minutes pushed up, making it impossible to gank safely or successfully? did they then flame udyr for not ganking every 2 minutes despite their terrible positioning?\n\n1. Yes. If a fed yi is the only thing that's preventing your team from being facerolled then your team has a problem. so he made a bad play. he died one time. shame on him. \n\n1. yes. you don't get handicap bonus because you picked x champion over y champion. if you want easy farm pick a dif champion. good job on keeping even though.\n\n1. Nami shouldn't be in the enemy jungle warding if they don't have tabs on the enemy team. if they do then its not much of a risk anyway. and if they need that ward bad enough more than just name will be going in for safety. If lee is running around in the enemy jungle doing lee things... are you saying his wards are less helpful because lee placed them and not nami?\n\nNo system ever devised is immune to abuse.

Screw the flag (or in this case, a tower), let me go on a killing spree.\"\n\n\n**Forewarned**: Please remember that I am simply interested in a system of numbers as opposed to actually competing. I have no real interest in competitive climbing due to time commitments and such. \n\nWith that said, any points for kills/assists would of course have to be over time. (aka something like 19+8 k+a divided by time (minutes) to give an LP boost would obviously be more fair than allowing a 100 minute game to go on with 50 kills and not judging time used.\n\nIn most multiplayer games focusing on objective plays, the team is of course exalted to a higher standard. An easy fix to this would simply be taking the optimal use for every part of the game in terms of team play and applying points to it.\n\n***Example: wards***\nA ward's effectiveness CAN be judged by someone jumping to it (Kat, lee) to avoid death or get kills. However, the more conventional use of a ward is of course vision. Instead of dealing with anything such as saving lifes/gaining assists for such acts, a better use of LP would be to determine the amount of time a ward spends spotting an opponent. Over the span of 3 minutes, how often is that ward spotting someone that **otherwise wouldn't be spotted**? A multiple of how many people were spotted could be included, as well as a cap amount of points a ward can actually give (probably like .5 LP max per ward?). The criteria of points gained would have to be balanced appropriately, but ignoring more subtle or (in context of the programming behind it) harder to determine cases would make an easier use. The limiter to this would be something like it is unrestrained up until x-time where it is reasonable to expect that wards can be placed simply for scouting. Later in the game, the points gained would be greatly diminished or non-existent to prevent abuse of the system. A reasonable time might be 45 minutes, as most games are decided by this point... even long games seem to be.\n\n***Further, Turrets***\nTurrets are already recorded by who hits them. However, simply saying \"taking a turret gives x points to all who took part\" would inspire rage from those unable to participate... While it might encourage grouping, who can save if side wave control wouldn't suffer? More importantly, it might force decisions otherwise not made (such as supports foregoing wards with the team around to be apart of the turret kill). More reasonably, something like a turret would be taken in good faith that everyone on the team had some affect on it falling (as it currently does... Seeing as a win expects this as well with the current system). As there is indeed no proper way to judge the reason a turret fell (was one of the teammates on the other side of the map drawing attention for minutes to allow waves to push?), blind faith of a team effort would have to be taken *if at all*. Since winning is the ultimate goal and turrets are a way to win, you cannot expect a turret kill to warrant that much (especially if we assume the most points would still come from a win). If anything, slight boosts would be given for every turret taken over five (the bare minimum needed to win the game).  \n\n***On Kills***\nThe issue is the ever-present form of kills and assists. This is because sometimes kills translate to objectives and other times they don't. As much as a support can enable an adc to get kills, the adc via wave clear and tower taking enables safer deep wards. But as this isn't always the case, you would almost always simply throw it out as unclear data. A better metric to benefit the likes of an apc/adc (or any laner) would to take average farm at 10 and 20 minutes. If they exceed numbers, boost. Otherwise, nah. Or perhaps even a ratio between average and actual to determine an amount. You wouldn't do it every ten minutes since late game, cs has no meaning beyond pressuring objectives (back to  the win being the apple on the tree everyone wants). Note: relic shield would have to be factored in correctly with gold shared.\n\nA way to benefit a jungler in such a situation would to be to take every lane's average and actual and average it at the same intervals, as well as putting a small bit of emphasis on his own camps (lesser importance, as it would either have to be specific on monsters and not minions to prevent boosting a score, which is not always the case due to ingame circumstances).\n\nAnd to inspire consistency in farming and not just rising for a point, an rng could determine the time it would be marked within parameters of time (between 8 and 15 for the first, 18 and 25 for the second, so on and so forth). \n\nI wouldn't expect an entire system on this, but rather something like this could be small boosts to mitigate a loss or increase a win.\n\n\n**Edit**: let me clarify \"average farm\". I mean the average farm as the farm other players playing that champion have at that moment of time, not the average cs you'd find in that lane or such. While something like this might discourage roaming, it does have mercy of being the unfinished product and would easily be balanced out by other simple metrics... Though, you shouldn't be roaming if you're gonna lose substantial cs.

Not only is it not good, IT IS VERY BAD. \n      -When we look at a player and see that they are Bronze II, we (generally) consider them to be (pretty much) a scrub.  When we see that a player is, say, Gold II, the first thought is far from \"Must be bad.\" We may not see them as LCS gods, but we see them as, at worst, better than average. This brings us to the crux of the problem. I've now seen hours worth of videos and read countless articles on \"ELO hell\" and the like, and many people scoff at the idea, while others would preach its existence to no end.  The best way I have ever seen it put went something like this: **\n\nAs someone who started in lower bronze and has now climbed their way to mid gold. The tiers are much more defined than you made them out to be. Their is a huge example between bronze 1 and bronze 5 for example. The further up you the less it is blurred and the more defined it becomes. I can now see a substantial difference between someone in silver 2 compared to someone in gold 5 or even silver 1. When I was in Bronze I could potentially beat someone who was mechanically better than me because no one really understand how to end games. Now in mid Gold it is much more frequent that a run away lane will snowball the entire game and result in a stomp.\n \n**           -In reality, someone who in all aspects of their play should be in Silver II or Gold V may, through terrible placements or bad luck streaks, end up in Bronze.  AT THAT POINT they are NOT good enough to SINGLE HANDEDLY carry their team every game. Simple as that. What that means is that there are many players, who by all intents and purposes ARE silver or gold, that have to be branded as Bronze. Even if they can climb out, they cannot expect to win game after game after game. Those who are good enough to climb out have to play literally upwards of 50-100 games just to get close. That is SIMPLY NOT OKAY.**\n \nHonestly I think you are blurring the lines too much. I belong in Gold I have been there for the last 2 seasons. If as you claim I got unlucky in my placements and was in Bronze I literally would have no problem getting out. None. Compared to where I am now the vast majority of Bronze players are not at my skill level. Hell even when I was low to mid silver I could have carried out of Bronze. I literally can win basically every game I play with people at substantial lower skill level than me. Are some unwinnable? yes. However the vast majority of games would end up in a victory for my team.\n\n \n**It is because the League of Legends ranking system ranks individual players based Absolutely, completely, and entirely on whether their team wins or loses.\nHow incredibly well you perform in a game is absolutely irrelevant if you lose that game. You may as well have put ZERO effort into that game, because both you and the AP Riven support on your team both lost the exact same amount of points. Had you gone into the game, and from the first moment beelined into baron while watching t.v. with your friends, you would have had the EXACT same outcome. This works both ways too. And that REALLY IS A BIG PROBLEM.**\n\nRanking on whether you win or lose is the only good way to rank it. Honestly if you are pulling off amazing scores like 21-0 and you still lose. Something you as a player did cost that game. Almost every time you play game, as long as you do better than every one else, you will win. The reason people have a hard time carrying games is because their true skill level is with in 1-2 tiers of where their ranking is at. Meaning that on average you will play against and with people who are slightly better or slightly worse than you every game. Where as if I was to play in bronze right now I would be substantially better than most of the people I play against or with.\n \n \n**-You, reading this right now, know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you really give a game your all, and it may be a video game, but it's still a significant amount of energy. For Riot to reward or penalize those two players the EXACLTY equally is, to be completely honest, Not okay by any means. It raises the question: \"Why do we even have Bronze-Platinum tiers?\" I would assert that most Diamond players probably are good enough to single-handedly carry themselves out of bronze. And the current ranking system really does (for the most part) do justice by them. It works in those cases. Perfectly. But that means that EVERYONE in the middle basically has an irrelevant rank that does not reflect their skill level. If they played 150 more games, MAYBE it would. but most working people, or people in school, simply don't have that kind of time to put into it.**\n \nAgain I feel like my Gold badge ranks me appropriately. I also think the silver and bronze badges ranked people properly. Is the system perfect? absolute not. Is it extremely flawed? no. Honestly every 1-2 or two tiers you can usually see a substantial improvement in terms of quality of play.\n\n \n** -I know full well that the kind of change that is needed would mean a complete overhaul of the current system, and I know that is something that we players cannot expect to happen overnight, or even in three months. But what I would wish for in a perfect world is for Riot to say:**\nI disagree. I think a overhaul on a system that is already placing people more or less correctly is a waste of resources.\n \n**it would truly mean so much to me, (And probably to a large majority of players if Riot were to simply Acknowledge what so many of us are saying. Most of us talking about this issue feel completely ignored, and if Riot were to just acknowledge the problems they've created with this system, then a lot of us would be at ease once more.**\nOn the other hand every one who worked hard and progressed to get to where they are at would essentially be cheated out of what they worked for.\n \n** Like so many people, I love League of Legends. It's the only game I've ever been dedicated to for such a long time, and the only real complaint I have is this one.

Tell me what *you* think.**\nI don't think you are alone I was like you at one point and felt hopeless when I was trying to struggle out of bronze. The thing that helped me out the most was a change of mentality. I changed my mentality from \"I am better than the people I am playing with i deserve a higher tier\" to \"I have a lot to learn and need to improve a lot\".

For champions you have played 2 or less times, you are a combined 6-20.  If you are having fun, then don't worry about your rank and just play.  If you want to climb, then pick one or two champions for each role that you enjoy, and only play those champions.  You'll find yourself getting more familiar with how you can use those champions to influence the outcome of a game, and in turn you'll find yourself winning more.\n\nOverall, focus on getting better and improving as a player, not on what rank you are.  If you get better, you will rank up.  It is very hard, however, to get better if you are constantly switching which champion you are playing.  This is especially true if, as you mention, you don't have a ton of time to play lots of games.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"PrinceArchie","date":"2015-03-12T17:24:55.831+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're missing the point of OP's post entirely. It's not about him being unable to climb elo because he cannot improve, it's the fact that the guage thats already in place to measure a players improvement isnt in depth enough. OP feels the individuals performance should have a lot more say than it currently has in determining where they place and how they gain or lose LP. It would be great if you could gain LP even when you lost, even if it were only a little and just on the merit of your own play.","replies":[{"poster":"AmazingGoat","date":"2015-03-12T18:50:38.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a team game.  You win or lose with your team.  Somehow trying to quantify individual performance would be problematic at best, and would create perverse incentives that might cause some players to try to maximize their own individual performance once (correctly or incorrectly) they feel a game is a lost cause.\n\nMy point was that OP's premises are flawed.  These are\n\n(1) that you should care about your rank (you shouldn't - just have fun and/or play to improve); and\n\n(2) that rank isn't roughly indicative of a player's skill (it is - if OP wants to get better he should get more familiar with a set of champions).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-03-12T15:58:48.503+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two options to climb: duo Queue and 5v5.\n\nFrankly the entire idea of ranking your individual skill in a game that heavily emphasizes teamwork by forcing you to match with random players is flawed.","replies":[{"poster":"TheJuzzo","date":"2015-03-12T16:27:44.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TotalJerk,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3Bll9zBE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-03-12T15:58:48.503+0000)\n>\n> There are two options to climb: duo Queue and 5v5.\n> \n> Frankly the entire idea of ranking your individual skill in a game that heavily emphasizes teamwork by forcing you to match with random players is flawed.\n\nThis is why I think the champion masteries need to stay out of ranked.\n\nEncourages getting points for yourself above teamwork.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kairya","date":"2015-03-12T18:32:47.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you, but I also think that it's very hard to judge good and bad play.\n\nFor example: I had a game a few weeks back with a Volibear Jungle. And He wasn't a bad player per se, but whenever he ganked he took all the kills and taxed the lane. The outcome was him having over 10 kills and about 3 Assists and the rest of my team having pretty much nothing.\nHe didn't manage to carry us either, since he build no damage and just was a very big tank in the end. This means he did not die a lot, but since mid and adc had no eq to do damage with, it was a lost cause.\nSo his statistics were good, but we still lost that game and I believe that it was partially his fault. \n\nI think he missed the point of LoL entirely - Winning is a team effort. He might have been mechanically skilled (I can't judge that), but does that make him a good player?","replies":[{"poster":"Ternt","date":"2015-03-13T16:54:35.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game where nobody would take objectives. At the end of the game, we were +12k Gold on them, but we lost. Their entire team was negative, but they pushed on objectives. The fact I went 16/8 didn't mean shit because we lost, which was annoying, but there needs to be a good mixture of team/single qualifications to fit in here. Because you can't base this purely off single performance, because it IS a team based game.
