Sometime last night or this morning my account was taken from me as it says my password is wrong and the recover password email is not being sent to my email so it must have been changed. I submitted a report this morning but theres still no response at all and when i try to check on the status of my ticket it says i need to log in so im guessing im never getting it back cause i cant interact with my Ticket at all. Anyone know what else im supposed to do? or is there a riot mod that can help me now? Im in a hurry as I see an account on Ebay being sold similar to mine and im afraid it might be mine","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T03:52:22.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you've already got a ticket in, it'd be best to wait for a reply there. You mentioned not being able to see the ticket anymore though, so feel free to shoot us another if you need to. You could also use this account to send another ticket using the [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to get in touch with us again. \n\nAlso, if you're able to give me the Summoner name of your account, I can take a look myself to see what's up!","replies":[{"poster":"xKingDamianx","date":"2017-06-18T14:57:12.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks thesummoner name is Len Ciedus If you notice the match history I've only been playing with my son for a while now (This account).","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-18T20:51:59.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaa it looks like something fishy might have been going on. Rest assured that the account will be kept safe, but you will need to go through that [**account recovery form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416). They'll be asking a series of questions to make sure you're the one who created the account so do your best to answer them all!","replies":[{"poster":"xKingDamianx","date":"2017-06-18T23:03:04.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea thats the first thing i did.

Riot were you compromised somehow? My account was also \"stolen\" as its pass was changed, but somehow I was still logged into the forums so I am actually able to post on the stolen account, though I have a bad feeling if I logged out of here I would be unable to get back on lol. But I never share my files and Im almost sure my pc is itself not compromised. Did something happen to the servers recently?","replies":[]}]}
