Pretty much every online game has its own currency, and also in pretty much every online game, the more in-game currency you buy at once, the better of a deal you get. Hearthstone, Warframe, TF2, etc all follow this guideline, but not League. If you go to buy RP from riot, buying five of the $20 rp packages gets you the same amount of rp as if you bought one $100 package. This does factor in the bonus, as doing either one of these things would net you 15000 rp total. Everybody is greedy these days so its not surprising, and this may seem petty but I really don't think much of Riot so for me its very satisfying to find stuff like this about them and post about it(:","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-06-04T01:22:53.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand the frustration, but you've simply made a mathematical error;\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b269edc08de5aa6d063296b57c323e6e.png\n\n$20 pack x 5 = $100\n2800 RP x 5 = 14000 RP\n\n$100 pack\n15000 RP\n\nI believe you were looking at the number that does not include the bonus. You are purchasing the amount shown in the box underneath that. You get 1000 more RP with the $100 pack than you do with five $20 packs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-04T01:29:25.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fake news","replies":[]}]}
