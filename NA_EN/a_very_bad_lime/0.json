I randomly get spikes in ping that last for several minutes at a time.  I have Charter internet service in Tennessee.  If someone from Riot can see this, I would appreciate if it could be checked out.  I think a lot of players are experiencing these issues with Charter currently.  Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-26T22:13:10.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen a few reports related to ISP issues, and we'd like to continue looking into this.
