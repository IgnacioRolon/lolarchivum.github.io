He has life regen.  He can be invisible. He can hook. He can dash. He can stun. He has execute. That is a lot of utility in one champion.","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2018-12-02T16:37:38.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It applies to Pyke specifically because his hook, stun, and execute are all skillshots. The enemy has the opportunity to dodge it, and the Pyke player can simply miss it. His hook is even telegraphed. The enemy knows it's coming before he throws it out. A Garen who is a worse player than you can still beat you because his kit is so simple, stat-checky, and unavoidable. If you're better than a Pyke, he can't do anything to you.\n\nBard gets enhanced slowing, cleaving autos, can stun, move his team through walls, heal, and put multiple targets in stasis. Lux can root, AoE slow, shield, deal a huge burst of damage, and mark targets for even more damage. \n\nPyke's kit isn't any more loaded than anybody else's. He has less team utility than virtually any other support and less burst damage than virtually any other assassin. He's an assassin who traded the ability to 100-0 targets for the Ability to sustain against poke. \n\nPyke has a ton of counterplay. His Q can be blocked by minions and his waveclear is poor. If you have lane priority, he can't really do much. Shove him under tower and harass his carry. If his carry can't go in safely to capitalize on the plays that Pyke sets up, he won't get any value. Get a minion advantage so you are free to punish them for CS. In the mid/late game, Pyke remains super-squishy due to his inability to build health and dependency on lethality for scaling. As long as he isn't fed, he can't kill things on his own. If he engages, dodge his stuff and focus fire to remove him from the fight before your teammates get low enough to execute.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinxalot","date":"2018-12-02T17:03:08.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok...I don't play him :D\nAll I know is that he is scary to play against.\nBTW...I think Neeko support is gonna be great because her roots go through minions and are actually empowered by minions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-01T23:56:40.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Pyke's ult is a dumpster fire. Its various components (blink, gold share, reset, etc.) don't work half the time.

I'm surprised it ever got through QA.

Teemo is right on the edge on the target area. It's tough to tell whether or not he's actually inside it. Regardless, he definitely didn't die in the area. He died after the cast, which means you don't get the reset. \n\nHe had like 800 health when you cast the ult, so it's possible that he just wasn't below the threshold. I can't see your items to know how big your execute threshold should have been, but it looks like it was ~400-600 based on the damage Teemo took at the moment the ult landed, which wasn't enough to kill him. \n\nMaybe you auto'd him immediately after you landed, and that's what got you the kill?","replies":[{"poster":"yipikye","date":"2018-12-01T19:22:16.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUT IT SHOWS I DIDNT AUTO. pyke ult damage was applied, and kayn victor brought teemo to threshhold and teemo died during pyke ult.
