I typically hover around 30 fps but as the games go on i drop to 2-10 and it is impossible to play.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any note or reference to this being brought up or worked on?\n\nEDIT: also when logging in i have been getting a \"Server cannot be reached - Or Unable to contact server - trying again \"Attempt 1\"","replies":[{"poster":"BlastTyrant","date":"2016-06-01T13:04:34.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response dArtagnan - My video drivers are current and up to date, and i have adjusted the in game graphics from what i normally run \"Medium High\" to Low with no resolution - i run my PC with the bare minimum on start up as to avoid performance issue \"I am use to running lower end machines\" \n\nI will check today when i am able and let you know any changes","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-31T21:43:05.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears to be two completely separate issues.  The Login Issues you described is actually due to an issue on our end earlier this morning (about the time you made this thread) that we later resolved.  You shouldn't be consistently getting this error anymore!\n\nAs for your FPS dropping down to the single digits, this can be trickier to investigate.  Given that you usually only have 30 FPS, this might indicate your computer is on the low-end in terms of power and being able to run League.  There are some steps we can do, but the hardware itself may be the root cause.  To that end, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [FPS Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684).  It has some of the most common solutions that should raise your FPS and keep it stable.\n\nReply back and let me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[]}]}
