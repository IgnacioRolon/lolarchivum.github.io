I was then told to either restart or shutdown the client. I hit restart and when i went to log in it gave me the same message. Is this problem in relation to the login bug occurring right now?\r\nI have attached an image of the message I am receiving .\r\n\r\nSorry Riot I thought this belonged in the bug session so I have moved it to the proper discussion as recommended.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T17:39:28.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Per the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page, there were server problems last night.

Navigate to toolbar and right click the client icon and click \"close window\".\n2. When league asks you if you want to exit, click no\n3. Connection error should go away\n\nMac:\n1. go do your doc and right click league client icon and click quit\n2. When league asks you if you want to exit, click no\n3. Connection error should go away\n\nThat worked for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"GQontheEQ","date":"2016-11-23T05:42:22.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/lLR30Oj6-login-bug-fix","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSP SKYWOLF","date":"2016-11-23T05:29:17.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I tried launching the legacy client both from the new client launcher password screen and directly from the League of Legends folder. Took a few times as I was getting an HTTP error also saying I wasn't connected.
