I'm Repertoir, this is Swain, Skarner, and Sona. We fled into this place to avoid getting caught up with Nasus and Renekton, who are probably still fighting topside. \n\n{{champion:81}}  So dog boy finally found who he was looking for eh? You're lucky you didn't have to listen to him nag everyone around for help to find Renekton. \n\n{{champion:44}}  Now don't be rude, if you were looking for a long lost, outrageously deranged brother, I'm sure you'd be asking anyone you could see too.\n\n{{champion:50}}  Enough of this. Is there a way to exit this place besides the front entrance?\n\n{{champion:81}}  _Ezreal folds his arms across his chest._ So the big bad Noxian speaks. Look here, this is our place, and in here you abide by our rules. \n\n{{champion:44}}  Ezreal, what did we talk about?\n\n{{champion:81}}  _Ezreal lets out a short sigh and stamps his right foot._ While you're our **guests** here, Taric and I would appreciate it if you would abide by our rules. _Ezreal passes behind Taric and sticks his tongue out at the group._\n\n{{champion:44}}  Excuse me for a moment. Please, make yourselves comfortable, and we will discuss your options. _Taric reaches behind him and snatches Ezreal by the ear, dragging him towards another room._\n\n{{champion:81}}  Owowowowowow!!! _Ezreal is dragged into an adjacent room by Taric, and the door is shut._\n\n{{champion:72}} Humans are...strange creatures.\n\n{{champion:37}}  _Sona plays a quirky, offbeat tune, one eyebrow raised._\n\n{{champion:50}}  The muse wonders if we shouldn't just explore and find out what we can before those two imbeciles come back.\n\n{{champion:37}}  _Sona plays a single low note, frowning at Swain._\n\n{{champion:50}} The muse would call them eccentric; I call them imbeciles.\n\n{{summoner:30}} Let's at least look around here for a minute; we should find out what we can about our...hosts. The guy with the gems and the hammer seems to be in charge.\n\n{{champion:72}} There is power in the gems that human possesses. It would be unwise to underestimate him. \n\n{{champion:50}} Of course, now let's see what we can find before they return.\n\nThe room the group is in is a large circle with two passageways and two doors within it. One passageway is where the group came from; the other leads to another set of stairs which descend further into the temple. The rightmost door is where Taric dragged Ezreal by the ear, and has a black handle. The leftmost door has a yellow handle, and both doors are made out of wood. There are several chairs, a table, and a locked chest which is against the wall next to the yellow-handled door. On the table are several precious gems, vials of sand, a compass, a canteen, and a map. Moments after the group has taken in the sights, the entire temple seems to shake, and the sound of crumbling rock can be heard above them. \n\n{{summoner:30}} Either we're having an earthquake or we're about to have some company from upstairs. \n\n{{champion:72}} If either Renekton or Nasus is approaching, it is recommended we vacate the premises.\n\n{{champion:50}} For once I agree with the beast. \n\nTaric pops out of the black-handled door, his forehead glistening with sweat. Muffled sounds can be heard from within the room, and Taric has a disturbing smile on his face.\n\n{{champion:44}} Don't go anywhere just yet, we have much to discuss. Ezreal and I will be done in a few moments. _Taric shuts the door, and the muffled sounds cease._\n\nThe shaking has stopped, but now the sounds of fighting can be heard echoing down the passageway the group came from. \n\n{{summoner:30}} Sounds like Nasus and Renekton broke through the cave-in. Everyone, come over here, quickly. _Repertoir leads them to the table._ What do we know about this stuff? Especially the map.\n\n{{champion:50}} The gems are of high market value, and this...blood and fire, this is a map of the Noxian Capital. The detail is astounding...only a Noxian could've drawn this map. How did those imbeciles get this?\n\n{{champion:72}}  The gems have the same power as Taric. The sand is peculiar, it holds some strange echo of power. \n\n{{summoner:30}} A map of Noxus...I'd rather avoid that place if we can. No offense Swain, but it isn't exactly the friendliest place around. We still don't have a lead on where our companions are, and we're caught between a grudge match and whatever the heck is going on with Taric and Ezreal. \n\n{{champion:44}} Wonder no longer, for your hosts have returned! _Taric has emerged from the room now wearing his Armor of the Fifth Age, and Ezreal is now in his Debonair outfit. Ezreal also has a peculiar look in his eyes, and seems to be out of breath._ Now then, please have a seat. You wish to leave without having to engage the quarreling brothers, yes?\nhttp://36.media.tumblr.com/8af58c2712ec6e830dbd07a74a1f9898/tumblr_na3tvmtuep1smuam9o1_500.jpg\n\nThe rest of the group looks to Repertoir, who nods, and they all take seats.\n\n{{summoner:30}} Yes, we need to get moving. \n\n{{champion:44}} We can help you get out of this temple. We can even obtain safe passage out of Shurima for you. However, we require something in return, a favor, if you will. Ezreal, would you be so kind?\n\n{{champion:81}} There is a cavern beneath this temple that houses an incredibly rare jewel, something that can only be found in Shurima. We know where it is, but we can't get to it. It's guarded by a pack of Xer'Sai, and worse, there are traps along the way. \n\n{{champion:44}} The jewel is called Shurima's Sun, and if you can bring it to us, we will assist you in getting wherever you need to go. \n\nWell GD, wat do?\n\nVoting is working differently this time, [here's how.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/OaFHsTEj-gd-interactive-story-ii?show=flat&comment=0046)\n\n**Choices So Far** ((This will be updated))\nTake the quest +1 \nEngage in combat, steal everything +1","replies":[]}
