So you nerfed her passive add extra counter play to her &quot;E&quot; and made knockups work when she ults in so that change wasn&#039;t very good and the extra health is nice but the passive hurts her already weak early game even more.\r\n\r\nDid {{champion:82}}  teach you a lesson.

You changed fevor so much it is worthless to AS champions. You nerfed every AS item because of fevor and only buffed 2 very slightly.

And the entire resolve tree, which is wanderful for shyvana, has no single key mastery that she would want to use in jungle. (Maybe if grasp worked on monsters?)\n\n2. She is an attack speed juggernaut that wants CDR. This creates some problems, especially because she has to build squishy first (a good AS item), and then go tanky-ish or full-on tank. And AS item, coupled with titanic hydra (or trinity) and her natural resistances, was usually a good compromise between defense and offense.
