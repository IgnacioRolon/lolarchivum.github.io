Even when I play poorly. He was very out of line.  And he would have gotten a chat restriction.

Therefore, you've had punishments before, and have probably climbed through the punishment tiers such that your next punishment was going to be a permanent ban. In light of that, the question to ask is \"is this behavior worthy of a punishment\", not specifically a permaban. \n\nThe answer to that is definitely yes. You're constantly berating and harassing teammates, threatening reports, calling for reports, and being all-around negative. \n\nSome highlights:\n\nBlackStarSoul: you are as useless\nBlackStarSoul: ziggs your bad be quite\nBlackStarSoul: you dont understand roaming or rotations\n\nBlackStarSoul: muted reported\nBlackStarSoul: enjoy your ban\nBlackStarSoul: lol rubbish feeder mid and bot\n\nBlackStarSoul: still havent seen you do a single thing trist\nBlackStarSoul: go back to bronze plz\nBlackStarSoul: yep sit under tower and watch me and panth die\nBlackStarSoul: the only 2 on the team actually doing anything\nBlackStarSoul: trust shut up\nBlackStarSoul: trist\nBlackStarSoul: you are bad dont tell anone what to do\n\nBlackStarSoul: plz report our bot lane toxic\n\nBlackStarSoul: plz report annie\nBlackStarSoul: plz report annie troll\n\nBlackStarSoul: gj annie feed more\nBlackStarSoul: 11 deatrhs from this duo\nBlackStarSoul: troll as fuck\nBlackStarSoul: no 11 deaths is what im pissed about\nBlackStarSoul: plz report jungler and supp\nBlackStarSoul: lol look at you dude\nBlackStarSoul: sitting there running your mouth and intentionally feeding you and your duo have almost all of ours deaths on purpose\nBlackStarSoul: cause you and your jungler are intentionally throwing the game\nBlackStarSoul: 16 deaths between the 2 of them\n\nBlackStarSoul: 16 deaths between the 2 of them\nBlackStarSoul: they are intent feeding\nBlackStarSoul: lol just end\nBlackStarSoul: so i can report the duo trolls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-05-03T20:46:40.772+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackStarSoul,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=R6jhjQMg,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-03T18:51:26.251+0000)\n>\n> BlackStarSoul: enjoy your ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2016-05-04T11:20:15.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If from zero, I give this 14 day ban.
