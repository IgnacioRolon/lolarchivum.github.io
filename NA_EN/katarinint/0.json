Images on Piltover&#x27;s page look like they could be on solid ground, but NONE of Piltover should actually work that way, right?\n\nNo a fair bit of Piltover would be on solid, flatter, ground.\n\nIt is very confusing, I agree.\n\nHere's my working theory: \n\nThe isthmus where Piltover and Zaun are, is unusual in that sea level is different on either side of it.  This is unusual, but not unheard of, even on Earth.  The height difference is fairly pronounced, however.  So when it was just Zaun, the settlement would have been built on the easiest, most convenient, part of the land to build on - coasts, riverbanks, the narrowest parts, and crossroads.  The higher altitude, more difficult/less convenient parts to build on, might have had some proto-Piltover districts, but mostly they wouldn't have been especially desirable.  When the OG Progress Day went down, several of the areas that were high density collapsed/sunk into sink-hole like chasms - effectively taking a lot of Zaun down there.  The previously undesirable areas of high, but flat, land, suddenly became highly desirable real estate, and new developments for the wealthy cropped up.  These areas are probably Piltover now.\n\nIf anyone remembers the plot to Superman: The Movie, it's like the San Andreas fault snapped off and now there's newly desirable coastline where there wasn't before.  The analogy is a little off, but you get the idea, maybe?","replies":[{"poster":"C me","date":"2018-09-23T09:36:50.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We would love if you guys at the map team would give us more pictures of how it all works but that theory is very interesting!","replies":[]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2018-09-22T23:25:32.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always question buying seafront property in Piltover?

I know that Zaun is in a chasm under Piltover, there are parts of upper Zaun that poke out into lower Piltover and there is also a canal that is parallel (perpendicular??) to Zaun. But when I try to put these together in my head my brain just farts. It doesn't have to be a Google Earth style 3D representation of the dual city-states you can have an high rez isometric map that can adequately show depth, because you're right top down wouldn't do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2018-09-22T00:45:04.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of seeing it but at the same time I don't think you need to go super in depth and potentially write yourself into a corner for future zaun/piltover stuff. but I would to get a better idea of where zaun is in piltover, and how the city is kinda laid out.\n\nYes I was talking about the cutaway, and I realize the top is open. But the cutaway makes it look like a tower within a pit, where I  guess I more imagined a canyon with the district laid out both in the middle and on the sides of the canyon. Obviously what I imagine isn't super important, but I was surprised at how small zaun looks when presented as this cutaway. \n\nAlso, I look at this big overhead image of piltover and I want to know where zaun is. I imagined it being like, almost a second, fragmented canyon adjacent to the one that's been turned into a channel, since both were created by the same explosion. It would have to be pretty close to the lock gates I'd think. \n\nI think maybe the best thing to do would be to take this POV https://imgur.com/8470ulG, flip it around, and just kind of give a very basic overview of the city's layout. Like, the Channels and the Sungate, where Zaun is, etc. Some things that would be cool to learn about Piltover- where's the most prestigious district where the richest families live? Where's the navy and how powerful are they? How does their police/sheriff system function (sounds almost bounty-hunterish and not very formal with the uniforms etc so far), where do more middle class types like ezreal live etc etc \n\nBTW I'd love to see this same sort of thing for the Sun Disc (especially if it repopulates), Bilgewater, and other major cities. They're all pretty interesting. \n\nThere's also a question of how much do you want it to be a really realistic look at the cities, like do you build them out as though they're real life cities or do you build them more like heres the different sections like a video game version of that city (ie just looking at stormwind and orgrimmar in WoW and how they're split into different distinct areas), etc. All this would be a lot of work for a very niche set of fans like me though lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YDy2ZkRq02","date":"2018-09-21T16:25:52.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that this image already is in the map, but the map isn't working to me so I can't say for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-09-21T17:37:51.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atgo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=8yWnAs10,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-09-21T16:25:52.424+0000)\n>\n> I think that this image already is in the map, but the map isn&#x27;t working to me so I can&#x27;t say for sure.\n\nWait wait wait.

The Targonians(Aspects that are part of Targon empire) built a space empire in the physical realm though multiple hosts in various planets. Mount Targon is a mountain created by their magic and is used as a test(most of the times) for worthy hosts, it's peak is connetced to the celestial realm and when someone reachs the peak and is considered worthy(a bunch of tests happens during the climb to judge the worthness of someone) the Aspects merge with such person, turning this in a Avatar that will make the will of the Aspect in the planet, the control of the Aspect over the host can vary, while some take complete control of the host(like Pantheon) others give basically complete control to the host(like the Aspect of the Sun, to which the host is Leona or the Protector, to which the host is Taric) and others influence the actions of the host in some way, but give most control to them(like the Aspect of Twilight, to which the host is Zoe or the Aspect of the Moon to which the host is Diana.\nIf you still have a question about Targon you can ask and I will try to answer you.\n\nAbouy Hectech, I believe that this quote answers your question:\n> The process of crafting hextech is a closely guarded secret, and no two artificers work to the same methodology. As such, each item of hextech is a unique artifact of rare beauty, a bespoke creation that will likely have taken years to craft.\n\nMeanwhile, Noxus started to use Chemtech recently :\n> In recent years, Noxus has begun to experiment with crude black powder weapons and chem-tech from Zaun, though the results are mixed—often as destructive to friend as they are to the enemy.\n\nThough, not all Zaunites would agree to sell Chemtech weapons to noxians, even if most of the greedy ones would.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zapzya","date":"2018-09-21T14:01:56.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In regards to the third question, hextech is rare and not in high enough supply to make much of a difference in regards to a large scale army. Perhaps a sizeable amount could be used to make a big siege weapon of sorts, but then Noxus still needs to acquire it. Piltover would probably not let that happen, as then they would also be under threat from Noxus. They also probably enjoy their hextech monopoly.","replies":[]}]}
