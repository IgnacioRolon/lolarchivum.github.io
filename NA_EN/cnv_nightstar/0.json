WHAT!!?!? This is by far the hardest quest line so far and ive only got 1 token! A free champion and random at that. What type of reward is that? No border. No Icon. No skin shards. No emote. Hardest quest line with the worst rewards. Last quest line i got the cool new garen skin (the one where his E is all green and stuff) and that was for playing without even caring about the quest. The rewards are most def. not worth the work it takes. Mainly since you also need a 5 man pre made for one of the quests which is very hard to find unless youre surrounded by friends. Dissapointing rewards. Best game mode so far besides one for all, urf, ARURF. better than dominions, ascension, assasin mode. Honestly just sad that the rewards are utter dog poop. {{champion:29}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-09-09T05:19:14.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will simply not bother doing them, i could grind 6300 IP in the time wasted getting premades together to do these ludicrous challenges.","replies":[{"poster":"CNV Nightstar","date":"2017-09-09T23:42:24.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ these quests are insanely hard yet no good rewards :c","replies":[]}]}]}
