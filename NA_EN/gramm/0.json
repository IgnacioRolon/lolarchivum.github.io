If only a viewer could move the screen around themselves, they could collect potentially useful metrics on - for instance - proportion of skillshots hit and dodged during lane phase. On top of that, being able to get at specific health values and smite timers would help a lot with all of the ballparking surrounding jungle metrics right now. Is there some way to get at these replays, whether through the use of a third-party program or otherwise, or do they not yet exist?","replies":[{"poster":"Takeda Khan","date":"2017-01-08T19:56:35.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Gramm\n\nUnfortunately, there is no spectate option to watch LCS games\n\nThe only thing you can do is watch recorded games from lol esports YouTube channel\n\nHope this explains it :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-08T22:26:06.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware, replays (in the file sense) aren't available outside of the VODS you'll find on the [**LoL eSports site**](http://www.lolesports.com/).\n\nIf you'd like to suggest some way for this to happen in the future, especially now that the new client has a replay feature built-in, I recommend drafting a post for the [**Miscellaneous Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous).
