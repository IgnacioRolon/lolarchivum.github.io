His VO is full of beauty.","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":21,"down_votes":7,"body":"I've been looking to hear, following Reav3 comment yesterday to judge his full VO, for the whole VO of Aatrox. The voice is not bad, I like it, and it gives him lots of character, but it came to my attention how good and well delivered some of these lines are:\r\n\r\n_\"I touched the stars... And saw the glorious light of a thousand suns... Now, blinded by this elegence, how could my purpose be anything... but dark...\"_\r\n\r\n_\"Where I was excellence, I am deformed... Recast poorly with these crude materials. But this abomination of flesh well serves my murderous intent.\"_\r\n\r\n_\"Once in noble battle, I screamed against the silence. I stood as light against the darkness. Now I serve a new master, oblivion...\"_\r\n\r\nAnd my favorite, a Shakespeare quote, link to audio included:\r\n[_\"No beast so fierce, but knows some touch of pity... But I know none... and therefore am no beast.\"_](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/36/Aatrox_425.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20180612213532)\r\n\r\nAll of these give me the vibes of Lord Darkness from Legend, which had excellent quotes and performance. My biggest question is why the hell did the multimedia and marketing teams think it was better to NOT have these elements present when presenting him, staining him as an edgelord when he's not as much.\r\n\r\nI just don't get it, I'm fairly sure if marketing had been handled a bit better and he had just 5 to 6 lines more like these, we'd be completely fine.","replies":[{"poster":"VICHEL CHAOS","date":"2018-06-14T13:33:13.273+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":7,"body":"The problem is that Aatrox's character was cold and calculated. He didn't shout unnecesarily and most importantly he never lost his temper. Now he seems like an idiot hit his car from behind and is pissed off about it.\n\nIt is not that the VO is bad per se, but rather that it heavily conflicts the character we grew to love.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-06-14T13:52:55.505+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, but you grew to love pretty much an incomplete, undeveloped character. When Aatrox launched 2013, he was a Darkin. But Darkin weren't defined, they weren't developed, and they remained undefined and undeveloped for at least another 4 years. The only thing we had was that there were 5 left. Aatrox had an intentionally vague story that was told from an outside perspective that actually offered us extremely little information as to who or what he was. We just knew he popped up in wars, made people have uncontrollable bloodlust, then disappeared. Because of his vagueness and lack of characterization, he was basically a generic godlike being, so naturally, his voice over was that of a generic godlike being.\n\nThen last year (after 4 long years of nothing) when they released Kayn, and actually confirmed hardcore that Aatrox was the weapon and not the body, and then updated Varus' lore, we actually got our first development of what Darkin were and we got actual information on how they fit into the narrative as a whole. This paved the path for the Aatrox rework, because he was undeveloped and incomplete, a vague blank slate in terms of lore. His phoned-in voice over and lore was scrapped, and replaced with a narrative and voice over that fits in with the new Darkin narrative they have been building. It would make no sense to keep him cold and calculated in the current lore. He's an alien being, trapped for centuries in a weapon after being shamelessly defeated by humans. There's no way any powerful being would be calm and collected after that. They'd be pissed, angry, and on a war path to destroying the world that basically committed genocide on his people and left him imprisoned. Swain is the calm and collected general who leads his armies to war. He's a tactician, and he's got a grander plan for the world. Aatrox is one of 5 beings left after the humans eradicated everyone else of his species and trapped him in this world. He's got nothing to live for except destroying the world that has trapped him. Anger and vengeance are all he has left, and the calm and collected personality is not something that works with him.","replies":[{"poster":"VICHEL CHAOS","date":"2018-06-14T14:42:20.907+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"About him being calmed and collected after being trapped, it can make sense if treated right. Aatrox, as the most powerful, leader, whatever of the darkin, could take on the role of the one who knows what he wants and keeps a calm head. Varus would be the vengeful one, Rhaast the one who only thinks about killing for fun and Aatrox the one who knows how to provoke the apocalypse. An intelligent being trapped for so long coud probably have had enough time to come to terms with his initial rage and bloodlust. That is not to say he needn't enjoy a massacre, but he could be way above the level of blind rage that he shows now. Some people actually focus when having a clear goal. He knows that being too reckless could lead to him enduring imprisonment again, so actually controlling himself would be more desirable. Aatrox knows he has the power to corrupt people, there is nothing wrong with more than one cunning harater in a game. Aatrox should be in control. Destroying the world is nothing to be scoffed at. Mocking people is fine in small degrees, but Aatrox has never had the need to degrade other to feel superior (at least so constantly) because he ultimately knows that he is the one who may end up destroying the world. He has already waited centuries for his revenge, acting recklessly and risking it would not be the optimal course of action. \n\nI don't want him as a master tactcian, but what I definitely do not enjoy is the petty level of mockery he shows and how easily he seems to lose his temper. A lot of us enjoyed his cold demeanor and self-confindence that coes from being one of the most powerful being and being aware of the fact. If his state of mind insrtead of being along the lines of \"NOW I'M FREE I HATE EVERYTHING THAT GUY LOOKS RIDICULOUS HEHE KILL KILL KILL!\" was more somthing along the lines of \"Now my time has come. I will not repeat mistakes of the past and with the help of my fellow darkin will bring the end to this world that was a catalyst for our suffering, killing millions in the process\" then they could bring him up to par with his lore and also keep his cold head and aura of superiority. \n\nEither way, it is understandable that the Aatrox playerbase including the subreddit and mains clubs is up in arms. It is not only that they effectively removed our champion, but they slapped his name on a different one altogether.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2018-06-14T12:38:03.166+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not Riots Fault. The issue is simply how SkinSpotlights works (No problem with them though, their vids are great) The issue is though that everyone looks to them to get a first eye on new content and not everyone wants to hear the 30-60min VO of some champions. So they look at the interactions. But just looking at how a character interacts with other characters doesnt tell them anything about the character, since its vs other characters.
