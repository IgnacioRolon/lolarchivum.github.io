I had 0 latency, no loss, and a perfect connection. I ran a speed test and was getting 120mbps down and 10mbs upload. I was also still connected via Teamspeak 3, Steam, and was still watching live streams on Twitch during the disconnection. I expected a loss prevented, but instead I got to lose 20LP. I added a player from the opposing team who had the same problem as I, and he also told me that it wasn't from his end. As you can see in the picture, 3 of us couldn't play the game at all, and it still counted as a loss. It was also very strange that after endlessly attempting to reconnect and authenticate, the servers came back on as soon as the game ended.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T03:28:35.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yikes.....yea this really sucks buddy. So I was able to confirm on the backend that none of your 3 that got dc'd were on the same network, but at the same time we weren't having any NA server issues around the time this game happened either.

I know if you go to the Bug Report section of the forums there are bunches of posts of people having disconnecting issues, including myself ever since patch/patch day early Wednesday morning. More than one champ select yesterday, I and a few other teammates in champ select were being disconnected. My ISP is Comcast, and another person in champ select also said they were about to call their ISP which was also Comcast. I don't know if it's certain ISP's or what it is, but this really sucks. I had a technician come out on Friday to check everything, yet they said their results were coming back fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
