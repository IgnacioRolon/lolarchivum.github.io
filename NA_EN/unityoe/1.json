The wiki is the only place to find every version of Ezreal's original lore and with a simple key-word search for \"Lyte\" via F3 function, nothing from those original writings pops up with Lyte's name. That's including for the JoJ. \n\n_And the tip refers to Ezreal's uncle Lyte. I believe it's exclusive to ARAM._\n\n- I, belive your misguided. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6sm4lx/i_have_forged_a_list_of_all_the_loading_screen/) is actually all the loading screen tips that were uploaded into the game in 2017. None mention Ezreal or Lyte, nor either being relatives and none of these tips were made exclusively for ARAM. Prove me wrong but Im fairly confident the game didnt have loading screen tips like these ones before they were implemented. \n\n\n- Also exclusive to the ARAM map is Lyte supposedly has VO lines towards Ez, referring to him directly as \"nephew\". Checking via the wiki once again, suspicious how no such VO line that is documented contains the quote \"nephew\" or anything similar that would prove they're relatives. \n\n_Also, it's entirely possible Lyte is short for Lymere, Lyte could literally just be a nick name._\n\n- Ezreal's new lore contains no hint nor wink for the audience that Lymere is/was intended to be Lyte, one and the same person. This is you pushing for just one more example to justify an unsupported suspicion at best. Not even the smallest suggestion of Lymere been to or ever going to the Freljord. \n\n_ANd furthermore, it's confirmed by a Rioter as well_\n\n- So the only thing you've offered that can be traceed back with, which might prove Lyte is Ezreal's uncle, is this single ancient comment from a dev in a since-abandoned forum site about 6 years ago. Neither have in the times preceding has their confirmation made it's way into modern lore. Excuse me for Im incredibly unconvinced.
