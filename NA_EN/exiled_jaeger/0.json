If you don't..... Well... Um. Anyways Urf should be a permenent mode because it's a mode to have fun, if you lose just go play Urf, Also it gives us an opportunity to test or explore more to a champion. I really don't see how Urf shouldn't be perma, it will just make the game better in general. When Urf left, it kind of stunk, it was back to no cooldown, and mana, I felt dreadful because Urf was gone. I also see riots point maybe why Urf ain't perma, the game isn't realy meant for such power, Urf will take away what the game is about. But either way riot could put in custom, I mean, geez, custom is custom we should have a little more control for custom games, so why not implement Urf, it will balance out if Urf is in custom mode, in custom you don't gain XP or IP, so if the player wants IP or XP their going to have to go to a norms game or rank game, so Urf in custom, I think this should be final, if you get bored go to Urf, but you won't get XP/IP and that's ok. One final reason Urf should be permanent, it will give the community more options on what they want to play, Rioters/Riot please read this post, i know a lot of people agree with me.\r\n                            \"I have a dream... that one day Urf will come back\" -League Of Legends","replies":[]}
