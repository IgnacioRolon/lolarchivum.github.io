If it somehow lets me in im not able to accept any invites (because they arent showing) and when i try to create a lobby and click confirm button it just turns gray and doesnt do anything. Tell me what to do, I already try repair tool and I tried reinstalling league and I downloaded Hextech repair tool. I also disabled Ipv6 address, deleted LOLReplay and i also ran it as adminstator and disabled firewall. This problem started 3 days ago, I think after the patch. Thats all i think. Please help me out here riot.\r\nTy{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-06-25T03:24:57.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've gone through a lot of troubleshooting already it seems! @_@ Pretty annoying issue if it's not gone yet.\n\nOne thing we've tried a few times when we see this problem is to open Task Manager and closing out all LoL related processes in the process list. After that, try logging back in and seeing if the authentication and queue-ups are smoother. It should help out, but if it doesn't let me know. I'll see if Tech has any other solutions we can try, and hopefully we can get it solved.","replies":[{"poster":"Riven Guide","date":"2017-06-25T18:05:16.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried that already and it didnt work :/","replies":[{"poster":"Son of Ornn","date":"2017-07-01T20:29:13.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaand we're back. Reh, still new to the Boards. I gotta get faster. >_<\n\nWhile it's a shame that none of these steps are working, it's also narrowing down the problem. More than likely it was caused by connection troubles on EUNE back a week ago, and sadly those are still a known issue. \nIf you're still suffering from these problems, keep up to date on the issue [**over here**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/uxE7avEp-622-connection-issues-on-eu) while it develops; we hope to get things back to normal soon!\n\nIn the meantime, go ahead and reach out to our tech team [**in a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your network logs handy so they can try a few more in depth troubleshooting steps!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dragodani","date":"2017-06-25T19:07:23.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happenig to me too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nopenguin","date":"2017-06-24T23:05:52.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact same thing is happening to me now. Now i haven't tried all that you did above, and honestly i don't think its worth the trouble, especially since there are others complaining about the same issue, meaning the issue is probably not on our end, so the fix shouldn't be as well. In addition to that, i've been experiencing other difficulties such as sound hiccups in champion select(ranked), game having no sound at all(even after relogging), chat text being black, missions not appearing...bugs all around. I guess we can just wait and see","replies":[]}]}
