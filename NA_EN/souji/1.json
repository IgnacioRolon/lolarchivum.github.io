I've completely reinstalled league and tried running repair and it happens on more than one computer. I just want to be able to view peoples club names in game but even if it does show up at the start it disappears for the rest of the game. Can a Rioter please look into this issue? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-15T15:35:44.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have the option for this disabled in-game.  Settings are saved server-side so they may be the same regardless of what pc you use.  While in-game, tap escape to open your options.  Head to the interface section, and toggle Team Frames.
