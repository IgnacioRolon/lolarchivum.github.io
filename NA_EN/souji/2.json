It's happening a lot recently. I'll be in champ select and it'll drop connection but will keep me in there and start without me even if I lost connection. Any help would be great thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T21:39:42.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While WiFi is convenient, it's not recommended for games that require a really stable connection like League. We actually did a really good comparison of WiFi VS Ethernet in [this article.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better) These types of drops can often be caused by conflicting WiFi network or issues with your router or wireless adapter. \n\nI strongly recommend working through the steps inside our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) in order to resolve this issue.
