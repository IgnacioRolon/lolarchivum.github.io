I still want to be able to play on my laptop for when I go out. Just wondering since I know there are pretty strict rules regarding account sharing and was worried the game might think I'm sharing my account when it's just me. Or do I have to stick with on computer? That would suck.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T18:59:51.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's totally fine to play League from separate computers!  As long as you're not being shady or trying to have someone else play on your account, then there's nothing to worry about.  I do, however, encourage you to make sure your [account security is strengthened](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account), that way you can play safely throughout different devices.","replies":[{"poster":"Souji","date":"2016-07-28T20:12:44.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the response!
