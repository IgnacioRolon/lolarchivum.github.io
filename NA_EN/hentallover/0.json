Obviously, this is nothing compared to some other people, but for me, it's a lot. 3/4 of this was spent a long time ago and I pretty much bought things I regret and never use. I was wondering if there was a possibility some kind of : Complete reset ( Basically you could only do this once and it would give you back all the RP and IP you used on runes, champions and skins). It would give them back to your account where you could use them right away as RP and IP.  That would make sure I wouldn't make the same mistake and i'd be more than happy to spend more on League. (I stopped spending now since I am kinda sad of all the stuff I bought that I don't use). I know the 'Refund' exists, but you only get 3 and I used them all in the beginning thinking you'd get more.\n\n\nEdit : Or maybe you could do it for people who ask on the forums (instead of adding an entire new thing on the launcher). i dunno. I just feel like I'd enjoy more the game if I knew the money I spent on it would be placed on champions and stuff I actually play.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-13T03:54:52.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-13T21:28:09.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can definitely understand where it would suck to have used all your refund tokens already thinking they might come back periodically. I'm not sure if this idea would ever be made into a feature, but if you do have items that need to be refunded you can always reach out to our billing team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). You can also check out our [**content refund FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864) to see what the basics for refunds are.","replies":[{"poster":"HENTAlLOVER","date":"2017-07-15T06:57:25.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at it and it said that in order to get a refund you need a token. Plus, it's 3/4 of my account that needs to be refunded so I doubt that it would be possible. I was really hoping to get a positive response regarding my suggestion but I completely understand why it would be impossible. I just know that I will not be spending anymore money on LoL. ðŸ˜•","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2017-07-13T22:13:15.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too!!!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/OzMTy","replies":[]}]}
