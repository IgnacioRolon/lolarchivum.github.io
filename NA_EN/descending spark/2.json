Every time I check to see if its fixed I get a harder punishment after being forced to restart my computer. *Cannot rejoin back* I have tried everything, even the support tips. I'm very concerned for my account. This is no hardware issue, my computer is high end. Whats also weird is that every time I black screen I can still hear music and adjust my brightness. The only way of getting out of it is by restarting the computer. All this started happening after the patch.
