Cannot Rejoin games.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a few days now I have been trying to resolve a client issue revolving around the load screen after champ select. I'm on a mac (high end mac) and the screen keeps going completely black and I can't get out of it. I can still listen to music and adjust the brightness but the only way to get out of it is by restarting my comp. Afterwards I get back on and CANNOT rejoin the game. This has been happening since the patch and after trying to do every possible step in fixing this. The problem still persists and I have no way of knowing if it was fixed or not. So everytime I try to see if the game is working again, I get HEAVY punished. I have gotten leave busters because of this and its a huge strike against my account. I now have a 20 minute wait every time I try to get into a game. This is out of control. I understand there are bugs and I'm fine with waiting for a patch if need be but the fact that I have gotten a huge strike against the account I have put time and money on, I am absolutely livid with RIOT, &amp; apparently these leave busters cannot be removed. I am just about finished with this game. All 3 of my support requests have been unanswered. What kind of support is this.

This is not something that can be removed without consistently playing without interruptions.  The best way to resolve is this is to fix whatever is causing this issue.  The black screen you are seeing on the loading screen is usually due to a network problem failing to connect to the game server.  Your best bet is to follow our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and configure your connection to get through.  Make sure to select Mac for instructions specific to your OS.\n\nI do see that you have a few tickets open, which can cause some confusion and delay in responding to you.  One ticket is just fine, just make sure not to reply to it until you receive a response, otherwise it can bump you back to the bottom.  It's likely that the response you receive will include the suggestions I provided above.  That should get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"Descending Spark","date":"2016-08-27T17:56:41.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the reply but I do not think this is a connection issue, this has been happening ever since the patch. I am also in the same room as someone who can play the game perfectly on the same connection. I have tried reinstalling the client multiple times.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T18:01:10.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms like the black screen are very common for connection problems, showing that your network has fallen into a dormant state after champion select and cannot download assets.  From my experience, this has been the case and even though someone else might be able to connect to the network doesn't mean there aren't settings or a configuration blocking you from establishing that connection specifically to the game server.  \n\nEven if it was not a connection issue, these steps can help rule out possibilities too.  I know it's a lot of work, but there's no magic wand to get around that I'm afraid.  The choice to follow those troubleshoot steps are entirely up to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Descending Spark","date":"2016-08-27T18:02:41.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, hopefully I can fix this.
