Basically, whenever I would be disconnected from a game (be it, due to my internet crashing, my laptop just simply dropping the connection, etc), League would pop up that \"Reconnecting...\" window. However, even after my laptop regains net connection (proven by web browser and other net-using programs usage), that \"Reconnecting...\" window just stays there and never ACTUALLY reconnects me. Another thing to note is that, when this happens, my frames stay at a stable 30 and the ping immediately jumps (or drops, if it was higher) to 500ms.\r\n\r\nThis has become a real pain, because the only way I've managed to actually reconnect to these games is by leaving the game and reconnecting from the client window. Sometimes even worse, by closing the entire client and restarting it. This is a problem because, with the new client (as well as my 'not-so-optimized' laptop), logging into the client JUST to hit \"reconnect\" takes a considerable amount of time. Enough time for my team to either (A) report me for dc'ing because the game has already ended, or (B) start losing a now 4v5 game that could have gone either way, had I still been there.\r\n\r\nI just want to know why the game never actually reconnects me when it tells me that it is?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T16:39:07.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like your laptop may be signalling that it's regained some connection, but not nearly strong enough to get you back in game.
