Whereas, Lulu had her kit nerfed for the sake of toning down her solo lane presence so that she&#039;d be favored more as a Support (her primary role, to begin with) rather than a solo lane bully.\n\nTaliyah, however, seems to be doing a good, if not amazing, job at being played in the Support role. As far as I was aware, Morgana wasn't even THAT much of a lane bully and the most frustrating part of her entire &quot;Support kit&quot; was her **year-long snare**. [Not counting her ult, of course.]\n\nLulu, I have no arguments for. (Sorry, I don&#039;t play her so I wouldn&#039;t know what to say about her without sounding like an uneducated bias a-hole.)\n\nBut Taliyah has good (if not annoying af) poke with her short cooldown Q, a hard engage and/or disengage with her W, and basically a &quot;you can&#039;t step here unless you want to die&quot; zone with her E. Not to mention, her passive combined with her ult make it easy for her to go to, like top lane, assist there and then snap back to bot lane so fast that it&#039;s almost like she never left.\n\nTL;DR: Taliyah Support is way more frustrating to deal with than Morgana Support was pre-nerfs and she is still a crazy solo lane bully, as well. So I&#039;m seriously curious as to whether or not she&#039;ll get any nerfs to her kit? Like a nerf to her roaming potential and stuff like that. That&#039;s honestly where most of my concern lies.\n\n**Extra Comment:** This isn&#039;t a flame or rage post. Just a simple, passive curiosity concern. Any comments, whether for or against possible Taliyah nerfs, are welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"I hate my ADC","date":"2016-08-22T10:45:41.932+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah is a terrible choice for support.\nI don't know why you'd think otherwise.\nShe has super high scaling. If you use her in the support role you are effectively starving yourself out of gold making you utterly useless. Her ult also requires a setup that you cannot really get as a support. You need to be with your ADC most of the time so you can't easily get an angle at which your ult will provide much. Roaming, even for less than a minute, can mean your ADC death or pressure on him/her that will be very unhealthy for your lane. It also starves you of much-needed XP and you are already XP starved from a duo lane to boot.\n\nSo no. Taliyah is a poor choice for support bar a few very specific team compositions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Advisor","date":"2016-08-22T11:21:40.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess I just ran into the coordinated duo-bot lane, then. = \\ Oh well.

Especially considering she cannot use her Q to its full potential down there because enemies can simply hide behind minions and Taliyah will steal CS from her ADC if she tries to poke. Which forces her to stay relatively close to walls in order to shoot behind those minions, giving less room for Worked Grounds and less poke overall.\nSeismic Shove take too long to use to be dangerous, put her at risk of using it and a good bot lane will retaliate if caught as once Taliyah used her Seismic Shove, she's pretty much out of tools to get away.\nHer ultimate also has nearly no impact for the majority of bot lanes situations. It takes too long to cast. Her ultimate is designed for surprising an enemy lane and Taliyah cannot roam freely if she is in the support role. She's kind of like {{champion:4}} or {{champion:136}} in the sense that her kit focus on map control rather than lane dominance.\nAnd for bot lane, if you go for a caster support, you need to focus on lane dominance.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Advisor","date":"2016-08-23T09:14:55.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All noted.
