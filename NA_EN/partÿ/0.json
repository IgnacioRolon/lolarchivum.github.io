My dad copied all the data from the old drive to the new one. Ever since then, every single time I attempt to join a game -- whether bot or pvp -- It crashes after champion selection. I've done some research and people are not really helping because it is all stuff from 2013. I cant see my other monitor, if I have a YouTube video running it crashes that and I have to restart my computer. I cant alt tab and I cant get to task manager because the entire two monitors are both black. I've been running it as admin every single time.  Any ideas?\n--Fixed-- leaving up for others","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-23T21:53:05.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some players have had this issue, and it turns out that third party programs that interact with league are the culprit.  If you have any running like play.tv or overwolf, remove them.  Hopefully, that will get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"Partÿ","date":"2016-08-24T11:40:22.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had it installed and when i read it i checked and It was no longer installed. But so far I've tried playing two bot matches and so far both worked. No clue why but it works now thanks lol","replies":[]}]}]}
