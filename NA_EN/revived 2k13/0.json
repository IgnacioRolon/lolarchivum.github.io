Lets break them down.\n\n1/ the \"kys\". We have a rare case here where contexts matters. \"Repeating\" is naive but can be appealed. Theres a difference between \"kys too\" and \"why did you tell me kys? that horrible\". ----> Contact Player Support and be patient and detailed.\n\n2/ A Rioter? I have no idea what you are talking about. There is no \"riot typhon\" in your match history and the daddy story is a troll. You got trolled by someone trying to scare you, he knew you had naively typed ZT words and that he only needed to report you at the end of the game. If you contact Player Support, dont forget to mention this story because impersonating or lying about ties with Riot Games is a serious offense:\nhttps://www.riotgames.com/en/terms-of-service  7.1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Póppy Chulo","date":"2020-02-28T07:59:13.153+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"rujitra is **so**  against ****_everything_**** i find it_ kinda **funny**_. &lt;-- See how annoying it is to read that alone? He knew saying kys is against the rules but im **SURE** he didnt expect simply typing it without intent would result in a ban for him. Have at least some consideration and don't go wishing his account to stay banned for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bijeesny","date":"2020-02-28T09:08:31.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, you got banned because you were repeating a ZT phrase. (kys)\nIt doesnt matter if it wasnt directed at any1, just saying it can get you banned.\n\nIn the future dont repeat those words, and if any1 tells you that, just report them without saying anything to them back (and mute if they bother you)","replies":[]},{"poster":"VelvetCrotch","date":"2020-02-28T16:22:34.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Jesus guys most of really aren’t not helping at all. The OP overreacted a bit for sure but nothing more. And repeating something by not insulting the other person should not have a penalty at all. \n\nAnd many ppl said these three letters sometime at least once during there gaming years. And one time should really not be a big deal. Stop being snowflakes. And Riot support should really read the hole sentences and course of the conversation before judging by single words.","replies":[]},{"poster":"in a hood near u","date":"2020-02-28T15:52:07.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's an extremely stupid ban.

As you know by now, it's an automated system that detects words that are considered punishable, and not actual human beings.\nThe link I sent to you will first be directed at Blitzcrank Bot, who is indeed a bot, and click on the link he gives you and then you will be redirected to a human being who will manually take a look at what happened and hopefully uplift the ban for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2020-02-28T18:42:31.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why ban an account for verbal language when mutes exist. {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}  The fact chat logs only ever show the posts u made and not what other write is just a form of incrimination.","replies":[]}]}
