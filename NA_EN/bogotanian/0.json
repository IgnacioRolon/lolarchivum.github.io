{"poster":"Bogotanian","date":"2018-11-05T19:27:29.249+0000","title":"Is it possible to unban my account? It just happened today","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have been playing league since season 2 and I&#039;ve been ranking up the last couple of weeks. My account literally just got permabanned. I was stunned. I used some language at our top laner (like I said what the f** are you doing?) because he started trolling us. Our top laner said &quot; I&#039;m running it down&quot; and started just running into the other team, griefing and inting. And I get banned for being mad at him for trolling? I&#039;m sorry, but this is unacceptable. We were winning the game, he decides to grief, and I get banned for being mad at him. I can show you guys the logs if you want. In the logs I also say alot &quot;Victor what are you doing? Move from base. You&#039;re sitting there&quot; and stuff like that. He also went afk. \n\nWhat I am saying is: Is there any way to unban this? It wasn&#039;t a 2 week it was a permaban, that honestly I did not deserve.  I had so much stuff on this account, it&#039;s been my main. To be permabanned in such a way is not right, while that top laner gets off scott free. This is not right, it just can't be. They punished the wrong person. Punishing a player for getting mad while letting actual griefers/trolls/afkers get off free is not fair. I was mad at the troll and I kept saying he's reported you guys see what he's doing?\n\nAnyways, if anyone could give me some information or tell me a good moderator or admin that I could privately message because I can't just let this go. \n\nHere are the logs: and note: I did cuss a few times, that is true said the f word and a$$ but look at the context. Victor was clearly trolling (he ran into their group of 5 repeatedly, he said \"I'm running it mid\" and then the part with nautilus. He said I'm done and left the game. that's why I was mad he was sitting at base) and notice how much I say they are reported. I was carrying, taking the game seriously, and griefers completely ruined the experience for me. I love league of legends it's my favorite game I play it every day and I can't stand that my main account is banned. There has to be a way :( \n\nAlso, the early comments... sometimes i like complimenting people on their skins 0_0 i know it looks kind of awkward but it's not relevant, anyways you'll see what happens later on\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nBogotanian: hi baby hru :)\nBogotanian: sivir is bae k\nBogotanian: oh no </3 gurl\nIn-Game\nBogotanian: ur cute yinxy <3\nBogotanian: :)\nBogotanian: sr\nBogotanian: double stun nj\nBogotanian: sorry\nBogotanian: no smite but k lol\nBogotanian: <3\nBogotanian: lkee bot\nBogotanian: nt sexi\nBogotanian: daum gurl u cute\nBogotanian: ooch\nBogotanian: take top hurry top hop! top hop!\nBogotanian: top hop! top hop! to phop!\nBogotanian: ?\nBogotanian: we outscaling ftw gurl\nBogotanian: <3 bb <3\nBogotanian: jax op gurlfriend\nBogotanian: we got thsi chill lol\nBogotanian: wtf ud oign vic!!!\nBogotanian: wtf\nBogotanian: y are you throwing like that?\nBogotanian: dude\nBogotanian: i didnt even mean to fuck take blue\nBogotanian: calm down\nBogotanian: i stood there\nBogotanian: wtf\nBogotanian: u are reported\nBogotanian: for fucking inting\nBogotanian: report victor for running and inting.\nBogotanian: victor reporte for griefing. hes running to feedc u\nBogotanian: i diddnt fucking mean to\nBogotanian: my guy was standing close by\nBogotanian: quit crying\nBogotanian: but victor\nBogotanian: legitimately\nBogotanian: ran into them\nBogotanian: sayimg \"im feeding\"\nBogotanian: that is reportable\nBogotanian: vote no\nBogotanian: you're not getting that surrrender lol\nBogotanian: kk let's just play\nBogotanian: deep breath\nBogotanian: kk\nBogotanian: ???\nBogotanian: SO SALTY this team\nBogotanian: u see this troll victor?\nBogotanian: report the crap out of him\nBogotanian: he runs into you when weping him back\nBogotanian: reported for greifing and hes been toxic the whole game\nBogotanian: nautuilus\nBogotanian: move\nBogotanian: your\nBogotanian: ass\nBogotanian: now\nBogotanian: nautilus reported afk now\nBogotanian: victor STOP\nBogotanian: gj vi\nBogotanian: bro vic\nBogotanian: lets grp up stop running inpls\nBogotanian: we can beat hthem ez\nBogotanian: oh my god\nBogotanian: you troll\nBogotanian: im muting vic lol\nBogotanian: vic ruined our game sigh\nBogotanian: noe u dont deserve farm now lol\nBogotanian: come make me lol\nBogotanian: stay ahri\nBogotanian: witjh me and jinx\nBogotanian: report naut he afkd\nBogotanian: report vic for int grieifing ty get him banned\nPost-Game\nBogotanian: naut reported\nBogotanian: vic reported\nBogotanian: nautilus reported\n","replies":[{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2018-11-05T20:39:27.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you had any prior punishments?\n\nand yes, the unedited logs would be very helpful","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-11-05T20:42:27.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CharDeeMcDenniz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4n2LtQx1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-05T20:39:27.794+0000)\n>\n> have you had any prior punishments?\n> \n> and yes, the unedited logs would be very helpful\n\nThis especially.
