Many of these temples are lost to time, but some are still guarded by small groups of unwavering followers. One such temple guardian is Asaya, a Cinder Guard, carrying a cinder of the Heartfire and enchanted stone javelins to protect the Wanhuo Temple and the Heartfire within it.\n\nWanhuo temple is built deep inside a cave, where the Heartfire, an artifact that grants its wielder power over all aspects of fire, far beyond its simple destructive powers. The gentle warmth of fire can heal even the gravest of injuries, and the radiance can cleanse others of illness or curses. On the other hand, the unquenchable hunger of the very same fire can destroy anything in its all-consuming path. To protect the world from anyone releasing the full fury of fire, Cinder Guards use the power of Heartfire to protect it from the outside world.\nEvery Cinder Guard carries a cinder, an enchanted piece of stone that carries the flame of the Heartfire. The cinder shares the power of the Heartfire, but not many can use the power fully, including most Cinder Guards, who can only use one aspect of the power. Asaya could use the Heartfire's power completely, although her powers are still weak.\n\nThe leader of the Cinder Guard noticed her talent, and named her the next leader of the Cinder Guard, should he become unfit to lead the Cinder Guards. Asaya now prepares herself to become the next leader of the Cinder Guard, as the Lamplighter.\n\n(lore still WIP, but most likely no major changes will happen, just some additions)\n\n---\n\nPassive: Lamplighter\nWhen one of her basic abilities hit a lamp, all lamps _**Erupt**_ after a short delay (~200 radius), casting an empowered version of her spells in an area of effect around them. After the lamps _**Erupt**_, the lamps stay **_Alight_** for 2 seconds, leaving a persistent area of effect (~400 radius). While a lamp is alight, Asaya&#039;s other abilities cannot affect the lamps (can&#039;t be lit up by her flames, or be picked up). The effect from multiple lamps do not stack.\n\nQ: Scorching Flames\nAsaya burns an area with hot fire in front of her in a cone, dealing damage to enemies and slowing them.\nIf Scorching Flames hit a lamp, all lamps _**erupt**_, knocking back enemies while dealing damage. The lamps then stay _**alight **_ and scorches the ground, dealing persistent damage and slowing enemy caught in the area of effect.\n\nW: Rallying Flames\nAsaya conjures up emboldening wave of fire in front of her in a cone, granting a decaying movement speed.\nIf Rallying Flames hit a lamp, all lamps _**erupt**_, cleansing all slows from allies in the area of effect. The lamps then stay _**alight **_ and grants movement speed to allies that starts to decay upon leaving the area of effect or until the lamps are no longer _**alight **_ with Rallying Flames.\n\nE: Protecting Flames\nAsaya manipulates fire to surround allies in front of her in a cone, granting a small shield.\nIf Protecting Flames hit a lamp, all lamps _**erupt**_, healing allies. The lamps then stay _**alight**_ and grant a small shield every second, which decays upon leaving the area of effect or until the lamps are no longer _**alight **_ with Protecting Flames.\n\nR: Light the Path\nAsaya throws her enchanted javelin to a target location, which becomes a Lamp and becomes _**alight**_ with Light the Path, granting vision near the Lamp.\n\nPassive: Asaya starts with 1 point in Light the Path. When Asaya walks over a lamp, she picks it up, gaining a charge of Light the Path and 20% bonus movement speed for 1 second. She can have up to 2/3/4/5 lamps out at the same time. When a Lamp is too far away, it will disappear. Asaya cannot regenerate a charge when maximum amount of Lamps are already out. Asaya gains a charge of Light the Path every time she gains a rank in Light the Path.\n\nActive: Throws a javelin towards a target location, granting vision around the target area and placing a Lamp.\n\n\n-----\n\nIn game, Asaya is a enchanter/controller hybrid who can place and move Lamps to empower and extend her abilities. By carefully placing the lamps, Asaya can create multiple zones that allies can be safe around, and enemies must be careful. This allows Asaya to add her teammates even when she is dangerously low in health by staying back near a lamp and casting abilities from afar.\nHowever, because her basic spells are very weak without her Lamps. This means she cannot be very effective in a moving teamfight, where she must pick up and place lamps again. Furthermore, her spells does not affect Asaya unless she is near a lamp, making her very vulnerable if caught out of position away from her lamps or allies.\n\nBecause her lamps remain alight after Asaya casts her spells, using all her abilities at once make her utility very low. However, by placing lamps to cover a large area of the map and using the correct ability at the right timing, Asaya can control the entire battlefields.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-03-04T07:28:20.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so heres a story:\n\n\nTHE LIGHT\n\"what is this sea?\"hollared the captain.\n\"sir ahhhh its an unknown sea\" replied the crewmate\n\"then the treasure must all be fresh am i right laddys?\"\n\"yeah!\"\nlets head for the nearest island!\n(side note: i put the lamplighter as a she tell me that she isn't)\n(as the crew search for land, they found them selfs on a tropical forest, as they set camp near the waters the man were send off the find treasure)\n\"hey captain! cap!\"\n\"we found a temple!\"\n\"sweet laddys,lets go in, take the valuable and out we go, got it?\"\nyes captain!\n(inside of the temple, there was gold and ancient artifacts, but what standed out of them, was a light)\nthat light... its shiny.\n\"its a lamp captain! cant be worth much\"\n\"oh well, i want everything\"\n(as they touched the lamp, it erupted out flames, as the eruption was happening, a lady appeared.)\ngreetings, i'am the lamplighter, who gives you permission to enter my land?\n(part 1 end)","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-03-14T07:20:21.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/FErU6Hps-asaya-the-lamplighter-draft-2\nI've made some updates, with basic lore this time!

Otherwise, she's a good champion with a good kit I would enjoy playing. \n\nA zoning champion that has semi-permanent tools to use in a battle is a nice niche to do, for I'm also doing a take on it, and I think this champion fulfills it well.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-03-14T07:18:38.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/FErU6Hps-asaya-the-lamplighter-draft-2\nI've made some updates!

I see great potential in this champion suggestion and so I hope you will come up with some great ideas for her character, lore and appearance.\n\nAbout the kit: The lamp mechanic is unique and really interesting. gives the feeling it is kinda similar like Sona, but with the advantage of not having to stand next to the champions you want to buff/damage.\n\nBut I want to give a bit of constructive feedback: \nI wouldn't make every skill in her kit have a cone shape. Maybe you could mix some other mechanics in. \n\nFor example: \nQ - linear skillshot, damages the first enemy champion hit and then searches for a nearby lamp. If there is a lamp nearby it will bounce to it and then search for another enemy, bouncing to that enemy. You can shoot the skillshot directly at a lamp and it will search an enemy target automatically. So basically it bounces between lamps and enemies all the time but each enemy can just be hit a single time per cast.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-03-14T07:17:04.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/FErU6Hps-asaya-the-lamplighter-draft-2\nI've made some updates, and changed most of her abilities to not be a cone!

All conic is definitely boring.\n\nI wasn't planning on giving lamps vision, but it only sounds fitting! I'll consider it, but for now, it only gives vision when you first throw the lamp.\nI want to balance the lamp placement around being difficult to set up quickly, and being difficult to move around, but otherwise impossible to remove.
