Many of these temples are lost to time, but some are still guarded by small groups of unwavering followers. One such temple guardian is Asaya, a Cinder Guard, carrying a cinder of the Heartfire and enchanted stone javelins to protect the Wanhuo Temple and the Heartfire within it.\n\nWanhuo temple is built deep inside a cave, where the Heartfire, an artifact that grants its wielder power over all aspects of fire, far beyond its simple destructive powers. The gentle warmth of fire can heal even the gravest of injuries, and the radiance can cleanse others of illness or curses. On the other hand, the unquenchable hunger of the very same fire can destroy anything in its all-consuming path. To protect the world from anyone releasing the full fury of fire, Cinder Guards use the power of Heartfire to protect it from the outside world.\nEvery Cinder Guard carries a cinder, an enchanted piece of stone that carries the flame of the Heartfire. The cinder shares the power of the Heartfire, but not many can use the power fully, including most Cinder Guards, who can only use one aspect of the power. Asaya could use the Heartfire&#039;s power completely, although her powers are still weak.\n\nThe leader of the Cinder Guard noticed her talent, and named her the next leader of the Cinder Guard, should he become unfit to lead the Cinder Guards. To help prepare her for leadership, he helped create her enchanted javelins that empowers her abilities. Asaya now prepares herself to become the next leader of the Cinder Guard, as the Lamplighter.\n\n##Base Stats\n(approx)\nHealth: 500-1800\nHealth regen: 5.4-15\nMana: 380-1300\nMana regen: 11-18\nRange: 550\nAttack damage: 50-100\nAttack speed: 0.625 (0%~+40%)\nArmor: 20-75\nMagic Resist: 30\nMovement Speed: 330\n\n\n##Abilities\nPassive: Lamplighter\nErupt: if a lamp is hit by a basic ability, the lamp erupts, granting powerful bonus effects in a small area of effect (200 radius) around the lamp.\nAlight: a lamp that is recently affected by a basic ability becomes alight, creating an area of effect (300 radius) around the lamp for up to 3 seconds. While a lamp is alight, it cannot be picked up.\nResonate: if a lamp that is not alight is hit by a basic ability, all lamps erupt and remain alight for up to 3 seconds.\n\n\nQ: Scorching Flames\nCost: 55/60/65/70/75\nRange: 1000\nCooldown: 7/6.5/6/5.5/5\nDirect damage: 40/60/80/100/120 + 25% AP\nSlow: 20%\n\nErupt damage: 80/120/160/200/240 + 50% AP\nKnockback duration: 0.5s\n\nAlight damage (per second): 10/15/20/25/30 + 10% AP\nSlow: 20/25/30/35/40%\n\nAsaya unleashes the all-consuming fire in a line. The fire passes through all enemies, slowing the first target hit and dealing damage to all enemies hit.\nSlow skillshot (something like Zyra&rsquo;s Grasping Roots or Lux&rsquo;s Binding Light)\n\nErupt: a small area around each lamp explodes, knocking away nearby enemies and dealing damage.\n\nAlight: a larger area around each lamp burns, dealing damage and slowing enemies caught in its area of effect.\n\n\nW: Rallying Flames\nCost: 40/50/60/70/80\nRange: 700\nCooldown: 13/12/11/10/9\nDirect movement speed: 10/15/20/25/30%\nAlight movement speed: 20/30/40/50/60%\n\nAsaya throws a quick ember full of energy towards an ally champion or a lamp. Upon arrival, the ember bursts into flame, granting a decaying (over 2 seconds) bonus movement speed for all allies caught in the area of effect.\n\nErupt: allies near the lamps are cleansed from all slows.\n\nAlight: allies near lamps gain bonus movement speed that decays if they leave the area of effect.\n\n\nE: Protecting Flames\nCost: 80/85/90/95/100\nRange: 700 (40&deg;)\nCooldown: 11/10/9/8/7\n\nDirect shield: 30/45/60/75/90 +20% AP\nHeal: 40/60/80/100/120 +30% AP\nAlight shield (per half second): 30/45/60/75/90 +20% AP\nAlight shield (cap): 60/90/120/150/180 +40% AP\n\nAsaya conjures a protective flame in a cone in front of her, granting a small shield to allies.\n\nErupt: allies near the lamps are healed.\n\nAlight: allies near lamps gain a shield that regenerate while in the area of effect, but decays if they leave. The shield cannot exceed a cap (works like Bloodthirster shield, only recharging if it doesn&rsquo;t hit the cap), but can continue regenerating as the shield takes damage.\n\n\nR: Light the Path\nCost: 100\nRange: 750\nCooldown: 2/1.5/1/0.5\nRecharge time: 40/35/30/25\nMaximum charge: 2/3/4/5\n(starts with 1 point in R)\n\nPassive: When she walks over a lamp, she picks it up, gaining a charge of Light the Path and 20% bonus movement speed for 1 second. She can have up to 2/3/4/5 lamps out at the same time. When a Lamp is too far away (1250/1500/1750/2000 units), it will disappear, and does not restore a charge. When all available Lamps have been placed, Light the Path does not generate new charges passively.\n\nActive: Throws a javelin towards a target location. The thrown lamp becomes alight for 1 second, briefly granting vision of the target area.\n\n\n##Gameplay\nIn game, Asaya is an enchanter who can control a wide area by carefully placing her lamps and potentially grant buffs to the entire team without even getting close to the enemies. To maximize her potential, Asaya must set up the battleground prior to fighting, and plan what abilities to use instead of using them reactively.\n\nAsaya starts the game with 1 point in her ultimate, and this can be ranked up 3 more times at level 6, 11, and 16. By activating her ultimate, she throws her enchanted Javelin towards the target area, briefly gaining vision and placing a lamp, which interacts with her basic abilities.\nAsaya&rsquo;s Passive is Lamplighter. This is a 3 part passive, which explains how her abilities interact with her ultimate. Asaya&rsquo;s lamps can become alight when it is hit by one of her basic abilities or upon cast of her ultimate. This leaves a persistent area of effect. While the lamp is alight, it cannot make use of Erupt or Resonate. When her lamps are not alight, any of her basic abilities will cause the lamp to erupt, providing a powerful effect in a small area around the lamps. If the target lamp is not alight, all lamps will resonate, causing all of her lamps to erupt and become alight.\n\nAsaya&rsquo;s Q is Scorching Flames. Asaya casts a slow skillshot that passes through enemies and her lamp. The first enemy hit is briefly slowed. If Scorching Flames hit an unlit lamp, it will erupt, knocking back nearby enemies. It will also become alight, leaving the ground scorched, dealing damage and slowing enemies on it.\n\nAsaya&rsquo;s W is Rallying Flames. Asaya targets an ally or a lamp, and throws a quick ember that follows the target. Upon arrival, the ember will burst into flames, granting a decaying bonus movement speed to all allies hit. If Rallying Flames hits an unlit lamp, the lamp will erupt and cleanse allies from slowing effects. The lamps will also become alight, granting the same movement speed to all allies in the area of effect. This haste will decay upon leaving the area of effect.\n\nAsaya&rsquo;s E is Protecting Flames. Asaya creates a veil of flame that shields allies in a cone. Allies hit gain a weak shield. If Protecting Flames hits an unlit lamp, the lamp will erupt and heal nearby allies by a moderate amount. The lamps will also become alight, granting shields every second, up to a cap, to all allies in the area of effect. This shield is more effective against sustained damage than burst damage, because it regenerates unless it hits a cap.\n\nIt&rsquo;s important to note that her basic abilities are very weak on their own, and only her W-Rallying Flames can be used on herself without relying on her lamps. Asaya must place down her lamps carefully, and position herself around it to survive and protect her allies. In return, Asaya excels in controlling an area with setup time. If she is allowed to set up beforehand, she can defend and contest objectives easily.\n\n\n##Asaya is strong with...\n{{champion:96}} \nAsaya can protect an area well, but she is relatively immobile because moving away from her setup makes her vulnerable. Champions who can hold their ground, like Kog&rsquo;Maw, without kiting synergizes well with Asaya&rsquo;s kit. Asaya can protect Kog&rsquo;Maw from divers with her regenerating shield, and knock away assassins attempting to jump on Kog&rsquo;Maw. Asaya&rsquo;s Q can directly hit the incoming assassin to break the spell shield, and use the erupt effect to knock them away afterwards.\n\n{{champion:13}} \nAsaya&rsquo;s greatest weakness is that once her lamps are placed, she is bound to the area. In a moving teamfight, Asaya can easily become powerless. With Ryze&rsquo;s Realm Warp, Asaya&rsquo;s lamps can be moved mid-fight, allowing Asaya to chase or kite alongside her team.\n\n{{champion:203}} \nKindred can prevent death in a large area of effect for a short duration. During this time, Asaya can freely set up lamps again, which can be used to finish off low health enemies or shield allies just as the invulnerability effect ends to give her teammates an edge.\n\n\n##Asaya is weak against...\n{{champion:53}} \nAsaya can protect allies near her lamps very well, but if Blitzcrank grabs her allies under the lamp, she can&rsquo;t do much to protect them. Even worse, if she gets grabbed, with her low durability and no way to protect herself, it will easily lead to a death.\n\n{{champion:115}} \nIf Asaya&rsquo;s team forces the enemy team to respond by creating a lane pressure elsewhere, Ziggs&rsquo; ultimate can negate that pressure and continue the stalemate. Furthermore, her shield is strong against sustained damage, but Ziggs&rsquo; poke comes in rounds of burst. And if his ultimate is available, grouping together near the lamps might just set up for Ziggs&rsquo; great AoE damage.\n\n{{champion:41}} \nAsaya&rsquo;s setup can easily become a zone of danger if it&rsquo;s starts raining cannonballs. On top of that, the barrel chain combo can do a tremendous amount of burst damage in an area, meaning her shield is relatively ineffective. Furthermore, Gangplank rarely gets close to Asaya and her lamps to do damage, meaning there&rsquo;s little she can do to help her team against Gangplank.\n\n----\n\nPotential things to change/add\nSome voice lines (interaction with Bami&#039;s Cinder?)\nSlight change to ultimate: It feels like she is meant to move around a lot, both in name and because of movement speed bonus\nNumber change to Protecting Flames: number seems too low and doesn&#039;t feel rewarding to rank up\nErupt change to Rallying Flames: cleansing slow on a delayed ability seems unwieldy\nRecommended items/masteries\n\n(Also, still looking for feedback!

That would open up your ultimate for something else (possibly having short lived lamps for quick set up for the prefight).\n\nGameplay wise, is there a concern for lack of interaction from the opponents?  Are the Lamps able to be destroyed  (not that they need to)? This playstyle seems like an Enchanter version of Heimerdinger, and shows promise; be careful that it doesn't cause an area the the opponent just has to avoid or it will create a stalemate feel for a team fight.\n\nOverall,  I love the concept and wish Riot would explore Vision based champions more.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-03-14T14:46:54.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"enchanted version of heimerdinger........ league would even be more cancer","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-03-14T14:12:58.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replacing the trinket on a support sounds like you can't buy a sweeper.
