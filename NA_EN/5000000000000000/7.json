That said, the effects of Ekko's ult are strictly AoE damage, a heal, and an invulnerable, untargetable state during the dash, as opposed to a true state reset, and none of the existing effects seem like they'd shed the bear trap. You could conceivably have an Ekko ult on top of you and then get pulled as soon as he lands. Also, Ekko **is invulnerable during the ult, so in theory, only the CC would apply, if anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2017-01-21T01:38:56.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played against the one (what are the fucking odds??), apparently it doesn't deal dmg or CC's him during the ult cast.

I've used it constantly before getting snatched by a Blitz, Nautilus, or Thresh as a nasty little retaliation for them pulling me into their face.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-01-20T21:10:09.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I meant Kled interrupting Dazzle seems like a bug.
