In fact, I don&#039;t even get a chance to play against them because  they are banned at my elo.\r\nI&#039;m just curious, in terms of design, why there are resourceless champions. What&#039;s the idea behind creating a champion who doesn&#039;t have to manage resources?","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-08-25T06:43:00.970+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":3,"body":"By concept, different resources have different effects on champions.\n\nMana for example is a resource amazing at doing a shitton of things at once, sometimes in a continuous stream. Burst mages for example are the prime definition of this as they can often throw at least some spell at a solid pace for long periods of time before dropping their entire kit on the enemy's head. It also provides early game gating and late game freedom, as early game you may have to consistently worry about your mana, but by the later stages of the game you quite frankly do not care about it anymore.\n\nEnergy is a resource that, if you are careful about, acts essentially resourceless. You can not fire large amounts of your kit consecutively like a mana user can, but you can drop an entire rotation of spells on the enemy's head after pacing your abilities in a way that your fast energy regen kicks in over time. Energy lacks the ability to build out of this restriction however, so if an energy based kit is designed to max out on energy with only 2 rotations of the champ's spells, you're not going to ever get around it no matter how you build.\n\nCooldowns, finally, have two significant weaknesses depending on how the champion is built. If it's a champion like Garen who is restricted by longass cooldowns, or on the opposite end of the spectrum Katarina with weak ass spells, resourceless champs are often balanced around the fact that they perform subpar to energy and mana in very specific matchups. Katarina for example is straight up weaker than Talon in many raw damage scenarios if you consider that her ult is easily interrupted and Talon can rely on multiple auto attacks with far more power than the former.\n\nThe reason why resourceless champions exist is to put a different spin on a kit than energy or mana could allow. Yasuo's design quite frankly is impossible with mana or energy because his Qs are essentially auto attacks and as his main combat skill damn near mandatory towards his damage potential. Wind Wall was designed as a reactive skill and therefore giving mana or energy is nothing more than a damning limit to using the ability in emergency situations. And don't even get started on trying to make his E function off a resource.","replies":[{"poster":"TacoTheKitten","date":"2015-08-25T15:49:04.887+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TehNACHO","date":"2015-08-25T21:42:29.187+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shit.\n\nGotta cover myself.

However, she has high mobility and CC to punish any mistakes the enemy makes and she has a shield to mitigate some of that incoming damage as well. Once she hits level 3, she can all in you anytime she has more health than you and she will most likely get the kill and then you lose lane since she snowballs so hard. As for the harass, you can avoid a lot of it by hiding in one of the top lane bushes. You know, the old Garen trick. If they facecheck you, you kill them. \nAs for the so called missing parts of her kit, you said she has no harass, weak defense, and no sustain. \nI hope that is more of what you are looking for. Like I said above, same problem every melee top has. She doesn't have weak defense since she has a shield that scales with AD. So the more she stacks offense, the more defense she gets. A pretty sweet deal if you ask me. Finally sustain. This can be overcome with lifesteal, especially considering how much damage she puts out.\nI could go on with the other champs, but the wall of text is going to be enough already.\n\nAn example of mana vs manaless. Let's say you have a Zed mid against Oriana (a good mage example). Zed can spam his shuriken without worry, since he doesn't have to deal with running out of mana. Add to that the fact that it's range is almost 400 higher than Ori's AA range, so she can't trade with him once out of mana. So she must rely on spells to have a chance. Her cheapest one is 50 mana and her base mana is 334 with a regen of 1.2 every 5 seconds. So it takes her 208 seconds to get back 50 mana for a spell. That's a pretty damn long time. So she has to rely on the base mana which gives her 6 attacks if she only uses the cheapest spell. Do I even need to go on at this point? It's painfully obvious that Zed has a MASSIVE advantage over her. This is the same for mana vs manaless matchup. So good luck having that mana champ snowball over the manaless champ. \n\nAs you can see, I know exactly what I'm talking about.

How OP do you want the damn thing to be? She doesn't have to build AP on it like the vast majority of champs do for their shielding abilities. She gets free defense from stacking her offense. How can you not comprehend how awesome that is? And it comes with a dash as well!\n>  \n> The cost is FREE, she scales it by buying her items that she gets anyway. \n\nIt's a 100% of bonus AD ratio, specifically.\n\nFor every point of AD, you get one point of temporary HP built into a shield that lasts less than 2 seconds.\n\nAllow me to point out that there are **two** AD/MR items, **three** AD/HP items (which don't really help much with how low innate resistances are), and **a grand total of zero** AD/Armor items.\n\nAllow me to *also* mention that, of these items, you will generally only see her build the AD/MR items, because the health ones provide very little AD.\n\n**Literally all of her defense is in her AD-scaling shield, which only provides a small chunk of temporary HP.**\n> Because it works for sustain. \n\nYou seem to think that mentioning her lack of sustain is a stand-alone point *when it's almost always mentioned at the same time as her terrible innate defenses.*\n\nAny damage dealt to her sticks.\n\"But she--\"\nHas a shield, yes, and like most champions with shields, you can force them to use it early, then throw more damage when it goes down. Or you can catch them off-guard and throw your damage before they shield.\n\nYes, like old Mordekaiser, she can build sustain and _eventually_ cover this weakness, but it's still an early-game weakness, something you apparently don't believe Riven has.\n> I picked Zed and Oriana simple because it's a fairly common mid matchup is all. I can do the exact same argument with pretty much any two champions.\n\nAnd I pointed out that you could literally pit *any* assassin against Orianna, because **literally every assassin shits on Orianna, especially because she was nerfed ever since the mana changes happened.** Manaless or mana-based, doesn't matter, Orianna has a rough game when she has to face assassins.\n\nYou have not countered my point: **Being manaless is the icing on the cake; being an assassin is why Zed beats Orianna.**\n> You must be one of those people who can never admit they are wrong.\n\nNo, I'm one of those people who argues with fools, not to change their minds, but to solidify my own understanding.\n\nFrom the first reply, I didn't expect anything I said to actually affect your mindset. I've seen your opinions often enough, and nothing *anyone* says actually changes your mind. I just wanted to see if you had any arguments or proofs that could change mine.

So the vast majority of her total AD at almost any point will be bonus AD. While her shield is the only innate defense ability she has, she can itemize against her opponent just like every other champion in the game has to do. So you have to weigh the benefit of going glass cannon (where you are pretty much guaranteed a kill if your opponent makes a mistake at the risk of dying yourself) or going defensive and focusing on farming and trading (where your shield is of the most use anyway). \n\nI literally only pointed out that it was bonus AD scaling out of OCD.\n\nMaybe you didn't hear me the first time, **but Riven scales for shit if you build a defensive item instead of AD.** She falls behind very fast if she isn't building almost pure offense, worse than most Marksmen in fact. She can afford *one* item for defense, usually after she has gained enough of a lead to rely on her current offensive output to stay ahead while she builds something *that scales with nothing in her kit.*\n\nThe only time you can make that choice is when you already have a lead, put simply and in small words.\n> \"No, I'm one of those people who argues with fools, not to change their minds, but to solidify my own understanding.\"\n> \n> This right here completely proves my point. You only seek to solidify your own understanding, even if it's wrong. That is what is know as rationalization. You are completely closed-minded in this regard. \n\nAn argument is a duel, and I'm as open to suggestion as a seasoned fencer. Get past my guard and you might actually score a point. Once.\n\nTo do away with the metaphor, **you are the one who has failed to present any points that change my opinions or perspective.**\n\nYes, I realize I opened the door for ad hominem...*after* I took your arguments, stabbed them to bloody death and incinerated the remains.\n> \"From the first reply, I didn't expect anything I said to actually affect your mindset.
