This gives it a unique value profile for champs that have really high base AD (immobile fighters) while not being nearly as good for other AD scaling characters with lower base AD (marksmen and assassins). \n\nThough if it's really becoming a must have core item we may add another base AD item in the future to compete with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-08-11T20:17:41.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that context, was it intended for Sterak's Gage to not factor into bonus AD scalings at all? AD casters tend to depend almost completely on bonus AD ratios, whereas most juggernauts have or will have total AD scalings on the majority of their damaging abilities.\n\nOn that note, how do you feel about items losing certain of their components' bonuses as you purchase them? Sterak's losing a small amount of bonus AD scaling from {{item:1036}} is an example, but there's also the removal of {{item:3010}}'s per-level health/mana restoration on {{item:3800}}, and the old case of {{item:3093}} completely losing its gold generation upon being upgraded to {{item:3087}} or {{item:3142}}. What impact does that have on builds and build decisions? If you're alright with trading off stats or bonuses, would you consider adding an extra \"upgrade\" to top-tier support items (e.g. {{item:3401}} / {{item:3092}} / {{item:3069}}) that would trade off their gold generation for other bonuses and better late-game power?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-08-11T02:45:00.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be pretty unbalanced.
