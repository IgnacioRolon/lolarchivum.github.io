What if crit chance was reworked into ramping up AA damage over time/on-hit?\r\n\r\nThe general idea I had is that autoattacks can ramp up to 300% damage (probably needs tuning). But in order to reach that 300% damage, you need to AA. &quot;Crit chance&quot; (probably with a different name) would give you that much damage boost, up to that 300% cap. So {{item:3046}} with 30% crit chance, with 100 AD, will do 100 on first AA, 130 on second, 160 on third, 190 on fourth, and all the way to 400 per AA on tenth AA.\r\n(all numbers up to adjustments, ofc; 200% might be more than enough)\r\n\r\nIf this would make on-hit champions broken, maybe it can just be changed to over time in combat. But the idea is that instead of crits giving damage straight up, it should give damage over time, since that&#039;s what DPSing is all about anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other changes that can go along with this:\r\n{{item:3110}}: slows attack speed, or ramp up speed.\r\n{{item:3143}}: reduced damage from crits, but only on the crit portion (using above example, the damage would be 100, 127, 154, 181 ... 370)\r\n{{item:3508}}: not really sure what to do about this. This change focuses on DPS/AA carries, not AD casters. Mana refund could be adjusted fairly easily (probably based on how much crit damage you do), but not sure about CDR. CDR changing mid combat could be just confusing.\r\n{{item:3031}}: increase the crit cap to 400%.\r\n{{item:3046}}: MS also ramps up with crit stacks.\r\n{{item:3094}}: no major change\r\n{{item:3085}}: can ramp up crit at 50% effectiveness with other bolts, but can only crit on primary target\r\n{{item:3087}}: no major change","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2016-12-11T18:36:19.642+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:41}} would need some serious love after such a change, because he doesn't get to ramp it up...\nBut other than that, sure, that could do a lot for the game","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-12-11T18:40:53.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't thought about other classes building crit, so thank you for pointing this out.

Every auto he does against an enemy champion generates 50 (50 / 1) stacks of aim, increasing his aa damage by 25% (.5% * 50), and after 10 autos his stacks are maxed and he deals 350% damage on his aa's and blight applications.

This would mean that game would be rounded only around ADc, which means that it would be unbalanced. The one who gets stacks faster becomes god, penta kills every game. This would drastically change game. More ADcs in games, more tanks in games. Mages would be useless at this point, because, yes, they still have burst, but how do you want to go behind enemy lines not getting CCd and IKd by ADc? Yeah, I somehow like your idea, but you have to think about many things in game, how would it change meta, how would other champions perform, how items like lifesteal would work, will CCs be OP? Will they be useless? Why would anyone build crit on melees then? Would be thornmail OP? How would armor pen items work, exhaust, ignite, creeps, towers... Almost everything would have to be adjusted just to apply one change.","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2016-12-11T22:07:47.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do know that this is game-warping, but sometimes the game needs big change.  First off, very many balance changes would need to be made.  Lifesteal would be less effective early in fights because their damage starts low, so they couldn't really out-heal burst.  For the later stages lifesteal may need to be changed (it's broken already) to be less effective, such as half strength on crit damage or no scaling at all.  Also, not every adc builds crit, and some that do such as jhin and ashe may be left out of this change.  Those that do put themselves in constant danger by needing to be in auto range to keep their stacks up.  The idea of stacks falling off becomes the main point of crit builds.  Those that have fast autos would need to be in the thick of it with little to no kiting to generate stacks fast enough, so there would be a great deal of risk-reward.  \n\nAdc's that focus on straight damage would not have to survive long to dish out damage because they are not affected by the scaling.\n\nAs for composition, it would be changed but there would still be variety.  Pick comps would be more effective against crit comps, but less effective against non-crit comps.  Protect the adc comps would only be really effective when the adc has crit.  However, I don't really know what to do about trynd, taric, and kayle ults because they would allow for free stacking (maybe invulnerabilities would freeze stacks?).  Tank comps would be untouchable for the first few seconds of a fight, but they would need to have a good mix of vanguards and fighters to take out threats, because immobile tanks are just free stacks for the adc.  Squishy comps would be mostly unaffected, but would be best if none of them had crit.\n\nMelees will inherently be a problem if they are both sticky and tanky due to their high base stats, but fighter builds are kind of boring, maybe tuning them around new crit builds would help with diversity.\n\nMages would still be useful because they always have good presence in a fight, which most adc's don't.  They would shine at the beginnings of fights as the safest source of dps, and may actually counter adc's more than anyone else due to strong zoning.  \n\nThere's a lot of factors to look out for, and I'm glad you brought them up, but remember that almost all of them can be tuned.  Crit is a stat, and changing a stat across the board always warrants a lot of other changes both to meta builds and to the usefulness of certain comps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-12-11T21:08:29.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar concept, but I think how it ramps up is better implemented in your case.
