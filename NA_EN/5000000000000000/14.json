The current development in AI allows riot to code an AI which can make the same distinction we've made (that player was intentionally trying to harm his mid laner).\nHowever, it would require A LOT of space, A LOT of computing time and A LOT of data (examples, such as yours) from previous games (as well as examples where players did a similar thing without being 'bad' people or had the intention to hurting their team mates).\nNow, the problem is that those 'examples' or 'data' required to feed the AI need to all be manually asserted by humans with the result of 'negative bad player with bad intention' or 'something different, not bad intentions'. And you need them in high numbers (think over 5-10 million).\n\nHence, the cost (money and time) of this feature would be absurd.\nThat's why, a better analogy would be.\nWhat you ask for is: everyone should be able to travel in space and to the moon.\nWhich once more, is not a bad idea.\nBut the cost required to fulfill that idea is to big.\n\nThat's why, currently, we lack the technology to do what you are asking for at a reasonable cost and in a reasonable time frame.\nLikewise, if you like studying history. You can look over how many people had cars about 100 years ago.
