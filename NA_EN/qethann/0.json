I got a message saying this account was logged in from another pc so i tried logging in but i had the wrong info. Thankfully, i was able to change my password before the hackers could but even with the correct password, it says im in a different region. I guess my region was changed, but whenever i check lolking or any other website, it says that my account is still in NA. I submitted a support ticket but still, nothing. I've had this account for years and i don't want to lose all my champions and skins.
