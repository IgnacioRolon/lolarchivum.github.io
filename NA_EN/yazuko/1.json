I created  a club a while back and of course I'm the owner. I made my friend a co-owner with the whole \"promote member\" thing. So somehow he left the group and he asked me to reinvite him into the club, but when I check the club, it shows that I'm not the owner anymore. And whats weird is that no one else in the group has that little emblem next to their name that represents ownership. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T05:14:45.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were a few hiccups with the Clubs re-enable that we're looking to resolve still.
