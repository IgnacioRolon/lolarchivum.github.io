I wasn't sure if I was the only one who saw this and was curious if there was a post or something I missed saying they were changing this back? Any rate, your thoughts are appreciated on this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-12T20:51:32.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP sales are only for a certain period of time. I believe the dates for the most recent sale was August 25th - September 8th. We do plan on doing this several times a year, so you'll have more opportunities to grab chromas for IP in the future. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lasher","date":"2016-09-12T23:43:44.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh right on.
