I answered this on another topic, but here's the dealio: \n\nWe're working on a fix to make the sign out button **actually** sign you out right now. Right now the button doesn't work as expected. :( However, at the moment you will switch from \"mobile\" to \"offline\" automatically after 24 hours though if you don't use the app again.","replies":[{"poster":"Wither Me This","date":"2016-03-07T12:43:38.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the information, being the smart person i am...i kept logging into the app to try to fix it :/.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2016-03-07T18:06:15.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Susan Top Only,realm=NA,application-id=J7eFAjsN,discussion-id=LEFeOx7j,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-03-07T12:43:38.617+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the information, being the smart person i am...i kept logging into the app to try to fix it :/.\n\nBut why would you want to log out...ever? ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2016-03-07T20:21:59.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have a question on the app. It keeps showing that I have 1 unread message.

When you background (or leave) the app, no matter if you're signed in or not, it disconnects from our chat service. This means it uses negligible battery life in the background. You can achieve the same chat disconnect by logging out, but it won't save you anything over just swiping away the app. \n\nIf for any reason the app is using a ton of battery life, please tell us because that's probably a bug of some kind. \n\nTL;DR Complicated tech stuff but the app should not be sucking battery for any reason (usually like 1% usage or less). If it is, please let us know.

Sorry about that!  \n\nSo before, log out wasn't working (sad face). To compensate, we had a really short timer that would bump you from mobile state automatically after 24 hoursish. Now, log out should be working properly and will log you out from mobile --> offline instantly when you select it. Therefore, we increased the mobile \"timeout\" to about 14 days. \n\nBecause you selected \"log out\" before it was working properly, it didn't log you out (double sad face). However, you now have the longer timeout because log out was fixed (and the timeout expanded) shortly after you selected it and uninstalled. \n\nSo that's a bit of a long explanation but the important things are this: \n\n1. If you have one phone, you can reinstall/log out and it will instantly change you from mobile --> offline (and fix the issue), or you could continue to wait for the remainder of the 14 day timeout. \n\n2. The \"cannot be invited to games\" part confuses me - are you showing up as green online when you log into the client or grey mobile? If you log into the client you should NOT be showing up as mobile but always as green online instead (and able to receive game invites). Please do let me know if you're having a problem on that front, because that's definitely a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"SoakingWetYuumi","date":"2016-04-06T18:57:22.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am no longer marked as logged into Mobile.
