The idea of Vi being 18 years old just seems completely bizarre to me. I do think that people's ages tend to significantly affect their views of age. I made my first roleplay character (well, one of my first) when I was like 12. I wanted the character to be \"a grown-up\", as in, a clearly mature adult. As a 12-year-old, I decided that 18 would work for an obviously adult age. It seemed very reasonable at the time. Now, when I think \"18 year old\", I think \"college freshman\" or \"tiny baby-person\".\n\nThat said, if two people both agree that Lux is supposed to be \"somewhat young\", with youth as one of her themes, I'm not sure it really matters if one person translates that as \"so she's maybe 25\" and the other person translates that as \"so she's like 16\". When I was 13, I thought 18-year-olds were \"grown-ups\", because hey, they could go to college, and as far as I was concerned, anyone going to college was clearly a grown-up. Then, shortly after I graduated college, some friends and I were talking about how weird it was to see college freshmen walking around: \"it's like, I want to ask them if their parents know where they are. They look so tiny.\" Not meant to be offensive; if anything, perhaps slightly envious. But mostly, it's just weird how perception of age changes over time.","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-05-14T23:47:50.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree, Vi strikes me as early or mid 20s at the very least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-14T12:08:22.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just guessing 18-20 based on her general immaturity despite her adult build, which reminds me of several people I know that are within that age range.
