His attack speed scaling is also fairly over the top now. Since his compensation pass fell through and his rework is not even slotted anymore with plenty of champions ahead of him Mordekaiser could really use this. The new AP item pass could be one of the few buffs Morde has had in a long time after being beaten down over the years by new itemization. \n\nA portion of this power is going to be wasted if his huge AD ratio is taking away from  his overall power distribution. His attack speed scaling is also outdated. In the past it served two purposes. One was to smooth out his attack animation for his Q so it wasn&#039;t so clunky ( especially for a champion plagued with cast times). Secondly it was there to make use of the large AD boost ghost and   hybrid items gave him. The first  reason is sound but there seems to be a bit of overflow for a champion who should really stop at 1 attack a second for a smoother Mace of Spades. The second reason has been dead and buried for quite some time, even more so with the latest change to Morde&#039;s ultimate.\n\n\nThe 1.0 AD ratio on the AOE Q and 1.65 ratio on the Single TargeT Q  should be taken away and Mordekaiser&#039;s AP ratios should be buffed accordingly. Lastly taking that attack speed scaling and rerouting some of  it to his health growth or health regen would go a long way for a champion meant to fight in melee range for extended periods. It just makes sense at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"King Odin","date":"2015-06-23T13:38:47.247+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"But but the {{item:3146}} synergy !!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Raid Boss Morde","date":"2015-06-24T03:03:34.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"WotA is a much better choice on Morde though.

Secondly as far as I know Jax's empower does not play by the same rules as Mordekaiser's Mace of spades.  Morde replaces  his melee attack with a completely new attack  that is converted to magic damage and does not use his base attack damage. It only considers the skill base damage, bonus AD and AP he has built. His power budget is being punished for a stat he has been discouraged to build and that does not use the same rules an On-hit effect like Jax's empower does.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-06-23T22:10:54.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look at Ekko.

If it wasn't there would be no precedent of the nerf on his Q AD scaling when Tri-force Morde was popular. It also would have been irresponsible of the Devs to have give actual mage ratios when hybrid builds were easily hitting 350 AD and AP with ghost back then. Not to mention how easy it was to aquire 30% + critical hit chance. \n\nHe gained a lot of extra damage from the old ghost and items. Many items such as gunblade, the original blood thirster, and tri-force have had balancing impacts on Morde because of his AD  ratio, however most were weeded out during item changes. With no compensation to be heard of ( a time before compensation passes) .It's a symptom of nerfs, itemization changes and system overhauls that leaves a champion like Morde still being punished for the past.\n\nSadly hybridization feel through the year it was announced and the spell revamps following made things worst. His damage has not been properly balanced. Its why his best damage scaling stats are CDR and Penetration because he was not allowed to scale like other mages. His ratios are so low AP is almost worthless. He's got wasted power in the AD ratio and attack speed scaling and it needs to finally come undone.\n\nFor reference of patch notes scaling his isolated AD bonus from 75% to 65% ( which is actually 1.75 to 1.65):\n\nhttp://lol.gamepedia.com/Mordekaiser_-_The_Master_of_Metal\n\nclick on the 1.x notes.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-06-26T16:19:08.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are all in the past though.

He was never compensated for having AD taken out his ghost and itemization as well as his 0 need for high scaling attack speed. No ratios were adjusted for this. He hasn't been balanced at all. If you give a champion a large AD ratio and scaling attack speed and then slowly take away all the reasons they was balanced around having extra damage and item options from AD their AP ratio should be readjusted. \n\nGraves W is not comparable to Morde's Q because Graves was never intended to build AP. His AP ratio is there much like the old Trundle Ult ratio to make sure the champion doesn't scale to well with one state. It's a way to gate a champions power. Riot has done this several times up until the release of Riven. Graves was balanced around not having AP or very little from things like Old WOTA aura, while Morde was not.  Morde was built with AD and AP in mind except now he has lost almost all the his AD options and instead of being converted into full AP for the time being he sits with nerfed values as if he is still balanced around using AD and AP. He no longer gets that 120 + ad that scaled with baron buff and consumables. His spike with ghost is no longer as major.\n\nTo really fix morde he needs a rework but for the time being he could be made to do what he does best now and actually deal damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-06-26T19:16:25.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It isn't all in the past.\n\nThe value of the AD ratio to his kit is all in the past.

The historical reasons for why he is weak don't matter.\n\nGraves W is a power gate, Morde AD scaling and attack speed was an intended portion of his kit since day one of his release. This was made obsolete and then not compensated for. His numbers are still definitely balanced around the fact that he had access to a large portion of AD. Not balancing for a potential 200+ damage on his Q just for having gunblade and a ghost would have been irresponsible.\n\n If a champion scales off a certain stat and then that stat is made obsolete with no reassessment of their kit the power budget for their kit has been effected. You can't make a champion who's kit scales off of AD and AP and then nerf everything that makes their AD scaling relevant and say the kit is fine. The champion was built with the notion that they would scale off both yet one portion of scaling was made useless and not compensated for. The champion would no longer scale the way they were intended and their numbers would be off.\n\nThere are also complications with leaving his main damage skill with a 1.65 ratio and then buffing him. Mainly with buffing his hybrid item usage reducing the clarity of his overall kit.  He needs to be pushed away from hybrid and AD usage which his AD ratio and attack speed scaling promote. Leaving those in could have unintended consequences down the line.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tsohgder","date":"2015-06-23T19:35:38.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a BONUS AD ratio, it literally replaces your next AA with an ability, it's not just an AA modifier.\n\nlvl 18 morde with no bonus AD or AP and a lvl 1 Q can actually deal LESS damage with his Q than his normal AA.\n\nI know it's weird, but there's no reason to keep it that way, either make it scale off total AD or remove the bonus AD ratio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-06-26T20:17:53.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, don´t kill trinity/gunblade bruiser morde!\nhe has enough power as it as as a ap-champ, it´s nice that you can actually add a little variety here and there.
