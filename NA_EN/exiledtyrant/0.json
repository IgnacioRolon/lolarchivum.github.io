It was under the remaining clears video. The clear still looks extremely fast. I think I'll still be able to keep my move speed quints while also using the more duel oriented talents. Will have to do a few runs when it comes out in tomorrow, but that was a good first look.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-08T04:31:55.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He can farm fine, but his ganks are worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2016-11-08T03:59:12.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure he's slow but at full health","replies":[]}]}
