The Update is live, while the SKT T1 skins were still on the PBE when the feedback was given- If people really disliked Zombie Ryze's new look, they should've said it when it was still on the PBE, because Riot usually never goes back to completely redesign modern things that are already released on the live servers.\n\n\n2. The obvious problem- China's bones policies and whatever other classic \"no-blood/gore policies\" that exist.\nThe old Zombie Ryze had his bones shown and even some flesh, brain and guts. Although those elements in the skin were its charm (I think?), Riot wouldn't go back to that if they are still on the track of having a cohesive look for all the skins for every place in the world (Basically, not making one Karthus normal and the other, Asian version having a hood that completely covers his face).\n\n\n-_-\n\n\nNow, I honestly don't mind the new Zombie Ryze, even if it looks more _Soulstealer_ than _Zombie_, I'm fine with it. I think that the **technical** quality of the skin is really good.\n\n**HOWEVER**, if Riot, by chance, would still somehow agree to take the skin back to the drawing board for even just a short time, **here are a few suggestions** that would align with both Riot's vision of _global-cohesiveness of skins_ and (hopefully) with the players thinking it should look 'more _Zombie_':\n\n- As I said, Riot probably would never go back to the _guts & bones showing_, but we still can make it look Zombie without those- First, I like how Riot tried to diffrentiate the skin from Zombie Brand by giving a different main shade of green (considering that \"the gorey stuff\" are gone now), but how about giving Ryze some of [Brand's features](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dw_2r60xZ0/UH-4ejOWuzI/AAAAAAAAJDA/E6UIn-UBGIA/s1600/zombiebrand.png) (but staying with the bright emerald color):\n\n - Ryze's veins could be thicker and more visible, like with Zombie Brand, and also have those bruises and spots of red hue on his skin.\n\n\n- Something Ryze doesn't have which Brand does is a shirt. You're probably skins, _\"What? Adding a shirt? You can be serious\"_, but that's not what I mean- Since Ryze doesn't have shirt, he has chest showing, which he can beneift from **if Riot makes him more boney- You know, having bulging ribs, making him slightly skinnier** (so it wouldn't look like he suddenly has really big bones or something).\n\n\n\nI think that those things could definitely make him look more Zombie (even if they don't sound like much) while not stepping too far into the \"no-bones/no-guts territory\".","replies":[{"poster":"WhiperSnapers","date":"2016-07-15T02:14:18.959+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for mentioning the \"no blood/gore policies\", I had completely forgoten about the karthus skins being changed to fit that. Seeing as how we will never get the \"brains/guts hanging out\" Ryze skin that many people had hoped for, we should talk a little bit more about what can be done to further zombifie him.\n\n* I liked your \"bulging ribs\" and \"thicker veins\" ideas, they both really add an undead appearance without adding all the gore. \n\n* I have to disagree with you on the color though. He just seems way to lively and energetic for someone who was supposedly dead. I realize that a big part of this is due to his animations, and since it is just a 975 RP skin they wont be doing any special walking or stumbling animations like brand. Aside from the animations, his skin tone and spell effects are just too bright to pull of the zombie look. \n\n * There are two other zombie skins: Brand and Nunu. In compliance with the no gore policies neither skin displays \"typical zombie wounds\" of any kind, yet both can be quickly identified as zombies due to their pale (brand) or dark (nunu) green skin tones and other dark features. Green is a tricky color to work with because if you go too dark you end up with the zombie look (literally death) and if you go too light you end up with the nature look (the symbol of life). I feel like on the green spectrum scale, he falls closer to elderwood leblanc and hecarim than he does to the actual zombie skins. \n\n * Zombie Ryze's spell effects are also too bright. When you look at zombie brand and nunu, their spells all look like some type of toxic green goo which seems more along the lines of a zombie than the glowing  blue-green spells that ryze has. Again, I dont expect them to change the spell effects of a 975 RP skin, but could they at least add a darker filter to them?\n\nIm sure there are more ways to zombifie him without adding any gore, but as for his current condition, I dont think we can properly call him \"zombie\" Ryze. If they dont make any changes to the skin itself, they should at least rename it to \"soulstealer\" Ryze because right now he looks more like someone who **MAKES** undead than someone who **IS** undead","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2016-07-14T05:56:28.624+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since i don't play ryze I wasn't much aware of it so I took a look and holy crap... it's terrible\n\nthe new one is basically a recolor of classic ryze and has absolutely nothing to do with being a zombie, at all.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-07-14T09:39:06.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, he has a tombstone instead of a scroll in his back ....\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-07-14T05:57:49.075+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"They should give it more rotting flesh like before and a chase animation like Brand has.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2016-07-14T11:39:09.324+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, it would scare Chinese, that's why they removed it even from the splash art before the rework during the splash art unification.","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-07-14T17:29:17.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure \"scare\" is a good word for how it effects them.
