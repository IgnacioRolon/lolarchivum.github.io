Unusual or inadequate language constructions might appear.\n \nAlthough I believe that doing away with the League of Legends as a narrative artifact was the right choice (seeing it gone was my secret dream, for reasons very similar to those expressed by Narrative), there is an issue with it that needs to be addressed.\n \nIn the previous version of Runeterra existed champions like {{champion:9}} Fiddlesticks, {{champion:56}} Nocturne and {{champion:31}} Cho&#039;gath, whose hat was basically &#039;scary thing being trapped by the Institute of War&#039; (there were variations among them, of course, but functionally that&#039;s where they stood), which I think can be executed in a far more satisfying manner if released into the world (figuratively or literally).\n \nHowever, there is a champion that, with the removal of the League of Legends (a massively influential, world-class combat arena), has been left without a clear place in the world, with a vital part of his identity irrevocably seized away from him.\n \nI am not talking about {{champion:24}} Jax this time (but a point about him in a moment).\n \nI am talking about this guy:\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/z8Qjt8i.jpg\n \n{{champion:119}} Draven&#039;s identity revolves primarily around him snatching the biggest spotlight available and pointing it at his glorious mustache. He is the ultimate attention seeker and glory-hound of the game, his backstory repeatingly illustrating his quest for fame and acclamation (up to and including his actual in-game League of Draven passive).\n \nDraven&rsquo;s thirst for acclaim was the sole reason he joined the League (well, that and his lofty desire to gift Draven to a global audience, of course), and the most important part of his character. The League of Legends provided him with a world-class stage from which his renown, his legend, was able to reach basically every person in Runeterra; With the removal of League, that stage is gone, and nothing even remotely comparable remains for the Glorious Executioner to stand on.\n \nI first thought about this when pondering how the removal of the League affected Jax. I realized that even though Jax&rsquo;s lore revolved heavily around the League (the most successful League participant in history), his core as a character (unbeatable master-at-arms) and his motivations (desire to fight strong opponents, presumably) weren&rsquo;t irrevocably entrenched on the League of Legends. Draven is the opposite case, I believe: His backstory touches only briefly on his enrollment to the League, yet his character (shameless self-promoter and fame-seeker) and motivation (gifting Draven to the world, collecting the adoration that is due to Draven) draws heavily upon the existence of the League of Legends to work to the extent it does.\n \nExpanding upon this, my opinion is that while Jax has lost the framework by which his character was showcased, there are other avenues to deliver on his fantasy. Certainly, with the League gone, the Grandmaster-at-Arms can no longer face, fight and humiliatingly defeat combat powerhouses from a dozen of nations on a daily basis, and the loss of his main story blurb is a small tragedy for the lore fandom; However, being that Jax&rsquo;s identity consist mainly on extreme fighting prowess, there are other ways to make him a part of the world while preserving his original character, and probably most of his (implicit) influence over Runeterra.\n \nOn the other hand, Draven&rsquo;s story not only depended upon the previous structure, but was driven by it; He joined the League with the explicit goal of increasing his own reputation and self-exposure. Unlike with Jax, I have not yet seen a way to preserve Draven&rsquo;s previous presence and influence on the new Runeterra , and I seriously doubt that is possible at all (hopefully I am wrong). Why I believe that? Because that part of Draven&rsquo;s identity hinges upon a lot of the elements that made the League undesirable to the Narrative team in the first place: A world-spanning, monolithic organization, its influence dictating the politics of Runeterra and permeating all levels of society, with the eyes of the world constantly upon it. Virtually any other forum Draven may get, in Noxus or any other place will probably fall short of the formidable League of Legends, which was home of the finest, most puissant  and most famous (or infamous) heroes of the land. In short, I really think that Draven&rsquo;s identity will be irrevocably lost, or at least dramatically reduced in scope and magnitude.\n \nNow, I don&rsquo;t believe that preserving a cool character (Draven in this case), or even a dozen of them, was enough reason to prevent the retcon of Runeterra, but still would be a shame if Draven were to lose his identity or place in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-27T01:43:25.171+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Draven is Draven, and the size of his audience won't change that.

It is possible that Demacia has many immigrants, and possibly subregional accents.\n\nOr take England. **Just England**, not Great Britain. England is an island, and it's not even that big compared to many American \"states\". It's much smaller than **California **where Riot Games is based.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TDTF0jp.png\n\nNow the above shows Great Britain vs the United States, but take a closer look, and see just how small **England **is. Ignore Ireland and the Isle of Man, cut off Scotland and Wales.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/vYxwYBl.jpg\n\nHow many accents could there be in _England_?\n\nCornish, West Country (stereotypical pirate accent), Geordie, Yorkshire, Lacanshire, Scouse,  East Hertfordshire (East Herts), West Herts, Hampshire, Kent, Norfolk, and more. \n\n#And LONDON?\n\nJust in the city of London you have Cockney, Estuary English, Multiculural London English, and \"Recieved\" Pronunciation (most stereotypical British accent, actually spoken by very few people). The following video gives you a little audio tour of accents in **just **_1 minute and a half._\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mzWkuOxz8\n\nIf you have time for a longer watch, about 5 minutes or so, you can hear nearly 25 accents located JUST within England.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZ-Ny8q22o\n\nWith that said, it seems reasonable to believe that a fantasy state like \"Demacia\" would have different accents, not just among it's boroughs/districts/etc but also between upper and lower classes in each, and even among subcultures (take Chav English for example) I mean, you dont expect {{champion:59}} to speak like a commoner do you? \n\nNow, it's true...with a fantasy universe you can create a unique fantasy accent (take Hunger Games' original \"Capitol Accent\" for example) But....it's easier to just use **REAL **ones from life. Accents have certain qualities associated with them as the video discusses a little (i.e. drunk sounding Welshmen) . They chose \"French\" for Fiora because it fits the ideas behind the character (and mind you, it's just ONE french accent). \n\nNow despite this, France does not exist within Runeterra. \n\nWhat I'd like to know, is WHERE accents map regionally in Runeterra. Essentially, what part of Demacia is Fiora and the Laurent family from? Is the accent more common than we think -or if not, then where did the Laurents immigrate from? Are there many of them in Demacia, or elsewhere? Was it a kingdom or nation that was unified with others at Demacia's founding, or was it...conquered? In that sense, you shouldnt be suprised characters from the same state can have many different manners of speech, but...what you should be asking is where in Runeterra these accents originate.\n\nNow an important thing to note is that theoretically....\"English\" does not exist within Runeterra either, despite being spoken by nearly all of it's characters (except {{champion:432}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:421}} ), because there is no \"England\". \n\nThere's several ways to handle this. There could be a common \"trade tongue\"/lingua franca that's spoken by all or most characters when not speaking their own native language  -which explains accented English spoken by {{champion:11}} , {{champion:43}} , {{champion:201}} , {{champion:114}} , and others. In this sense, English does not exist, and is merely a stand in. So when we have a character that speaks with say, a rural accent -the character actually speaks a fictional language unknown to us, _but_ the accent in a language the player understands, can convey the characters upbringing. or lifestyle.\n\n#OH AND ONE MORE THING.\n\nWhen they dub the game into other languages? They have to _redo all the accents._ And they dont use the same ones, but ones speakers of those languages are accustomed to hearing. \n\nThat _aside_ NORTH America _is_ a continent, it has several nation \"states\" within it -Canada, the United States of America, and Mexico. Within any one of them, you have MANY accents. But I think you know that now. \n\n\"The joke's on YOU!\" -{{champion:35}}\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BpsmuKL.jpg\n\n:D\n\nLet's have more funny accents, now with Animations!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtB1W8zkY5A","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-27T17:47:21.565+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"We definitely want to move Noxus beyond being outright villainous, there are so many characters that aren't that, but at times we've gone a bit too far in making them de facto antagonists.

Look at how people viewed Lux's Judgment. They forgot that the conscription also part of defending one's country and people, instead, people say it's a completely black mark in Demacia and makes them eviler than Noxus. I'm very sure you have a way to explain why it's not a completely black act, but... yeah, as you can see.\n\nSelf-righteousness is also a topic that is often viewed as an act that propagates hypocrisy, and hypocrites are amongst the most hated kind by the fans. Many often views the \"At least I'm honest about it\" to be a virtue, which Noxus obviously had, so by the views of many, Demacia being very self-righteous on law is considered something worse than Noxus' murderous freedom (and we also hear cases or stories that makes law bad and undesirable). So all in all, if we're just using the normal cliche, it could be easy to really pull down Demacia from the pedestal way too hard and then we end up painting them black instead of making it 'grey'.\n\nJust my two cents, I could be either wrong or just looking at a dim view based on some select, unintelligent posts.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Garlyle Wilds","date":"2015-07-27T04:26:09.686+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any sufficiently large country has multiple accents depending on the specific region of that country.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-07-27T15:34:14.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Rito, y u no post on threads about HUD, Fiora art ,etc.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-07-27T17:42:34.030+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm really not the right person to post on those issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-07-27T19:16:37.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"then get Lyte or Wookie to comment on their boards again ;-;, instead of camping reddit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toa of Death","date":"2015-07-27T17:47:39.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause Jaredan is in the Lore department.
