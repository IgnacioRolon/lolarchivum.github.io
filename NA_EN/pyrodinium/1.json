Right now, it benefits primarily autoattackers and champions with good offensive scaling.\r\n\r\nDo you think the fuzziness of the buff (as it is effective against structures, minions and monsters rather than just for teamfighting) is in an acceptable level?\r\n\r\nWere clarity concerns present around the fact that a +% damage against champions buff would be less visible, while AD/AP are displayed openly?\r\n\r\nDid you think that affecting base damages on skills could have lead to less healthy gameplay?\r\n\r\nMaybe there were balance concerns around champions that get damage from defensive stats, or a desire to make the buff attractive to champions with AP-based utility scaling?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-17T17:47:34.559+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Infernal Drake's % AD/AP scaling for a few reasons. The first is that it avoids pushing damage dealing champions (assassins and fighters especially) towards building tanky and relying on their base damage. We already see a number of cases where that's a bit too effective and don't want to exacerbate it. The second is that we want the dragon buffs to influence decision making somewhat. By not offering base damage scaling we can offer a significantly higher % on AP/AD, making it worth considering items that might normally be optimal when you've got multiple Infernal stacks (e.g. going an AD heavy build on some champs that might otherwise go on hit or tankier). Finally AP/AD scaling isn't as snowbally early game, since stats from items are contributing a smaller proportion of your total damage. Infernal Drake's already a strong indicator of success if you take it early, multiplying total damage instead would have increased the amount taking one first decides games noticeably too.","replies":[{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2016-05-18T17:59:36.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking a lot about the infernal dragon recently and I agree that the power creep of tanks (if Infernal dragon was amplifying damage) would be way too strong.  \n\nBut in its current state, the infernal dragon is buffing wave clear, jungle clear, epic monster and tower taking (overlap with mountain dragon), and the ap buffs are also affecting healing and shielding from supports (mild overlap with ocean dragon, less now that ocean dragon has been changed).  For the dragon that is suppose to be buffing champion fighting (well more specifically, killing) capabilities, it is doing so much more than that; to the point that it crowds out the other dragons.    \n\nWhat if, instead, the infernal dragon buff gave a % increase to damage against champions based on the bonus ad/ap a champion has.  Rough numbers, for example, would be a 1% increased damage to champions per 50 bonus ad/100 ap.  \n\nChampions are still encouraged to build damage items (as opposed to building tanky) but the infernal dragon will no longer be this giant snowball mechanic that is buffing far too many areas at once.  Of course, this still leaves the on-hit builds a little lacking, but it at least solves some of the bigger problems that the infernal dragon presents.  \n\nNow I know I'm not a part of any balance team and it does feel like I am greatly overstepping some set of bounds here (as I am sure that your balance teams have infernal dragon on their radar and have maybe suggested this same idea), but I ~~refuse ~~ find it hard to believe that the infernal dragon in its current form is good for the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-05-17T18:55:47.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that tankier champs would more enjoy the regen from the ocean drake for example. The on hit champs get typically minimal from even the the infernal since the only 2 on hit items that also give AD or AP are {{item:3153}} and {{item:3115}} with nashors being the clear winner for giving stats to AP based attack speed champs. The only drake that on hit heavy champs would enjoy heavily is the elder drake. If the infernal drake boost also affected the on hit damage of champs that would build for that it would also be a helper for the previously behind devourer champs.","replies":[{"poster":"masterdragon481","date":"2016-05-18T18:06:46.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm against this because tanks building thornmail start to do even more damage if Infernal Dragon is buffing on hit damage as well.  Tanks/ juggernauts etc are strong enough as is right now.  \n\nI think the solution to the on hit problem is to get rageblade into a good place where it is essentially *worth* trading off benefits of the infernal dragon.  Perhaps damage abilities should give stacks, etc but I don't think there is anyway to include amplifying the damage of on hit builds in the infernal dragon's buff.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-05-16T20:48:37.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The Ocean Drake benefits tanks/mages more, what's your point?","replies":[{"poster":"Pyrodinium","date":"2016-05-16T20:51:00.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is right there in the post.
