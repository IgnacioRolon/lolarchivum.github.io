Unfortunately, I have no way to prove this.\n\nWhat people don't like is the following:\n> There are just certain things we can respond to and other things we can't. It's not as much the topic as it is the way we engage about it. I know Ant in Oz riled some folks when saying that we can't read fan-fiction.

It's partly due to the legality of it, **but also because using other people's ideas, even accidentally, is stomach churning to a creative writer.**\n\nHad he stopped at where it was due to the legality of the situation, people would've been more okay with it. Not by much, but it was a fairly logical reason. But to say that it's offensive to a creative writer to use other people's ideas opens a can of worms he didn't realize, for a few reasons:\n-A fair number of skins, and some champions, are inspired in some way by previous works.\n-The claim I made earlier (someone else would have to confirm this for me), that fanfiction or other such ideas that was provided by the community was made in the final product.\n-There's a DAMN BOARD for champion/skin concepts. Which means, at some point, a Rioter had to have looked at it and said \"Huh, that's interesting\"\n\nHad his words been warped? I believe it has to a degree.

Yet, as I'm sure you're doing, whatever content you put out would be done with care; planning out every aspect as much as possible. \n\nBut, don't you think it's a bit strange to be reacting this way to input? \nFrom what I've heard, every story out there has been told countless different ways. It's what you do with that story that makes it unique. Point in case: Wukong, the Monkey King {{champion:62}}. The name, title, and appearance has many people thinking of Sun Wukong from the Chinese classic *Journey to the West*. There's many renditions of him, yet the lore that pertains to him here for League of Legends places him in Runeterra, and makes him unique. I mention him because I feel under your words, and I may be misguided, but I feel that a champion such as Wukong wouldn't exist because that identity has already been established in previous works (or it'd give you a pretty bad case of \"stomach churning\").\n\nIf that example didn't work, here's one that might seem a bit more familiar to you: Kalista{{champion:429}}  and Graves{{champion:104}} . Based on lore, both are driven by revenge of those who have betrayed them. The details vary (some more vague than others, if you don't mind me saying), but it's the same story at its essence. \n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned in my comment that you've replied to, there's a board dedicated to Skin/Champion concepts. Now, if part of how you operate includes avoiding that section like the plague to avoid being tainted, that's fine. If we are able to speak about the bare essence of champions, that's fine. If we could maybe speak more about the world of Runeterra in general and get a better vibe of the realm that everyone exists in, that'd be wonderful.

Art changes when people think something is ugly or doesn't match characters. Abilities change when people find them unsatisfying. The PBE exists for the purpose of taking feedback from players. There have been huge threads about what people want from champions like Skarner, Rengar and others.

The infamous Saturday Morning Cartoon Villain Viktor was changed after a furious response from players.

There are many other instances. \n\nTo ignore such a strong precedent of player feedback shaping what the company creates is rather upsetting I think. What is it about Narrative that makes player suggestions anathema? Why is it bad for players to influence the lore, but not the game and art? Few of us are demanding to be given the reigns of Narrative to do what we want with it. Certainly no product can be made solely by anarchic committee (except maybe a Twitch Plays game). There needs to be a balance of Narrative control and player desires. Of course Narrative has final say and should have final say. Quality control is vital and they'll never please every single fan. They have a big picture view and are trained writers with more resources than us. But players are the ones reading the lore and it's designed to appeal to us. If we don't like it, then it should be changed. It's not us telling Narrative how do to its job I see happening most often. It's players saying 'We don't like this lore' and the response being 'We aren't going to change it.' If a world building suggestion is pleasing to many players and doesn't clash with the lore Narrative wishes to tell, what makes it a bad thing to listen to? We already are helping (hopefully) shape how champions like Taric will be remade. Taric is part of the world, and we are giving world building suggestions to shape him. \n\nIt's a hard balance. Right now I don't think the balance is right though. Hmm...maybe Bard is here to save Lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2015-03-13T23:18:27.824+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LucidLunatic,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=L2nEKFGG,comment-id=0000000000010001000000010000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-13T22:18:07.162+0000)\n\n> Here on the boards, we aren't being offered drafts. We are certainly not being asked to help the lore team improve as writers. While certain feedback is valuable from us, telling them how to do their jobs is not something they are looking to hear, and that includes our worldbuilding suggestions.\n\nAnd what you are failing to grasp is that there is no harm in hearing what we have to say. This is a game. One in which now we play directly as the characters.\n\nGetting feedback on what we want those characters to be is not harmful.\n\n\"Plot suggestions\" are in no way harmful... I fail to see how they could be. If you don't like the suggestion or it doesn't work you discard it. The real issue is that people who find there work to carry some kind of sacred quality often make the most pretentious twats in real life.\n\nWhile I wont go as far as to say Narrative seem to be those people... The evidence is clear Narrative has already missed the mark several times on Characters. \n\nWhat narrative wants is for us all to STFU and just \"Like\" whatever they put out.\n\nWell we don't do that when something is imbalanced in the game and we won't do it in Lore ether.\n\nThis is a game with 4 years of lore pre-retcon... and people are still attached to that lore. To give it up Narrative needed to show real flaws in it... and at the same time show a plan forward that would preserve the characters.\n\nNarrative failed to show a real flaw, then time and time again failed to maintain the characters with respect to the originals.\n\nNo one talks about it... but new Karma is a direct affront to what the original character was all about. She make direct quotes that go against what her philosophy was before.\n\nNow on the subject of input. Maybe you don't like input on your stories... and you are the type of writer that likes to give readers finished products with a \"Here it is, read it, and if you don't like anything go fuck yourself\" attitude. And that would be fine for most companies. But that isn't what the rest of Riot is about and it shouldn't be what Riot's Narrative is about.\n\nI would put forward if their train of thought, or personal grasp of a setting is so weak that merely reading opinions of interesting ideas unhinges that grasp... perhaps they don't belong in a professional environment when it comes to writing.\n\nFurther more you want a real world example of something like this blowing up and costing a company REAL money... Mass Effect 3's ending.\n\nMass Effect 1, 2, & most of 3, where written with community input and feedback on so many levels, by 1000s of dedicated fans. \n\nThen it came time for the ending and you know how many people got to put their input into that?\n\n2... 2 people... 2 Holy sages of the clan \"Professional Writer\" sat down behind closed doors with NDA's and wrote out the ending without any input from the fans... the ending had to be a surprise right?\n\nI think we know how that turned out...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-13T20:10:26.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, but I think Narrative's connections to the players have significantly decreased over time.

Sure. But, it doesn't feel like it holds weight because as you said, they've barely produced any literary work.\nBTW, is there any supplemental lore besides what I see in the game for Bard?

Therefore, there's *nothing* to talk about on that front.\n\nConsidering \"Essences of people and places of Runeterra,\" this is also up for grabs since the entire world of Runeterra is being rebuilt (supposedly).  Also, the \"core concepts\" of each and every champion in League should *already* be well ingrained within the minds of the people in Narrative.\nIf they're capable of missing the mark on a champion's core concepts (Xerath, for instance) when they release and establish a new story (thus, creating new canon for the lore), then what does debating these points *actually* accomplish?  Would Jaredan, Loping Cinder and the rest of Narrative be willing to go back and redo a champion's failed bio (changing months of internal debate we don't get to be a part of) after getting feedback from us?  I have my doubts.\n\nSo, I ask you, what would be the point of establishing a meaningful relationship between Lore fans and the people within Narrative if the two areas we're *allowed* to talk with them about either *don't exist right now* or are likely set in stone by the time they *would* get to us?\n\nAt least that's how I see it, and I don't see anyone from Narrative telling me otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-03-13T02:50:10.714+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":21,"body":"This is precisely what my previous statement was meant to convey.","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-03-13T03:09:25.908+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":4,"body":"It baffles me that it took you *two weeks* to convey this despite numerous unanswered questions on your original post, as well as a separate post with 158 upvotes that expresses disappointment in your words.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2015-03-12T21:22:00.210+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"My favorite part about that post is that Jaredan is a senior editor, but he doesn't know which members of the narrative team were around six months ago or whether there are even any who have been around that long.
