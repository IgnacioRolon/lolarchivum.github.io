Kill him a few times and trash talk him a little in all chat, complain in team chat about community having no shame..  Then my bard tries to 1v1 the Kennen, and all I really did was ping him back.  And after he ran in and died (I assumed he had inted) he said &quot;cause kys n**ger&quot;  Like I know this community can be really toxic and usually I don&#039;t ask to report people for being toxic cause maybe they just had a bad day.  But since he was being racist, I said in all chat to please report him for saying &quot;cause kys n**ger&quot; but apparently since I relayed what he said, I was punished for 14 days.  2 Minutes later it comes up saying he was punished, but this seems really unreasonable to me.  I&#039;ve seen people get off with crazy toxic trash talk in all and team chat and I was mostly just complaining in team chat about Kennen&#039;s jungle help.  I don&#039;t think I really did anything that deserves this punishment.  I know I'm  not supposed to respond to racist peoples trash talk, but I get really agressive about that kind of behavior.  But even then, I think he's in the wrong, and I shouldn't have been punished this harshly","replies":[{"poster":"Dolyna","date":"2018-05-12T00:16:38.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=An Irish Boi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zF1zhoEV,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-12T00:03:52.761+0000)\n>\n> But since he was being racist, I said in all chat to please report him for saying \"cause kys n**ger\" but apparently since I relayed what he said, I was punished for 14 days. \n\nRiot's zero tolerance policy strikes again. Personally, I don't like zero tolerance policies. But never repeat someone's toxic chat.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that asking others to report somebody is useless, so you weren't accomplishing anything anyway. The system doesn't check the chat logs any harder when more than one person reports someone. All you had to do was report the player yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-05-12T00:46:10.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest you send a ticket to https://support.riotgames.com and have them review the punishment.\n\nIf you had a clean behavior history, they might change the punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PURYY","date":"2018-05-12T10:47:20.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"relax i get ban on my acont waste time and money for that acont over 2000 euro and they ban me and say i cant recover money of this acount on other relax is just a waste of time play this game i never play this game invest 00 from nw","replies":[]},{"poster":"An Irish Boi","date":"2018-05-12T02:13:03.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, got this resolved.
