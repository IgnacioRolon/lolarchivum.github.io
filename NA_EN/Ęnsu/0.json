It looks like some game assets could be failing to load during champion select.  To start, I recommend enabling [low spec mode](https://i.gyazo.com/a39e12ca76e54359342203c476a0e9c1.png) mode incase the really fancy stuff is not rendering properly.  \n\nI then recommend downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and running a repair to fix up any bad assets.\n\nYou'll want to test this in a custom game though to prevent anymore penalties.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
