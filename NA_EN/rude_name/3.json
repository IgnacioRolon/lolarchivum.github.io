Their damage should be easy to see coming, but not necessarily easy to dodge, e.g. Galio R, Maokai R, etc.\n\nSupports should be gated by allies. Supports should excel when they can work THROUGH allies, not necessarily working FOR the allies. Stuff like Zilean Q, Lulu EQ combo, etc.\n\nThoughts? I&#039;m still trying to get orientated around this.\n\nEDIT: This is very simplified. I also changed mages from mana/energy to CD, because, well, Sire Hippington is right. ","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2017-08-07T18:00:29.338+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't agree with mages and the heavy mana gateing.\nObiously some kits need gateing either just for lane or even later on, but in general, heavy gateing through mana leads to a very passive and boring playstyle as you only comit your preccious mana if you really are sure to get something from it. The insane mana gateing is one off the things i dislike most in dota.\nYou also shouldn't forget that in dota, even mages have well scaleing AAs, some of them like lina even have pretty huge dps, so they can afford to hold back their spells.\nImo mages should rather work like in S2, when you actually had to decide between cdr for dps and raw burst damage. They should be more gated by CDs **and opportunity**\n\nAssasins imo should not be designed about 100-0 combos, wether it's delayed or not, it always leads to a binary scenario where either the victim or the assasin gets rather frustraited(Zed always had the delay, and by times was the most banned champ in the game even while not op). Imo they should focus more on hit n run, beeing able to unload decent damage rather fast, and then disengage for a second round soon after, while skirmishers should have an ok opening burst, but good dps and stickiness aswell as the means to avoid some damage so they can use their dps.\n\nFully agree on adc, they need more rampup mechaincs and shouldn't have burst mechanics like shiv on their dps items. It's ok if they can built ad/cdr/pen and become ad-casters that have burst/poke, but they need to sacrifice dps for that. \nI also really dislike current huricane, crit+aoe should not go together. Old hurricane was a lot better design, you could go for on-hit builts with it for aoe damage but loose out in the crit scaleing vs singletaregts, so there was more of a tradeof. They also should have to sacrifice a bit more damage for survivabillity than they currently do, and lifesteal items should NEVER have anti burst/anti cc on them, they should counter their own counter.\nBut mostly, crit needs to go or geting reworled into something else, but the current RNG has no place in a competetive game. Pure luck should never decide wether you win a trade/fight or not.\n\nSupports imo should be less designed as slaves to the adc and just the adc but rather more as supports **for the entier team**, with maybe some beeing more focused on supporting adc, some on helping melee fighters and some on boosting mages. I also do think that (some)supports should be allowed to be somewaht selfsufficient, especial earlyer in the game. It really helps strategic diversity if there are supportive champs that can perform in a sololane while getting his best perormance once he joins up with others. And yes, i'm all for supports working more through others rather than for them with stuff like namies W or Ivern E.\n\nTanks should have less damage+cc, right now they bring to much of both. Befor the tankreworks slapped aditional cc on every tank, it was fine for them to do the damage they did, but now it's just to much output overall. They also could use a clearer focuse on either engage/dive or peeling. Prettymuch all tanks right now can do both so there is little varity. I also think that hard cc shouldn't be as plenty and spamable as it is. It needs to be either gated by high CDs and/or by Opportunity/Conditions. Maokai spaming a strong aoe knockbak every 3 sec or Zac haveing 3 displaces in his kit with not to high cd on two of them is just to much. It's ok for a tank to be disruptive, but there always is a line that shouldn't get crossed, and the old tanks imo were well within line, they had good cc to be disruptive, but weren't overbearing with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyarlathοtep","date":"2017-08-07T20:29:49.746+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Tanks should have less damage+cc, right now they bring to much of both.\n\nWut.

As it is now, getting to 40% is a given, not a choice. I'm fine with not mana gating them. They're mages, using spells is the point. But missing should have a consequence and they should have to decide to use their spells for one thing or another, not have enough CDR for both. Unless they sacrificed power to do both.\n\n\nFor Assassins, I'd argue that over the course of 20 seconds (which is an absurd time for any fight in league at the moment) DPS should be equal to a mage or adc. But mages and ADC do the same DPS over that 20 seconds; assasins do 60-80% in the first 5-10 seconds, and 20-40% is the back half. \nI'm using exaggerated times to get the point across better. And because I think that's closer to the time fights should actually take. Assassin v mage/ADC obviously shouldn't be that long, but I'd argue ADC/Mage/Tank v.

Unfortunately, Riot wants tanks to damage despite that being the main issue anytime we hit a tank meta. Honestly, tank meta should be great. I'd argue it is the default most balanced state. Except Riot still wants tanks to kill people in the same time-frame as other champions.\n\nGoing by before, a fight or duel with a tank should always be significantly longer. \nMy basic opinion for tanks is that if the tank can't realize he's losing and actively run away from most things damage wise, there's a problem.
