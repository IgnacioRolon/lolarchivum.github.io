You also cannot be punished for someone else's behavior.\n\n> When are you going to fix this? \n\nThe 10-game chat restriction was your penalty. Because you were penalized, you also lost the benefit of Hextech items. The loss of hextech crafting is not linked to the 10-game restriction. You must show a sufficient amount of good behavior before you are again eligible. This is not broken, and is working as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"Friedrich Drumpf","date":"2016-07-13T00:29:18.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm still waiting for the other 2 games that I was never showed...\nI think it's BS because like I said, this isn't normal.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-07-14T00:05:42.296+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you want me to post all 3 games here?
