Those players are losing what they play.\n\nIt would be like taking Ahri, and reworking her to have only a single dash, no MS on her Q, and way more damage and faster travel time on her E. Okay, great - she's now just like almost every assassin out there. And that's a much smaller change than most of these reworks are, but the point is that it removes her identity and replaces it with something that >50% of players may prefer (i.e. there are more assassin mains combined than Ahri mains). \n\nI think new Galio sounds broken. I think he also sounds fun. I also think old Galio was pretty well balanced and didn't need any changes.\n\nI wish Riot would learn that NOT EVERY CHAMPION needs to be picked a lot. It's OKAY to have some niche champions. Some players like to play a less popular champion or a champion with an older design. There's nothing wrong with that and Riot shouldn't disrespect them so much.\n\nNew Galio is sufficiently different that he could have been an entirely new release (a release we don't need mind you, I really wish we would have fewer champion releases as this game is getting too big for its own good...). Old Galio and new Galio could have existed as two different champions, and you would still see old Galio getting played.","replies":[]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2017-03-08T03:19:12.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kind of like the taric rework that left nothing from his old kit around","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-08T03:16:24.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between galio and sion or yorick, for example, was that he was actually viable and had a healthy kit.\n\nOh well. i guess we get another generic bruiser with overloaded crowd control.","replies":[]}]}
