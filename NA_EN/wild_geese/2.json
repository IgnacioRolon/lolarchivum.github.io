Can these champions be anymore obnoxious?\nKayle is like more ADC than an ADC. She literally just stands there and idle autoattacks and hits R to keep autoattacking.\nMorgana has infinite mana level 1 for some reason so she&#039;s throwing every spell at you forever and turtling the lane forever.\n\nBoth champions always when I play with them, it doesn&#039;t look like they are trying, feels like playing with a bot.

Even more different than Poppy or Sion (at least they kept one skill).\nAatrox kept no skills at all. The only thing that's the same is he has a *means to revive and sustain*, however that says nothing for his gameplay, just that he has a way to obtain familiar functions.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-07-23T16:35:27.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Urgot changed more.\nNot that this is a bad thing , tho, I love Urgots playstyle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
