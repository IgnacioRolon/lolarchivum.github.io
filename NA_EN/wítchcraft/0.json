It was one of my favorite animations while I played Lulu, and I&#039;m certain that it wasn&#039;t intentional. I&#039;m sure it&#039;s not at all a priority but maybe someone at Riot could take a look for me? Thanks for your time :)\n\nOk, just tested it in game, the animation is there when I get speed boosted by anything that's not whimsy, but before, mobility boots or swiftness boots would cause the animation to stay permanently.","replies":[{"poster":"Jinxel","date":"2017-01-29T00:15:46.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been a common known bug for a long time.

He's going to talk to an animator on his team and see what's intended and what needs to be changed. It isn't something you'll see next patch, but something we're actively working on! :)","replies":[]}]}
