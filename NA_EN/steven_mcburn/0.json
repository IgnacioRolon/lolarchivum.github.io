Kill Nexus.\n\nIf you manage to do those two things, you win every game. Nothing else really matters. If we&#039;re up 9 kills 20 minutes in, but have no objectives, and we win ANOTHER teamfight and don&#039;t get anymore objectives because you decide that wolf camp looks juicy, I&#039;m going to understandably say &quot;what the hell are you doing?&quot;\n\nIf it&#039;s 36 minutes in, and our team hasn&#039;t collected a single objective on the map, despite winning multiple fights where our carries are alive after; I&#039;m going to be upset.\n\nIt&#039;s not rocket science. It&#039;s not a &quot;comeback&quot; when you finally decide you want to shoot a tower. It&#039;s nothing more than you deciding you finally wanted to play League of Legends and not CoD. Your goal isn&#039;t to reach 250 farm, your goal isn&#039;t to get sated by 22 minutes (wtf slow?), your goal isn&#039;t even to be 500 short of your next item and farm it rq. No. Your goal is to take the opportunity to kill the towers, then kill the nexus.\n\n\nIn the slums, that&#039;s the #1 thing people don&#039;t do. Ever. Forget the tunnel vision, forget constantly trying to play like you&#039;re ahead when you&#039;re 0-5 in lane, none of that is uncarriable. It&#039;s the guy who&#039;s 11-0 and just afk farming a frozen bot lane while the rest of the team fights 4v5, wins, and then we get absolutely no objective out of it.\n\nDon&#039;t be a CoD kiddie. Play League of Legends. Shoot a tower once in awhile, take a stroll to the dragon pit, breath in the fresh air of what teams actually do to win the game outside of trying to be a bad-ass-one-shot-king. You&#039;ll get those badass-one-shot-king games like once in a hundred games, you should want to win way more than that.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2016-02-04T21:26:31.743+0000","up_votes":72,"down_votes":1,"body":"announcer: \"ace\"\n\n4 recalls. *facedesk*","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2016-02-04T22:36:16.841+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} - \"Um guys?Shouldn't we push down some towers or get drag?\"\n{{champion:51}} - \"Nah,those can wait.I got to finish my {{item:3072}}.\"\n{{champion:201}} - \"But....but\"\n{{champion:11}} - \"Chill buddy,we'll get them next time.\"\n{{champion:268}} - \"And they'll be back in 30 seconds.That's certainly not enough time to do anything.\"\n{{champion:201}} - \\*sees 2 half health towers with ally minions attacking them* \"Ugh,I wish I was Trist right now.\"\n{{champion:14}} - \"The fuck are you idiots doing?!?!!?I didn't die to get you guys to fill your item slot faster.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-05T03:23:59.907+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how it's the tanks that care about objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-02-05T05:43:37.949+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's true, you know.

I'm going to hit that surrender button because I know the game is already lost because my teammates either didn't want to win or they're just too prideful and there's nothing I can do.
