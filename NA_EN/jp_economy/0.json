The fact that there is no sightstone or upgraded support items (i.e. face of the mountain) leaves tanky supports, even other supports in general, close to useless. A primary job for a support is to ward the map and control vision. It takes about 10 minutes to even get an item that will allow you to ward and a ton of your gold in order to do so. There needs to be some kind of compensation for these changes or support players will be left feeling useless until changes are made. Ask any support main how they feel right now and they will tell you that these changes are not just different they are for the worse.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2018-01-25T01:10:30.184+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":5,"body":"I mean, I'm 99% certain I'm gonna be downvoted, but I kinda like them. because I don't need a sightstone, I can save a bit of gold and buy an actual tank item. bonus points if I took inspiration for the gold efficiency.\n\nplus I get a bit of build leniency, because since its a quest thing:\n\n1) I no longer have to rush it and give up something I can totally use\n2) ADC dosent have to worry about me giving up vision for a bit extra poke\n3) everyone gets it at about roughly the same time, so the enemy would have just as much vision as I do early on\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lexanomical Unit","date":"2018-01-25T01:43:27.296+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sightstone itself isn't my issue.

Tank items for support is usually benefitial only on early stages of the game. it helps you stand in the lane if your ADC is noob.  \n\nSupport needs to concentrate on speed and active skills items most of the time.

Now only {{item:3107}} left and since there is no way to decrease CDR of this item anymore it is not so useful anymore.. \n\nThe rune tree is also crap.. As support you cant have items CDR, hexaflash and ult cooldowns in the same rune tree.

(Yes, Rito had publicly stated multiple times that not buying Sightstone on support is a punishable offense.)\n\nWell guess what: they didn't fix the problem AT ALL.  I still had a support who openly and LOUDLY refused to upgrade their support item for the sole and intentional purpose of not having it evolve into Sightstone.  Matter of fact, halfway through the game they just straight-up sold it, gimping their residual gold-gain as well.  Sightstone is a FREE evolution out of an item that you WANT to buy on support and players are still INTENTIONALLY refusing to buy Sightstone even after Rito made it FREE.\n\nThat aside, let's not forget the old adage: you can lead a support to wards, but you can't make them ward.  Rito can hand supports a free Sightstone, but they can't make them use it.  FFS, we can't even get people to use their damned free yellow trinkets, they spend all game sitting on 2 free wards and end with a vision score of ZERO.  Did Rito really think it would be any different for supports?  This doesn't even count as a band-aid fix, Rito is just rubbing some spit and dirt on a broken leg and pretending that'll fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Don Lupus","date":"2018-01-25T16:44:33.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first sight, the change is good, as you don't have to buy sightstone early.
