His Q is the only real source of skill expression in his kit. And to top t off he&rsquo;s either this oppressive Monsterous juggernaut that heals through all of your damage or he&rsquo;s reminded with a swift kick to the ribs that grevious wounds exists, and without healing mundo really has only one ability (being his Q) to make him... Mundo.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser, oh boy. Easily the worst gameplay update. They fixed up his numbers but that&rsquo;s all. No CC, no utility except for an delayed Heal that&rsquo;s unreliable, MORE bugs, and a kit that&rsquo;s just all over the place since Riot tried to force him bot. Shared exp, a buddy system W, having more burst in the third Q, a dragon, and did I mention MORE bugs? \r\n\r\nTl:DR I think Mundo needs it more but Morde deserves it more.","replies":[]}
