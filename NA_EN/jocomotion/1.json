So even though he&#039;s actually at a balanced spot at the moment, we&#039;re going to give him buffs in the hopes that he&#039;ll be played to make the game more exciting to watch.\n\n{{champion:114}} \nPassive - Duelist&#039;s Dance\nVITAL HEALING 25-110 &rArr; 35-110\nQ - Lunge\nBUGFIX Lunge will once again correctly prioritize champions and vital procs over killable minions.\n\n* Fiora&#039;s win rate dropped suddenly, and since she&#039;s always been one of the favored champions here at Riot we&#039;ve decided to give her an small immediate buff, and a quality of life change that we should have done WAY earlier. Woops.\n\n{{champion:121}} \nPassive - Unseen Threat\nBONUS ATTACK DAMAGE RATIO 0.2 &rArr; 0.4\nW - Void Spike\nEVOLVED NON-ISOLATED SLOW 40% &rArr; 60%\nEVOLVED ISOLATED SLOW 80% &rArr; 90%\n\n* Kha&#039;zix is, despite the ult nerf that we&#039;ll totally use to justify this, at a pretty balanced spot at the moment, buuuuuut we also want to see him played in the LCS because he&#039;s exciting and exciting = profit. So we&#039;re buffing him. \n\n{{champion:60}} \nW - Skittering Frenzy\nCOOLDOWN 12 seconds &rArr; 10 seconds\nE - Rappel\nCOOLDOWN 26/24/22/20/18 seconds &rArr; 22/21/20/19/18 seconds\n(Note: I don&#039;t even have to try on this one, they literally wrote it for me)\n\n* &quot;Elise used to dominate the early game and facilitate aggressive plays across the map. We want to bring that back, so we&rsquo;re decreasing the cooldown on some of her playmaking tools so she can more frequently seek out risky opportunities to dominate her opponents&quot;. Like she didn&#039;t even need the buff, she was actually balanced... WHY?\n\n{{champion:59}} \nPassive - Martial Cadence\nNEW Martial Cadence now has a visual effect indicating its per target cooldown\nPER TARGET COOLDOWN 10/8/6 at levels 1/7/13 &rArr; 6 at all levels\nBUGFIX Tiamat passive will now consistently work when hitting a target with Martial Cadence\n\n* Hey, look! I&#039;m starting to see a trend.... Exciting champion who&#039;s already fairly balanced and around mid tier gets buffed for no reason except the fact that they&#039;re not picked as often as riot would like! Yaaaaaaay.\n\n{{champion:20}} \nQ - Consume\nHEALING RATIO 0.5 ability power &rArr; 0.70 ability power\nBUGFIX Tooltip now accurately reflects how much healing Nunu and Willump get from champions\nE - Snowball Barrage\nMAX 9 SNOWBALL HIT ABILITY POWER RATIO 0.45 ability power &rArr; 0.54 ability power\nWILLUMP&rsquo;S TURN (ROOT DAMAGE) 0.5 ability power &rArr; 0.8 ability power\nW - Biggest Snowball Ever!\nNEW Willumps transition to walking after he finishes rolling his snowball will now feel smoother.\n\n* We&#039;re fixing up Nunu with some quality of life changes, as well as some buffs to his AP ratio&#039;s since even AP nunu was dealing the least damage unless vigorously fed. No joke here, he needs these QOL changes and buffs\n\n{{champion:40}} \nPassive - Tailwind\nBONUS MOVESPEED CONVERSION TO DAMAGE 15/25/35% at levels 1/7/13 &rArr; 25/35% at levels 1/10\n\n* Janna, like Fiora, is a champion we show blatant favoritism toward in terms of balancing. So now that she&#039;s just barely below average we can buff her!\n\n{{champion:412}} \nQ - Death Sentence\nMANA COST 80 &rArr; 60\nCOOLDOWN 20/18/16/14/12 &rArr; 16/15/14/13/12\n\n* Thresh is  one of the few tanky champions who we&#039;d love to see in the LCS. So, lets just put it in quotes at this point &quot;we decided to needlessly buff him even though he&#039;s at a good spot in terms of balance&quot;. This buff in particular will make it so professional players are more willing to just throw out random hooks without fear of those pesky cooldowns or mana consumption. Who&#039;d want a very calculated, percise hook to make a well executed madlife pick when Thresh could simply throw them willy nilly blindly like me when I decided to work on my aim in archery.\n\n{{champion:555}} \nR - Death From Below\nBASE DAMAGE (BREAKS EVEN AT LEVEL 11) 200 / 250 / 300 / 350 / 400 / 450 / 475 / 500 / 525 / 550 / 575 / 590 / 605 &rArr; 250 / 290 / 330 / 370 / 410 / 450 / 475 / 500 / 525 / 550 / 575 / 590 / 605\n\n* &quot;we decided to needlessly buff him even though he&#039;s at a good spot in terms of balance&quot;. That 50 extra base damage will make it so Pyke will greedily go for kills more often in the early game. Since 50 extra true damage in the early game is the difference between one shotting someone at half health, and someone barely surviving a clutch play. Ignore the people saying one shot&#039;s aren&#039;t fun to watch! One shots **are** fun to watch, and if you disagree you&#039;re wrong!\n\n{{champion:223}} \nBase Stats\nHEALTH 610 &rArr; 540\nHEALTH GROWTH 95 &rArr; 102\nW - Devour\nBUGFIX Allies Tahm Kench has devoured will no longer sometimes be targetable when first swallowed.\n\n* Unlike thresh, Tahm Kench is a champion we **DON&#039;T** want to see played. So even though he&#039;s a pretty weak support at the moment we&#039;ll be nerfing him in secret, and covering said nerf up with a bugfix that really shoulda been implemented on release, and reasoning that&#039;s barely trying to cover up the truth.\n\n{{champion:96}} \nBase Stats\nMOVEMENT SPEED 325 &rArr; 330\nR - Living Artillery\nRANGE 1200 / 1500 / 1800 &rArr; 1300 / 1550 / 1800\n\n* We&#039;re buffing Kog&#039;maw because we know that he&#039;s pretty easily blown up and unreliable. ~~And if we nerfed him when he finally started to get a little better players would be onto us~~. So we&#039;re giving him tiny buff so he won&#039;t show up in LCS, but he also won&#039;t be soooooo weak against assassins.\n\n{{item:3151}} \nABILITY POWER 80 &rArr; 75\nTorment:\nDOT AGAINST NON IMPAIRED TARGETS 1% Max HP per second &rArr; 1.5% Max HP per second\nDOT AGAINST IMPAIRED TARGETS 2% Max HP per second &rArr; 2.5% Max HP per second\n\n* Again, we really, REALLY don&#039;t want tanks here. So we&#039;re buffing Liandry&#039;s juuuuust enough to be a more viable anti-tank item, while making sure people like space aids or flame boi over there can&#039;t abuse it by giving it...... 5 less AP. YOU&#039;RE WELCOME! (you all know who I&#039;m talking about.)","replies":[]}
