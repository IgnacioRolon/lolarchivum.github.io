I was 2nd pick on red team, and was hovering shyvana, enemy team first picks maokai then our tristana instalocks then it briefly switches to me then it hovers tristana (who already locked in) and I was unable to lock in shyvana. Eventually the timer ran out and never switched back to me and forced me to dodge the game, as I could not lock in my pick.\n\nStep by step:\n1. Enemy team picks maokai.\n2. Our first pick is tristana who basically locked in very fast.\n3. The client switches to me for a brief second like I'm supposed to pick.\n4. The client then quickly switched back to tristana as if she's still picking and won't let me lock in.\n5. Eventually the timer ran out and forced me to dodge.","replies":[]}
