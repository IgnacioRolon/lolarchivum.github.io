I understand that these ideas may be late since riot may already be on the brink of releasing him but then they could use the ideas for another champion. I've decided Ao Shin should be an ap tank.\r\n\r\nAnd here we go:\r\n\r\nRange: 150 (Melee)\r\n**Passive**: Favor of the Wind- All enemies who auto attack Ao Shin are slowed by the wind. They are slowed by 14/16/18/20% at levels 1/7/12/17.\r\nNotes: This allows Ao Shin to not easily be kited and get to the ad carries.\r\n\r\n**Q**: Clearing Breeze- Ao Shin sends out a breath of air that explodes upon hitting an enemy, slowing the initial targetand revealing the area. If it doesn't hit a target it explodes at max range anyways.\r\nNotes: This is Ao Shin's gateway to ranged poke and also allows him to gain vision without \"face checking\".\r\n\r\n**W**: Righteous Force- Passive: The longer Ao Shin stays in combat the less he is affected by cc. Reaching a maximum of 10% cc reduction (not including airborne cc).\r\nActive: Once he reaches maximum cc reduction he may activate this ability. Ao Shin clears away all cc on him and gains 5/10/15/20/25% movement speed. The passive bonus is lost on CD.\r\nNotes: Helps him get to the carries and less easy to lockdown. This makes it clear: If he's not tanky blow him up immediately or if he is tanky don't waste your cc on him.\r\n\r\n**E**: Maim- Ao Shin strikes an enemy with a deadly blow, stunning them for .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds, dealing magic damage, and making them bleed for 5 seconds.\r\nNotes:Gives him the cc every tank needs and another source of damage.\r\n\r\n**R**: Conquering Storm- Ao Shin calls upon the winds to surround him and creates a great storm around him for 5 seconds. Allies including Ao Shin in the zone have their movement speed increased by 20% and take 10% reduce damage(reduced damage may be unnecessary). Enemies in the zone are slowed by 20% and take magic damage every second. At the end lightning strikes all enemy champions and stunning them for .5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2015-03-26T00:28:04.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see I'm getting down voted :) I'd like to see you people come up with champion kits that actually make sense instead of being a senseless moron who down votes","replies":[]},{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2015-03-25T22:48:33.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bump\n\nAlso ideally Ao Shin's kit could be used in situations such as: No vision of enemy team, q to baron check. Enemy team is doing baron you then walk towards the pit with your team then ult when you get close. Maim one of the carries and try to do as much damage to them as possible.","replies":[]}]}
