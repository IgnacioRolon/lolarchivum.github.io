It will be interesting to see what happens with this thread.\r\n\r\nReddit thread- https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6cxdi6/the_guys_from_riot_anticheat_just_temporarily/\r\n\r\nThe main details are that someone made a reddit thread about a Rioter that posted a warning on a scripting forums that people using that script would get banned. It was originally thought to be a troll post but people who started playing with this scripting service received almost immediate bans.  You guys can read the reddit thread for more details.\r\n\r\nIt remains unclear whether this was a direct action approved by riot, or the lone vigilante rioter taking action on his own, but it does seem like riot is cracking down on scripting, and it seems like scripting may be dead in only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think? Will scripting die in the near future or will it never die?","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-05-24T02:49:15.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wont stop.
