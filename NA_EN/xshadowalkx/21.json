While certainly, crit adcs may be in a bad state, Kog sits barely above a 1% play rate and has about a 46% win rate. This isn&#039;t the lowest win rate thanks to champions nerfed for the LCS like Azir, Ryze, Ornn, and Gnar, but Kog&#039;Maw was never nerfed for the LCS, he is just plain bad no matter what level of play he is played at.\r\n  Kog&#039;Maw&#039;s current state of being bad is a combination of many changes that ended up indirectly nerfing him to his current abysmal state. The buffs to crit items won&#039;t help Kog&#039;Maw at all and I am worried he will stay this way.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of Runes Reforged Kog&#039;Maw lost his most valuable keystone, fervor of battle, while other champions, like assassins, gained more powerful keystones (TLD to Electrocute). While lethal tempo may look nice initially, once you see it takes 1.5 seconds to activate while assassins have higher burst than before, it seems like a miracle to survive 1.5 seconds in a fight. If bone plating was a keystone option for Kog, it would be 10x more useful than lethal tempo. Kog benefits very little from new runes and gets bursted much faster than before.\r\n\r\nAnother issue were the marksmen nerfs. All adcs had their armor reduced. Now Kog is even easier to oneshot. Also riot buffed a lot of other adcs to make up for the nerfs but never included Kog in those buffs.\r\n\r\nAlso, champions like Kai&#039;sa and Varus were abusing Kog&#039;s one core item, rageblade. Instead of nerfing those 2 champions, riot nerfs rageblade instead, which was almost the final nail in the coffin for Kog. \r\n\r\nThe FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN for Kog was the enchanter nerfs. Riot nerfed all the enchanter items that increased heal and shield strength while also reducing the duration of many shields. The most significant part of this change isn&#039;t that Kog&#039;Maw has weaker heals and shields to protect him, it&#039;s that now Kog&#039;Maw has NO SHIELDS OR HEALS TO PROTECT HIM AT ALL. These enchanter nerfs pushed protective supports entirely out of meta so that damage supports fill the bot lane. Now Kog can&#039;t even survive 2v2 bot lane, much less a team fight. The only way I see Kog being viable again would be if riot massively over buffed his passive which is basically his main source of damage at this point. Anytime I see a Kog nowadays I feel like 99% of the damage I take from him is his passive bomb after I oneshot him.\r\n\r\nRIP Kog&#039;Maw. I really enjoyed playing you, you little stomach acid spitting team shredding ugly void thingy. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \r\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3073}} {{champion:96}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Swarmer","date":"2018-07-21T17:36:21.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, hes more viable than all adcs except lucian and kaisa, but since anything that is an adc is unviable, i say naah, especially in this 2 seaso long assassin meta","replies":[{"poster":"SugeMinPikk","date":"2018-07-21T19:04:37.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xLd9DJq2l2VFtu/giphy.gif\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3WIiAc6.png[]\n\nStormrazor is a very good item.
