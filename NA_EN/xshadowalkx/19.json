A champion is not broken simply because it had a higher win rate than other champions. There are many factors involved in win rate. -Riot\n\n  Riot has been wrong so many times. I understand that if a champion has a lower play rate and a high win rate there's a chance that it is just a slight anomaly, but when a champion is in 1/20th of games and wins 57% of them several patches in a row it's no anomaly at all. \n  I'm talking about ivern in the example above. I'm going to explain build paths and win rate. Basically, anyone who builds cinder hulk on ivern will only win 45% of the time, this is because cinderhulk is a bad item on him, you can buy much more cost efficient items. \n\n  Ivern's high win rate comes from when you build support items like redemption, athenes, and locket on him. In fact, you win 62% of games with these 3 items. When combined with ardent censor this increases to a WHOPPING 68% WIN RATE. Why?\n\nCost efficiency and gold income. These items are completely balanced on support champions that have lower gold income. However, ivern has super high gold income as a jungler. He buys these items faster than any other support and then, he becomes better than your support. \n\nHere I am presenting to the 2 different win rate statistics: overall win rate and play style win rate. \n\nOverall win rate- a champions win rate over all games played. Is typically a bad statistic since low play rate could spike it or could be lower since lots of inexperienced players use the champion with the wrong playstyle/build.\n\nPlay style win rate- the win rate of a champion when used and built properly. \n\nExample of overall and play style win rate: Last season, sated devourer with guinsoos rageblade was broken on master yi. This combination of items had almost a 60% win rate. However, mosy players actually still built warrior on yi which only had about a 45% win rate. This brought his overall win rate down and made him look balanced.\n\nTLDR; overall win rate doesn't matter, what matters is the win rate of a champion when played properly (with a specific build).\n\nMost statistics from www.lolalytics.com","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-03-20T15:08:06.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tldr","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-03-20T15:11:06.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He says that Ivern has a win rate of 68% with 4 specific items.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-03-20T15:20:14.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So nerf Ivern?","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-03-20T15:37:33.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's what he's saying.

I don't understand what's logical in your reasoning. First of all, theses statistics are platinum+ statistics. In your \"logic\" you said that you don't see people playing ivern and he doesn't seem that op and you shouldn't lose to him, despite the fact you don't even play close to platinum. Logically mejai's is a snowball item that people buy when they are super fed, so of course it has a high winrate on ahri, it's not some absurd stupid thing. I don't understand what your \"logic\" is. I also mentioned that ivern has had a high win rate for several patches, so therefore it's invalid to say it is some sort of statistical win rate outlier due to low playrate like elixir of wrath skarner, In fact elixir of wrath skarner only happens 0.759% of the time while the ivern build wih a 68% win rate happens 2% of games or 1 every 50 games, which a lot considering the hundreds of thousands of ranked games that occur weekly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-03-21T11:03:28.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was sort of on board with your points until you brought another person's rank into the discussion.
