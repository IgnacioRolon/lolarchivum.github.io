Then I looked at the ranked reset part and was like F***. I'm currently D3 and have spent so much effort climbing there, it's the highest rank I've ever been. I actually reached D3 AFTER lp gains were fixed by riot and now I'm going to get demoted to D4 0 lp. Can you guys not just reset the players who got there before the lp changes?","replies":[{"poster":"StSnowball","date":"2019-03-09T21:06:48.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're just going to be dropped a division, i saw you're in d3, do you'll be put in d4. it's to fix the whole ranked system and to hopefully remove the people that are currently ruining high elo, back to where they belong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siyou","date":"2019-03-09T19:57:55.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably to offset the miserable mess of the lower ranks","replies":[]}]}
