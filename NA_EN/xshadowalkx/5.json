There is no sarcasm. I have had better results on climbing these past few days by banning out champions on my team than by banning any \"op\" champion that I might not want to play against. First of all, I don't ban my team's champions out of spite, I ban it using logic and statistics. One of the red flags I look at is if my team hovers a super low win rate champion (this includes Yuumi, Azir, Irelia, Aatrox, Akali, and even Ezreal, with a few others) I will immediately look them up on op.gg. I don't immediately ban out because first of all, I understand that the champion may have a low win rate, but they might be good at the champion, as well as the fact that they might be a Smurf. I look at their match history and win rate with the champion and then use that to determine if I will ban out their champion. For example, I had a person hover Yuumi, that had played Yuumi for the past 5 games for the first time with a 0% win rate and 10+ deaths each game. I immediately banned out their Yuumi and they chose a different support and performed much better than their past 5, 10+ death, Yuumi games. Meanwhile, I see that my Irelia is actually really good and has a 55% win rate then I don't ban it. My reasoning behind this is that there isn't a guarantee someone on the enemy team will pick an \"op\" hard to play against champion, but there is a guarantee my team will pick a bad champion and feed if I don't ban it out. I'm sorry that this sounds really toxic to you guys but it's been so much more effective in helping me climb. Bad team mates have always felt like a bigger factor in losing than \"op\" enemy champions, and this strategy has helped me win more games.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2019-09-20T19:38:37.412+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"That would immediately be met with a report from me.

Does he ban the champion his teammate is hovering? because then i can guarantee you that this will backfire more times than payoff. Simply because his teammate who doesn't know op, is judging op by being a troll who does it on purpose. therefore when one simple thing goes wrong that guy will tilt into hell. Decreasing the winchance and doing well as a individual. At least this is what happens at euw here","replies":[{"poster":"True Garen","date":"2019-09-22T08:07:18.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skýcrow,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OrPh8VLv,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-09-21T19:18:15.245+0000)\n>\n> it depends what op means anyways.

If he checks all of his teammates records and sees that the chance of losing appears to be rather high with a certain champion, and they also feed... so, he isn't really probably losing much even if they trolled the game after that. And he might even have a good match.\n\nHe basically bans the worst teammate's worst champion. Sometimes.\n\nI'm not saying that I agree with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-09-20T19:50:28.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"and this is why i never hover.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShyImagoghnar","date":"2019-09-20T20:25:55.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"well yea\nop.gg your teammates and ban their bad champions\ntry to manipulate them into playing champions they're good at\ndodge if 2 or more of your teammates are off-role or on losing streaks\ndodge if a single person is on a losing streak on the champion they picked \netc.\n\nthe only way for you to be the deciding factor in a game is for the rest of your team to have about a 50/50 chance of winning ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Düff McWhalen","date":"2019-09-20T19:13:14.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Perfect logic.
