However, to my dismay, I e&#039;ed into the middle of the enemy team and was unable to activate my ult (note: I couldn&#039;t even ACTIVATE it, so please don&#039;t tell me you can&#039;t move during katarina ult, I have lvl 4 mastery). I was confused and didn&#039;t know what happened since I had played katarina earlier and been able to ult. I quickly realized I hadn&#039;t fed my poro so i fed him. Amazingly, I was able to ult after I fed my poro (with poro snax) but it took me a while to figure that out so I was pretty useless by then and we lost. I think riot should fix this just in case you forget to feed your poro and want to ult when you see a perfect pentakill oppurtunity.\r\n\r\nHow to replicate bug: Go into a Legend of the Poro King game. Play Katarina. While in game don&#039;t feed your poro and get to lvl 6. Once you reach lvl 6 approach an enemy champion and attempt to ult. 10/10 you will be unable to ult until you feed your poro.\r\n\r\nI have not yet tested this in ARAM yet but they bug might be an issue there too.","replies":[{"poster":"Seriphym","date":"2015-12-16T00:55:43.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Kat in ARAM Poro King match and have never suffered from this issue.\n\nI also never feed my poro so I don't know what your issues was.","replies":[{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2015-12-16T12:03:29.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seriphym,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=xLsQXZ29,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-16T00:55:43.519+0000)\n>\n> I play Kat in ARAM Poro King match and have never suffered from this issue.\n> \n> I also never feed my poro so I don't know what your issues was.\n\n  If you ult right before you die (as in your ult animation starts but you don't begin channeling) your ult goes on cooldown and doesn't show you unless you fed your poro. This only seems to happen in aram.","replies":[{"poster":"Seriphym","date":"2015-12-16T23:24:02.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by \"and doesn't show you\"?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FacerollKatarina","date":"2015-12-14T01:41:56.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ult just before you died before that?

However no enemy champions were nearby and I couldn't ult when I pressed it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darkmatchwaldo","date":"2015-12-13T22:58:34.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the morale of the story?
