Then this happened. \r\n\r\n[Me In The Center](http://imgur.com/a/dNoFr)\r\n\r\nBasically I&#039;ve Come to Understand serveral things about the boards from reading through it for the first time in years.\r\n\r\n1. Flame Riot--This company has only made ~~one of~~ THE most successful online game in the world. To make a post popular you just need to rant on the forums to express you hatred at this company  ~~since you are hardstuck in low elo since you are a noob that sucks at video games~~ for screwing up the game and nerfing your favorite champions and making other onese overpowered as fuck and hard to play against.\r\n\r\n2. Hate specific champions--A very original thread topic. You must express you hatred towards specific champions, to confirm you are not ~~the only noob~~ skilled player that is experiencing feelings of frustration towards specific champions. It doesn&#039;t matter that you are the 10th of 12th person to make a thread about why you hate all the meta sheep that are playing vladimir nonstop and losing or players that annoy you by outplaying you on shaco because ~~you don&#039;t understand how he even works~~ of how overpowered he is, what truly matters is that you create a hate thread towards a champion and have others support your hate so you can try to reach out to Riot and clearly convince them something is unbalanced ~~even though you are just a bronze player and balance is geared toward platinum and above~~.\r\n\r\n3. Opinions&gt;Statistics--Statistics don&#039;t matter at all. What matters is how you feel and statistics should only come into play when they support your opinions. Jhin, Lucian and Ezreal are obviously the best adc&#039;s! I see them every game!!!! Other adc&#039;s like twitch are balanced because all he does is ~~become almost undetectable for 14 seconds and delete entire enemy teams with his ultimate~~ auto attack and press e. No way jhin has a 48% win rate!!! He is so broken, which is why I play him all the time!!! I lose because ~~I suck at league~~ I get bad teams!!!\r\n\r\n4. It&#039;s Full of Kids--There&#039;s supposed to be an age limit of 13 for playing league but I for certain can say a lot of people here don&#039;t even have the mental maturity of a 10 year old. I&#039;m going to count all the downvotes to get an accurate statistic on the population of 12 year olds on this forums.\r\n\r\nSorry if you are a low-elo scrub and you disagree with me because you are obviously so much better than league at me and know so much more.","replies":[{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2017-03-21T01:28:35.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've counted one so far.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxicate13","date":"2017-03-21T02:16:17.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, I upvoted it for you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-03-21T01:31:14.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ooh.

I also have a habit of upvoting any posts that have 0 upvotes, to create a positive atmosphere for relevant discussion instead of a cockfest.","replies":[{"poster":"XShadowAlkX","date":"2017-03-22T10:40:47.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Capn Evan,realm=EUW,application-id=bzRrPGQO,discussion-id=PEkQVbzF,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-03-22T04:23:05.059+0000)\n>\n> You should chill.
