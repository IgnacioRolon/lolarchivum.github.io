Had a very toxic team how do you deal with a duo top (when you have a jung) that thinks they're pro for winning a 2v1 lane and is extremely toxic to us for losing 2v1 lanes (when we're the 1). It didn't help one of the people I was laning against was a blitzcrank. i'm good at dodging rocket grabs but I cant dodge every single one. (as a matter of fact I only got pulled 2 times the entire game). They never helped out in a single team fight.","replies":[]}
