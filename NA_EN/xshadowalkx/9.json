The akali was on our team and rumble was on the enemy team. Whenever akali used w then rumble ulted the rumble ult was invisible. This bug caused us caused us to die from rumble ult twice since we couldn&#039;t see the ult and we walked all over it. This is a very game breaking bug if rumble and akali are in the same game, as the enemy team can potentially die form an invisible rumble ult without knowing it.","replies":[]}
