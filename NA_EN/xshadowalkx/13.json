Wow. Riot says make sure you have 40 minutes of playtime and I did but nooooo Riot bans you for leaving a game 25 minutes longer than the average time that they say to make sure you have time for. I mean if a game lasts an entire day and someone who has a life has to leave and gets banned? Riot needs to set a limit before you get banned, like you play 45 minutes and you won't get banned since you did your part and made sure you had the amount of playing time needed.","replies":[]}
