Skarner ult and Tahm W are direct counter examples to your claim.

Skarner q is an exception but none others can do this. The fact is a suppress causes the caster to channel, and if the caster stops channeling then the target is no longer suppressed. ALL channels are canceled by silences but for some reason warwick's ult suppress doesn't stop if hes silenced. Therefore his ult IS BUGGED as the suppress SHOULD stop, but it doesn't. Please tell me that skarner's ult doesn't stop suppressing after skarner dies. Oh wait it does stop suppressing after skarner dies? If you think that warwick's ult isnt bugged then you are awfully wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"M0b1us","date":"2015-12-21T23:22:04.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XShadowAlkX,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=QrpEdy0P,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-21T20:25:30.595+0000)\n>\n> I'm sorry, I shouldn't have tried to argue with a little kid who always thinks they're right.
