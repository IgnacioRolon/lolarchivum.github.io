This guy (and yeti) is(/are) currently sitting at a 57% win rate (58% if you build cinderhulk). I feel like this is a pretty good indicator of how strong nunu is right now. Though some of you might disagree with this, at this point nunu probably needs a nerf.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that having a high win rate isn&#039;t the reason nunu needs a nerf, its the factors that contribute to his high win rate that are why nunu needs a nerf.\r\n\r\nThese factors would include:\r\n-Can easily take objectives\r\n-Extreme tankiness\r\n-High utility (gives adc 1 free attack speed item)\r\n-Strong counter jungling ability\r\n-Fast movespeed (has one of the highest base ms in the game along with his q and w giving him bonus ms)\r\n\r\nObviously, nunu is not without his weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThese include:\r\n-No hard cc (less gank potential)\r\n-Can&#039;t pressure objectives or counter jungle if enemy team has lane pressure and vision and reacts quickly when nunu does something.\r\n\r\nHis weaknesses are easily abuseable by a well coordinated team, which is why he&#039;s not often seen in the LCS. However, in the environment known as solo queue, people are less likely to be proactive, allowing nunu to freely take objectives and easily counter jungle.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that the majority of the time, nunu&#039;s strengths heavily outweigh his weaknesses, contributing to his high win rate. This creates a problematic champion that there&#039;s not much an individual player can do against.\r\n\r\nThere can even be times when your team can&#039;t do anything. When the one teams lanes are being pressured and nunu counterjungles, teams can&#039;t risk reacting because they are pushed under tower and risk losing tons of minions and turret health to help the jungler.\r\n\r\nTo end this off, I&#039;m probably making a thread that many people will disagree with. Nunu only has a 4% ban rate, which means the majority of players don&#039;t see him as a problem. However, as a diamond 5 jungle main, I see nunu as a big problem, that riot certainly needs to nerf soon.","replies":[{"poster":"J4 Ulted Mexico","date":"2017-07-02T02:51:44.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing against him is pretty awful.

Yes, now nunu has a 47% win rate. Also, please improve your English skillis, your post is almost unreadable.","replies":[{"poster":"pro rusher 2","date":"2017-10-16T07:11:19.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying he guy who wasso toxic, that his comment was taken down in his own thread.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hallbuster","date":"2017-07-02T02:40:36.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Time to abuse this guy for freelo.","replies":[]}]}
