And other stuff.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":103,"down_votes":9,"body":"I realize games are usually FF@20 now, but lets say, hypothetically, a game went long.  So long, in fact, that players were reaching full build.  Or even just &quot;need every slot but not quite complete items&quot; build.\r\n\r\nAt that point in the game, pink wards no longer exist.  It&#039;s like a timer.  Used to be, one or two people could upgrade their trinket and have a pink available to help with (insert reason to see invis champs here).  Heck, even sweeper could be used in a fight.  But now?  Now all invisible champions/abilities have a new hidden power:  They become undetectable late-game.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple solution, of course:  Item slot #8:  Ward Slot.  If you feel that a slot just to hold pink wards is a bad idea, then you could do one of these things:\r\n\r\n1. Reinstate green wards since, PLEASE REINSTATE GREEN WARDS. Then the slot could hold pink or green.\r\n2. Allow the slot to hold any of these: {{item:2043}} {{item:2049}} {{item:2045}} \r\n3. Give us the ability to make the Vision Ward upgrade trinket again, so we could choose between:  {{item:3362}} {{item:3340}} {{item:3363}} {{item:3341}} {{item:3364}} \r\n\r\nOn a very related note, there is a reason to keep {{item:3340}} over {{item:3363}} -- you can teleport to the wards, and they are harder to destroy.  However, there is no reason to keep {{item:3341}} over {{item:3364}}.  I mean, would you like to detect a much smaller area for a shorter duration, or would you like to pay exactly nothing and detect a huge area that moves with you and lasts 50% longer?  The choice is yours!  Why not make the un-upgraded one actually useful.  For instance, it could fully reveal invisible units in the area?  It&#039;s duration could increase with level to be even longer than the oracle upgrade (since it is stationary).  It&#039;s cooldown could be dramatically reduced.\r\n\r\nTLDR:  The vision situation sucks right now.  Please do something to help alleviate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Virgin Ray","date":"2015-12-17T15:11:44.377+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Support ward here, ward there, ward baron, ward dragon.
