However, it seems like memes are consistently up-voted or &quot;hot&quot; for whatever reason. The result is that the boards home is basically the meme board with a couple other posts mixed in.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to give us a config page where we could uncheck boards in which we have no interest? It is ok with me if I never see a meme on my boards home. I&#039;m sure there are other players with no interest in various other boards that would also appreciate this feature.\r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"ZGM Dazzling","date":"2015-05-04T20:42:12.061+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda tired of the hot page bieng filled with memes too, their fun and all but the important stuff is getting blocked out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reaper Soraka","date":"2015-05-04T20:46:36.652+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to filter out the memes and team recruitment sections of the boards, they're not very interesting to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-05-04T19:03:00.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm okay with memes, but I hate seeing \"new\" full of LFG posts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"brad","date":"2015-05-05T19:10:54.707+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know its out of control when you hit control f and find 21 threads from that board on the front page","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenjirio","date":"2015-05-05T14:38:57.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support this so much","replies":[]},{"poster":"Collapser","date":"2015-05-05T00:17:38.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2015-05-07T18:27:27.200+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Nebuul,\n\nThis sort of thing, opting in and out of what you see on the homepage, has been on our radar for a while.

Like maybe only let players of a certain rank post to it.. but not show their rank.  That way you could look at the stuff the higher ranked people were saying,  but it wouldn't necessarily create a place where people could go to laugh at bronzies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blueberrypancake","date":"2015-05-05T14:32:41.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"but...
