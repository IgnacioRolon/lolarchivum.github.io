Start at chickens. You should be able to buy your jungle item after red buff. But the catch is that with hunters potion start, you will never have to back for purchasing the entire game until you want an elixir.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2017-10-19T10:05:06.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea.
