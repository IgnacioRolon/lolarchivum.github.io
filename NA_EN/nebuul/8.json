I have to say, after seeing how fluid it is to cast Viktor&#039;s laser vs the irritation I still feel at casting her W, please make W a vector-cast spell.  I appreciate that you tried something new, but it is the wrong decision.  Please change it to cast like every other directional ability in the game:  Make it vector-cast.  The double-click thing is disruptive and unintuitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Yosuke Apperu","date":"2016-05-26T06:49:09.702+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if they could just make things like that optional.","replies":[{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2016-05-26T17:01:48.758+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why SMARTCASTING requires two button inputs is what drives me off the wall.
