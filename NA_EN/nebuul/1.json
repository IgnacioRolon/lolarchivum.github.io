Sometimes, Sion just cannot knock the small monsters through the large red brambleback.  He stops their movement and the 3rd little monster won&#039;t be hit.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-12-08T19:40:13.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to get this bug to occur, do you maybe have video or gif confirmation or specific repro steps for me? E'ing the small monsters through the large monster worked for me every time so it's possible the repro is more complicated. gif/video proves the existence immediately even if we don't have repro steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2015-12-10T07:11:16.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, here is a video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mcPb22G1y_Y\n\nIt appears that the bug only exists for the red-side brambleback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nebuul","date":"2015-12-08T19:50:58.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll see if I can get that nvidia thing to work to record it.\n\nOr would a replay work if I used the lolreplay thing?
