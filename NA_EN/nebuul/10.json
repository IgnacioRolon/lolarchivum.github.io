It is outranged by every-f&#039;ing-thing.\r\n2. You have a long cooldown. 12 seconds at level 1? Level 1 at 8 seconds would still suck. Level 5 at 8 seconds sucks.\r\n3. You have low damage with a terrible ratio and a long cast time. Seriously, at skill level 1 it actually lowers your DPS to cast it.\r\n4. You can be dodged easily. There is absolutely no reason to have any delay on this ability. If it had a 4 second cooldown? Yeah, sure, the delay would be fair. But every 8 seconds (ok, every 4.8 with 40% CDR...) your opponent gets to dodge your 1 second low-damage slow? Why?!?\r\n5. You are a short-ranged, long-cooldown, low-damage, easily-dodged ability. Fuck you, Q.\r\n\r\nHow much budget is the 1 second slow taking on this ability? Because I find it hard to reconcile a 1 second slow for something with such objectively horrible everything else. Is it the lock-on? Because if you land this slow and then cast W, they will still outrun you. You have to land the E, which locks on anyway, in order to get decent damage in with W.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2017-08-26T14:15:09.994+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be healthier if he could have charges on his Q?","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-08-27T00:08:19.511+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, 1/1/2/2/3 maybe?\n\nThe problem is it's not great lead in and it doesn't really justify being saved for a follow-up.
