Fast forward to around July-ish when I got her, I noticed that those sounds weren&#039;t playing and it&#039;s really tilting me. We&#039;re they removed, is it a bug or a problem with my computer? It&#039;s been an issue for me for quite a few months and I&#039;d really appreciate some clarifications or know if any1 else is having the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-10-10T17:05:47.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nAs others have linked, we are aware of, and fixing the issue.
