He killed it smiteless(not that this should matter per se). He did not get level 2. Why?\r\n\r\nSee the video, nobody else got xp. Yasuo has the purple XP bar that looks to be full up to about 200 xp out of 280 XP. I looked (and in the video) at the twitch poison tick on it appears to actually dissapear at the last second before Red is killed. Are there 2 chunks of EXP involved?\r\n\r\nIf anyone can lend some information this way, it would be great as I frankly do not understand it. I will try to find the replay file to upload itself if you want to check. If you feel this video I linked is not long enough, I could upload more of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T04:14:12.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I'm not sure about how your own game went, but this Yasuo didn't get level two because he didn't have one of the jungle specific items that gives you extra experience. Without that little boost, you won't be able to hit level 2 off one jungle monster.","replies":[]}]}
