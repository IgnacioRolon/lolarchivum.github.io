Like you said;\n\n> Most the time, there isn't a set number, cos Riot wants you to fully reform instead of faking it for a set number of games.\n\nEven if you got Tantram to answer you directly I don't think you're getting more than that. It's not worth pursuing imo, just encourage players to focus on reforming.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-16T13:20:41.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You didn't get a specific answer because there isn't one. Be a sportsmanlike player and you don't have to worry about being punished, and over time your tier will diminish naturally. Playing games and showing reform is the only way to lower it.","replies":[{"poster":"BläckLotus","date":"2016-10-16T13:52:51.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everyone has bad games,riot only needs 3,i cant imagine someone being on the 14 day ban and after it reforming then one day having 3-4 bad games 5 months later and getting perma banned.That doesnt feel right to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-16T13:58:00.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are only provided 3 examples, but that is not the requirement to get punished. It typically takes a lot more than that to trigger a review and punishment (though immediately coming off one punishment you'll be on very thin ice). The more games you play without being negative the farther you get from that. If you play regularly for 5 months showing you've actually reformed there is very little chance that a few bad games will ruin it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-16T13:19:59.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the system sees you as reformed or in the process of reforming adequately then it drops you punishment tiers. You won't know when it happens. Just don't break the summoner's code and you won't have to worry about it.","replies":[]}]}
