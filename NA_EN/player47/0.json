In the game above i played her top lane, and did all of the above. I got an A+. \nAnother thing I&#039;ve heard is to play off meta roles with the champion, so I played her ADC and the second game shown happened.\n\nGame 1 (Top Lane): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/433351032269963265/533706759240417290/unknown.png\nGame 2 (ADC): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/433351032269963265/533699296369836073/unknown.png\n\nI got an A in that game. \nCan someone please explain the grading system to me, I really don&#039;t understand what I have to do to get an S. This is partially a complaint to Riot for not making it clear as to what you have to do for an S and I&#039;m also asking anyone if they actually know anything about this.","replies":[]}
