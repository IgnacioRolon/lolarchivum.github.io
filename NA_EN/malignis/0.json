And then you look at the model and you&#039;re like, why is he so covered up O.o  And then you see his recall animation and you&#039;re like YASSSSSS!!!!! Take it off!!!!!  I have heard many people suggest it but this skin should have a taunt toggle or something added that allows you to remove his jacket.\n\nThis skin is almost perfect.  The animations are stunning, the ult sun(glasses) are adorable. I love the implementation of the life preserver as one of his crystals (this should be a bit bigger though it looks tiny).  But the one big drawback is the jacket.  From any angle aside from facing downward Taric looks super covered up, and this is Taric, probably one of the most vain people in the universe (aside from Aurelion).  He knows he&#039;s gorgeous, he knows he has an amazing body, he would be showing it off at all times in a bathing suit scenario.  Not to mention the fact that he has a flawless tan and wearing a jacket constantly would distort it, thereby distorting his beauty and causing a mental breakdown O.O  (tan lines are evil incarnate)\n\nPerhaps I&#039;m in the minority here but Taric is my favourite eye candy and although I will be buying the skin no matter what, I do think the toggle idea or even just removing the jacket all together would be much more appealing.  When I first saw the art I was crazy excited because the jacket was not the focus and it really showed off Taric&#039;s great body, but the in game model feels like the jacket is the main focus and it&#039;s pretty boring.  Plus having the highlight of your game being when you recall because it is the only time you get to remove that damn jacket covering up your ideal man, it feels bad :&#039;(\n\nFREE the TARIC!!!!! CREATE the TOGGLE!!!\n\nEDIT; We've received an official reply from Riot that they have no intention of creating a toggle despite the voting poll showing vastly in favor.  This thread will now represent the people who want the ugly and hideous and cruel and evil jacket covering our beloved pool party Taric to be removed completely and burned in the fires of righteousness!\n\nPlease feel free to leave your opinions and position on this below.\n\nhttp://grabilla.com/0661d-15b88daa-2fc6-457d-9fa9-986eea0493f3.png","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-29T21:59:14.182+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey folks, \n\nWanted to jump in here since there's been a bunch of talk around Pool Party Taric and him having a toggle for various actions in this skin. \n\nPart of this is due to my less than clear wording on the PBE post - \n\n> **New model and texture:** Lifeguard outfit, complete with a jacket that can be taken off!\n\nBy this, I was referring to - \n\n> **New recall animation:** Taric takes off his jacket and hops into the pool!\n\nI've since updated the post to better reflect what was meant to be said - \n\n> **New model and texture**: Lifeguard outfit! \n\n**The TL;DR is**, I apologize for the poor wording that may have gotten some players' hopes up for a toggle, but we do not have plans to add any sort of toggle for Pool Party Taric.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-06-29T22:57:18.128+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Didn't you guys add a toggle to Night Hunter Rengar with the hood after community feedback though?

On that note what is to stop Taric from just spamming recall and it not being distracting in the EXACT same way? Your logic here is kinda flawed.\n\nI feel like this could have been easily worked into the recall anyways, like the first time you complete the recall Taric's jacket is removed and stays off until you complete the recall again, then it is back on until he recalls again.  That way you could have a consistent changing mechanic that isn't distracting outside of the recall and lets the people buying this skin have their fanservice in a fun way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-07-12T19:16:11.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":";)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malignis","date":"2016-06-29T23:23:23.923+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case is there any chance of the jacket being removed all together?
