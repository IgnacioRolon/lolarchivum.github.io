He is not OP, but he is way too broken to be called \"completely balanced\". He maybe isn't as scary as Blitz or Naut, or as annoying as Sona or Nami, but he is very versatile while being one of the safest bottom-lane bullies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taryn","date":"2015-09-10T16:32:47.765+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Totalis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rqVE9sRH,comment-id=0017,timestamp=2015-09-10T14:11:32.569+0000)\n>\n> Thresh is completely balanced.

Many people I know, myself included, when forced to support go with sona, or braum, or somebody else, anyone but thresh actually. In plat+ most (not all) people will know what they want to play and are good enough with when it comes to the support role when they are forced into it that they won't pick someone like thresh if they arent expecting at least a decent performance with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2015-09-10T21:55:46.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may know many people who won't default to thresh, but having around 6x the ranked pickrate of sona and almost double that of braum means most people still do. Besides, with that high pickrate, it's much harder for thresh mains to outweigh the enormous amount of casual thresh players who may not be good enough to win. Meanwhile, sona mains need six times less wins to affect her winrate as much as thresh mains.\n\nGenerally, when you're forced to play your worse role, you don't exactly get a decent performance with them. Even in plat and diamond, there are usually people who strongly prefer not to play certain roles and do not perform well. In fact, you rarely get forced into a role in plat and diamond because people are somewhat more accommodating.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SociopathFriend","date":"2015-09-10T06:40:01.319+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"I love how nothing whatsoever changes about a champion and they go from \"Fine\" to \"OMG OP this needs nerfed\".","replies":[]}]}
