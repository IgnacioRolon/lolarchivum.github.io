Firstly though remember:\n1. Never try to fix League on a hill.\n2. Make sure you have a lot of room so you don’t run into anything.\n3. Spin around in clockwise circles.\n4. Make up your own League chant.  It should be rhythmical\nand easy to say fast.\n5. Yell your League chant while spinning around in circles.\n6. If you are trying to get rid of your connection to League, spin in counterclockwise circles and say your chant backward.\n\n(Adapted from a guide to preforming a  rain dance)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"foxes303","date":"2015-08-06T01:36:10.672+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey so I know its only been like 2.5 hours and there very well might not be new info, but could we get an update even if its just to say \"nothing new, sorry?\"\n\nMy insecurities want you to confirm that you are still working on this","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuctileChris","date":"2015-08-06T03:18:05.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been four hours *since the last update*, any idea what is going on?\n\nedit: added **","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Foro","date":"2015-08-06T05:14:13.438+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\n\n\nA bit of background - as part of our Riot NA Roadmap, we've brought our Denver location online, with a direct peering port to Comcast in this location.

I think a large part of the problem here is everyone assuming there is a single over-arching issue impacting them when the reality is that there are several discrete ones. Comcast in Colorado is the largest single problem and has forced us to turn down our interconnect with them in that location while they perform repairs and upgrades. The other regions (Virginia for example) look at lot more like local access congestion (peak time lag spikes and packet loss). This type of issue hits services like Netflix etc a lot less as that content can be cached and served to a subscriber from a closer point in the network. The nature of LoL is that it is an interactive real-time game where the server you and 9 other players are on has to be able to talk to you all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Foro","date":"2015-08-06T22:19:36.194+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoners,\n\nWe identified a new issue with our Denver Comcast port around 1:20pm Pacific time - we're working closely with Comcast to get this resolved before the evening.\n\nMore to come, stay posted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Foro","date":"2015-08-06T19:50:54.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoners,\n\nWe've been making some adjustments along with Comcast to try and solve these issues - can affected players via Comcast Denver test and send in their traces?\n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Eglorian","date":"2015-08-06T05:10:10.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nCan you please provide your most recent NetLogs?\n\nThey can be found in X:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Network Logs where \"X\" is the drive where you installed League of Legends.\n\nPlease post them here. \n\nThanks for your help!","replies":[{"poster":"GentleZacharias","date":"2015-08-06T05:36:47.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post how many, exactly?

They're doing their best to help everyone they can, and also, all the hate that's going out to them is unnecessary because in the end it wont help anyone. Second, after I had logged back into LoL to check up on the status, I was able to play again! This ultimately means that Riot is trying very hard to get this dealt with. For those who are still not able to play, I'm sorry but you still need to be patient. I get that it sucks trust me this is happened to me and I even dropped a division, but we just need to forgive and forget.\n\nAlso, thanks to @TraakSC for making this thread and spreading the word about this problem!
