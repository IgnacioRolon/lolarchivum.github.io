Its been about a year since I applied and I still haven't gotten an invitation. Now, in general, I think I'm pretty positive when playing league; although, I have to admit there have been occasions when I get a bit upset. I imagine most people are this way when playing a game they enjoy. I guess I'm a bit skeptical about how Riot chooses people because I have a couple of friends with accounts and they play less and are much more toxic. Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Fires of Justice","date":"2015-09-24T23:14:24.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Snuggly the Crow,\n\nYou've been patient for a long time!  Getting accepted is not a guarantee, and there haven't been specifics about how new members are exactly chosen.  I've heard that they might select players who might have experience or knowledge respective to what's in the patch, like a rework.  Aside from that, there really isn't any other information or way to further expedite an application.  I hope that you can get selected soon, and sorry it's taking so long!","replies":[]}]}
