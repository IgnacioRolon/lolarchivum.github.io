When they reworked him, they made him an anti-magic tank. Then they wanted him to still be able to build a mix of AP and tank, and have good waveclear for midlane, which made him oppressive toplane. He got shifted so he had to build more AP in order to deal the damage they wanted him to do. But he was still dealing too much damage and also too tanky, plus a semi global ult, and they just kept hitting him, especially for proplay (same as Shen). His issues mainly started when they built him to be tank at first and shifted him more to AP bruiser.\n\nTangent: This is why I fear Riot will try to salvage AP Malphite alongside Tank Malphite if they give him more kit-work.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2019-05-31T17:20:12.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"With how tank items are atm.
