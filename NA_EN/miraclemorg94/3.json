And what is with all the recent huge AOE ults?** Her new R looks very similar to Neeko's and not anything unique by any means.**\n\nNew regular spells look interesting though, looks like she has a lot more range and can slow multiple people. Where's the heal though? Where's her supportive side? \n\nAugust, you have some explaining to do.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1097560552505634817","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-18T19:04:56.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana looks great, Kayle looks like shes missing her textures(make her armor look the same as before plz), and honestly she should keep the blackened face while her helmet is on.

That looks hideous.\n\nThey spread from above her back, which is commonly used to demonstrate it is a \"fallen\" angel. It is a good way of creating distinction and also shows she is an angel.\nThis is the same with Kayl, though in my opinion, I would like for her to have more armor around her body rather than this oddly armored limb look. \n\nObjectively, she looks far better than her current variant. You can say you prefer the old look, but ultimately rfrom an objective view she looks better.\nI just wish Kayl was closer to being fully armored like her current variation rather than appearing to wear a skin suit with armor on her limbs.\nLooks less like an angel of justice and too reminiscent of ZSS","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-02-18T19:16:45.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh no.
