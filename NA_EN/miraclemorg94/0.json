It's a shield that absorbs only magic damage, but prevents disables while it holds. Sivir and Nocturne have spellshields. Of course, a magic damage shield can also be enough to prevent lethal burst, or you could try a regular shield like Janna's, or a champ with an untargetable effect like Fizz/Vlad, or Kayle's invulnerability, and so on. It's just that Zhonya's is a pretty reasonable purchase for mages in general, so you don't have to be playing a specific champ for that to be available to you. It's just that champs who do happen to have an effect like that generally have access to them more often than you can use Zhonya's, so you can get more practice in.","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-02-05T13:25:11.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can't expect your team to always build correctly.

I go botlane and just stack my passive basically nonstop. If I do that really well, and get a few items, I start being able to cast W on a squishy (like Nid bot or something) and then Comet finishes them off. A few minutes later, I don't need Comet anymore. Note that that's with W, which does more damage than R when the target is at full health. To be able to kill a Kennen who's probably building a couple items with health and MR with a single ult cast before 30:00 would require an incredible amount of farm and items. It would basically require running in there repeatedly to intentionally give him stacks and gold, while protecting turrets to delay the end of the match.\n\nAlmost any champion fed to that degree would murder everything. This isn't a problem with Veigar, it's a problem with needing to report three of your teammates for trolling and inting.\n\nDo you have a replay? Can you tell us how many stacks he had on his passive, how much total AP he'd managed, and what items he was using?","replies":[{"poster":"MiracleMorg94","date":"2019-02-05T22:31:28.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=SnugglePuggle94\n\nI play on my main account here.
