I believe this may be a mistake of some sort. When I went to check the email connected to my league account, it was not the same as the one I registered with. With the slight information given I can tell it was an email I have never had access to due to it being a Yahoo email and I tend to use Gmail for simplicity sake. I'd appreciate any responses and it's truly upsetting that I may have lost not only countless hours put in to the game but also north of $500 spent.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T21:27:32.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to the nature of sensitive account information, we'd like to help with your specific issue individually through a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
