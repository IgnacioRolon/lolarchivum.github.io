I went back to the website that had the tabs that say apply, pending, create account, etc, and though I received an email saying I was accepted into the PBE, it has me stuck on the \"pending\" tab. I downloaded the PBE application and can sign in with my regular account credentials, but the store is unavailable and so is the news tab. I'm lost as to what to do in the PBE as there isn't much direction or options and I thought I was given all the champions in the PBE. Someone please give me direction! Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T16:31:22.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you and it looks like you've actually been accepted into the Alpha Client, which is very different than the PBE. [Alpha client access](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update) allows you to use the new client on the live servers, while [PBE access](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe) lets you enter the test environment which is outside of the live servers to test new content and balance changes before they hit the live servers. Store and News aren't added to the Alpha Client yet, so this is normal behavior at the moment. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Jungle Camps","date":"2016-07-22T23:05:52.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for looking into this, I appreciate it so much. Does being apart of the Alpha Client mean that I won't be able to take part in the PBE? I wanted to get to try out Kled when he is launched in a few weeks, look at all the maybe upcoming stuff, and actually be an active part of the league community regarding to feedback and potential bugs. If there's anything I should do to be apart of that, I would love to know! Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-24T15:23:58.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having Alpha Client access doesn't mean you won't be able to participate in the PBE, as they're both different systems and at the moment, you've been invited to only one. I see you've recently applied to the PBE, so all there's left to do is wait to see if/when you'll get invited.
