As I was looking around, I realised that my account said that I was only level 22, when I am actually level 30. I looked into it on the forums, and I couldn't quite find the information I was looking for. My summoner icon changes, it's just that my level stays the same. This is my first post/comment, so I really don't have any other way of checking if it was my account, some sort of glitch, or just that it doesn't update until a certain amount of time. I really got a {{champion:26}}  questions, and I was wondering if anyone else had this issue or had an explanation.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2015-03-31T20:31:10.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NeverCat!\n\nWhile the Boards is linked with game account information, sometimes the information doesn't update properly.
