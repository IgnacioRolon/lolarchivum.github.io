Moving units are not blocked under any circumstance (including dash abilities) Champion summoned units are considered projectiles while traveling, becoming units when they hit the ground.","url":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Projectile","image":"http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/c3/Tectonic_Disruption.png/revision/latest?cb=20161031083724"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I found some interesting stuff about champion`s abilitie`s and their interaction`s whith Yasuo`s Wind Wall and Braum`s Unbreakable. Under the second segment where it say`s ``The following projectiles are not destroyed when they hit &nbsp;Wind Wall and their units will drop to the ground beside the wall`` and there is noted that Zilean`s bomb`s schoud NOT be destroyed by it and just drop down. As a Zilean main, i had many encounter agains a Yasuo and his WInd Wall allways DESTROYED my bomb`s. Now i got curious, if this is true and that the bomb`s schoud not be destroyed. And if this site is wrong about it, id realy like, if i coud get a reliable source, where i can read the truth about all these interactions.","replies":[{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2017-08-29T00:02:59.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Zilean's bombs used to drop, but that gave him a very reliable stun if someone happened to be near the windwall. So they decided to just make it destroy the bombs","replies":[{"poster":"AIIahú Revive","date":"2017-08-29T06:50:43.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well... thats how braums Unbreakable Works. it does not destroy the bomb. its simply put directy on him, even tho, i aimed it behind him. so why schoud yasuos windwall destroy it and not braums unbreakable? so basicly if braums jumps to an ally whith his unbreakable activated, i have atleast a free 2-man stun.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-29T07:18:17.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum's W destroys projectiles, but only kind of. It mostly seems to function by redirecting them at himself, which is why he still takes damage and is affected by CC, while the specific hit that pops it deals no damage as per its effect.\n\nYasuo's W **actually** destroys projectiles, end of story.\n\nThey're two different abilities with very similar traits.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-08-28T16:36:59.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a side note, why are all of your \" and ' as accent marks?","replies":[]}]}
