It does less damage than before and his one of the hardest skill shot in the game because the soft-spot that prioritize champions is very little. \r\nOk, now it can stun, but the bomb last 1 sec less than before and it&#039;s a skill shot, which make it nearly impossible to land because people will try to dodge the 2nd.\r\nQ will waste a lot more mana than before with less potential damage(even with mana reductions), for lane trades that&#039;s really bad.\r\n\r\nWhat I think should be done with Q, gives it charges like smite so you can spam more bombs quickly. Using W is like showing a gold card on TF, people will just run away.\r\n\r\nW rework with Ult is pretty fine, that was indeed a weird interaction.\r\n\r\nHis E is really trash for me now. You don&#039;t need a 99% slow as an AP mid or support, that&#039;s what a tank support should get. Now you tell me that if I slow someone I should be able to put 2 bombs on him. OK, that&#039;s more mana down the drain, and still wasn&#039;t an issue before. The main use of this is to roam, get in fight faster, buff your allies. Now, the duration is trash it&#039;s 50% of original duration, which makes it that you can&#039;t do like the Nunu bloodboil (buffing you and an ally) at the same time, you can only chain it. Mana and cooldown change doesn&#039;t change anything for that skill. If people needed it they use rewind to get it.\r\n\r\nR. Duration reduced? really? that&#039;s the biggest nerf, a character that his ult is one of the only reason to pick him get nerf from 7 to 5?\r\n\r\nI understand the rework, but I think people that did it didn&#039;t understand what people expect from this character and what makes him.","replies":[{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-04-03T06:36:47.581+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is just a victim of rito's \"we dont want any old-nonmobility champ to hold back our MUH LCS PLAYZ champs in action so we take the nerfbat and kill him under the disguise of rework\" syndrome...\n\nHis current kit is garbage and no buffs will make it viable unless it gets a joke scaling (like 2.0 ap) but that's unlikely to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-04-03T06:33:42.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just needs Q adjustments.
