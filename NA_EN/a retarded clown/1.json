May I remind everyone that no marksman can have crazy kits because of your bullshit itemization and ranged vs melee tweaking? \r\n\r\nAnd look at that kit, are you trying to kick every melee champion in existence right out?","replies":[{"poster":"A Retarded Clown","date":"2014-11-05T01:49:11.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, let's just pretened the rest of her kit is gone and she has nothing but passive. She's already super strong there because no melee champion has any hope of actually killing her, ever. Melee champions have in general 10-15 s cd long gap closers. Sh'e has a CD less 'hop' that will take her out of range of most melee spells and autos for sure....how is that even remotely going to be balanced?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZekromEX","date":"2014-11-04T23:53:42.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"........ May I remind you about Yasuo and His Crit range?","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-05T02:01:03.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly. Every champ this guy designs is a total catastrophy. \n\n.Stupidly Strong\n.Instant Nerfs\n.Overloaded kits\n.Are cancer to play against/with for long periods of time\n.Reach a point where they need buffs, but any kind of buff would make the champion OP again\n.Rework necessary for revival\n\nThis is pretty much how this goes. Yes I am exaggerating for comedic effect, but lets be real. This is exactly where Darius is at right now. He cant be buffed because he would get stupidly strong again with even the smallest of changes, yet he needs something.\n\nYasuo has reached the cancer stage. People don't ban yas because he is strong. They ban him because they don't want to deal with one being in their game. No one wants Yasuo in their games right now. Downvote me if you want Yasuo mains, but he is pure cancer right now.\n\nWhy does this happen? Stupidly overloaded kits. His only success I would say is Thresh, and that is only because people dont know how to click on his lantern.\n\nYasuo needs a rework asap. I saw an excellent thread on the topic awhile ago, do some searching if interested.\n\nDarius... I really don't know. I love the champ, but you can tell he is always gonna be on the fringe of being outright broken and \"Meh he is okay\". Although, tbh, I could imagine that Darius is in a perfect place right now, and that mobility and shit just needs to be fixed. The meta is really stupid right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ParinoidPanda","date":"2014-11-05T00:52:00.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista is the best of many worlds:\n\n* Nidalee spears\n* Ashe Vision\n* Twitch poison consume\n* Quinn style of mobility\n* Viktor item (?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalloweenDeath","date":"2014-11-04T23:52:40.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you talking about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-11-04T23:52:23.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's okay, Jinx was made.","replies":[]}]}
