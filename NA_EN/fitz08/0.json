I was wondering if it was a bug or not ... but can Azir ult stop stop the sion ult (unstoppable onslaught) ? Because it just happened to me in a game and the sion ult description is that its not affected by crowd control ! So theoretically Azir ult should not stop the sion ult. Anyway thought you might want to know if it is actually a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-24T04:45:25.707+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's working as intended.

Or does he still need a small push?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-03-24T07:24:48.183+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We suspect he might need a little bit more, not certain though.

Maybe still pushing his sustained damage playstyle rather than bursty.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UberNat","date":"2015-03-24T08:12:24.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While on topic of bugs this happened to Anivia yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PegdTGoM-ik\n\nI posted it to boards but no one ever responded.
