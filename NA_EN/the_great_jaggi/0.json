I think Narsicus has it right:\n\nThis isn't the only reason this is noticeable. There are several factors that make Thresh's hitbox an issue.\n\n1) Thresh doesn't face the way he's going to toss the hook before he tosses it, which is intentional and also _removes counterplay_ for the other player.\n\n2) Unlike other skill shots, hooks like Death Sentence, Rocket Grab and Zenith Blade can literally lose a fight because of how punished the team is for getting hit by it. It should be the player's skill that determines the swinginess of such a powerful ability, not a broken hitbox or a lack of telegraph. (The skill should be Thresh's to hit, not the enemy team's to dodge).\n\n3) Skill shots with a stun attached to them are much more visible when they don't hit you because you can't do anything except stare at your screen wondering how the hell they hit you (your champion can't take any actions for another 1.5 seconds anyway).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DazedOnlooker","date":"2015-11-03T19:48:06.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had no idea that, that was even possible..i was always wondering why it looked like it took godlike reflexes to dodge a thresh hook when im playing as lulu....i also hate how thresh can still hook you if you polly him mid, hook animation.
