Honestly, isolate is just a rough mechanic, because he really needs the long jump to reach potentially isolated targets, but he doesn't get that until level 11, which by then, the squishies are no longer alone and easy pickings, which heavily gimps his character. \n\nWhat they really need to do is make him even more \"high risk, high reward\" to differentiate him...maybe make his other moves do stuff based on isolation to emphasize positioning and doing his actual assassin role properly (which still probably wont fix the problem, but it's an idea). I'm not saying it would be easy to do, but something needs to be done, because irrelevant utility is still irrelevant.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Reks","date":"2015-12-29T02:41:52.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">doesn't get that until level 11\n\nyou're playing him wrong.

That IF is a HUUUUGE one at the moment. I've played him A LOT, and it's few and far between when I can actually kill my desired target (and consequently I die instead), which defeats the whole purpose of an assassin. I wouldn't mind changing his kit to make him play differently or something, but as is, he is not fulfilling his job.

They both have a heal, they both have a slow, they both have invisibility, they both have a gapcloser but Rengar has a root which is much more deadly and useful for his team than a slow. \n\n2. You are right that Khazix is generally more useful after getting a kill than the knife cat but that only applies to large teamfights. In small 2v2 and 3v3 engagements, I'd rather be Rengar. He can still fight as long as his ambush took out the right target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-12-28T21:51:10.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Multi-rotation assassins are always more of a risk to buff than Single-rotation assassins. \n\nE.g.
