I managed to relog but I was disconnected once more. After that I tried restarting the client, with great difficulty (I'm using the new client). When I do manage to get to the loin screen it gets stuck on authenticating forever. This is very frustrating; I use ethernet and have never had this issue before. My wifi is fine, as I can access everything else without issue. My team is still managing to hold out in the ranked game bless them, however the game has been made needlessly more difficult due to this issue. Should they lose the game, it will be because of this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-10T21:33:40.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It seems like you have an unstable connection that's degrading an failing to reach either our game or authentication servers.

I suppose it was just an issue with the campus' wifi which is tragic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cookiecrafter","date":"2017-10-21T04:23:03.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its simple guys rioters will continue to blame our connections when the reality is league of legends servers are trash i don't remember having so many problems on any game i have ever played . this has been said lots of times on 1000s posts and lets repeat it here \"pls riot fix your shit and stop been so greedy\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"emptyadam","date":"2017-02-10T15:11:13.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me, and i got afk leavebustered","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siren Beauty","date":"2017-02-10T08:01:55.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing with my bf and I","replies":[]},{"poster":"CsBro","date":"2017-02-10T07:57:55.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me","replies":[{"poster":"CsBro","date":"2017-02-10T07:58:33.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in both of my games for my series","replies":[]}]}]}
