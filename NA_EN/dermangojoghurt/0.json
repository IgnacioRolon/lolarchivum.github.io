It&#039;s clearly recognizable, even with a lot of noise. However, I think the Q sound effects of the Lancer skins are too quiet or don&#039;t stand out enough to quickly react to. \nI usually don&#039;t have any problems spellshielding allies as Morgana when they&#039;re about to get hit, but I found myself struggling greatly to do that against the Lancer Rougue skin, even when deliberately trying to bait out the hook (I assume Lancer Paragons sound effect is similar).\n\nI would deeply appreciate it if somebody from Riot could look into it and maybe adjust the volume levels.","replies":[{"poster":"semipriceysoap","date":"2018-04-16T21:23:00.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DerMangoJoghurt! I'll take a look at adjusting volume levels here - the audio levels between the these Lancer Q's and the base Blitz Q are actually pretty similar, but the base Blitz Q is definitely pretty high pitched and instantly recognizable, especially since that's such an iconic spell too. \n\nLooking through his kit, I'll make some volume tweaks to see if it'll help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"webstar1108","date":"2018-04-12T18:02:58.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pay to win","replies":[]}]}
