The game would be be played at a stable FPS and Ping, correct? \r\n\r\nCompared to 10 people in which one person is playing near Chicago and 3 are playing from Europe and 1 person playing from Asia, etc. Would the game be laggy for the person playing near Chicago because the server is compensating/handling connections from that far?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, for example, if a person has Overwatch, 50 Chrome tabs with YouTube videos loading, PBE Client open while in a game of League of Legends (live), would that affect game stability for the other 9 people in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T04:24:29.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The locations of the different players in a match shouldn't affect the stability for any of the other users as far as Ping/FPS is concerned. If one of them has a really bad connection, it would only effect that one player. \n\nOn the same note, if you have all of that running at once, you're bound to have a bad time in the match xD. But, nobody else would be affected by that one player having everything running in the background.","replies":[]}]}
