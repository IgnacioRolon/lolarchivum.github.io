Lowest tier being SIlver 5. If you lose enough games at Silver 5 with 0LP you will be kicked out of ranked and will have to play x amount of games in normal draft before being able to reattempt your placement matches. Another suggestion: Having to wait a week before being able to attempt placement matches. \n\nEach season there would be an unlimited amount of times to reattempt placements after being dropped from ranked with the restriction of the aforementioned penalties.\n\nEnd of season awards: Gold and higher. \nAn aside: I sometimes thought the silver borders around player cards indicated S4 bronzies.\n\nReason for this idea?: If you&#039;re not good at the game you should not be playing in ranked queues hence why there should be a chance that players drop from ranked altogether and have to go through a \"rehab\", so to speak, before trying to get placed back in to ranked. If you&#039;re good enough you will stay in ranked. This will remove having questionably horrible teammates and the notion of elo hell.\n\n\nThoughts?

Normal Draft and ranked Draft are very different entities because not everyone who does normal Draft want to play ranked. In the few ranked games I've played I've typically had a much harder time in lane than I normally would. Why? Because the people in ranked games tend to play better and are more skilled than people looking to just play a quick game and be done with it. In a normal game I expect to do well. If I am comfortable with the champion I am playing I will have no problem winning lane. If at this point I only play normals what reason would I have to get better? However, in ranked I don't have as easy of a time winning lane. Even if I am on a comfortable champion it is much harder because my opponent tries.

I can answer two questions with one post. \n\nWhy does Bronze exist? Why are people allowed to be infinitely bad in a \"competitive\" environment? **Because the only requirements to play ranked are:**\n1) Be level 30\n2) Obtain 16 or more champions\n\nThis means any player of any skill level can enter promos and then be placed according to how many wins they accumulate in their placements. More specifically speaking, you will have players with no knowledge of how to cs effectively, group, team-fight, take objectives, etc. (basically newbies who grinded to level 30)\n\nHowever with the buffer of winning x amount of games before being able to play ranked they will realize they are not ready to compete with their higher-skilled peers.\n\nI completely disagree with your rude statement that my idea adds \"unnecessary frustration.\" Literally cannot understand if you graduated middle school with that logic.\n\n\nLet's be real for a second. Riot has so much trouble removing trolls from ranked that it almost seems like they are doing absolutely nothing while complaints about ranked games continue to pile up with no solution, immediate or eventual.\n\n\nThe skill floor is the main concept of my idea.","replies":[{"poster":"shalec","date":"2015-04-15T18:47:47.046+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to insult my intelligence when you try to dispute my claims.

The people against what I suggested in OP can't seem to undestand that ranked is competitive and there should be a minimum skill level in order to play and not just \"Must be level 30 and have 16 or more champions that are not included in the free week champion pool\"","replies":[{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-04-15T17:56:40.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"arent there usually some sort of \"try outs\" for things?

Right now I am in Bronze 3, and even when I get to Bronze 1, it all feels like Bronze 5. I think with a skill-cap minimum, you will definitely get more quality out of games, and people who can't rank will hold value in Bronze over nothing. Good idea imo.
