My last computer broke a couple years ago and my dad never got around to buying me another one but now my birthday is coming up and Im trying to get back into gaming. The only problem is, Im on a tight budget. The budget would probably be around $400, but less is always better. I know building one would be the best idea for this price but Im not sure that my parents are willing to do that. Accessories arent needed as I still have my Razer Naga and Blackwidow from my old computer","replies":[{"poster":"Melt3","date":"2017-05-20T22:48:56.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just realized Help & Support post wasnt exactly what I thought it was lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T23:42:47.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!
