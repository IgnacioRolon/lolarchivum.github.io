{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2016-05-05T01:04:17.640+0000","title":"PLOT - An Extensive Analysis of Sexuality in League","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":93,"down_votes":32,"body":"The recent discussions about the newest champion, [Talyiah](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-reveal-taliyah-stoneweaver), got me thinking about the sexuality of League champions. Riot&rsquo;s gotten a _lot _ of criticism in the past for what people call &lsquo;blatant [fanservice](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice)&rsquo;, among other things, and in a modernized League of Legends where Riot is doing a lot better in terms of sexuality(I&rsquo;d argue the last 3 female champions are great examples of diversity), I ask - What place does &lsquo;fanservice&rsquo; have in League? Is it just &#039;pandering&#039; to the male player base, and should no more female champions feature fanservice? Should older champions have theirs tuned down, as people said Riot did with Akali? Or is Riot going too far, harming the nostalgia and legacy of the game with &lsquo;censorship?&rsquo;\n\nAs a disclaimer, I&rsquo;ll say that I, a straight male of mixed descent, enjoy fanservice. I enjoy story more. If a game/show/whatever has a lot of fanservice with no story (With other redeeming qualities of course, like comedy), I&rsquo;ll enjoy it. If it has no fanservice, with a deep and impactful story, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it. If it has both, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it. If it has neither, well then you have Call of Duty.\n\nLet&rsquo;s have another disclaimer, for Riot this time. In the past, they&rsquo;ve given their reasons for making many old champions very heavy on the fanservice. Before they had the technology and skill they do now, larger breasts and elegant, flowing hair made it easier to identify a champion within the game as a female. The release of Quinn(Some might argue Vi) though, heralded in the beginning of female champions who were less heavy on fanservice, with champions like Lissandra and Kalista and Rek&rsquo;sai hitting the rift with little to no fanservice.\n\nNow, [plot](http://i.imgur.com/usPVwAO.gif).\n\nWhere does sexuality actually hold weight in the plot?\n\nSome would say that it never should, and those people are dumb. Anything can be used as a literary device. Anything. George R.R. Martin made a story where a rapist and a victim fall in love with one another, and both ended up being characters I cheered for in the story.\n\nSo, what I&rsquo;m going to do is list a number of champions who&rsquo;s sexuality is very explicit. The fanservice exists in these ladies, and I want to analyse their lore, personality, and storylines, and see if the fanservice is justified, could be justified, or holds no place.\n\nFirstly, I want to say - Skins are excluded from this. This is an analysis of the character&rsquo;s lore, personality, and base appearance&rsquo;s outfit. Skins can be all sexual, if Riot wants; it holds no bearing on the story. We can have skins like Frostbutt Irelia and Chest Hair Party Graves, and it&rsquo;s okay, because it doesn&rsquo;t effect the lore of the character at all.\n\nFirst, champions where sexuality is a cornerstone of their character - The sexuality, attractiveness, and blatant fanservice following in the probably heeled footsteps of these characters actually matters in the story (In my honest opinion). Their fanservice is **_completely _ justified**.\n\n* {{champion:103}} Ahri - Let me say first, you&rsquo;ll find seduction to be common ground between most of these characters. Ahri was known to use her body and magic to seduce men and drain their spirit essences when she had their weaknesses laid bare. Did this involve actual sex? We don&rsquo;t know. What&rsquo;s interesting is that Ahri wants to reform into a better person, than just someone who tricks men into surrendering their spirits to her. Her sexuality, of course, remains as a part of her character. Until she actually is able to become a part of human society, her dress likely cannot change, and her former mannerisms will likely stay. Through development, she could end up going in the opposite direction. At the moment, though, sexuality does remain a staple of her character.\n\n* {{champion:60}} Elise - Now, we have a champion who seems to relish in her sexuality. She uses her feminine wiles to seduce men into her religion, essentially gaining their worship. When they follow her to the Shadow Isles, of course, she kills them and, through methods we don&rsquo;t know, uses their bodies and/or souls to fuel her magic and her eternal youth. This is probably linked to Vilemaw, but I digress. Her sexuality is an integral part of her character. She&rsquo;s very similar to Ahri, where again, that the act of sex itself is not the source of her power, but seduction and sexuality is how she bridges the gap to power.\n\n* {{champion:28}} Evelynn - The new splash art got some criticism recently for having &lsquo;nerfed&rsquo; Evelynn&rsquo;s bust size, but it&rsquo;s very clear that sexuality will remain a part of her character. Here, though, I think sex and violence will end up becoming synonymous. We know nothing about Evelynn&rsquo;s character right now. What we do know, though, from hints and discussions from Rioters, is that sexuality will be involved, similar to old style vampires and succubi. What I forsee is a character who interplays sex and violence very heavily. She may seduce a man(Her contract, if she&rsquo;s still a mercenary), have sex with him, and then kill him either during or after the act. It&rsquo;s certainly what her new splash art looks like.\n\n* {{champion:21}} Miss Fortune - Ah, Sarah. Once, the worst, most egregious offense. Now? One of my favorites. _Burning Tides_ and _Shadow and Fortune_ did wonders for her character. We learned, for example, that the Captain Fortune skin is her actual, canon representation, while her base splash is how she goes around in public. This is, in my opinion, Riot&rsquo;s best handling of the sexuality trope, and the best way they&rsquo;ve turned a character around. Sarah, being Bilgewater&rsquo;s Jessica Rabbit, combines sexuality, friendliness, and flirtatiousness to convince men to like her. Alongside her track record of claiming bounties and shooting enemies, this cements her as someone men want to follow, perhaps for their own reasons. Pirates often think with their dicks, not their brains, after all. She becomes the quintessential femme fatale. Those who fell in love with her in Bilgewater&rsquo;s taverns find a very different Sarah Fortune standing at the helm of her ship. But with a wink, and a puckering of the lips, they fall back in line all the same. If only they could see the actual Sarah Fortune, hiding a heart of black ice under her bared chest, manipulating them for her own vengeance and gain.\n\nNext, we&rsquo;ll do champions for whom sexuality is a lesser part of their character. It may seem like blatant fanservice on the surface, but after looking deeper into their stories, you can see why they dress the way they dress and act the way they act. Perhaps it is sexual, and perhaps it&rsquo;s not at all. Either way, the fanservice is **justified**.\n\n* {{champion:69}} Cassiopeia - Here, we have a champion who was once beautiful. In another time, Cassiopeia likely used her body and skills in seduction to gain political power within Noxus and in other places. But the curse of the Stone Serpent twisted her body into that of a vicious ophidian. Her form changed from alluring to disturbing. In her old lore, this traumatized her. From what we could logically garner, her sexuality went from an undertone or aftertaste, to the forefront. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find me beautiful?&rdquo; She began longing for the attention and affection she might&rsquo;ve gotten before, and in turn, adopted a scantily clad figure and more overt mannerisms. But now, it&rsquo;s too late, because she&rsquo;s cursed with the body and venom of a snake.\n\n* {{champion:222}} Jinx - I didn't include her at first, but after more thought and analysis, well. Does anyone remember when the cinematic was first released? People raved over dat lip bite. That said, here, the sexuality isn't sexual at all, and isn't even meant to be attractive (I don't think, anyway). She loves explosions and bullets and the like a _lot_. Again, that lip bite. Not to mention the extremely revealing attire. What I like here is that she's a champion who doesn't fit the typical mold. Most female champions in League, old ones anyway, fit a very specific body type. Jinx is a different sort. Not to say thin women with a small chest have to be crazy to be sexualized, but still, it's diverse.\n\n* {{champion:7}} LeBlanc - Another Noxian master of manipulation, the difference between Cassiopeia and LeBlanc is simple a matter of situation. Were LeBlanc in Cassiopeia&rsquo;s shoes, she very much might end up the same. But she&rsquo;s not. Instead, she became a master of illusion magic, which she combined with political engineering and her sexuality to become the leader of the Black Rose. Her sexuality is used to gain the favor of Noxian nobles and politicians. I imagine a night with LeBlanc often ends up like [this scene from X-Man First Class](https://youtu.be/EBsCP8ZQ-3c?t=20). LeBlanc would use her magic, along with her attire, to trick a politician into a wonderful night. Little do they know, it&rsquo;s not actually LeBlanc. The illusion could be another woman entirely. This creates a situation she can take advantage of from many angles. The man could become wrapped around her finger. She could reveal her magic, along with a witness&rsquo;s account or other proof(Do cameras exist in Runeterra?), to blackmail the man. Perhaps he cheated, and if LeBlanc lets the secret out, his career and reputation will be ruined. Classic misdirection.\n\n* {{champion:113}} Sejuani - Specifically, I&rsquo;m actually making a case for Traditional Sejuani and her various, scantily clad skins. It makes sense that, currently, in the midst of a Freljordian war, Sejuani is dressed in full plate armor. Classically, though? I actually see Sejuani wearing her Traditional outfit most often in the canon. In her lore, Sejuani laid herself bare, completely bare, in the cold wilderness of the Freljord. The elements changed from being hated enemies, to embraced, welcome torture. She doesn&rsquo;t enjoy it, no, but she did it to become strong. And going back to more protective garb would dull that strength she forged. I could see the entirety of the Winter&rsquo;s Claw dressing scantily, man and woman alike. Look at Olaf - He wears a vest and a loincloth, leaving his chest, arms, and legs completely exposed to the frigid ice and snow. Likely for the same reasons that Sejuani does.\n\nThirdly, I&#039;d like to examine sexualized champions where the sexuality could play a part, be it large or small, in their characterization. Like before, it could be sexual, and it could not be. We don&rsquo;t know. But in these cases, where the lore doesn&rsquo;t tell us, there could be reasons why the characters dress or act the way they do that aren&rsquo;t implied or obvious. The space is there, and the writing isn&rsquo;t. But it could be. The fanservice **_might _ be justified**.\n\n* {{champion:55}} Katarina - Our beloved(Or reviled, based on your experiences) Noxian blademaster is rockin&rsquo; one hell of a getup. Tiny jacket, leather pants, bare midriff, generous cleavage, complete with black tattoos. There is little sexuality implied by her lore, barring her encounters with Garen. That being said, her attire could be warranted. Being an assassin is about more than stealth and bladework, despite what Assassin&rsquo;s Creed might tell you. Perhaps she wears the outfit so she can be flexible with fighting, or easily fit through tight gaps during escapes. Perhaps she seduces people in between her and her target to avoid a potentially dangerous confrontation. Perhaps, even, it&rsquo;s just a part of the image of Noxus&rsquo;s premier assassin, and her personality and confidence makes her choose the outfit on purpose. Who knows? Later lore will tell.\n\n* {{champion:76}} Nidalee - So, at first, I had Nidalee in the above list. After more thought, she likely belongs here. My original point stands; she wears a loincloth because she was raised in the jungle, and it's a wonder she wears clothes at all. That justifies the revealed skin and such. But, as some of you have pointed out, revealed skin doesn't(Or shouldn't) necessarily mean sexuality. Besides, a feral child should look a lot worse off than Nidalee does. Her hair is perfect, her makeup, she's not covered in scars or boils, she's not missing any teeth or fingers, and that's likely what being feral would entail. Rengar's missing an eye, for example. Still, it is a fantasy game, so I suppose maybe you could excuse it.\n\n* {{champion:15}} Sivir - Everyone has mixed feelings about Sivir&rsquo;s reworked splash. Everyone has mixed feelings about her revealing attire. That being said, it is likely Sivir&rsquo;s choice. I don&rsquo;t see sexuality or seduction playing any part here, it doesn&rsquo;t fit Sivir&rsquo;s personality. Battle does, though, and Sivir&rsquo;s crossblade is not an easy weapon to wield. Unlike other places, where heavier armor helps, it wouldn&rsquo;t help in a desert. You would overheat. That being said, a desert robe, the traditional attire for enduring the glaring sun, doesn&rsquo;t at all lend itself to fighting. It would get in the way of her crossblade and the weight would slow her down. Sivir is fleet of foot and agile. Her armor is chosen to make all these burdens easier to tolerate.\n\n* {{champion:37}} Sona - What little lore there is about Sona doesn&rsquo;t tell us much. She was a mute orphan, she picked up a magical instrument, and became a master at it. Her symphonies are enjoyed by even the stoic Jericho Swain. This very sparse lore leaves a LOT of wiggle room. Personally, I see Sona being that &lsquo;perfect girl&rsquo; that every man wants but cannot get. Someone who&rsquo;s been [Spoiled Sweet](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet), and her body just so happens to attract a larger male audience. No, Sona doesn&rsquo;t wear skimpy clothing; her robe is, to me, reminiscent of real life red carpet dresses that celebrities and the like often wear. Cleavage is, well, standard on those sorts of dresses, most of the time. You&rsquo;d expect it to have an open back, too.\n\n* {{champion:134}} Syndra - League&rsquo;s brash, arrogant, young upstart doesn&rsquo;t leave much to the imagination. In this case, though, I see it as symbolism, rather than a story consequence. Syndra is the classic teenager, who cries &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me!&rdquo;, leaves the house, and comes home with a wet t-shirt, a tattoo, and a drug addiction. Except, instead of a drug addiction, it&rsquo;s a channeling of immense, innate magical power. The revealing outfit, uncut hair, and hunger for defiance and independence serves as a harsh contrast to the rest of Ionia, and a representation of how far she&rsquo;s trying to set herself from them. The reason she is on this list, though, and not the prior, is because, while the fanservice is justified, it doesn&rsquo;t serve as a plot point or story hook. It&rsquo;s still a literary device, but through symbolism. In a story, the dress would likely be ignored entirely, and that&rsquo;s okay.\n\n* {{champion:143}} Zyra - No, my opinion on Zyra has changed very much since I originally wrote this post. Of course, it makes some assumptions on Zyra and her character, so it still is still only maybe justified. That said, she's a predator who's developed a taste for human and the ability to roam. Carnivorous plants want to look inviting and enticing for prey, to lure them into the trap. If a wanderer, alone in the forest, stumbled upon Zyra, and she smiled coyly at him, it's a lot less likely that he'd flee if she were attractive. If she were more monstrous, she'd need to rely on other means to catch her victims.\n\nLastly, I want to list the champions where sexuality does not fit. While they are or have been sexualized in the past(Be it just a little fanservice or a lot), they shouldn&rsquo;t be anymore. This list was inevitable, as League&rsquo;s history was ripe with reasonless fanservice(And that was okay). Now, though, because the story is being taken seriously and isn&rsquo;t just a fun story to justify us fighting in an arena, it doesn&rsquo;t hold a place for the characters anymore. There won&rsquo;t be any analyzing here; the reasons why they should not be sexualized, should be obvious. Note that this doesn&rsquo;t include skins. While Ashe shouldn&rsquo;t be sexualized in the story, it doesn&rsquo;t mean skins like Heartseeker Ashe or Officer Caitlyn can&rsquo;t exist. It just means that, in the lore, the fanservice of the base characters is **_not _ justified.**\n\n* Akali, Ashe, Caitlyn, Fiora, Irelia, Janna(This one especially), Karma(Pushing it here, but her base splash is a little sexualized), Lux, Morgana, Nami, Soraka.\n\nIf I did not list a female champion, it&rsquo;s because I personally don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re sexualized enough in lore or in their base skin to justify their inclusion. If a girl champion is less sexualized in lore than Yasuo or Taric, then they don&rsquo;t belong on the above list. Champions like Kayle, Quinn, Riven, and Vi are hardly sexualized, not including skins(Which can be fanservicey as all getout with no excuses).\n\nWhat do you think? Is sexuality justified? Do you think Riot should continue with female champions like Taliyah, with no sexuality intended or implied? Do you think we&rsquo;re due for a sexualized champion, after many who aren&#039;t?\n\nPersonally, I&#039;m okay with either. As long as the story is good, I&#039;ll gladly welcome any champion, sexualized or not.\n\n**EDIT**: So, my girlfriend and I had an extensive discussion about this post. We went back and forth, talking about different champions and lores(We're both aspiring writers, so we discuss this sort of thing constantly), and she pointed out some things for me. One, Jinx is sexualized, and it hadn't even crossed my mind. Two, Nidalee should probably be on the maybe list, since a feral child, realistically, would look so much worse off. And three, Zyra may not be as bad as I thought. All she said to me was, \"Well, she's a carnivorous plant. They're supposed to look enticing.\" And I saw it in a light I didn't before.\n\nSo, I changed a few things. Also fixed a few semantic things and places where I may have come off wrong. Miss Fortune is one of my favorite characters, and I probably came off wrong about her at first.","replies":[{"poster":"YOLO420SWAGSCOPE","date":"2016-05-05T03:16:44.727+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:421}}  how could you not find this sexy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darrosh Jewfist","date":"2016-05-05T01:42:45.996+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sex sells.

But it doesn't, really.\n\nCaitlyn is a relic, though. Right now, it's understandable why she looks the way she does. It has to do with League's history, and Caitlyn is one of the oldest champions.

People often say that all the ladies of League have the same face, or too similar faces. Her update made her much more subjective. Not everyone is attracted to cheek bones like hers, for example. She became more defined, and less generic.\n\nFor Caitlyn, it's things like her large cleavage, and some of her lines. \"Sorry boys, I left the fuzzy cuffs at home.\" How is that relevant?

Taliyah is incredibly cute, at least to me, eyebrows or not. Some people find Jinx sexy, exept that she is farthest away from fanservice. \n\nWhat the hell a sexualized champion even is? You can call almost every champ sexualized if you get down to it, because different people find different preferences. And even if someones sexuality doesnt play into their lore, doesnt mean it cant exist.\n\n\nI am getting annoyed these days by people talking about character writting when they know shit about it. How a character looks is one of the last parts of the character creation.\n\nI disagree with your \"fanservice unjustified\" Champ list for a few reasons. \n\nLets tkae Freljord champions. Both men and women are rarely covered, yet i dont see people bitching about tryndamere, do i?\n\nWell there is a logical explanation as to why people in Freljord may not be covered in furs, because they are used to it and have extreme cold tolerance. Hell, even i can go out at -30 shirtless and enjoy the sun, because i tolerate cold that much. Those who live in such temperatures for a long time would build up natural resistances to the elemments. As such i dont find ashe sexualized or fanservicy.\n\nAkali isnt fanservicy either. While yes, she isnt fully covered in cloths her clothing fits the character of  a shadow assasin, it provides her really good mobility and speed, which she needs. Being fully covered in cloth would actually limit her fighting potential because if it would be too tight it would limit her movement and if it would be too big it would also limit her movement. \n\nCaitlyn aint fanservicy or sexualized either, even in her splash.

Her tribe lives in the warmest part of the Freljord, where it's at least warm enough to farm crops, so it's not like she's walking around in the snow and ice wearing that.  She'd also want an outfit that doesn't restrict her arms or legs in any way, being an archer who needs to be mobile, so sleeves and long pants are right out.  It's a bit showy, yeah, but it's not *entirely* unusual.\n\n{{champion:40}} - [She has a personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histrionic_personality_disorder).  If you look through her lore she shows many, many signs that she's histrionic, and the sexy, provocative look goes along with that.  This is backed up in the JoJ, where she flirts with everyone, gets pictures leaked of her in lingerie, and once seduced the reporter interviewing her.  She's also a fan favorite and always strives to be at the center of attention, but has a flighty personality and changes emotions quickly.  Further, the main suggested causes of this disorder - abandonment issues and traumatic death of close relatives - are both present in her lore.   \n\n{{champion:7}} - Probably a personal choice, nothing story-related.  She's a master of illusion, she can make people think she's dressed however she wants.  Her dress choice seems to be more indicative of her love for herself than for the purpose of being sexy or seductive.  She dresses like that because she thinks she looks good in it and for no other reason.\n\n{{champion:25}} - She's doing it to draw a sharp contrast to Kayle.  Kayle feels guilty and ashamed of her actions so she hides herself behind layers of clothing and armor, but In Morgana's mind she's got nothing to be ashamed of.  it's also probably hard for her (or any other winged character) to find Runeterran clothing that works well with wings aside from open-backed dresses or bikini tops.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-05T21:12:30.106+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting post, but I would have been interested by your thoughts on the champs in the \"not justified list\". Something like \"Cait is a cop, she should wear protection and look more formal\" or \"Ashe is a Queen, she must look royal, not be sexy\", etc.\n\nAlso, I'm nit-picking, but hum, we're not exactly talking about \"sexuality\" here. More about \"sexualization\", or \"sexyness\", but we're not talking about people actually having sex. And that would be another interesting topic, I think.\n\nNow about individual champs:\n\n* For Sona, I think it's partially justified by the fact she's from \"show-business\", when your livelihood is making spectacles, you take care of looking good, even when you're playing music. Now, \"looking good\" doesn't necessarily means \"baring cleavage\", so only partially. And it's kinda similar to what you said, but not exactly: I don't think it's just random circumstances, and I don't see her as a Spoiled Sweet instance.\n\n* For LeBlanc, I think her Lore completely justify her being attractive and sexy: great illusionist means she can be as beautiful as she wants to be, and evil mastermind politician  means that she wouldn't hesitate to resort to this kind of methods to get her way. I'm less convinced by the actual clothes she wear in her base skin, though, I think it fits more the D&D adventurer sorceress than the politician she is.\n\n* About Jinx, my head-canon is that she doesn't care about sexuality at all, and that she wears what she wants to, not to look sexy for other people, just to look good in her own eyes. It just so happens that, influenced by the society she lives in, it's also something that is rather revealing and that some would find attractive. Nothing in the actual lore proves this, but I think it fits well with what we do know about the character.\n\n* About all the champs in your \"completely justified\" list, I agree with you, but I kinda find sad that, for all of them, it's just a mean to an end, and seduction and sexuality are always linked with misdirection, deception and most of the time plain evil magic. We have no representation of positive sex, healthy and consensual relationships. Which leads me to...\n\n* {{champion:420}}  Illaoi. Sure, she's not sexualized in her appearance, but did you listen to her voice-over? She had plenty of partners, she openly talks about it (well, as openly as a PG13 game can support) and she's actually the healthiest representation of sexuality we have in the whole game. I liked her character anyway, but I especially enjoyed this side of her. Her sexuality is not front and center, because she's a priestess above all, but her sexuality is an integral part of her life, and this has been wonderfully handled, I think.\n\n* I don't think Lux is sexualized, and it's debatable for Karma/Soraka/Nami. I agree that they shouldn't be.\n\n* For Morgana, the lore doesn't justify it well, but the archetype from which she's inspired is traditionally sexy, so I'd put her in the \"maybe\" list.\n\n* For Janna, the outfit doesn't bother me so much. An air mage that control the elements and the weather, she is very lightly clothed and doesn't care, it can pass, as a justification. Like, clothes are just a hassle, let me use as little as possible and be comfortable in the wind. What bothers me much more though, is the joke about phone sex or the old story in the JoJ where a sextape was leaked and she was blamed for having sex (instead of the person leaking the tape for invading her privacy). It was even a running joke that stayed for many issues after the initial story. Seriously. <_<\n\nFinally, about skins, I think you are too fast in deciding it doesn't matter. I don't have too much of an issue with Candy Cane MF, for instance, given that MF is already sexualized, but I'd be really shocked if Riot would release a Call-Girl Annie skin, even if it's just a Skin. I'm taking an extreme example on purpose here. In the middle, there is a large gray area of things I'm not really sure how I feel about. Battle Bunny Riven or Headmistress Fiora? Weeell, whatever floats your boat, I guess, but I personally hate these skins, and I don't think they are doing justice to their original champion. There is also Kayle losing her helmet in most of her skins, as if to say \"hey, look, i'm a girl, a real girl\", or Diana losing her armor.","replies":[]}]}
