The cdr and AP is nice, but it doesn&#039;t give them something they sorely need: Mana. AP junglers have to clear with their abilities, and unless you can keep the blue buff all game, you&#039;ll have to either carry around Mana Potions or build Mana items, which can set you back.\r\n\r\nHaving to build them sets back these junglers, since most Mana items (Besides RoA and Seraph&#039;s) have CDR on them. They need a new AP Jungler item that&#039;ll give them the Mana they need to clear the jungle. Here&#039;s my suggestion.\r\n\r\nEnchantment: Manahunter\r\n\r\nSmite item (850g) + Tear of the Goddess (720g) + 730g\r\n\r\n+250 Mana\r\n+50% Base Mana Regen\r\n\r\nUnique Passive: Awe: You gain 10% of your Mana as bonus Ability Power.\r\nUnique Passive: Mana Charge: Grants 4 Mana for every spell cast and mana expenditure. Max 750.\r\nUnique Passive: Manahunter: Slaying large monsters grants you +10 Mana for Mana Charge. In addition, killing a large monster instantly charges you with 4% of your missing Mana, and 6% of your missing health.\r\n\r\nAt 750 Mana, the enchantment evolves into...\r\n\r\nEnchantment: Manalord\r\n\r\n+1000 Mana\r\n+50% Base Mana Regen\r\n\r\nUnique Passive: Awe: You gain 10% of your Mana as bonus ability power.\r\nUnique Passive: Manalord: Slaying a large monster instantly charges you with 5% of your missing Mana and 10% of your missing health.\r\nUnique Active: Ether Shockwave: Expend 20% of your Mana to release a shockwave, dealing Magic Damage equal to the Mana consumed, and slowing nearby enemies by 35% for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nYou may be asking, why a shockwave? Because the majority of AP Junglers ({{champion:30}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:9}} etc) are pretty close range and always near enemies, which is one of the reasons jungling comes naturally to them in the first place. And even if you&#039;re playing a real dark horse AP jungler, the Shockwave would still come in handy in case someone get&#039;s close to you and you need the slow.\r\n\r\nAlso, why the heal on large monster kill? Because AP characters are squishy, almost by nature in some cases. It&#039;ll make sure they can heal through the jungle as well as keep mana through it.\r\n\r\nIs this item perfect? No. But its a start. Anyone else have any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-04-17T13:46:46.121+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"smite midlaners ftw, 10% of mana as ap, thats 200 ap with only that item fullstacked, add in an roa and you get nearly 300 ap out of that+ a 600aoe damage active, thats totally broken.\n\nJust add some meaningfull manasustain to Magus and everything is fine(maybe lower the ap if it becomes to powerfull)","replies":[]},{"poster":"forist","date":"2015-04-17T12:23:15.398+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yay {{champion:76}}  buffs.

(Limit once per spell, even if it is a DoT or AOE etc.)\n\nIt's fine for mana users to have to limit their spell usage in lane, because you can just last hit minions that have been weakened by other minions until you regen some mana (and also you have {{item:1056}} if you want it, which most mana users do).  But mages need to use their spells frequently to clear, and can't generally do anything useful when they're low mana and waiting for some to regen.\n\nP.S.
