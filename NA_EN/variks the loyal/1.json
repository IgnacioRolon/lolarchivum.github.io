Im not saying that cold steel needs to stay but dont think it will be that much of a passive.

So basically he mustn´t autoattack others if he want to use his Ult or Passive.\n\nIt has the smallest impact on Vlad, but it´s still stupid not being allowed to autoattack without losing the ability to heal yourself up again. But like I mentioned it has probably the least impact on him.\n\nIt could heavily impact Soraka (still less than ADCs/etc). You don´t have control over your teammates and your heals would be reduced on allies who attack someone with Thornmail. Additional the same situation like Vlad, you give up on additional damage (even if it´s not that great) for self heal (Q).\n\nAlso it hurts champions/playstyles which are based on draintanking from autoattacks -> Xin and Aatrox are such examples.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2017-06-28T21:37:38.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crewx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z8GJv8OZ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-28T21:04:40.964+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that&#x27;s what I thought.\n> \n> I have a feeling it&#x27;ll either push out Randuin&#x27;s Omen as an item, or Randuin&#x27;s will always prove better, since they share the same passive.\n\nTrue.
