I would even consider her my main.  I've tried Braum and really liked his skillset also.  I'll be giving Nautilus and Taric a try for sure.  It seems that putting Support primary always lands me that role, so I'm thinking I can earn enough IP trying to master the champions I have while I save up for others.  I'm also finding that non-squishy Supports are helpful while I go through the growing pains of facechecking bushes to lay down wards.  :o\n\nMy knowledge of Support would be okay for someone as new as I am.  I'm big on Vision Control, and thanks to other MOBA's, I have a decent understanding of pings and using the minimap to my advantage.  \n\nJungle is a different issue.  I understand the paths, buffs, and objectives to a basic extent (Thank you Youtube!), but when to gank, how to see it, ect., are still difficult for me to determine.  I suppose experience and further study will help me clear the fog.\n\nLeague is a much different MOBA than DOTA, D&T, and HOTS are.  I'm just thankful that the core mechanical skills are largely the same.  But even if I knew everything, I would never stop trying to learn.  It's the nature of the beast.  :)\n\nCurrent Supports: {{champion:1}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:16}}   Next Target: {{champion:37}} \nCurrent Junglers: (Laugh if you must!) {{champion:32}} {{champion:19}}   Next Target: {{champion:76}} \n\nThese are subject to change as I learn new things, of course.

Having to remember the cds of 3 abilities you can&#x27;t see at the same time just adds to the difficulty.  While I say go for it if that is what you want I just wanna warn you that she is very time based, she doesn&#x27;t have the luxury of trying over and over for good ganks, she has to be there and get the kills to snowball.  If you are still trying to figure out when to gank then you are gonna have a lot of trouble succeeding on her.\n> \n> But you can definitely learn a lot from nid if you pay attention.\n> \n> Anyways, I am just here to give advice, ominous warnings, and moan about the beautiful beast that is Taric.  Since you have some goals in mind just shoot me a message if you ever need advice, whether it be game, champion, or just generally want someone to chat with.\n\nI just gave Taric a run in a custom game trying to support an Intermediate Bot (it's just not the same), and I like his kit too.  The only reason Sona was next on my list was her kit seems to be the most like those that I mained in other MOBA's.  Going to give Nautilus a run now, see how he plays out.  But Taric has become my next Support Target.  :)\n\nI targeted Nidalee because she seems to be the only other Jungler aside from Evelynn that isn't a 6300, and from reading the boards and watching some of the worlds games, she is always there.  Her kit looks more difficult than the others, I will admit.  But I seem to be leaning more towards Support at this point.  If I somehow draw Jungle, I can fall back on my two \"newbie\" junglers for those games, or try out a free rotation when they aren't Nocturne and Gragas.  Warwick is my safe pick because of his sustain.  I don't know why people don't like him other than he can't really gank until 6.  His Attack Speed team buff is pretty amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2016-10-12T03:55:56.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW is very strong until you know how to deal with him.

I haven't gotten the chance to really use him in PvP, and of course, bots aren't going to do anything fun enough to expose such a trick.  I consider them both \"get me by\" champions until I can afford better ones.  But I will say that clearing is easier with Warwick, and team fighting is easier with Amumu, though neither seem to have the real power of a true Jungler.\n\nBut I queue up as Support/Jungle, so I almost never get anything but Support.  I should probably try to broaden my horizons some, but I'm finding a comfort zone in the Support Role.  :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Solitair","date":"2016-10-11T21:55:22.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing a lot of him since he appeared in worlds.
