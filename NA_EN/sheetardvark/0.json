(sarcasm)\n\nThe mute button solution is so simple. I think most LoL players know how to press a button. And, on the positive side, the ones who decide to not be toxic and join the voice chat enjoy an easier communication. \n\nMany games have implemented voice chat and have been successful. Dota, for example, has a much smoother communication process. Sure, you get some toxic players every now and then, but then, again, the mute button is just 1 click away. You could even have the option of leaving it muted by default.\n\n[]s","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-12-14T21:34:22.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. this thread was months ago, drop it.\n\n2. league is far more toxic than dota, so u cant compare.\n\nIt's sad you went so far back just to comment on stuff","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wildmartinis","date":"2018-03-16T01:18:05.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the point of having mics then if half of your team is gonna be muted because they're being obnoxious?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SKTT1 da 1","date":"2018-01-05T22:26:56.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dragneels","date":"2017-12-14T15:50:16.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are actually in progress of implementing the voice chat if you read the last update on Ask Riot or Riot Pls or whatever it's called.","replies":[]},{"poster":"newbyplsbeeasy","date":"2018-07-25T01:56:21.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"pls add the mic in this game cause I gotta talk, and i dont wanna type.","replies":[]}]}
