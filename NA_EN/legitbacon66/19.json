In the current meta where everyone bitches about lvl 2 ganks, either shove hard enough at lvl 2 that you can back off early, or play defensive so you're not open for a gank.\n\nIf you do get ganked and set behind, invest in defensive options (corrupting pot, coin in case you miss CS) so you can get back into the game.\n\nI had a game on Trundle where I died twice to Camille in like five min and was behind about 30 CS by 10 min but I was still able to beat her through proper building and defensive play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-02-26T23:47:40.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you don't hug turret or you overextend?","replies":[]}]}
