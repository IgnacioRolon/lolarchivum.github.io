Those who main Bard may shine, but he's never going to be freelo.

If you get hit by a Morgana Q then Bard being there isn't going to be of much use unless he can actually manage to land a stun with his Q. How about you don't get hit by Morg's Q instead of QQing about Bard's not being in lane and his heal being low?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
