So this is a matter of perceived effect of Autofill VS the actual effect of Autofill.\n\n>do you really value queue times over game quality?\n\nQueue times go hand in hand with game quality.\nThey don't go separately. If there are instant queue pops,\nthere can be two scenarios playing out:\n\n1. Player number, role distribution, player ELO is equal across the board.\n2. Matchmaker doesn't care about ELO or roles, it just fills teams with 5 people.\n\nSince the first scenario is the ideal one, it's only theoretical.\nThe second scenario is also not true.\n\nWe firmly sit somewhere in the middle and until the problem with Supports is resolved, the need for Autofill is going to be real, even if the players don't agree with that. The data is simply on the side of Autofill existing. Why would Riot even implement it if everything was ideal before and there were no problems with people getting their roles?\n\n>before perma autofill was implemented, the quality of my games was fine\n\nYou are looking at this problem from your perspective only.\nRiot needs to look at a bigger picture and that's data from millions and millions of games, across the servers and across ELOs. That data says that queue times are long and the match quality is bad, resulting from the long queue times. One way to fix it is to implement Autofill and have some people in roles that the teams need. It isn't an ideal solution but it's not like people are getting autofilled game after game, never getting their desired roles. Autofill was designed with that in mind, which makes is way better than what we had to deal with under the old SQ system, which had the requirement of having to autofill if you're close to the last pick in a team.

Queue times will pile up to unreasonable levels without Autofill.\n\nIt's all because people refuse to learn how to play 3 champions that aren't carries (AKA: Vayne/Yasuo/Riven/Lee Sin/Rengar). Maybe if people (pointing the finger to you too) would learn some easy shit like Morgana, Soraka, and Nautilus, we wouldn't NEED Autofill in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"LegitBacon66","date":"2017-01-09T15:30:55.670+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"But we did dynamic queue and my queue times barely were longer.

Maybe at most 2 minutes longer\n\nThings dynamic queue had going for it:\n\n* People didn't realize \"Fill\" and \"Support\" were practically the same thing so you had more people choosing \"Fill,\" but that number was going down every single week as \"Fill\"-ers who didn't want to support 50% of the time dropped \"Fill\", and then ones who didn't want to support 75% of the time, and then those who didn't want to support 95% of the time. \"Fill\" became even closer to being synonymous with \"Support\" as supports rose in demand.\n* It allowed people who played in groups to play the game. The popularity of this feature meant that the queue had a bigger pool of players to choose from to minimize queue times due to MMR disparities, geographical proximity for better connection speeds, and other factors (although overall popularity doesn't do much to help with the role selection slowdown, this still affects total queue time)\n* It required player groups to always cover at least 1 more role than the group had members, and these groups generally contain players whose favorite things in the game spread out across a variety of tastes. Every 4-man group was required to have \"Support\" as a primary or secondary role somewhere in the group, and a group of 3 was required to cover 4 roles and was far more likely to have \"Support\" as one of them compared to 3 random solo queue-ers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-09T16:55:54.363+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot needs to fix the support role first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanctimonious","date":"2017-01-09T12:16:41.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#BringBackSeason5SoloQ","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2017-01-09T13:12:50.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you want pick order back?
