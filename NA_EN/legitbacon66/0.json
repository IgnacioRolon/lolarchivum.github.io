Whatever that means. How can I convert it to an MP4 for youtube?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T16:51:26.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays are still new and in testing so there's still a lot of knowledge to gain.  Per the [Replay FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/234965248-Replays-FAQ-Pro-Tips), You should be able to record your games as a .webm and view it through your browser.  I'm not sure if you can currently upload it to Youtube, but I could be wrong.  I suggest sharing your feedback and asking over at the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards in case there are other options.  Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
