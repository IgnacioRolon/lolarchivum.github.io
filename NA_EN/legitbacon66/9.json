Her Pounce's CD is a 5s base, meaning it goes to as low as 3s. It pounces 375 base, 750 (Double) when hopping towards a marked enemy. LB's Dash is 10s, going down to as low as 6s. Has 700 range and an undo button to it. It takes Nidalee two pounces, which is about 3s to go around the same amount of LB's dash, but now she has to wait 3s and hope she doesn't get rekt in that time. W in as LB and you can W back, doing the same amount of Burst as Nidalee while also having an 'Oh f-ck' button. \n\nHonestly, if you just land a slow on Nidalee, she gets destroyed. There's also the whole... Don't Chase Nidalee or Singed. Why? Because they'll outrun you in the bushes, do non-stop damage against you, and kite you to oblivion. So what do you do? You let them run at you. Nidalee's entire kit requires her to land a spear then pounce at you. If she pounces at you, she doesn't have an undo button. If she jumps and can't kill her target because they dashed before her Q hits, she's now completely and utterly screwed since most dashes are 500ish range (Including flash) and her own is only 375, unless marked. Have her pounce, do a little side step and show her what the Back Hand was invented for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-06-24T21:43:13.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Nid's leap can be easily stopped\"\nAnd LB's can't be?\n\nGet out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-06-24T06:05:41.006+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:92}} ???","replies":[{"poster":"Angel ViolÃ©t","date":"2015-06-24T21:25:46.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you put it that way\n{{champion:36}}  R","replies":[]},{"poster":"LegendmakerGX","date":"2015-06-24T08:36:26.779+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"You forgot the king of them all.
