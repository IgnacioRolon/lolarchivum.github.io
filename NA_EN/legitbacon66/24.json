In teamfights, having the E every 3 seconds (and that considering that you already got a 40% CDR) doesn't mean much with that small damage (it wasn't even very damagy before...)\nI agree the new tank jung item is going to be good for him, but the changes to the champion itself are clearly a nerf.

It's MUCH more reliable than having his W as his main dmg source becuase his W is usually just destroyed becore he can even fully utilize it. And he'll do even more dmg with that new jungle item.\n\nHe'll also have more CC, seeing that he can use his e more than once in a teamfight now.

I understand people may find the game less enjoyable with kassadin deleting your adc off the map and than blinking out. But a lot of the current nerfs are directed in the wrong direction. It's sad how at the beginning of the season there was so much champion diversity and whenever a champion finds a place in the meta he is quickly nerfed out. I think it would be so much funner to have 15 viable jungle picks rather than 3 or 4. The only way to do this is not nerf the champions that we feel are OP. There only OP because there counterparts in the jungle are under powered.

Even though the Q (which is pretty much only used to slow and reposition now, except of a more burst based spell in the early game) is a bit weak, i believe that it is needed. Any changes i want to see? I believe a change on his E ratio should be changed. I like the fact that his max health scales the shield, but there's absolutely no reason to get more than 1 item which increases his health (RoA and RcS). i believe if they increased the health ratio a bit, or atleast make it increase with AP (like 0.15 AP ratio or maybe 0.20) would be a great change for him, so that he isn't a total pounching bag, if he decides to do a play with a tasty Q-E-Ult combo.\nOverall, i am looking forward to be able to play him again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L7xLoTek","date":"2015-03-09T20:33:03.444+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those Skarner changes...
