Seriously this ability of all abilities in existence needs to have a mana cost. In my opinion his ultimate should work better with mana as a risk reward. Basically the ultimate will cost you 100 mana. So you if you use it to escape, it burns 100 mana; however, if you use it on a target, depend how many targets you hit or maybe just at least 1-2 champions, you get mana _refunded_ back you. Basically it rewards you for going in with your ultimate so it returns your mana back because you didn&#039;t escape, but if you escape just like that you burn 100 mana. It allows for strategic decisions when playing Ekko, and he will use up mana.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for the feed back! Just one other thing I should mention. This is not a QQ thread about Ekko. I am actually perfectly fine with his kit, I an just stating my opinion he should be changed a bit to offer balance.
