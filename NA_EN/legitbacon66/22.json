And this can be frustrating for a lot of players because they don't know how to counter him. I don't think he should be receiving this rework because in ranked, he does not have a lot of viability in anything past gold. If he were to receive a rework like Kindred's, I wanna see his W get changed into something new, I feel like this is the thing that frustrates people the most about Yasuo, that he can block all projectiles for 4 seconds. Apart from that, everything should stay close to the same.","replies":[]}]}
