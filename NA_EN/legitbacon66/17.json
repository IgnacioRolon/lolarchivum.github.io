I mean it is to the point that when a team has a lead half the time at 20 minutes Monte and Doa are calling the game over, and sometimes before that. Even they are talking about the games being boring.\n\nNA and EU might be clown fiestas sometimes, but at least it makes it entertaining for the \"watching a train wreck\" factor. The \"good\" games are just so boring to watch I don't bother sometimes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-03-15T01:14:46.342+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.

Nothing quite beats adding free 20% lifesteal, 200 on-hit damage, or 400 instant AoE burst damage to a kit. I get that they want keystones to be powerful and impactful.

The part where you can stalk pros' builds..\n\nif you click the match overview, most games tend to have a fairly constant slope until the end of the game...meaning in general the first team to take a gold advantage keeps it until they win. They grow it little by little by pressing that small advantage while the opposing team avoids any risk and consequently falls further and further behind, objective by objective. Eventually they will be forced to make a move, but the winning team dictates the game, plays to their win condition typically leaving little opening for a comeback, unless some big mistake \"throw\" is made\n\nThis is mostly a professional league problem...solo Q is so disorganized that unless youre playing very high elo, or you completely shat the bed and fed your lane 4+ kills, you almost always have some opportunity to come back for a win. The long death timers and weak towers give you that chance...\n\nin pro play, however, these players are so skilled they make very few mistakes. Thus, once someone gains an advantage, they typically keep it unless they make a monumental mistake. This happens sometimes, we see gold leads flipped and big swings...but yeah mostly it's the, \"first team to get a lead keeps it by playing hyper-cautiously until they everntually win through attrition\"\n\ndefinitely a boring season. Overpowered ADCs make this even more boring when graves and corki are staples and present in almost every game.\n-------\nidk, every season has its FotM optimal picks for each role. That's always been the case and still is...however i think that basically the optimal way to play the macro game translates to boring as fuck matches for the viewers. The game seems more punishing now than in the past, hence the already risk averse pros are even more risk averse these days","replies":[]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2016-03-14T18:23:30.027+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"My LCS watching has greatly declined compared to last season.

Towers, objetives, champions, minions, monsters, everything just desintegrates so fast.
