First they removed the burst from burst mages....so that casuals can get away and now they are planning an assassin rework? Whoever is in charge of the reworks should be given the sack. Just look at the state of rework Brand.....play rate dropped from 12% to 3.6% (champion.gg). Malzahar lost his damage and burst...Viktor lost his burst and got damge over time buff. \n\nYou are removing the goal people strive for...you are making the game too forgiving....you are killing your game.","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyNeedle","date":"2016-07-05T18:09:24.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor is still quite bursty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-07-05T20:24:21.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's almost like Brand requires a certain amount of skill now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-07-05T05:13:03.174+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"The hardcore players are the ones that won't leave.\nRiot can't drive them away with something as small as a few reworks and a queue change.\n\nSome of the competitive players are leaving, but that shift started before dynamic came out, and it happened naturally.\n\nGive it time, you will either leave or understand. either is really fine with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Noblewind","date":"2016-07-05T05:55:45.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exactly, many of this group, especially those in the pro scene, started playing in Season 1. It isn't unheard of to move away from a video game after having played it for 6 years. There are plenty of new, young players in LCS, and the general group of new hardcore players are actually busy playing the game and not reminiscing about the good ol' days on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-07-05T10:05:20.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah and without offending anyone but when i see those \"new young players\" many of them are SO FRICKIN BAD if they don't get their meta power picks it's saddening. \nThat's not skill.
