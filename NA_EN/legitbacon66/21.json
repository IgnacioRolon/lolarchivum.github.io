With adc's getting one shot by tanks by playing cait in solo q the extra range allows people to be safer. Also after the lethality buffs jhin and mf dumpster cait. Because once they get a dirk then they do so much more damage to cait. But if you really dislike cait that badly play ezreal into her hes safe and can poke her out :D","replies":[{"poster":"Hige","date":"2017-01-29T00:45:10.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I was being sarcastic bro lol\n\nI just had to point out the irony that Cait is not an issue in pro play, yet people keep asking nerfs for Cait which I find funny","replies":[{"poster":"Spârky","date":"2017-01-29T01:29:44.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahh i see and i agree with you but remember pro play and solo q are two way different things.
