Why does Yasuo negate all of that? He can scale whenever he wants. Just give him 2550 gold... + 2600 if he wants infinity edge. I feel like Yasuo&#039;s crit needs to work either with his flow bar or with his levels where the crit multiplier by level 13-16 reaches 2x but before that it will scale like 1.1/1.2/1.3 etc. He needs to be a late game niche.
