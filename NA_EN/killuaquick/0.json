You may also have problems like this if you are using any third parties that are interfering with the game.  As a first step, let's reset your bindings configuration to a fresh start and free of any corruption:\n\n\n1) Login\n2) Delete your PersistedSettings.json and input.ini files (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config)\n3) Go into a custom game\n4) Exit the custom game (you will now have the default settings)\n5)  Enter another custom game and save bindings to your preference.\n\nHopefully, this will get you fixed up!","replies":[]}]}
