The fact that bothers me is when you're waiting for say 20 minutes, you have to stay in the lobby on the screen saying, \"Low Priority Queue\". You have to stay on this screen until you wait your time up and get into champ select, or you just leave the queue, however, leaving the queue results in you having to wait again if you want to play another game. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I find this very stupid, I can not interact at all with friends online or change my runes or go into my collection or even look in the store. I think this feature should be changed. Keep the low priority/ leaver buster thing of course, but make it so I can at least interact with the client instead of waiting there for 20 minutes just to talk to one of my friends.\r\n {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T23:42:52.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This higher timer would only occur with a history of leaving, normally it's 5 minutes.  The lower priority queue is a good time to troubleshoot whatever is causing issues, and also very good at picking up a disconnection that would have otherwise been during the match.  \n\nIf you have issues causing you to leave, toss me some info and I'd be happy to help.  The suggestion to use the client is a good one, but you may want to give this suggestion direly to the client devs over at the [client boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)!","replies":[]}]}
