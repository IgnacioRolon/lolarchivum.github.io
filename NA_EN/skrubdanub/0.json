This gave me an instant loss and kicked me out of my promos. Like what the hell? How is that even allowed? And don't give me the \"you'll get back there\" response. Its ridiculous when I should have atleast one more game to play.\r\n\r\nSincerely a pissed off gamer.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-14T17:08:43.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"During promotional matches, a dodge counts as a loss. Because a crash disconnects your client from the servers, the server registers it as a dodge. The most common cause of a sudden disconnection/crash in champ select is an unstable connection to the servers. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) addresses the most common solutions for unstable connection, and I recommend giving them a go so this situation is less likely to happen in the future.\n\nIf you continue to see issues after working through that guide, I recommend reaching out to our tech specialists by [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with a set of logs using our [Hextech Repair Tool.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G U C C 1 x","date":"2016-07-14T03:23:13.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me multiple times today.
