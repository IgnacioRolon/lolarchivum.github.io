I'm just curious as to why players lose the same amount LP as normal when a teammate leaves the game? It's simply unfair to players that wanna climb and improve when a player leaves and makes the game an instant disadvantage, right? it would make sense to lose less LP then normal if a player leaves the game so you don't get punished as hard for taking a loss you did not deserve. I'm just curious about why this isn't implemented into the game? Of course, this is just me ranting about a feature I think that would help players of all ranks out, low elo scum like me and high elo players as well.","replies":[]}
