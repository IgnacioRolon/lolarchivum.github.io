Upon retrying and finally loading into game the game does not run properly.  I cannot see items, skills, health bars don't change, no chat, gold amount doesn't increase, etc.  Pretty much the only thing I can see is champions moving.  Reconnecting repeatedly does not solve the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T03:20:46.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that seems like a lot of visual errors pertaining to certain key aspects of the game which makes me feel like some of the game files are corrupted. Let's run a quick repair through the client options to make sure everything is still intact. Hit me back up after testing it in a practice game and let me know if you can see everything correctly again.","replies":[]}]}
