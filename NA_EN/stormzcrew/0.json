(Achievements concept)","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":132,"down_votes":7,"body":"https://zupimages.net/up/18/33/zgpb.jpg\n\n**Warning : This is a traduction of my french thread. I&#039;m a french player and my english may not be perfect, so please, do not hesitate to correct my mistakes and/or reformule my sentences.**\n\n\n**I&#039;m here to introduce a concept which took me a lot of time to prepare.**\nBefore we start, I&#039;d like to introduce myself : I&#039;m StormzCrew, I started playing League 5 or 6 years ago and I&#039;m a passionate gamer and an I.T. lover!\n\n_Achievements is a very popular mechanism among video games and I really wish it will be implemented in one of my favorites game, League Of Legends!_\n\n**But what are achievements?**\n\nThe achievement system is a common thing in the video game industries and you probably already know it or something similar such as: successes, achievements, exploits&hellip;\n\nIt&#039;s simple, you collect a prize list of different action that may be hard and keep a track of those achievements. For me, the pleasure is here, in the principle of a collection, and the pride to accomplish a really hard achievement! Do you even remember your first league game? Or your first Pentakill? I think it&#039;s really satisfying to watch back our own successes with a little nostalgia, remembering our good old moments on this game.\nMy Achievements system would fit in time and follow players throughout their progression. For this, a special tab would be dedicated to it in the &quot;collection&#039;s&quot; interface.\n\nOf course, this prize list is not an essential feature, but I think it would add a little something more to League of Legends.\nHere is the Achievements interface I designed:\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/4lif.jpg\n_This is the general interface of achievements._\n\nAchievements&#039; visual are composed by several small cases with a title, a goal, a progress bar, an indication of the level of difficulty and the game mode in which the achievement is achievable. There are several types of achievements: some are general, some are reserved for champions and other special achievements. We will see examples a little bit further!\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/19il.jpg\n_This is a case of an achievement_\n\n\n**What would achievements bring in League of Legends?**\n\nIt goes beyond a simple collection. This system will give a new goal to players and will break the monotony of some games. Also, it will allow players to discover new horizons and will encourage some people to play new champions or other game modes. It will be an accessible and motivating system for all players, even beginners.\n\n_Whether ranked or not, and in different games mode, achievements are very diverse, but they must respect some conditions&hellip;_\n\n**1- Do not interfere with the game during a game !**\n\nOf course, do not prejudice the gameplay in progress... As soon as I started working on my concept, my first thoughts was to bring a small additional goal to start a game of League of Legends. That being said, it should not conflict with the objectives of teammates or opponents during the game. The goal of this system is not to induce a player to succeed an achievement at the expense of the first game goal: to win and help his teammates.\n\n**2- No confusion: the Missions are the Missions! Achievements are Achievements!**\n\nThe 2nd point is to make sure not to encroach on the territory of the Missions recently added to the game. The utility of the Achievements is not to obtain a particular reward but to collect them, to compare with friends and to remember back some moment. Missions and Achievements are two very distinct things, it is important to note it.\n\n**3- Bad Achievements? A bad idea!**\n\nAs said in the first point, achievements should not prejudice on the gameplay. Initially, I thought that it would be fun to add 2-3 &quot;Bad-Luck Achievements&rdquo; such as : &ldquo;Die 10 times in the same game&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lose the game without destroying a single enemy turret&rdquo; or &ldquo;Get kicked by the Leaverbuster&rdquo;. The idea came to my mind because during our time on League of Legends we have all been at a point confronted to a very bad game or the need to be absent during a game. I thought that 2-3 Bad Luck Achievements wouldn&#039;t hurt with a humorous title and a limited number. But after reflection, I decided that it was a false good idea... Imagine that some people never die more than 10 times in the same game or that players are never AFK; They might be tempted to do it on purpose, and that&#039;s not the goal at all. So I just abandoned the idea of that kind of Achievements.\n\n**4- Do you know how far those data go?**\n\nHow much player data are kept by Riot Games? Personally, I do not know exactly. I have seen, over time, that League of Legends keeps a lot of game&#039;s data. That&#039;s why we have a lot of details about our accounts! For example, the season 7 report, which was delivered to us at the end of the season.\nThe Achievements system I present are limited to my knowledge of current data utilization. But how far can those possibilities go? Only Riot knows it!\n\n**5- Achievements for all!**\n\nAchievements that can only be achieved through Skins or available with RP contents? Why not! But for the moment I would like everyone to have a chance to achieve those without necessarily paying... That&#039;s why, for the moment, I do not propose an example, even if I have already worked on it, because skins are also a part of the game.\n\n**-6 Come on! Maybe a little reward?!**\n\nEven if it is not the goal of the Achievements, small rewards can also be unlocked, such as Summoner Icons or Emotes, without excess, to not collide with Missions (as stated in paragraph 2). For example, arriving at a total of 150 Achievements could earn you a Summoner icon.\n\n**There are 3 types of Achievements:**\n\n**General Achievements: **These are mainly the Achievements you unlock during your journey on league, from a number of victorious game to the number of minions you killed since you started League.\nGeneral achievements also include special Achievement only available on normal or ranked mode.\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/4lif.jpg\n_Here is the general Achievement category_\n\n**Achievements for Champions:** As its title indicates, these are all the Achievements concerning the champions. For the moment, the champion system works in a very precise way. The 1st success will ask you to play for the 1st time the said champion, the 2nd will be a success based on one of the 3 base spells of the champion Q, W, E, (depending of the champion), the last success will be based on an action with the ultimate of your champion.\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/7kgf.jpg\n_Here is the Champions Achievements category_\n\n**Special Achievements:**\nIn this last part, all the Achievements of game modes, events or even out of the game Achievements are gathered. This part can bring together more &quot;fun Achievements&quot; and very special ones...\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/z2wc.jpg\n_Here is the category of special Achievements_\n\n\n**Due to the high number of Achievements I already created, here are some more visual examples of the different categories**\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/oxgf.jpg\n_Achievements for assistances_\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/j6e6.jpg\n_Achievements for Poppy_\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/2z7o.jpg\n_Achievements for Poros, U.R.F and Jean-Michel_\n\nI would like to bring attention to a particular type of Achievement that you may have noticed in my examples, these are the hidden Achievements. These Achievements do not show their instructions unless you achieve them!\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/i084.jpg\n_This is the case of a hidden achievements_\n\n**Statistics are cool!**\n\nAs a big fan of statistics, I like to have lots of details about when and how. That&#039;s why I wanted to integrate a new page with new informations, and also show the rarest or most difficult Achievements to unlock!\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/cy9j.jpg\n_Statistics interface_\n\n**Notifications for completed Achievements**\n\nAfter a successful completion, it appears in the already existing notification area of the launcher.\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/vf7x.jpg\n_Image of Achievements notifications_\n\n**Additional idea: A message in the chat?**\nI was quite divised about this idea. At first, it sounded to me like a good idea! But after a careful consideration, this may not be the best idea I had. Of course, I only want the most difficult and rarest Achievements to be notified in the chat but would it add something ? Give your opinion!\n\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/dtw9.jpg\n\n**Bonus:**There&rsquo;s the different looks that achievement passed by during the conception.\nhttps://zupimages.net/up/18/33/3619.jpg\n\n**Thank you for taking the time to read everything!**\n\nThis conclude my presentation. And I had a lot of fun looking for different ideas and spending time on my concept. I do not hide it: it took me a lot of time and I worked really hard on this, but after several versions, I am really proud of the result! At this time, I realized visuals for more than 176 Achievements.\nIf you have any question, do not hesitate to ask! Whether in private or in comments. I did this work globally alone, but two persons helped me a lot for the correction and I really want to thanks them! On this words, I leave you, waiting for the pleasure of killing you on the field of justice!\n\nMy Discord : https://discord.gg/ENqaq2J\n\nEndearing end message\n\n_Sincerely, StormzCrew_","replies":[{"poster":"Pale Mask","date":"2018-08-14T12:08:38.579+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion achievements should definitely be a thing.\n\nI wouldn't mind getting specific rewards (summoner icons?) for completing them.","replies":[{"poster":"FlayBoy","date":"2018-08-14T13:11:21.048+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude that would be sick.

For example one of the awards for the god Ymir, who has a Nunu-type ult, would be \"damage 5 enemy gods will a single use of his ultimate.\" (idk if that actually is what it is or not). As you earn awards, which there are lots of general ones too, you gain points to show off a score on you profile page. On Xbox One and PS4 they are translated into achievements and trophies respectively...……\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that these being in the game have almost no true impact on the game, its more of a situation where if you see the requirements for an award is able to be completed then maybe you'll go for a play but other than that you are just playing normally and earning the achievement. But, that is also about how the achievement is designed; not for you go to out of the way to complete it, but have it earned by using the champion effectively to earn it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2018-08-14T19:23:37.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Stop feed omg noob\"\n\nBetter than Lorem Ipsum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janakin","date":"2018-08-14T15:23:32.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, great job with this!

I see a lot of \"our WoW-killer has to have achievements\" achievements, that substitute actual achievement for grind. For example, killing Herald 50 times: killing it once is a tiny achievement, barely worth mentioning. Doing this 50 times isn't a substantively new \"achievement,\" you've just done the same trivial thing 50 times. That's a phony achievement. I understand that this kind of achievement is very common in games these days, but that's done for profit (can't do the daily dungeon 100 times without logging in on 100 separate days, right?) rather than for fun.\n\nAnother problem I see is that LoL just doesn't have enough content. There may be more champions than any new player could possibly be expected to deal with, but that's a mile wide and inch deep. The achievements you've created mostly involve normal gameplay (winning, killing minions, etc.) and grinding matches on each champion, which boils down to playing a lot. Kill Herald 50 times? Sure. How about Baron? I didn't see an achievement for that, but I'm sure you thought of that. How about each Dragon? Each jungle monster? Minion kills are there. And we can't forget Vilemaw. But... that's pretty much it. LoL doesn't get an expansion every couple years that adds new zones, dungeons, and raids like MMOs do. But how about achievements for playing with and against each champion, right? And mirror matches! You could come up with literally thousands of new achievements by calculating combinations of team comps. But... does that sound as boring to you as it does to me? I don't care to see every permutation; I can just enter the equation into a calculator, mutter \"wow, that's a big number,\" and move on.\n\nFinally, I can see that you've made many of these achievements work in normals and ranked only, as many of them would be a lot easier and faster in customs or co-op. When someone got one of those achievements, they'd be able to proudly state that they got it in real matches. That's cool... for people who like normals and ranked more than customs or co-op. This is just yet another system that screws over everyone who doesn't want to join the crowd in the tryhard game modes. Unfortunately, I don't know how to solve that problem. Crank up the number requirements for achievement progress outside of normals/ranked? That's just grinding, not achievement.\n\nNeat idea, but I get the feeling that it just doesn't belong in LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silver Thunder25","date":"2018-08-15T03:42:24.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can't up vote?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nishant","date":"2018-08-15T00:58:14.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love these, but the client can hardly handle new additions and is still a laggy mess.
