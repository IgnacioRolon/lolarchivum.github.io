However, i&#039;m unsure if it&#039;s really worth it. Here is what Gold and Platinum have in common:\n\n* Both Gold and Platinum get a Victorious skin at the end of ranked season.\n* Both Gold and Platinum get a Summoner Icon.\n* Both Gold and Platinum get a Loading Screen boarder &amp; Banner Trim.\n\nOnly difference really is the color of that boarder, and the icon reflecting your rank. Not much difference really, apart from bragging rights. Do tell, do you guys think I should try reaching Platinum? At the beginning of this season, my goal was to reach Gold. I started out in Bronze II and climbed my way up, mostly solo but then getting friends to climb with me. After hitting Gold V, I was satisfied but people still wanted me to rank with them because i&#039;m a great Support Main. After some time, I found myself nearing Platinum and I don&#039;t know how to feel about it personally.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I risk my LP / dropping to reach it or stay put and enjoy Normals / URF / ARAM and not stress anymore?","replies":[]}
