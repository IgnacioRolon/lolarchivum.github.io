Although many are right about people not wanting the Support role because you&#039;re not getting kills therefore you don&#039;t feel like you impact the game ... it&#039;s boring at times (can be) and / or the fact Supports don&#039;t get much gold therefore they struggle. It could also be that if your team is struggling themselves, you can&#039;t carry them which is a huge concern for most people.\r\n\r\nAs a Support Main who&#039;s in Gold (yeah it&#039;s not impressive but that&#039;s my feat) my biggest problem is HOW Supports are treated in general. We&#039;re people too whom do everything to ensure the ADC and team survives every encounter while warding / doing what we can to make your lives easier. Granted, not all Supports are innocent either and can be toxic (let alone not even build a Sightstone ...) but more often I find myself getting raged at or treated like i&#039;m a bot.\r\n\r\nThis is very discouraging hence why people don&#039;t want to Support. I can&#039;t tell you how many times i&#039;ve been told to leave bottom lane because the ADC was a Ashe trying to dive a Tahm Kench and Ezreal. You can&#039;t expect me to save you when we&#039;re only 1 minute into the game but you want to get kills without peeling.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve seen ADCs go back into fights when i&#039;ve died trying to save them so they could flee, or when I say &quot;Brb warding&quot; and suddenly they go trying to pick a 1v2 fight over CS rather than wait for the only one whom can save them. Then i&#039;ve seen people rage at me for not going tank when i&#039;m Sona .... **Sona** whom has a score of 0 / 2 / 12 and my ADC is 7 / 2 / 3 but because the other lanes suffer, it&#039;s my fault for not going tanky or picking a tank champion. Although it might of &#039;helped&#039; that I went tank, it still wouldn&#039;t save the game if you chose a Nidalee vs a Malphite top.\r\n\r\nTreat your Supports like people, and not rage at them for mistakes either you or BOTH of you made. If something goes wrong, look at yourself and see if it really was the Support&#039;s fault, or you got caught and died before the Support could even get the chance of saving your hide. Again Supports aren&#039;t all innocent and can either KS often to make the ADC weak, or they&#039;re toxic / making mistakes for odd reasons ... but for the good Supports that do all they can to help you get fed, to help you live, to die for you ... don&#039;t treat them like bots. They chose or playing Support to ensure you guys win and are the only role to set aside kills to make the game easier for you to obtain that win.","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2016-03-10T21:58:12.262+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":0,"body":"that soraka and kog pic is from a hentai comic lol well done good post op tho :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ackelope","date":"2016-03-10T22:33:04.662+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"How might you know that? https://vsmallfires.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/kappa.png","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2016-03-10T22:37:42.408+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am not a good boy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2016-03-10T22:42:17.946+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Source please?

Today there is little argument that while winning a match has nothing to do with KDA, Riot has built a game thats built around KDA. What I mean is this. In League the largest game wide popups for \"GJ / pats on the back\" are all completely kill related. In league there is no popup for an \"assist streak!\" its all about kills. \n\nLet's talk about kills for a moment. A kill in league _just means_ you got the last hit and dealt the last 1 damage that ended up killing the player. Others could of set up the situation, done the other 99.9% damage, but you did the .1%. So with Riots (flawed) system, you get the game wide alert. Same thing with kill streaks. All you did was get the killing blow. You didn't do anything else. No one in any real game can 1v5. If you get a multi kill chances are there was at least 1 other person on your team involved. But Riot fails to recognize their contributions and instead chose to just focus on the killing blow. Riot created a selfish system that's completely built around kills.\n\nYou get the notification for the kill. in game when you open the players view, you see KDA front and center. In the post game window. Again you see KDA front and center. Riot preaches that the game is not about kills. That it is about objectives, working as a team, and eventually hopefully winning. Yet their game system is completely built around providing players with some form of satisfaction and recognition for kills only. Sure pros are better and know when to get the kill and when to not go after the vayne last hitting in the bot lane by herself when you could push and take an inhib instead of chasing her. Yet way to often someone or some people go after the Vayne.\n\nIf your team works together and kills the dragon or baron. You get some terrible yellow text in the chat box. If you have 4 people working to push a tower. You don't get anything. If you are in lane and your bot lane kills the enemy, your ADC (hopefully) gets a game wide alert saying \"duo kill!\". \n\nTheir game is completely built around recognizing killing blows. It is not built around recognizing teamwork and objectives. It all again comes down to practice what you preach. If you watch the LCS, you never see Phreak getting super worked up about how a team worked together to take an objective. He uses his normal voice for that. Suddenly throw in a fight and someone gets a penta kill? Watch and Phreaks voice and volume climb like a rocket. He will likely be standing the next time he is on camera. Again the system is built around the killing blows of one champion even though there were plenty of other teammates involved. \n\nSo once you understand that Riot has built a game which puts killing blows on a pedestal, that does not recognize teamwork or cooperation, then you can see why people don't play support. \n\nIf your ADC gets a kill in the bot lane, your ADC more often than not, did not 2v1. Your jungler or your support made a play and you capitalized on that. The support is not recognized for their contribution to the team. \n\nWhen you build a game that only rewards and provides recognition for kills and does not reward or recognize players who contributed to kills, or objectives its easy to see why A. No one plays support. (because you are not recognized for your contributions. Either by Riot and the game, or by your team) and B.  They want to feel recognized, that someone out there will notice that they are contributing to the team and that the rest of the team knows it. Instead it's through killing blows. This right here is the reason you see some supports taking CS or \"accidentally getting the killing blow\" (P.S. It wasn't a mistake)\n\nThis is why people play ADC, why they play mid. People want to be the one to get the kills. Not because kills mean you win, but because League rewards and recognizes kills. That somehow your KDA means you are amazing. Everyone wants to see their name up there with PENTA KILL! Its just a failed design and it's really easy to see why the community judges the performance of one another by kills and deaths alone. You die 3 times in lane? The general response \"Man you are terrible\" look at that he has a negative KDA. The reason doesn't matter. You have a negative KDA you are obviously terrible. That's the game they made. \n\nIt is 100% on Riot and how they have designed league over the last 6 years to understand how we got here and how people are 100% kill focused for the most part. Sure some people will realize the clear objective when it counts, but everyone wants their name in lights. They want to feel like they are the important one responsible for the victory. Riot's League provides that. \n\n\nSo again it is really easy to see why people don't like playing support. Simply put, you are never recognized for your contributions. You have an assists percent of 100%? You were involved with every kill your team had? Nothing. Not a peep. Your ADC does poorly? You are immediately blamed. \"he is the ADC super carry amazing player with the god complex! he can't do anything wrong.\" He goes in for a poor trade and dies? \"why didn't you support me?\". Enemy jungle comes in over a wall for a gank \"Why didnt you have a ward there?\" It is _always _ the supports fault. If you ever find an ADC who recognizes their own mistakes and carries them on their own shoulders. Friend them. You just found a freaking 4 carrot diamond in the ocean. \n\nTLDR:            Riot created a game that is \"supposed\" to be about teamwork, taking objectives, and working together for a victory. Instead they created a game which only provides recognition for kills. Their game keeps KDA front and center. The champion screen? CS and KDA. Post game? KDA. The game only provides recognition for kills. It does not recognize all the other people who participated in that kill or set up the situation much less the whole point of the game which is to work together as a team, take objectives and hopefully win. Sure we got the \"assists\" tally, but again it is not recognized in game. Just the killing blow. The community is focused on kills because that's the game Riot made. Kills and Deaths are the stats Riot force feeds us. So we natually use them as a way to judge another players performance. If you didn't get the killing blow, but did the other 99% of the work. Riot doesn't care. They don't give a shit. Teemo got the killing blow and thus gets his name in lights! Riot provides virtually no recognition for taking objectives or the contributions people made which ultimately (hopefully) lead to your teams victory.\n\n\nIts like we are playing CoD and you are 100% focused on your KDA and the player with the most kills is your teams best player. Except its not team deathmatch. Its capture and control with infinite respawn. Kills don't mean shit.

All worked out fine.\n\nRight now I just don't want to play at all xD I'm meeting so many really stupid people. These \"ADCs\" who are getting caught by EVERY hook/grab/something, die and then go like \"OMFG THIS LANE IS SO LOST, CAN'T WIN LANE WITH A FKING LULU\"...no, honey. YOU can't win your lane because YOUR positioning is aweful. Because you are overextending. I pinged you to not stay here with your 50 HP, but instead of recalling you turned around and you ran straight in their faces....what do you want me to do? You are constantly out of position, constantly getting caught, so what do you want me to do? Lately, some of them were so bad and so toxic that I left botlane to support our mid because it was just no helping them anyways. Seriously, I'm not the best player or ADC myself but if you can't even get basic positioning right and are overextending af, DON'T BLAME YOUR SUPPORT! I can't do more than put everything I have on the table to correct YOUR mistake, but some people just don't want to be saved! I save them AND THEY RUN STRAIGHT BACK IN! Just to blame it on me.

Ice Queen's Claim is a good recent example. \nIt's been gutted for being good on ap mids. I'd rather have the old spooky ghost item back (the name eludes my memory..), and old Frost Queen active.\n\nLikewise many support items were removed or completely changed to suit other roles better. \nThe only auras I can think of off the top of my head is Locket of the Iron Solari's meager resist aura, and Banner of Command's minion buffing aura. We used to have lifesteal, cooldown reduction, spellvamp, armor+resist, health regen, and even attack damage auras.\n\nWhat actives we supports do still have have been nerfed due to tanks/fighters/mages using them too much as well. So rather than them becoming unappealing items for those classes, they became just unappealing in general.\n\nNowadays if you don't play a mage or tank in the support spot you're just gimping yourself. I will continue to gimp myself as much as I need to, I'm not giving up Soraka no matter how much Riot nerfs and reworks her. :/\n\nI feel really bad for Janna and Lulu mains.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-03-11T05:39:37.949+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"PSA: if you are fed as an ADC and win the game toss your support a \"/all This Janna too op\" at the end before you gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larnexe","date":"2016-03-11T13:35:36.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL:DR, Play some non meta supports and do good as them if you want people to acknowledge you as a support player and not just some bot that they blame everything on. PS: Junglers feel the pain of that blame too.{{item:3070}} \n\nI have mained support for a few years now. I just played whatever when I started league back when {{champion:69}}  was released. Then around season 3 I bought {{champion:37}} and never really went away from support as a main role. You are gonna get stuck with dem feels but Rito has tried making it easier for Supports believe it or not. Trinkets to help keep your item slots open for actual items instead of ward stacking all game, making warding a team effort. So I don't really complain that much when someone claims it's my fault, if it was I own up to it or call myself on it, if not I ignore it and just keep going at it. Just a side note, there are more supports out there then just the \"Support\" and \"Tank\" labeled supports. Play something new and fun as a support, do good at it, people will take notice and give you credit and stop treating you like crap. Ever do support {{champion:254}} , {{champion:28}} , or even someone like {{champion:35}}, some great fun, alot of bs slung your way in the start but if you know the support well enough and you do your best and get your ADC fed or help protect your team in a fight mid/late game it will be noticed especially on the non meta supports. Remember Meta is just purely a \"This is working the best and easiest in this role so why not just go with it\".","replies":[]}]}
