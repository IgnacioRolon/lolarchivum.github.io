Boring pose, with the art looking dull in comparison to the latest splashes ... generic and not to mention, her face bothers me the most. I mean from afar it doesn&#039;t look bad but up close-\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eg8BLay.png\r\n\r\nEessshh. There&#039;s no hurry of course, but a new splash / upgrade would suffice. I mean look at the fantastic job you guys did when making BBQ Leona&#039;s splash. The face looks way better and the expression matches her skin model too.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RSIzwBW.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you guys were to do this, I would most certainly appreciate it.

Doesn't look pretty? I mean she's not ugly but the eyebrows, eyes, and lips are exaggerated which throws the face off for me. Again from far away, it's alright but up close and it doesn't look great.\n\nEven if the face wasn't an issue, the splash of her's definitely could use some loving. I mean her pose is really dull and the art is outdated. Let's give her splash the {{champion:28}} treatment (I mean seriously what Riot did with Evelyn's splash was majestic as hell and wonderful.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-24T16:17:14.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks posed.

If there's worse champs out there I believe LoL should focus on what's important before moving on to what is average or sub-par. Plus, Leona {{champion:89}}  is an amazing champ. She's a very fun, balanced champ with a great kit, and one of the best engage supports in the game. And if you didn't know, her face is actually based off of Natalie Portman, so if you find a problem with her face then I guess that's more of a personal thing. A few bad splashes won't stop me from loving this champ. And like you said, some of the skin splashes are really well done.\nFrom yours truly, a 650 K mastery proud Leona main.\nP.S guys can main support too","replies":[]},{"poster":"dynamo312","date":"2016-12-24T16:28:54.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:117}} also too.","replies":[]}]}
