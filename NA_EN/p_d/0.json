It's pretty frustrating as this happens frequently (that's kinda the point of a laptop...). I've had this issue since i've had the laptop, and none of the popular solutions worked for me. I finally solved it, so i'll post my solution at the bottom along with a couple other solutions for others having this problem as I know how frustrating it is. \n\nPossible solutions: make sure v-sync is disabled both in game and in the nvidia control panel (or AMD equivalent). open the Xbox app, go to settings, make sure the \"record games and screenshots\" button is off. There are probably a few other things that may cause this that I'm forgetting, but these are the big 3. None of these worked for me, so if that's the case for you then read below for my solution. \n\nopen file explorer and go to  C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.198\\deploy\n\nright click \"league of legends.exe\" and select \"properties\"\n\ngo to the compatibility tab\n\ncheck the \"disable fullscreen optimizations\" box and hit \"apply\"\n\nAfter that you should be back to regular uncapped fps without any input lag. \n\nHope this helps anyone else suffering from this problem as well that can't find a solution yet! \n\nCredit to /u/Bluemer_98 on this reddit thread that I randomly found. https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7hy5qo/fullscreen_capped_at_60_fps_borderlesswindowed/?st=jbq7h6vm&amp;sh=bd04c303\n\nIf you know him give him a hug, he's a god.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-28T22:22:20.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be happening from the laptop power settings for AC power and battery power being different.
