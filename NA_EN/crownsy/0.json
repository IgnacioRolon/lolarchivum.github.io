The others are Red's patting themselves on the back for the new Xerath/Azir short stories (fine, i like them too, but do we really need 20 red posts saying \"you're right, they are awesome!\" in that thread while topics like EC ping, champ diversity, and other questions go ignored though?), riot themed pumpkins, and promises to play a round with a person who is about to hit 1000 wins (again, no problem with that, that's a cool gesture, just question where the effort is in other areas.)\r\n\r\nIt just seems to me that the amount of riot interactions on substantive issues has hit a brick wall since we swapped to this kinja inspired mess.  on the old boards, we seemed to have active red's in both the game play and champ threads who were very helpful to understand where riot's head was at on certain issues.  Now it seems like they stick to fluff posts and stay out of gameplay discussions.  \r\n\r\nIs it a question of the Red's learning the new boards too? Removing red's dedicated to one forum? just sample bias early because everyone is busy wrapping up worlds?","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-10-21T17:48:41.807+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is happening for a few reasons:\n\n1. Worlds, but you knew this.\n2. Preseason is coming. Again, this is obvious.\n3. The boards failed their intended purpose.\n\n>***Rito White Knights:*** But Pryo! How can you say that? We have moderation! We have new forums!\n\nSimply put, the Boards were designed around a few points. While they have minor (and debatable) success in scarce few scenarios, the real purpose for all these changes was not realized. New =/= better, and should be judged solely on whether or not it was actually successful.\n\n1. **Moderation** - Just starting here because I mentioned it above, a part of the boards purpose was to improve upon both the tools, methods, and results of the moderation team, while also increasing our own ability to self moderate. While they did indeed give us a report button, they still have not addressed the issue of down-votes being far to influential early on, and completely ineffective later on. And that is only 1 half of the equation\n\n The other side is the moderation team themselves. They have been given new tools, and more presence. However, they are ineffective due to a) Still not giving very good feedback on why they moderated, b) still completely invisible, with no community faith (a problem they are responsible for both making and remedying), and c)very little oversight or actual influence. I think it is telling here that while they definitely have the potential to be either great heroes or top tier villians, they end up as the comedic relief of the forums.\n\n2. **Ease of finding the key topics** - One of the big reasons the Boards were created was to give view of the hot topics to Rito, so that they could easily find and respond to them. Thing is, we are getting even less communication than before. Even before worlds and preseason, Communication was pretty lite. This means 1 of two things:\n  1. *They can't find the hot topics.* - Pretty obvious fail right here. If the reason they aren't posting is that they truly cannot find said issues, then they both got rid of a platform that filled this purpose better while simultaneously forcing everyone on to a platform that was less efficient. Oops.\n  2. *They don't want to post* - Well, this is arguably worse. If they *can* find the hot issues, then they are purposefully remaining silent. The main issue and reason they used pre-boards to defend from the critique of ignoring player feedback was that it was hard to find said feedback. That being removed means that more response should come. So where is it?\n\n3. **Alienated Communities** - This is a big one. A promise of the boards was a new, better home for all communities. That said GD was given a tombstone and Communities like Lore Fans, RPers, Dominion players, TT Players, etc. were essentially told to hold their breath while Riot decided whether or not they deserved to have a home. Pretty messed up, considering they evicted these fans from their old home.\n\n4. **Discussion is all but dead.** - The more verbose will easily tell you that you that this board is really confining. But even the not nearly as verbose have probably at least run into the end of the reply string once. If you limit how we respond to one another, the conversation is essentially killed at some arbitrary point. Rioters heralded the boards as a better place to hold discussion, but GD never killed off conversation arbitrarily outside of the thread being locked, and even then people would occasionally just make a new thread to continue it. Right or wrong, that board still catered to discussion far better than this board did.\n\n5. **Circlejerk OP** - Rioters claimed this board would solve the problems of GD. When the community brought up the issue of the circlejerks, Rioters laughed at the notion that it was an issue, and mentioned it would be even less of a problem. They then turned around and buffed the circlejerks. The only way to fight circle jerks now is to out smurf them. WTF.\n\nIn the End, the boards are worse. I would continue with areas that Riot *did* succeed, but character limits.

Oh wel\n\nI think you just won the Boards for today.\n---\nI want to add one other point to what you have above, and that's aesthetics.\n\nWhy has the Boards been designed with this idea of flat functionality?  A long-form communication site is meant to foster a community and allow people to be really passionate about something.  I think some of the mechanical tools get us close, but the aesthetics just...don't.  \n\nThe Boards is kind of like I'm sitting in a hospital eating ice chips; it boils everything down to the absolute functional essence.  This is great for mechanics, but I feel like we're losing so much with that.  Why is the Boards not designed to match the new client UI?  Why are patterns and gradients almost completely nonexistent here, and why is the idea of little splashes of vibrant color so against the design philosophy?  \n---\nI'm going to link a picture made by a master artist (yours truly) in MS Paint that essentially tries to make the client's top bar UI look as close to the Boards' aesthetic design as possible.  Compare it to the actual client, and draw your own conclusions.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UkIUoHA.png","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-10-22T04:42:26.401+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Funny thing is, that is the actual character limit.

It literally burned my eyes, had to wear sunglasses for exposure exceeding 15 minutes.\n\nI get that this one isn't much easier for some people, and I do hope a middle ground could be reached. I never wanted it as dark as night, but you really shouldn't be winning the \"Who's brighter?\" contest with the sun either. When I initially made GDNight, I did so reactively, as I wanted a darker screen. If I were to go back and do it again, I might have made a different skin that actually incorporated a color other than grey. Not that I regret how it came out, but knowing what I know now about color design, it would likely be better.\n\n---\n\nI do like that mockup of the client, it actually looks pretty good for some MSPaint.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-10-22T05:08:50.653+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me preface this by saying:  I'm almost exclusively referring to the **way color is used and displayed** rather than the colors themselves.  I **love** the general UI as far as placement and functionality is concerned, it's easily the best looking forum I have ever seen in that regard.  **Despite this fact**, the platform seems lifeless to me.  I'll explain why.\n---\n\n>As for aesthetics, it would be hard to find a worse color scheme than the previous one. It literally burned my eyes, had to wear sunglasses for exposure exceeding 15 minutes.\n\nIt's not really about the color scheme, to be honest.  Everything here is just matte rectangles of either brown or various shades of teal; there's no depth, no vibrancy, no splashes of color, no personality, *nothing*.  I actually love the design as far as the clean lines and positioning of elements is concerned, but there's just...no ***life*** in the platform.  \n\nGo look at the client as a comparison; along the top there's a subtle pattern that looks etched into the background.  The Play button looks as though it was hewn from a bright metal block and sticks out dramatically.  All of the buttons and experience fields have gradients and three dimensional aesthetic elements.  The Riot fist icon for Riot Points has a red aura around it to add a splash of color.  The bottom bar has a shading pattern that is a similar theme to the top.  The buttons on the bottom right actually look like...buttons.\n\n^ Why is **this** not the theme for the Boards?  The client design is unique and vibrant, whereas the Boards is kind of bland in comparison.  The most important button on the **entire Boards**, Create Discussion, is literally just a flat brown rectangle with a tiny black line right inside the border; no effects whatsoever, and something that can be replicated in two seconds with MS paint by grabbing the color and drawing a rectangle with it.\n\nI get that a ton of flashy effects would not look good on this platform.  I do.  The thing is, there is *nothing* that sticks out about the platform to me other than the fact that the UI itself is brilliantly designed.  When I come to the site, there isn't anything I look for or that really catches my eye; it's just...nice.\n---\n**TL;DR: Why is the Boards platform a mere shadow of the aesthetic beauty that is the new League of Legends client and launcher?**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-10-22T00:39:52.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm so confused. I hate the boards. But like the Boards. But hate GD. Who is GD? I feel as if a lot of this is stuff that only smart people can know about. \n\nThe boards seem to have a good form but have many (MANY) problems as you have mentioned. Like Pryotra, Crownsy, and you have stated; the boards did not get much better. Discussions that deal mostly with champions aren't ever looked at. I've questioned many champions. Kassadin didn't really deserve his nerfs. Also, majority of the community on LoL that see any thread will most likely start with what's at the top. My Champion Idea was chosen to be PoTD once and though it got a few positive likes, majority asked why he was so weak compared to other adc's yet now we see many threads asking why adc's are so strong right now. But its not that they need nerfs. We forget that most or majority of the nerfs are towards melee champions. Why not keep them the same? How about asking the community about a nerf before the nerf happens? No player insight is given. We give out our comments on why and how it is wrong and forget to realize that the boards are dumb to begin with.\n\n---\n\nAs LoL should be a fun sport to play and watch, that should not be the primary focus for Riot to go towards. Summoners Rift has become the main place to play, except when a game mode appears. People on here have asked for it countless times, and Riot has yet to say more than *it will be back*. **When is *U.R.F* coming back?**\n\n---\nNow this is dumb, but, does anyone have any info on why the 7 champions have fog besides the thing each have in common?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-10-23T05:28:40.261+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hey!\n\nYour initial assumption is correct on \"why less reds\" - it has largely been due to Worlds (it's NUTS, as you can imagine) and hard work on preseason, Harrowing and other events that have us all more simultaneously \"heads down\" on the gameplay side than normal.\n\nFor us, posting format doesn't tend to affect our personal posting much (something I think would be different as a Rioter or a non-Rioter) because our posts are always called-out and easy to find for interested parties. I think the Skarner discussion on the boards beta was much better, for example, and resulted in extremely useful discussion that drove the second set of changes. Soraka was similar here to some extent.\n\nSo, the reason we're here less right now is usually present on GD annually around this time. Fall is bonkers for us, and things like preseason discussion and other big topics are still on PBE forums until we get closer to the finish line on that stuff. I will comment on a couple of key points you mentioned.\n\n1) is a good point, especially RE: moderation feedback. I'll kick this issue to the Boards team to see if we have any analysis or plans on this.\n\n5) I think is untrue of how Riot sees the circlejerking. I think that circlejerking is always native in ANY discussion - Rioters can do this to cherry-pick comments if we're not careful, and players can do this to show how \"everyone\" believes something to be true. It is an issue, but not special to LoL communications, it's a challenge in big communities.\n\nHas boards helped? A little in one way - basically \"useless\" stuff (ie \"GG u fucking trash\") is gone. This does clear the way for better comments. I think the upvote-sorting is super great. Your comment is at the top because there's resonance. Therefore lots of people see it. Therefore I see it quickly and can respond here (and we can thread it). I think that's pretty good.\n\nOne thing we've lost that I'm happy to see go is that the most verbose voice is no longer the loudest. As a developer, this was the biggest source of frustration via the player-side circle jerk (by a product of removing others from the conversation unless they had similar time and fortitude to batter on the gates) and seeing it gone lets us be involved with the most resonant stuff first.\n\nAs for Rioter-side circlejerk, there's an important distinction to be made. I totally agree it is ineffective and inauthentic to cherry-pick views that only support ours - right with you there. I do think deprioritizing extremely...shitty?... comments is fine. People who put effort into good critical discussion (again, see this post!) - especially on opposing points of view or critiques - should get top billing. I don't believe that's circle-jerking at all - that's fostering meaningful conversation that can affect change and actually get shit done. \n\nIf Rioters are choosing only SUPPORTIVE views, I would love to directly address that with individuals who exhibit that behavior and teach them better ones. If they're ignoring low-value bile, then that's fine. \n\nThanks for the post - good stuff.

If they're ignoring low-value bile, then that's fine. \n\nSee: The lore team. There are three topics in 'Story and Art' that have a red post in them. One is a thread made specifically for discussion on the Azir and Xerath story pieces. There are 11 red posts in that thread. 2 are the standard Lore Team Apology (I know we haven't been around much, but we'll be more likely to communicate with you in the future!), 4 are 'I'm not telling~' non-answers, 1 is Jaredan clarifying that he did not write the piece, 3 are him giving his own opinions on the characters (using the phrase 'I think' to indicate that this is not Riot's official stance), and one is just a joke.\n\nOne's a single red post in a thread entirely about theory. That red post comprises of three minor pieces of information to help people figure things out.\n\nThe third is likely the one that pisses people off the most. Of all the threads to comment in, Jaredan chose one explicitly praising Riot's storytelling to post in. Of the five posts, two are him doing the same thing gypseylord did in the Vi and Jinx thread, giving extra information to figure things out. One is another annoying non-answer, and another expresses their disbelief that people aren't willing to trust the lore team to follow up on hints they give out. The last one is them trying to express that Old Xerath and New Xerath are close enough that they should be considered the same character.\n\nAbsolutely none of those are responses to any of the myriad 'I don't like that they removed the League!' threads, including one that has 96 upvotes. I can kinda see that a red wouldn't want to post in that that thread, since it's already hostile to Riot, but they haven't even acknowledged our complaints, let alone made a thread to discuss them with us. Whatever their actual motives are, it genuinely feels like they're either ignoring us, or hoping that we forget about it so they don't have to deal with it.

Now the whole boards kinda just sit here, with occasional topics being talked about. Not that this is bad persay, just different. TBH, I'm probably as glad as you the old shit-tier posts are gone.\n\n> I think the upvote-sorting is super great.\n\nI think this is, at least in my eyes, the root cause of why circle jerking is such a problem. You shouldn't be effectively silenced for holding an unpopular opinion. I'm sure I can link examples if need be, but the fact is that this is actually easier on the Boards than it was on ye olde GD.\n\nI mean, if you were OP you would have to make a pretty good argument to stay open, but otherwise a few downvotes early never really silenced everyone. Here, if you are against the circlejerk, you might as well not speak.\n\n>One thing we've lost that I'm happy to see go is that the most verbose voice is no longer the loudest.\n\nAn interesting point. That said, I don't think it is gone. I mean, my post is arguably the longest here, and you have seen how much attention it garnered. I honestly feel that while the character limit has it's merits, the reply limit has none. I see no reason why my discussions have to end after x number of back-and-forths. It's also a little jarring when that happens, and I have seen it end multiple times.\n\n>If Rioters are choosing only SUPPORTIVE views, I would love to directly address that with individuals who exhibit that behavior and teach them better ones.\n\nSee: Lore team. I think they are the #1 offender at this time. Not that others don't exhibit it, but that department in particular seems to have made it a habit. That said, this may be due to the fact that lore fans no longer have 1 section to post in, and therefore have a hard time being seen by a red.\n\n---\nOverall, I don't actually hold much issue with the new boards. I feel they were handled very poorly, and forced on everyone far before a time that they were ready, and ultimately fail due to not being complete. If Rito had been patient, and crossed their I's and dotted their t's before turning in their project to GD, maybe they wouldn't be judged as failing. While this may sound like everything would be peachy if Rito just finished the boards, I think that I can speak for many when I say that at this point it won't be enough.\n\n Rito kinda wounded alot of communities with that forceful eviction from GD, and it will take Rito actively reaching out to these communities to help them. Tamat acting like they need to prove themselves by flooding Misc or GD before they get a home is pretty low in my book, and I hope that isn't actually what needs to happen in order to get a home for these groups.\n\nAnother thing that prevents success on the boards is, and this one is a little more personal, is how discussion is handled. It's pretty hampering to discussion when 1 reply gets all the attention, and this thread is proof. Look past my initial post here, and you get an idea how starved the other comments are for replys. If you switch to chronomode, I don't nearly dominate the discussion like I do in \"discussion\" mode. When you think about it, this means chronomode is *better than Discussion view for discussion*.\n\nOverall, while their are some pretty big hurdles to cross still, I feel that these boards do indeed have the potential to be better than anything we have experienced. It's not going to be easy, and will take loads of work and patience, but I think that the platform is far more capable of rising to the challenge.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-10-23T17:21:48.213+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"This is interesting - I see what you mean now as far as \"verbose.\" \n\nI was trying to use it to describe sheer post volume as voice volume - that was a major problem with the old GD.

As far as I'm aware, votes in the traditional sense have two primary functions:\n\n* Showing community opinion on a given post\n* Filtering content based on constructiveness\n\nThe problem is, these two things overlap in opposite directions in some ways.  Community opinion on a post might be in opposition (downvotes), but the post might be really constructive (upvotes).  What do?\n\nWhich is the more important thing: Filtering content by opinion or filtering content by constructiveness?  Arguably they are both equally important, and the question becomes whether it's possible to filter things \"properly\" with just a yes/no system to do so.\n\nWhat if votes were on a scale instead of up/down?  A 1-5 star sort of dealio or some other kind of gradient.

I would say most activity would be better, including all posts within and their vote counts as well, but I'm not certain how that would play out. Straight up vote count would be a terrible idea, as seen on youtube.\n\nIf I had my way, there would be a sort that was purely for traffic for default. Like, If I posted in a reply below my mine, say [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback/pIQUzrbj-new-boards-substantially-limiting-discussion-by-reds-on-key-issues?comment=0007#oembed-content-modal), I would effectively bump it to the top. This would probably need some form of \"sage\" feature, to allow you to post without affecting visibility, and some method to prevent 1 person from just bumping themselves without ever dropping from the top. So, If I would create a new reply to the OP, and you responded, I could reply to you to bump it 1 time, but if you didn't respond I would have no way to raise the post without someone elses help.\n\nPerhaps I'm thinking too complicated, but honestly I don't see a simple solution to this one. It's a problem inherent to reddit's design, one that the Boards all but copy. It will take something unconventional to solve it.\n\n>Is Reddit more successful at this in your eyes?\n\nThat is kind of hard to say. Reddit has areas where it works for them, but even more areas where it works against them.

I don't think that is exactly ideal, but as far as better or worse than here, I would probably lean towards usually worse while opportunistically better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoZfan03","date":"2014-10-23T17:54:54.419+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A word to the 'sheer number of votes' sorting method.

My way of dealing with this surprise retcon is to say, okay, lore community, let's step up to the challenge: they've abandoned the task of giving League of Legends a backstory beyond \"I guess it's like some alternate universe where they're fighting each other with Summoners backing them up\", so let's see what *we* can do.\n\nI'd much prefer some discussion of upcoming rewrites, particularly those that might further tear up the established foundations of canon, early enough that it can make a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2014-10-24T17:29:20.601+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'd much prefer some discussion of upcoming rewrites, particularly those that might further tear up the established foundations of canon, early enough that it can make a difference.\n\nI think that´s what´s troubling me most...I mean, without having the League in Place, why would I bother about any story they write from here on out?

I totally agree it is ineffective and inauthentic to cherry-pick views that only support ours - right with you there. I do think deprioritizing extremely...shitty?... comments is fine. People who put effort into good critical discussion (again, see this post!) - especially on opposing points of view or critiques - should get top billing. I don't believe that's circle-jerking at all - that's fostering meaningful conversation that can affect change and actually get shit done. \n\nMy main concern here is that shitposts and constructive minority opinions seem to get curated to the same spot by the community.  This could be because the community doesn't understand how downvotes are supposed to work.  Reddit says you're not supposed to downvote those you disagree with; you're supposed to downvote unconstructive or useless comments.  Here, we seem to largely downvote based on disagreement, even if the post is constructive, which makes some pretty interesting posts disappear.  Even a fair number of red posts get hidden by this.\n\nA couple proposals on this topic:\n1) Many subreddits have a \"controversial\" sort, which sorts by number of upvotes+downvotes.\n2) There is no stated policy on when to downvote on the universal rules.\n\n> If Rioters are choosing only SUPPORTIVE views, I would love to directly address that with individuals who exhibit that behavior and teach them better ones. If they're ignoring low-value bile, then that's fine. \n\nI do think that some Rioters choose to ignore dissent and respond only to supporters.

I will comment on a couple of key points you mentioned.\n\nMay I take this as Riot will get around to actually talking to the dominion community within the next full 30 days? By talking I mean actually discussions and not setting their community to the side and letting them rot. The Dom community deserves just as much respect as the lore community does, maybe even more so as they were promised something from the start. You had said that due to worlds being so close there was not much you can do as you had all the Worlds event planning and execution to do. You may have noticed but since there was zero responses to the Dom thread from riot after the Forums closure was announced the Dominion high ELO players have pretty much all left as they are not expecting anything from riot. If this is the message you are wanting to send your customers then you should have scraped dom in the first place, it sends the message that Riot is willing to abandon things they don't feel profit them anymore, which will in turn lead people to mistrust you as they will wonder how long until you abandon SR or TT (even more) as they are not as profitable as you want them to be.\n\nI'm no Dom player but the fact that i can see riot eventually just dumping TT or SR because its not as profitable by a 15% each year disturbs me, as a player I should never foresee that in a company. Profit margins aren't what you are making the game for please try to remember that, the player are waiting for you to remember them. :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlighte","date":"2014-10-23T10:38:25.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) is a good point, especially RE: moderation feedback.

Fall is bonkers for us, and things like preseason discussion and other big topics are still on PBE forums until we get closer to the finish line on that stuff.\n\nHere's the thing: Silence feels like the community is being completely ignored.  Logical explanation of silence feels as though there is a reason for it, and is far easier to understand.  It's impossible to cut someone some slack if you can't see it.\n\nA simple \"Hey guys, we're going to be putting our heads down a bit to work on the Preseason/go to Worlds for the next month or so; we'll try to address forum conversations but we can't realistically promise that.  Once we have a working prototype we would love to get feedback, but we're planning some crazy things down the line so we want to at least have something to use as discussion material.  Stay tuned!\" would suffice.\n\nRule of thumb: If informing the community about something **in the proper way** creates harsh negativity, it's likely there's something wrong with what's being informed.  Every example in Riot history I can think of (Dominion announcement, Magma Chamber, lore retcon, Boards transfer, lifetime RP decision, etc.) has been primarily due to the information being presented in the wrong way (or not at all).  \n\nUsing the Boards transfer as my primary example, it was done with extremely short notice and it **still** hasn't been explained why the move needed to happen that instant rather than a month or two down the line.  It would have gone much smoother with a longer adjustment period and actual reasoning, let alone features on the Boards to compensate for the loss of the old platform.\n\n>1) is a good point, especially RE: moderation feedback.

Your comment is at the top because there's resonance. Therefore lots of people see it. Therefore I see it quickly and can respond here (and we can thread it). I think that's pretty good.\n\nAgreed.  The issue becomes whether unpopular opinions are immediately stifled, and it's interesting to consider because (and this might be unpopular) that might not actually be a bad thing.  It's likely it is a reasonably negative thing in many situations, but in many others it holds merit.\n\nMy main issue with upvote sorting is that the earlier in a thread you post the more likely you are to get upvotes.
