You could double his healing instead but that would make grievous wounds too important for a non ultimate ability.  Just saying it how it is ;)","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-02-14T06:44:30.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you're not \"saying it how it is\", you're giving a terrible suggestion. Outside of his ult, his kit isn't weird at all. His interaction with grievous wounds isn't the issue.  A lot of his sustain comes from healing, therefore anti-healing items are strong against him. Those items are suboptimal compared to what people could be building instead, so they're hurting their overall build just to be good at killing Sylas. \n\nIf grievous wounds is too strong of a counter to Sylas, the solution isn't just to make him an exception to it. That's a lazy, cop-out way of going about things. Instead, you give him sustain in other ways. Increase his health and/or resistances. Make the shield on his E stronger, or have it refresh when he pulls himself to an enemy champion. There are so many ways to make his ability to trade better without hinging it entirely on one ability or making his heal ignore the thing that's supposed to counter healing.","replies":[{"poster":"Deliberate Inter","date":"2019-02-14T06:53:05.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-02-14T06:55:45.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Ad hominem\" is an attack on the person, calling your argument terrible is as far from ad hominem as I could get.
