When that department has a smaller job we could let some people go and hire new and potentially better people and yes,  more of the RIGHT people and more of the right initiatives certainly make things get done not only faster but better :)","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-03-04T07:09:03.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Yes, short term it would very much be the opposite of freeing up data but long term, no, false reports would be a thing of the past...\n\nEven in the long-term, they wouldn't be freeing up resources. The IFS is an automated system, so adding the function to punish invalid reports would simply waste resources without any gain of resources to compensate. Because, again; **_The system already handles invalid reports._**\n\n> ...and this functionality doesn't have to be there forever, the threat would be enough.\n\nHaving a threat without having the actual punishment would be found out quickly. You either punish for it, or you don't, you can't have some in-between where the threat exists and people fear for a punishment that isn't there.\n\nWhich, ironically, leads me into another subject of black &amp; white...\n\n> No, honest players wouldn't shy away from reporting, if they were really honest they would have the citizenship and conviction to speak their mind equally as if there were no threat of being arbitrarily punished. \n\nIf your only counterargument to the collateral damage is \"well, if they're honestly reporting, then they should have nothing to worry about\", then your biggest counterargument is fallacious. 'Cause guess what? _**Honest reports do not universally equate to valid reports.**_\n\nDifferent people have different understandings of toxicity, and there are some people who take even the lighter offenses of poor sportsmanship (\"gg ez\" for example) seriously. So should they be punished just because their idea of toxic doesn't 100% line up with Riot's?\n\nThe situation isn't this black and white \"if they're reporting honestly then their reports are valid and if they aren't then they're liars and should be punished\" - one can report honestly and have their report turn up invalid, just as someone can report maliciously and have their report turn up valid.\n\nArbitrarily punishing for false reports would not change that fact, and it would definitely cause undue harm simply for the fact that it would be wholly possible to be punished even while innocent.\n\nAnd until you can resolve that issue in your idea, then that's going to be a massive hole in it that keeps it from being remotely viable.\n\nEnd of discussion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2019-03-04T17:12:36.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Brony Gaymer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=HWXkquhR,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-03-04T05:55:32.400+0000)\n>\n> As mentioned earlier we can free up a lot of data and resources and introduce more respect and accountability to the community.  It's a positive positive.

Riot does and gets more with the same dollar.\n\nSomething you're missing here is that the IFS is a learning-based system. Say some clever troll type comes up with a new euphemism for \"kys\". At first, they'll get away with it since it's not recognized as toxicity yet. As he uses it more and more and other people use it, it'll eventually wind up on the naughty list and start triggering bans.\n\nThere are the instaban keywords, but there's a lot more than that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
