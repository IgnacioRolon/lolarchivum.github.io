Rogers is my ISP and I am from Toronto. My ping should be around 26-29, but recently it's been above 40 every game. The spikes fluctuate throughout the entire game every few seconds from 40 to 50 to 60 to 80. It's ridiculously annoying and hard to play with, I just don't know what to do anymore.. I tried turning off IPV6, I've tried opening Ports, I've contacted Riot support who do nothing but ask me to run WinMTR every single time only to have no real solution, all Rogers does is make me do speedtest.net and change my modem, I've had my modem changed over 10 times in the last 3 months.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to do, I'm stuck and nothing/nobody seems to help man.. fml..","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-10T02:37:00.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your tickets and it doesn't look like we were able to get the logs we needed to verify where the issue was coming from. It looks like we reached a point where we needed some traceroute logs from WinMTR but were unable to get them. Since you've already worked with our tech specialists on this issue, I strongly recommend reaching out in another [**support ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can pick up where we left off and finish troubleshooting this together.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":" Ćub","date":"2017-01-10T06:39:59.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I opened a new ticket! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
