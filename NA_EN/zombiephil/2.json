It doesn't really matter why, but the fact of the matter is your skill didn't show or wasn't enough that game and unskilled is a completely legitimate report about your performance that game. If you're more skilled and had an off game it won't matter much, because you'll win games and you'll be put against more difficult players either way. It really doesn't have any effect except that you may lose 1 or 2 LP from your next win (which the loss probably did more to hurt than the report if you're winning consistently and playing well consistently (and thus only being reported a few times and it doesn't effect your MMR much, because the majority of games you lose you still play decently in and aren't reported, and you win more than 50% so your MMR goes up).","replies":[{"poster":"Jeehawd","date":"2015-07-30T03:13:29.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk, i feel like 'unskilled' means you play as though you're a full tier under your elo, or don't understand basic gameplay if you're being reported in bronze.\n\nif you're consistently diving someone, that's intentional feeding. getting outplayed doesn't mean you're not skilled enough to play with those people. but i guess it's open to interpretation, i feel like reporting means they DRASTICALLY underperformed. to me, that's 0/10 or something with a loss of lane and no presence in objective control or teamfights. or if, for example, your jungler wants to swear that his job isn't to assist anyone else in a team-based game.\n\ni don't mean that this jungler didn't gank you because you fell behind and wanted to help the teammates who are relevant get ahead, i mean if the jungler picks {{champion:131}}  and then utterly refuses to gank any lanes.\n\nOr if your top laner picks teleport and uses it to teleport to a nexus turret in the laning phase because he thinks it's more effective than recall.","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-07-30T03:34:47.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I do overlook the fact that it is probably subjective and depends on rank to some degree. In normals there is probably much more variance, and 0-6 probably is someone who has no idea of the match up bc they are practicing a new champ. In the ranked games I play, an enemy getting FB from you and a kill roaming to another lane means you lost lane generally, going 0-3 means you lost lane hard and probably got dove by the jg and your lane bc you were too far behind to just play safe. In the games I play 0-6 is legitimately a player who is really struggling, because not only are they dying to a lane who beat them, but they are continually trying to fight them when they don't have enough damage to get the kill. Admittedly I'd rather have someone 0-6 on my team than someone 2-6 or like 3-10 or something, but unless they are 0-6 and went super tanky and die in team fights forcing the other team to focus someone worth no gold, then 0-6 means you had probably the worst game you have in your last 15-20 games if you're not dropping MMR in my experience of ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2015-07-30T16:46:20.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or if you are being a douche and play teemo vs nasus in ranked.\nNever first pick Nasus bois.\nThe nasus will go 0/3 or 0/6 and something like that cuz teemo is 2demon4u","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LuckySportiv","date":"2015-07-30T16:11:18.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Children will never understand someone can have a bad day, i mean if they had a bad day they wouldn't even realise because they'll manage to put the blame somewhere in his team, 99% of the cases on jungler, 1% of the cases, they play jungler ;) .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"woobee","date":"2015-07-29T21:28:50.698+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Braum's mother said so....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bladeworked","date":"2015-07-29T22:26:56.179+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If losing is a bannable offense, then EVERYONE in the community would be banned.\n\nWe've all lost a game sometime somehow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-07-30T00:33:56.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I report Everyone every time something I don't like happens.\nNot like it's unjustified; that guy is a bastard.\n\n*(Waits for down votes from the ignorant masses.)*","replies":[{"poster":"DeerGreenwood","date":"2015-07-30T01:42:44.648+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you should report everything that goes wrong.

People crying about how their ally is feeding or how they are verbally abusing them or w/e the case may be. It's childish trying to collect reports. It's actually pathetic.\n> \n> I call bs if you say you've never been reported though.\n\nI have no idea if I have ever been reported.. I said I have never gotten that pop up that says something about having a bad day and modify your behavior.\n\nAnd yea.. I guess I must be the 1 in a million.. Every other player gets reported every other game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-07-29T20:24:30.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now, maybe I'm missing something, but in the long run wouldn't it be *better* for them to report everyone after each game they lose?
