I am getting sick of the kill steal crybabies that are on League of Legends. I don't mind the ones that just simply type, \"KS\", when it really was a KS and in that case I would apologize. But 99.9999999999% of the time, the people that type KS don't know what it is.\n\nKILL STEALING\n\nIT IS **NOT**\n- You not awarded a kill because someone else got a last hit in a kill that was not guaranteed (meaning the enemy could've escaped)\n- You not getting the last hit on an enemy in a team fight where everyone dealt some damage.\n- You not awarded a kill that you **thought** you \"deserved\". What I mean is there are some noob Ashe/Jinx/Ezreal players that cry KS just because someone killed an enemy before the noob's Arrow/Rocket hits the enemy. Sorry, I am not risking letting the enemy run away just so you can show your friends your 3/4 map shot. I mean cmon! Where is the logic in that? It is 100% (scratch that 110%) not a KS if you don't even get the assist.\n\nIT IS A KS WHEN....\n- You sit there in the bush and jump out at the last second to get a kill that was already secured. I know some of you say \"Kill Secured\" but if the kill is already secure and you jump in to get the last hit that is a ks.\n- Ulting just to get a kill that is already secured. Similar to the last point, only even worse. Not only did you KS, you just put your team at a disadvantage because you used up your ult just to get a kill. Ex. Jarvan IV just trapped Ashe in his Arena Ult thing and he has full health while Ashe has 20% health. Your jungler is also coming. There is no way that Ashe is going to escape that. Yet Jinx decides to ult to attempt to get an already secured kill. That is absolutely ks. And then 20 seconds later when her ult is needed it is on cooldown and would not have been had Jinx not tried to get a kill.\n- Some of you say its teamwork and that it doesn't matter who gets the kill. Look, League of Legends it is all about helping your team. So let me ask you this. How is it helping the team if you sit around waiting for last hits and doing nothing else? Or, how is it helping the team to waste your ult?\n\nREPORTED FOR KS\n-KS is not a punishable offense even if it falls under the \"It is a ks\" category. So those who say they are reporting KS, they are just dumb. They are just spamming the Tribunal and then their reports will mean nothing. So don't worry about being banned for KS. Now wasting ults and sitting around doing nothing except getting last hits is a different story. Would be something like \"Assisting Enemy Team\".\n-The crybabies that say KS are the ones who will be reported. Either Negative Attitude if he just simply types KS, or Verbal Abuse/Offensive Language if he starts flaming or cursing. \n\nTHREATEN TO AFK\n-Just ignore them. They obviously don't want their accounts anymore. Report them for Leave Game/AFK and also type in the additional details that they were crying about ks.\n\nEDIT: Sorry haven't looked on these forums for a while and I can see you guys posted this a while back. Now I see a lot of comments about the last part about downvoting my post. I can see that I said that incorrectly and somewhat unfair to some people. Just to make it clear, I did not mean that. I meant if you come on here and say stuff like stfu noob or some random insult and then downvote it (even though I can't find that option but w/e) then you would be one of those people who I consider \"KS complainers who deny the truth\". But if you have constructive critism, then thats different.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kexus","date":"2014-08-22T04:33:59.023+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also worth noting that getting a kill doesn't mean much.

Of course loosing one or two kills is harmless.\n\nBut then you loose 5 kills to your teammates and now there is 750 gold difference, which might set you behind the enemy. (If we are speaking about carries like ADC and Mid)","replies":[{"poster":"Onegarion","date":"2014-08-22T19:20:19.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we are talking about that gold difference there is always a different way to look at it.  Each person has a benefit to getting kills and getting fed:\n\nADC: Of course this and mid are obvious. They get fed, they get stronger, and then they hurt. Yet ADC specifically get to help take down towers faster and objectives in general. Also they should be csing too. If they ONLY want kills for gold revenue and suck as csing then there is a huge problem. They should get a huge majority of their gold revenue from last hitting minions and getting that high cs.\n\nMid: I covered the overall before in that they just get stronger, but the other side is they get to start roaming and just blow up people and giving you the #'s advantage to take those objectives. They should be focusing on csing just like the adc. Kills should not be their main source of income.\n\nTank: Tanks get tanky. Its really simple here. If your tank gets fed your team fight and seige potential get a boost. Now that you have {{champion:36}} , {{champion:86}} , {{champion:57}} , etc who will just soak up damage allowing your team who isn't as fed to get more time to deal damage and letting the team as a whole come out of fights healthier and letting you push longer and stay out of base as long as possible. \n\nFighter: Fighters are like the mix of an adc and a tank. It gives you the best of both worlds. Usually these champs need to hit the mid game before they really become valuable. They need some gold to get them going. Being an aatrox player I know that having early gold is a huge benefit. Fighters get to stay in the fight longer and hurt more which can be good after your team engages and they can jump in and have the damage to hurt and survive long enough to be relevant.\n\nSupport: While last season this wouldn't be a great place to put gold bc it would get put into many wards (which really isn't bad), but now with the new support items that came with the season 4 supports builds are much more varied and usually just slightly weaker than their secondary role. So {{champion:412}} is now slightly less tanky than your full tank and will have more itemized utility and {{champion:37}} is now a weaker mage, but still deals/heals a lot compared to last season. So they can hit those early spikes they get since most supports fall off late game and become mainly cc machines. So your support can now be a stronger threat early to the enemy bot lane since anyone who knows league knows that the support is what makes or breaks bot lane. If the support sucks your bot lane is kinda screwed.\n\nOverall while it is 750 gold after 5 kills its still not required or really necessary for them to have all the kills. I'm pretty sure that we can all think of a time where we gave that carry all the kills (by chance or accident) and the carry ended up getting blown up early and lost the fight/game for it. I mean I know I've been in that spot where I'm so fed and hurt so much that the enemy focus just you and the rest of your team is a nuisance since they aren't fed at all. After you get blown up your team has nothing to keep going. So its nice to spread the gold around and not concentrate it on one or two carries. As stated above there are benefits to other roles getting fed and kills to contribute to the team. Spreading that gold around is required personally. I know you aren't suggesting that only the adc and mid laner should get the kills, but you can't look at it the way you did. You have to look at it in the sense of what is your team benefiting from someone else getting the kill and you taking a smaller cut in the end. If you ignore the other benefits you only blind yourself to the other possibilities, and i think thats what lower lvl people do, of how your team can excel. \n\nJust some food for thought.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-12-06T12:04:32.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's also worth noting that getting a kill doesn't mean much.

Of course, it's not intentional. I main Nami, and I always feel terrible when I heal my ADC in a team fight, and it bounces to the enemy and kills them. \n\nBut as others have said, I would rather kill an enemy (especially if it's the enemy ADC), which could potentially help my ADC stay alive and win the fight. After all, it's a team game. I think a lot of people lose sight that assists totally count, and although not as much as a kill, it's still gold, which still helps you build your items, and potentially carry. \n\nWith that being said, do I think Lux using her ult to snipe a kill that her ADC clearly has in the bag is a good play? No, not at all. If Jinx just spawned and is trying to help her team in mid by sending some extra damage their way, and she happens to grab a kill, I wouldn't call that a KS. In a case like that, I see it more as her trying to balance out a 4v5, and genuinely help her team. \n\nThere's always going to be some gray area for what is / isn't a KS. I think it's best to not say anything in situations like these. \n\nThink about it this way: Did you get an assist, even if someone else got the kill? Did you get another kill in the team fight? Did your team ultimately win the team fight? Did the person who got the kill gain something from it (i.e. a support who bought Mikael's Crucible, that will ultimately help the team)? \n\n**What do you guys think?

Of course it would be nice if I had that kill gold, but honestly kills are just bonus gold and experience; I just need to CS better and not die, and with the other laner dead, it's much easier for me to do so. No champion or role is *entitled* to kills, that's all bonus. I play a lot of support myself; I know how good a support who has gold can be. Same thing if a jungler gets the kill; it's all an advantage for the team, and if I really need that kill gold that badly, all it means is that I really need to work on my CSing, I need to be making better calls for objectives, I need to stop sucking compared to the other ADC, etc. Of course it's nice to get kill gold on your carries, but for me, in a perfect world, the ADC would never miss a single CS and the support would get all the kills. The ADC would still be on track for all their items as if they were snowballing, and just imagine how terrifying it would be to face a support Zyra that actually has gold for AP. \n\nThe part I get annoyed about is when the person seems to deliberately take kills (not that bad, again, maybe they need the gold to complete a major item, and I just need to CS better), and then refuses to make use of the gold to help the team (this part is the annoying part). For example, your support gets a handful of kills and buys a Deathcap and still doesn't have a sightstone or wards, or your team is relying on some champion to be the main tank/initiator and they buy an Infinity Edge instead. That part's annoying. I find most people who deliberately do obnoxious things like these are often to stubborn to reason with, so I just ignore them and play around it.

Also to help Ryze escape clean if there were enemies lurking nearby waiting to pick him off.\n\nRyze proceeds to go on a rant about KSing..\n\nDo I let my teammate die next time? Do I not interfere and just go about clearing jungle? If someone jumps in on my action, and get the credit.. Meh.. To me it's all the same..

It's a ridiculous notion, and I have no idea how it got started. Gold distribution is basically irrelevant in a game where players can efficiently invest gold in one another, and specifically feeding kills to one person is only useful to the extent that it denies killing sprees.

Talon did well (I think it's a great matchup for Talon). Lane phase, I stayed in my lane against a GP only dying to ganks (when I try to ward of all times) so I leave laning phase at 1-2-0 (I assisted our struggling bot lane at one point) and a decent cs score. From then on we went to mid game pushing their base and forcing winnable team fights. Our Talon finished the game at 23-4-8 or something silly like that. At one point he starts complaining \"Great job team, except Ire who keeps KSing me\". Now, as I said, we were in teamfight fight mode roaming as a group trying to secure objectives or turrets. I'd Q squishies or anyone trying to escape. I wasn't paying attention to Talon alone, I was watching the state of the entire fight. Anyone trying to run away was a Q target for me and I took those whenever possible. Ultimately we won game, I finished 7-8-8 but Talon was furious as I kept KSing him (although he did intentionaly ks me when I was obviously winning a 1v1 against morg while their entire team was dead and she had engaged me hard). Made me think of a few points about teamwork:\n1. If one champion on your team is fed and carrying hard, it would be a wise thing for the team to help spread the wealth and ensure others got kills (as he was intentionally making sure he last hit everyone). Sure we get some gold for assists, but the more gold the team has, the stronger we are. If he's the only one getting fed, shut him down and it's gg. Spread the wealth and there are now 5 champions to shut down instead of 1.\n2. This is a team game. In team fights not only are you trying to get kills, but you'd like to keep as much of your team alive as possible to help push objectives if the team fight is won. Secure a kill, especially if that kill threatens the health of your other champs. Talon is not that tanky. Helping secure kills keeps him getting focused as they were focusing hard on him at this point in the game.\n3. People are trolls. I love this game, I've been working very hard to see the game as a more team oriented endeavor instead of my KDA. I want to learn what mistakes we are making as a team so that we win. I see a lot of games where 1 person \"carries\" but if he gets shut down we're screwed. But I seriously hate going into games with people who are loosing a lane hard and someone on our team has to be the ass about it, call names, flame and troll. FFS! This is a team game. Don't troll. Push your damn lane and help. Our bottom lane was getting destroyed by their 2 bots and jungler (our jungler was just heavy farming...he died early to a creep and fell behind). I left top lane b/c Talon didn't see the point in leaving his lane (understandable if mid turret was in danger, but no, he'd kill Vel and stay in lane and push and farm or go back to base). I went and helped bot, secured a kill for our adc, got a kill myself and scored a turret, but lost my top turret in the process. Fair trade. That's doing something to help a lane behind.\n\nSorry for the rant. I just get tired of the negativity in this game. How hard is it to cooperate and play together. We have a single common goal: Destroy their inhibitor. In the end, KDA doesn't matter. I've been very proud of games that i'd gone 0-4-9 as top lane or jungler but managed to bust the back door open and secure the game. Especially when our team is struggling. Thats much better then going 9-4-0 and loosing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2014-10-09T16:46:24.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"kill stealing is not a thing. it is a lie perpetuated by angry dudebros obsessed with 1 of 3 numbers when those 3 numbers are still just something vaguely connected to the only thing that matters: destroying the nexus. a kill for your team is a kill for your team, that's it. if you don't like how your ally handled the kill you need to grow up.\n\na kill where your ally gets the last hit instead of you still gives your team the same amount of gold and EVERYONE on your team needs gold. being angry about them getting more gold than you makes you selfish. a kill involving you and an ally gives your team more gold than a kill involving just you. being angry about your team getting more gold but you don't get all of it makes you downright stupid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iron Spatula","date":"2014-08-23T12:50:53.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a total fan of kill stealing... in a certain sense. Let's you (a syndra mid) are 0/1 and down 20-30 cs. Your jungler has wrecked bot lane and your adc is sitting at a comfortable 3/0 40 cs up. It is a beautiful idea to sweep wards and have mid camp bot... when bot lane engages and goes for the kill, syndra appears and last hits by throwing a sphere on a thresh hooked or stunned opponent. NOT A KS! Not having that kill, bot lane is still going to fair just as well and now syndra is one step closer to getting the item she needs to catch up.\n\nAnother comment, as an adc and sup main I'm a firm believer that supports should get the first kill in the lane! I duo queue with a lot of adc/sup friends and it's so much more advantageous when the support gets the first kill. A support who goes back prematurely to come back with a ss boots and a ruby or giants has just secured protection for their adc for the entire early game.\n\nKS'ing isn't always a bad thing...just make sure that if it's a random... your not ks'ing an arrogant prick.

Usually typing kill secure or explaining how it is not a ks will just lead to stuff like stfu, report X.

The other day I had about 20 mins of free time and I was tired so I played Intro Bots. Those level 5 newbies will scream KS at you even if they did 10% damage while you did 90. Basically any kill they SEE that you take is a KS to them. Sometimes they will call KS when they don't even get the assist! And unfortunately, some level 30s act just like those level 5s in my game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
