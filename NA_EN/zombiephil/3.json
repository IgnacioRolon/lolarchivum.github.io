SO USELESS, GO AFK PLEASE!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":63,"down_votes":6,"body":"No, I am 2/7/32.\n\nI am tired of people criticizing others (or me) for KDR when my KDA is much higher. Whenever 2 teammates get into a fight in the chat, KDR is always typed, and it's getting really annoying. I am a Shen (top) and J4 (jungle) main, and I have encountered some experiences with this. When I play Shen, it's not rare that I finish with a \"low KDR\" while having a high assist count (i.e. 4/5/33, 7/9/27, 1/7/32, 3/8/33, etc). But sometimes my teammate(s) decides to be a douche and start trolling us in the chat and criticizing me for being \"2 and 7\" when I have 32 assists. And when I say I am 2/7/32, they say you are not a support, you are top, and you are 2/7. So you're telling me that I ulted all of you and taunted all the enemies for you guys to get kills, and now you're going to troll me. Anyone can \"support\" in a kill, even the adc. Same thing happens with J4, I could knockup 4 enemies, leading to an ult from Yasuo that ends in a Quadra kill, and still be yelled at for being \"2/9\" when I am 2/9/23.\n\nSo my solution to this is to just simply make the ratio TDR. Takedowns to Death ratio. Kills + Assists + Towers destroyed = Takedowns (like the ones displayed in your profile). This will also take into account how many towers you killed or assisted on, since this is another problem. Teammates yelling at others just on KDA, when the player has secured lots of objectives.\n\nSo in my example, I went 2/7/32 that game and I also destroyed 5 towers. \n\nTDR = Takedowns/Deaths ratio. Takedowns = kills + assists + towers\n\nMy score would be displayed as 39/7. (2 kills + 32 assists + 5 towers divided by 7 deaths)\n\nIf Riot still wants to display KDA, can we please save that until the post game screen?","replies":[{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-02-26T06:14:06.032+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":21,"body":"relax, take a deep breath...
