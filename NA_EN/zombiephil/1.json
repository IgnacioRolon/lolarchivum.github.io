And what&#039;s even worse is that this question usually is a start to a blame game that pretty much screws up teamwork and costs your team the game. In this example, 85% of the time what follows that question is everyone answering, \"Kat,\" and then Kat blaming other people and getting toxic and leading to an argument.

Not only that but the same mindset that leads to this unconstructive venting of anger probably also leads to despair and giving up.\n\nIn many cases \"Who fed Zed?\" and \"Zed is fed. gg\" might as well be the same. It's basically somebody saying, \"This game is over.\"\n\nIf they had constructive intent, there'd be acknowledgment and advice rather than blame. For example, maybe after Zed got his second or third kill, say something like,\n\"Kat, just bunker down. Play safe and hold your turret even if you have to give up farm to do it. Let us know right away if he roams. We'll try to win or push the other lanes so we can get some help your way.\"\n\nAnd then actually DO that. In the example given, if the rest of the team let Kat die nine times without offering constructive suggestions or trying to help her, it really was a team failure. Way too often, people have the attitude that if their teammates were doing their jobs, nobody would have to adapt their tactics to fix somebody else's mess. To that, I say \"Tough. It's a tactical team game. Be flexible and work with what you have, or lose.\"\n\nYou hear people say  things like \"too heavy\" or 'can't carry trash\". What are they actually doing to carry, though? Usually it's just doubling down and playing harder  at the same strategy that let the enemy team get an advantage in the first place. Knowing how to coach a weaker player through a tough lane is a lot easier, IMO, than trying to beat a fed opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"SorasMemories","date":"2015-07-02T00:17:52.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving other people advice on how to play never works, in my experience, because, no matter how polite or logical you are, people just do what they want, anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Spreek","date":"2015-07-02T10:25:24.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it can work sometimes, but it is rarely worth it. There are basically 3 scenarios when you give advice to someone doing badly:\n\nA. Person refuses to accept that they did something wrong. This player is likely to argue with you and/or get mad at you if you try to give them advice. No advice is going to be helpful with a player like this and you are at best wasting your time.\n\nB. Person knows what they did wrong (especially when said thing is extremely obvious). You see this all the time with \"stop feeding,\" \"dont get blitz hooked\" and so on. At best this kind of advice is useless (because anyone who has played this game to any degree realizes those things are bad) and at worst it can sound very condescending and flamey and make someone tilt worse.\n\nC. Person doesn't know what they did wrong and is willing to accept your advice. So obviously in this case, advice can potentially be helpful. But you have to know exactly what they did wrong (which you won't always, as you aren't watching everything they are doing -- and chances are you aren't actually that much better than the people you are matched with anyway), AND exactly how to teach them to improve (which is harder than it sounds because many mistakes in league are more of a collection of small mistakes than one big easy one to fix). And even if all this is true, the exact situation that you taught them to play better in the future has to arise again in the same game for you to get any real benefit from all this trouble.\n\nI think a policy of encouraging the feeder to keep trying and not tilt is far better. Accept whatever excuses they give (you can also make excuses for them -- \"yeah man i hate that matchup so much\" or \"idk why their jungler keeps camping you when we are winning bot so hard\") and never pressure them to admit blame. Give them a reason to keep playing (X lane is winning, better late game, better team comp, enemy team can always throw, etc.).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-07-02T03:33:00.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Shut up.
