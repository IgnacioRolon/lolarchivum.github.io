CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING LEVEL X, You have unlocked these features..... 1 Mastery Point.......\r\nYet, the client doesn't actually register it right away. This has happened to me every single level up. I can't add the next mastery point or put the next rune in until I've played another game. I just hit level 30 and have 20+ champions yet, I can't queue for ranked since \"I'm not level 30\". I've played another game AFTER hitting level 30 and the client still tells me I'm not level 30 so I can't queue for ranked. It's honestly not that huge of an issue. I'm just wondering why is it even an issue in the first place? The most popular online game right now has ass-backwards user interface. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-31T04:12:04.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it can take a bit for the client to update certain aspects such as your level or IP/RP values if your connection with our servers are a little spotty.
