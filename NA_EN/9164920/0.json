I was told to kill myself  for the first time here on League of Legends. I've dealt with it since my start here in season 2. But nothing make me feel more hopeless, depressed and betrayed than when Riot takes part in the bullying of players. You allow players to arouse negative emotions in us by calling us names etc and then chat restrict us for defending ourselves. It really, really, really feels like you guys are part of the problem. You  act as if we are not entitled to reacting in human ways. You want us to always mute regardless of how we feel emotionally. And yes, we have emotions. We are not supposed to suppress them.  You allow players to bully us into reacting and then they report us and you take their side by chat restring. YOU guys said yourselves that player shaming is prohibited but that's what you let players do. \"YOU'RE TOXIC\" is shaming especially when it isn't true. Allowing players on the opposite team to report without context of the team chat is wrong. You treat payers in these instances as if they are bad people and neglect our actual feelings. You are shaming. We don't need to work on ourselves.  I truly truly truly believe I'm a decent person and I believe we all deserve respect. The report system is manipulated and broken to the point that you guys are part of the issue. I've tried so long to not react to players. I've done really well. I'm kind to people. I try to help people.  You allow players to abuse the system. Then these little demonic players laugh when they see action as been taken against players who are only defending themselves. I honestly wish I could make you guys feel the way some people make me feel in game some times. Once things have been said, they've been said. Muting them won't change the way I feel about things that are already said. Muting and taking the \"high road\" is not an actual moral law nor morally right. That is completely subjective and an opinion. You guys have created some fantasy world where you guys lay down the law of what's right and what's wrong and you guys are the ones that are wrong. Having people play frustrating games and expect to not let people blow of steam is insane. But I just feel so betrayed when I get excited for the new season. I try to change my attitude about Riot. I look up riot's videos on youtube about game design and tell myself these are cool people. Then some player wants to start something, presses all the right buttons and gets me chat restricted. You let players HURT me and to add salt to the wounds make me feel like I'm the bad guy. I I hate it. It makes me so frustrated I want to cry sometimes. I believe your expectations for us are wrong. I do not like being chat restricted. It makes me feel like a little kid. Which we aren't. It makes me feel severely disrespected by a company I've given too much money to. You guys are wrong and I know it. You guys are accomplices to the people that hurt other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-09T17:56:05.596+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't like being chat restricted because it makes you feel like a little kid? Then maybe you should take the grown up response. We don't get to lash out at people in most real world settings without potential repercussions. A customer yelling at you at work? You can't tell them to \"fuck off\" without also potentially getting in trouble. Someone dissed you at a pick up game at the Y? If you and the other person start a yelling match, you will both be told to stop and/or leave.\n\n Whether you agree or not, muting is the way to defend yourself from verbal toxicity. You can report post game if you feel the deserve to be reported. If you can't contain yourself, actually use your voice to gripe and complain. You can say anything you want with your vocal cords while playing without being punished. Arguing in text chat just contributes to a bad atmosphere.\n\nMorals don't completely matter when it comes to a private establishment. As long as you aren't in any physical danger from their rules, they can have whatever rule they want in place.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-09T23:47:31.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Morals don't matter when it comes to a private establishment.\"\n\nFixed that for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2020-01-10T01:10:58.111+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"What exactly was wrong with what I said?\n\nMorals vary, there isn't a cookie cutter correctness for morality.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-10T02:32:59.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"When you said they don't completely matter, that suggests that it does matter, but only just a little. Yet, it doesn't matter at all. Some people care about maintaining their morality, *but an entity, as a business, has no morals*. If the people working the positions within this entity are not allowed to apply their human judgement... there is no room to apply morality. The system may have had people with morals applying it when it was created, but once out of the box, that's in the past.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2020-01-09T18:03:19.794+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"* You are allowed to \"defend yourself\" if you feel the need to. What you AREN'T allowed to do is flame back, harass, or add to the toxicity already in the game. \n* Nobody bullies you into reacting. You don't have to. You have control over your own actions.\n*  One report in a game does as many as nine. If someone asks the enemy team to report you, they are likely reporting you anyways so the enemy team's reports really won't matter.\n* If they are reporting and there are no infractions, the reports are thrown out. Since you were punished you were have found to have violated the ToS or Summoner's Code\n* \"Someone presses the right buttons and gets me chat restricted\" is NOT how it works. You aren't a video game yourself where people just play you without you having any control over it. Again, you have control over your own actions.\n* Toxicity sucks and at  the end of the day LoL is a game. If you are unable to handle the toxicity in a healthy manner and without adding to it yourself, I would suggest looking for other coping mechanisms or find a different game to be honest. Riot DOES punish flamers and toxic players (just look through these boards).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-09T22:35:19.831+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"More like Riot defends you by banning the players that flame you. If you want to ignore that, and flame them yourself, then obviously youre breaking the rules too. Hell, they even give you tools to eliminate the threat (thats what self defense is), its the mute button. If youre being attacked by flame, mute will completely block that flame, thus protecting you, defending you, from the offender.\n\nYour analysis is so twisted it almost makes me sad that people frame things in their mind with such a warped bias.

It's very bigoted of them. The system in place was relatively effective to the Tribunal, but now players are taking advantage of its weak points and players like you end up as victims of those rotten players and the system. The system is not morally based. *At all.* It was originally conceived with a noble goal, but is now upheld without any morality. It does not matter how justified you are. Context is entirely excluded and this rule that context does not matter was introduced when the automated system was put in place.\n\nI feel for you. I'm on your side. At the same time, I must, with a heavy heart, advise you to follow the letter of the ~~law~~ rules. You ARE NOT defined by Riot's rules. Do not accept their label.
