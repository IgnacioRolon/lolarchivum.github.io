I am sick and tired of how awful your client is riot I have lost 2 games worth of LP and multiple 30+ minute wait times. I repaired it and I just encountered the problem once again. Would be awesome if i could get an explanation on a way to fix it from someone who had the same problem or something similar.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T15:53:54.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean exactly by crashing?  Are you receiving any errors?  In the meantime, if you are using any apps like play.tv I recommend removing them all as they've been known to shut the client down.

It`s happened to me and it`s happened to friends. i don`t use any apps i usually only have league open with teamspeak and even then it still happens on my occasional skype escapades. it isn`t like I am going into eversingle champ select that it happens, but it happens enough that I think it should be brought up.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T20:17:49.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're losing connection in champion select and getting kicked off.
