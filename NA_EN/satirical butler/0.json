Shreds tanks (long fights)\r\n4. Lacks burst (short fights)\r\n5. Is batman.\r\n****\r\n**Current Problems With Above Identity**\r\n1. Itemization too easy to solve early game/waveclear weakness {{item:3087}} {{item:3085}} \r\n2. Q crit is too bursty (2-3 shots to kill champs with no armor or health items)\r\n3. {{item:3153}} is bad. \r\n\r\nThoughts: Vayne should have potential to outplay tanks and burst champs alike, but only through longer fights, peel from her team, and skill. She should be rewarded for surviving to late game and good mechanics. She should not be getting a free pass through her weak early game and bursting anyone. 5-6 autos, that&#039;s what should kill squishies. Not 2-3. If you auto an assassin 6 times they deserve to die. Tanks more like 7-9 late game. \r\n\r\nSuggestions: Nerf Q crit damage, buff {{item:3153}}, and consider some additional rewarding mechanic for hitting 3 procs of her w (such as reducing the CD on condemn by a few seconds, or giving her stacking increased lifesteal for each time she hits 3 procs until out of combat). She needs to be doing sustained damage like {{champion:69}} over longer fights. Also, {{item:3087}} {{item:3085}} need to be changed, nerfed, cost increased, or whatever. Free waveclear=free early game pass. \r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable mention: {{item:3147}}, as of now, is garbage compared to the abusive crit build.

It brought in meta slaves, brought in high ban/play rates, further negative opinions on him and his players, as well as brought a playstyle so forgiving that it just wasn't fun.\n\nI like his glass-cannon playstyle because there's a lot more skill to it than going 3k health on Yasuo and absorb damage like a sponge. Tank Yasuo was and probably is the most boring build for him by far because of how little you have to actually do. I realize how cancerous it was for everybody else and I sincerely apologize if you had to face it.\n\nThe build was indeed clever and useful for that meta, so in which I had to pick it up myself, but I didn't like it very much. It did, however, bring up some new itemization opportunities which I still use. I started to utilize more items on Yasuo and didn't blindly follow builds because they were good, I actually learned better item optimization for him. The Triforce > Frozen Mallet build was so goddamn boring to play, and while I still incorporate Frozen Mallet in my standard build, that's only because it is just a good item on him.\n\nProbably my favorite build on Yasuo is {{item:3111}}{{item:3046}}{{item:3031}}{{item:3072}}{{item:3022}}{{item:3748}}. It's not widely known by other Yasuo players but it has damage, sustain, and defense. It doesn't go overboard on a stat other than damage, which is what Yasuo was made for.

Stattik maybe do less base damage (120 vs 190) but Stattik proc can crit. Vayne crit build usually end with 3 crit item so she end at arround 70% critical chance.

Already higher than RFC and if you bought IE it add another bonus 50% so its a clear 300 bonus damage before armor and damage reduction.

well its more likely when you have such a disgusting ult. rushing RFC, hit 6, ult, 100-0 any ADC at all. rushing shiv, harder to freeze, faster to push, more time under their tower means less safety in general. pushing as fast as possible with RFC? more outplay potential from a gank. not good enough to utilize vayne to the best of her ability by buying RFC in the majority of situations? dont play her or git gud :)\n\nor just buy PD IE GG......or triforce cos her Q scaling is insane.....or bork cos the active gives even greater outplay potential.....or frozen mallet, because absolutely anything works outside of the pro scene and we should all let people do what they want, except for runaans on vayne","replies":[{"poster":"JVlasterQuinn","date":"2016-11-20T00:25:37.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=XErtJtrO,comment-id=001900010000,timestamp=2016-11-19T23:55:28.499+0000)\n>\n> i like this response and the math. i think if you want an ADC who can waveclear you should pick sivir. vayne does not, and should not, be an AOE champion. i think riot have correctly balanced her so that things like runaans and shiv would not be broken on her\n> \n> so i guess shiv can be a situational item. i just think that if your vayne is assigned to waveclear at a safe range, the shiv proc probably isnt going to kill all the minions at once, so if you buy this item, its mainly to stop the enemy from having time under your tower to chunk it down with their minion waves, and not to last hit and get gold, which i dont really like. i guess if you predict that situation though, more power to you\n> \n> apparently the magic damage that can crit, does mean that its a magic damage crit? i never thought about that. 240 AOE magic damage crit is pretty decent late game, for vayne &quot;poke&quot;, especially if it hits more than 1 champ. with adc&#x27;s usually around 30-40 MR in late game, thats gotta be at least 10% of their max health, from an autoattack that didnt even hit them\n> \n> but then RFC gives you that deadly assassin/outplay potential. if you know how to vayne, and you&#x27;re tryharding every game, you&#x27;d wanna build this item just for that magnificent passive. so you can buy shiv and sit under your tower, waiting to lose the game, or you can buy a real item, you can roam and look for massive chunks with moves like extended range auto - Q forward auto - condemn+W proc, or just run away still with a strong disengage spell. you could also Q before hand and just auto once and chunk them with both empowered procs, and leave having never been within 700 range of them. or best of all, you could be fighting, and/or kiting forward OR backwards. passive comes up, you proc it, turn around and kill em. not a likely situation?

RFC is good in 1v1 situation and safety range to chunk good bit of HP from afar. PD is good for dueling to deny enemy potential damage by 12% wich is pretty huge on a squishy duelist marskman that is Vayne. Each game is different and item should be bought according to who you are facing and wich is better for how the game goes for you. If you are safe but need more burst and AoE? Stattik shiv is for you, if you lack that range to AA your enemy when you are usually 1v1  and want to freeze lane ? RFC is for you. If you want more dueling power to out trade anyone late game, PD is here. Every game is similar but they ain't the same.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zelorxon","date":"2016-11-19T19:20:35.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Daily reminder that we are in this current shitty situation because riot with their \"identity\" bullshit nerfed bork as they wanted it to become an \"anti-tank\" item, opposed to \"must buy for every on hit adc\", too bad they forgot about the champions and completely cut from the game an item as there are much better alternatives against tanks (which are kinda weird as now they stack hp and it's really hard to stack armor or mr as we did in the old good days), buffing in the meanwhile an item for completely different purposes and giving it an extreme synergy with a particular champion because they can't see past their nose when they go for changes.\n\nUn-nerf blade of the ruined king and you'll see all these problems disappear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-11-19T11:50:26.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne main here.
