Borderless is meant to be borderless and not movable. If you're wanting it on a secondary display, you'll need to make that display your primary display in your Operating System's settings to get League to launch on it. Alternatively, you can freely move League around if you run it under a regular windowed mode.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Absorbed","date":"2016-12-06T05:04:56.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda late but I came up with a solution. It was dipping into my taskbar so all I do now is move the task bar up and back down. It pushes the window up and I'm set :)","replies":[]}]}]}
