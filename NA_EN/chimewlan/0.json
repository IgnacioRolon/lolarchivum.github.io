It stopped after about two minutes and I was at the home page. Then I tried queuing up for another game, but then I received a queue timer. I guess I was in champion selection but on my screen I never was. Did this happen to anyone else and can I get the queue timer removed?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-28T20:58:04.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is losing connection during champion select, which is when our servers pick up everyone in the queue and places them together.
