Instead the shield will be missing and a large red X will take its place. Now at the time this happened I built attack speed items on Vi as well .\r\n\r\n1. Level Vi&#039;s W\r\n2. Allow attacks to break opponents armor then watch the shield animation play.\r\n3. (Optional) Build attack speed items to see if this breaks the animation.\r\n\r\nThis happened to me through three different games as Vi. And I believe items may affect this bug some.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-21T19:33:26.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey PlagueKnight,\n\nOn the skin's [launch page](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/vi-demon-ganks-we-call-thee) the video show what the Denting Blows shield should look like. Is this what you're seeing in game? Or are you missing the shield behind the red X entirely?\n\n**EDIT**: We're aware of an issue where her shield is appearing dark (as seen in the video). We're working on a fix. ","replies":[{"poster":"PlagueKnight","date":"2015-10-23T07:42:52.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No its not appearing dark for me. Most of the time it will not appear at all but the red x will. Then sometimes only the lower half of the shield will display so it looks like its cut in half.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-23T19:42:12.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, that's interesting.

So you will see the red X and no shield at all. And I it took it the second the shield should appear broken.

I checked jungle camps since sometimes the on-hit can goof up, but that doesn't appear to be the case. I have a particle artist taking a look at this to see if it's something on our end. \n\nI'll update you as soon as I have a bit more info. :]","replies":[{"poster":"PlagueKnight","date":"2015-10-26T21:05:55.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, looking forward to the information.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-10-29T20:05:01.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been trying to repro this for a couple days and haven't had any luck in doing so. :c We've taken a look at back end particle work and there isn't anything to suggest an error in hookups. Without a solid repro of the issue, we're unable to create a fix. At this point, I may suspect that this may be a graphics card issue. \n\nWe did make a couple changes to the shield that should be updated in this patch (5.21). If you're still having issues this patch, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"PlagueKnight","date":"2015-10-31T20:19:10.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know why but the bug is still happening. The interesting thing is I play on the PBE too and her shield animation works just fine on there every time so I know its not a graphics card problem. So I'm going to uninstall and reinstall League to see if that fixes it. And if that doesn't I'll repair the games files then test it again.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-02T19:09:18.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, that's really bizarre. Let me know what happens once you've reinstalled/repaired the client. If it's still happening, I'll see if I can dig a bit deeper.","replies":[{"poster":"PlagueKnight","date":"2015-11-03T18:24:36.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I have a nVidia 650 video card so I went to the GeForce Experience app and clicked optimize game settings for league. And the only options it changed from the settings I had changed in game were it turned shadows from off to very high, and turned off vsync and anti-aliasing that's it. But now the animation seems to work fine for the moment. \n\nThe odd thing is like I said I use the same settings I changed in game on the PBE as well and for some reason the animation works fine. But for the regular client I have to optimize my game settings via the GeForce experience for it to work.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-03T20:37:02.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O__o Okay, thanks for the heads up on this one. Glad to see it's working again. It's weird you'd have to optimize. I'll poke some tech bros and see why that might be happening.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
