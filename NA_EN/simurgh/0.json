Here are a few reasons why:\n\n1. We didn't want to anchor people on the \"grind\" to honor levels. By not having progress indicators, we wanted to root the reinforcement for being sportsmanlike on the feedback you get from other players (the honors), not any artificial motivation from being \"close to the next level\". \n2. Our behind-the-scenes systems which determine honor level ups aren't simple. The types of calculations we do to determine if a player is ready to level up take into account their holistic behavior across many games, and don't lend themselves well to being surfaced in an \"XP bar\"-style system. Anything we surface here could also warp behavior around trying to \"minmax\" the most honor points, which really refocuses it away from the point of the Honor system - play good games and you'll make progress.\n3. We wanted to have a few discrete levels in Honor, since bloating the number would make each feel less meaningful. However, we wanted players to progress over the course of a season or half-season, which means that progress to the next level would necessarily be fairly slow. We didn't think it would be a great experience to reinforce this through some progress indicator.","replies":[{"poster":"Recalescence","date":"2017-07-01T06:06:59.836+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":130,"body":"\"lack of clarity is best\"    \n\n-riot since 2015\n\nhow long do you expect to keep customers while being CNN with faking statistics and never providing proof or reasoning behind anything you do","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-07-01T06:09:48.452+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":6,"body":"I mean ... you just responded to the reasoning...","replies":[{"poster":"Recalescence","date":"2017-07-01T06:11:29.774+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":103,"body":"that reasoning is horrible. it really is\n\n\ni never though it'd be possible for this game to get worse after lyte leaving but congrats","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-07-01T06:07:32.485+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to put a disclaimer here: I'm a nice person, I apologize in advance if my tone in the text sounds or feels ignorant or ragey, I mean this to be read respectfully not harshly. :)\n\nI understand the reasoning behind why nothing was implemented, but I'm going to be completely honest with you, what most of us care about is getting to level 5 to get honor exclusive rewards and personally I'm looking at (rng) chances for those two limited skins, and a lot of players feel the same way.\n\n\"That's wrong, you should worry about being good!\"\n\nYea, but that's nothing we \"good\" players have to worry about because it naturally happens, we're not getting bans/restrictions so we'll just get level 5 eventually anyway, and its kinda frustrating for us to figure out \"am I good enough?\" when the fact we're still playing is already the big \"ya you're a decent person\". \n\nI don't have to be fake nice to get level 5, why do I deserve fake assumption with what level I am and to make fake guesses when I'll reach that level?\n\nWhat makes players get upset and less friendly is frustration, and tbh every game I play I feel a little frustrated because I feel like I gotta \"play every norm like a ranked to grind for honor\" simply because I don't know how much I'm even getting on a passive rate (if I knew I was gaining efficient honor \"XP\" per game of just simply playing and not being toxic, I'd be more at peace than trying to rush level 5 before season ends like I'm grinding for a rank or trying to get that S token/appeal to the team.). I feel a little frustrated getting that pentakill but the team honors the 0/5 AD for staying cool (not salt, I respect that and even I honored him) and the AD himself just doesn't honor and we don't get a lobby bonus, which all in all, makes me feel like even bothering with the system is beating a dead horse outside self esteem boost which feel good when you do get honored and makes us feel good when honoring somebody.  \n\nI think we all will be happy if you guys give us a \"rule of thumb\" in terms of how much we need to \"grind\" (yes it already feels that way), or an in-depth look at how the honor system works mathematically just like how our ask riot gave us some insight of the mechanics behind auto fill. \n\n______________\n\nAs far as the idea of the honor system itself, I do love it but I have noticed a lot of fake nice, especially in my premades where me and my buddy seem to compete for who gets the honors (since we don't get much doing it to each other we gotta earn the wildcard's). However, I cannot emphasize enough how much better that is and I can't really complain about it as much as I could complain about somebody flaming instead. I'd say the honor system is successful so far, just needs more explanation in terms of leveling up, but we'll have to see how level 5 looks and whether or not players will \"fake nice to 5\" and then go back to spam pinging their team, too early to judge but today and yesterday have been great so far and even I've been completely avoiding using chat outside shot calling or saying gj to earn as much respect as I can. (I have my moments ;-;)\n\n---------------------------\n\nI would like this clarified though:\n\nDo REPORTS harm your honor? Or is it only PENALITIES? Will a toxic premade 4x me for having an off game lower my honor, or will only me getting bans/chat restrictions harm my honor? \n\nBy wording from multiple sources it sounds like reports alone can harm honor, including false ones, would like to confirm/deconfirm that.","replies":[{"poster":"Simurgh","date":"2017-07-01T09:24:22.892+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":5,"body":"Thanks for the feedback - you put a lot of energy into this post. Maybe I can answer some of your questions:\n\n* I think you'll find the most efficient way to increase honor level is just to play more games with a good attitude. Don't flame, don't question mark ping and play games, and you'll be good. Getting honored helps, and having everyone participate in honor also helps. Trying to abuse the system with premades spamming honors on each other won't help. The more good games you play, the more good experiences for nine other people you create, and you'll get rewarded.\n* Penalties are the only things that will drop your honor level. A toxic premade all falsely reporting you will not affect your honor level in any way. However, keep in mind, our systems are watching for good behavior on the whole for players to increase in level. If you're flaming and being negative towards your team (but not toxic enough to get punished), you might not drop in honor level, but you probably won't climb fast either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JRobin31","date":"2017-07-02T02:51:52.537+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":3,"body":"What is the point of an honor system?\nIs it to reward players who are honorable by distinguishing them from their fellow teammates?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tormentula,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=l3xTFQnI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-01T04:14:11.120+0000)\n>\n> Give us a way to watch our honor gain like masteries.

An honor system designed to reward players for being honorable is reinforced by the rewards.  An honor system can't benefit from being deliberately mysterious about the reward.  Psychology 101.  It doesn't work.\nPavlovian-instrumental transfer: the reward must occur when the behavior is noticed.\nCarrot and Stick: the reward must be clearly visible and appear attainable.\nAchievement Motivation: characteristics by McClelland: responsibility for solving problems; calculated risk and moderate, attainable goals; continuous recognition, as well as feedback, in order for them to know how well they are doing.\nExpectancy Theory: Motivation = Expectancy X Instrumentality X Valence\n\nReinforcement for being sportsmanlike is not rooted on the feedback you get from other players, because the feedback from other players doesn't not tell you how much progress you are making.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Simurgh,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=l3xTFQnI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-01T04:36:12.015+0000)\n> Our behind-the-scenes systems which determine honor level ups aren&#x27;t simple.

Also, I like how it will go up gradually over time (I believe this was mentioned in a post?) so even if you do not get honored often, you can still receive higher honor level.\n\nIn terms of improvements for the system, there are still some things that could be done or explained:\n\n1. Being able to honor only one teammate can feel really bad, especially when you felt as if the entire team you played with was amazing (as rarely as this may happen).\n\n2. What about premades? They'll have power to honor each other freely, and can just boost their honor levels at will. However, sometimes they may actually want to honor somebody in their premade as they were just that amazing of a player. Is there a potential of there being a kind of system where an honor only counts as half if you're in a premade with the person?\n\n3. A popular one is there being no honorable opponent. Sometimes, people on the enemy team can feel fun to play against (or chat with). There's no way to honor them outside of simply telling them that you enjoyed playing with them.\n\n1. It's unfortunate that players are unable to view how much more honor points(?) they need to get in order to level up to the next honor level. Is there going to be a way of viewing how much more honor points needs to be obtained in order to reach the next level?\n\n1. This is kind of a minor one, but what about viewing what honors you got in match history? It can feel nice to just go in to your match history and see games that you were honored for your behavior, even if you lost the game.\n\nThat's all I have to say about it at the moment, but I truly do like the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Simurgh","date":"2017-07-01T04:48:33.181+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah!

We have systems in place that will account for premades that spam honor each other. They will not be able to abuse the Honor system to gain levels in this way.\n3.

I like the idea of it leveling up and giving me a rank. I like the flairs and how it rewards (and punishes). I feel this whole new concept is pretty awesome.\n\nWhat I don’t like is how the actual honoring takes place, or the categories that are offered. Right now, once I finish my game, the system compels me to honor someone, but not everyone.

Spam a lot of pings, talk pretty harsh in game, but not necessarily 'toxic', and sometimes make some pretty questionable plays-\nEG: {{champion:54}} just YOLO ulti's into an unwarded baron pit and throws a game we were winning.\nAnd we had an easy final team fight if they'd just waited another 10 seconds to do whatever they just did, and almost looks like int.feeding just to end at that point, but then post game they're like\n'sorry guys, i totally tunnel visioned that last fight :/'\n\nAnd it makes all the difference in the world.\n\nBut with new system, it seems like post-game lobby is pretty pointless.\nBut I think post-game is fairly important. It's not like you have time to sit and type out an explanation of every play you made/are going to make while in game. Half the time you're trying to type a quick reply right before a team fight, and you end up burning your flash or something stupid and turn an iffy fight into a straight loss.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2017-07-01T20:02:22.339+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had 1000+ teamworks through a few years of playing this game.

Perhaps allow players to use icons on their client profile page like badges, so they can show the team they root for (SKT, INTZ, EDG, Fnatic, etc.), events they participated in (Ascension, Poro King, etc.), and champs/skin lines they love (Project, Pool Party, etc.).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chazual Fridays","date":"2017-07-01T07:11:38.362+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the new honor system!

Being honored legitimately (not just your premade spamming honors on you) will increase your progress significantly, but not to the point where it overshadows just playing good games over time.
