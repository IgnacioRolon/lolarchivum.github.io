I knew the password was right, but it kept saying that my username/password combination was wrong. I went to change the password just to see, but even after multiple password reset attempts, I still never got any emails.\n\n\n**(I have multiple email accounts, and idk if I maybe chose one that I don't use anymore for the PBE account, or even if that was an option, but I checked every account I can remember and I haven't received any emails.)**\n\n\nI kinda forgot about it and was too lazy to say anything, but I went on the PBE signup page, and it says I'm still accepted. I can download the client still, but I still cant access my PBE account. Which is why i'm posting here, and not in the PBE forums.\nI would like to know if my account was deleted, or if I still have access. In which case I would really like some help getting my account working.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2016-06-23T19:43:13.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BeastPepper,\n\nIf the signup page shows that you've been accepted and directs you to download the PBE Client, you should still have an account on the testing server. Unfortunately, we can't verify any details within the Boards. Please submit an account recovery request with my colleagues through the Support Site so we can look into this further:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"BeastPepper","date":"2016-06-24T00:50:00.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to before posting on here, but I hadn't realized that PBE was an option in what region your account was from.
