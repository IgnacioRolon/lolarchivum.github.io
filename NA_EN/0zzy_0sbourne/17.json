But I dont think so...\r\n\r\nEvery single game I play, I barely say anything.  I play my game, and do the best I can every single time.  I always keep my CS high, trade well in lane, stay safe, and always trying to make the best movement for where I think I&#039;m supposed to be.  Teamfight shuffle happening in the midlane?  I&#039;m there.  Team is headed toward Fire Drake?  I&#039;m there.  I&#039;m always relevant in dmg.  I&#039;m building correctly every time I play.  I position the best I can in fight (i&#039;m always in the back hitting the first safest target.  if there&#039;s a higher priority target that&#039;s hittable safely, I will switch aggro).  I&#039;m always DOING EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY CAN.  I almost never contribute to negative energy, and instead promote positive energy.  If we&#039;re losing, and we just won a fight, or a pick, or if something good happens I say &quot;GUYS WE CAN WIN.  WE GOT THIS&quot; and really push to try and win the motherfucking game.... every.  single. time.\r\n\r\nBut every single game.  Team is raging at each other.  Blaming for mistakes.  and Getting shat on.  There&#039;s one person, usually mid, that fucking feed 0/4 in lane phase, then the mid laner proceeds to carry the game really hard.  I can&#039;t fucking prevent my midlaner from feeding as ADC!! HOW COULD YOU?  I tell him to try to play more safe, and I get shat on for TRYING TO SAY OR DO ANYTHING that will win me the game.  LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE GAME my teammates are HOSTILE.  FIGHTING EACH OTHER.  AND JUST GIVING UP IF SOMETHING, ANYTHING GOES WRONG.  How come the enemy team is never like this?  How come the enemy team ALMOST ALWAYS has someone who&#039;s either a smurf, or getting really lucky and fed, and can just go around an dominate?  How come that ALWAYS leads to my team getting hostile AND UPSET?  THIS ALWAYS MAKES ME LOSE, AND I&#039;M SICK AND TIRED OF IT.  WHAT IS THE FUCKING ANSWER TO THIS IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE PROBLEM??  BEING GOOD AT THE GAME ISN&#039;T HELPING, I JUST LOST AS 6/3 CAIT BECAUSE THE REST OF MY TEAM WAS 12/25.  HOW DO YOU DO BETTER, CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP ME PLEASE?? \r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t get it.  I mean people carry as ADC, I physically see it.  They carry so fucking hard.  Why can&#039;t I?  I&#039;m not bad.... I&#039;m really not that fucking bad, when I&#039;m just LOOKING at my teammates perform not just poorly in skill, but in fucking manners and confidence.  When they&#039;re losing, they believe it&#039;s over.  The enemy team NEVER has this problem.  Why?  why can&#039;t the enemy team ever tilt?  Why is it ALWAYS my team?  I don&#039;t tilt, my team does.  I almost never am the one to instigate it, I ALWAYS try to fix it.\r\n\r\nThis is just a game, and I&#039;m starting to care less. BUT FUCK, when you lose fucking 5 games in a row, because the team feeds literally every single time.... you actually fucking FEEL like you are horrible and shit at the game, but I&#039;m actually not.  It does NOT feel good to feel like shit, when you know you are not.","replies":[]}
