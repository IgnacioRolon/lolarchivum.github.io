I knew it!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":12,"body":"I just played a game as Darius top against Yorick.  He&#039;s 100% broken, as I predicted.  I wasn&#039;t doing anything wrong, building wrong, or playing wrong.  Yorick was just simply stronger overall, for no real reason.   He was only 1/0 (I don&#039;t even think he killed me, he killed Udyr), and he SINGLE HANDEDLY carried the ENTIRE GAME in 20 MINUTES, because he was SO FED, is was like he had 12 KILLS, even though he only had JUST ONE.\r\n\r\nBroken.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s sad, I can&#039;t even ban yasuo anymore, cuz of how broken this fucker is, it&#039;s really pitiful that you&#039;ve let it go this far.  Yorick&#039;s rework made him literally invincible, and it is a crying shame.  A fucking.  Crying. Shame.  SMFH :(","replies":[]}
