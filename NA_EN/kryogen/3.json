Cus these reports are reviewed right? Well review this, inc post game chat (wish I could post in-game chat):\r\n\r\nIce Science joined the room.\r\nTheRedBaronJJ joined the room.\r\nbearindownonya joined the room.\r\nCristinaIsBOMB joined the room.\r\nIce Science: why report me, im going to do the same\r\nTheRedBaronJJ: cause you were going to do the same thats why lol\r\nIce Science: weak\r\nbearindownonya: youre going to report us becuase we played the game right and didnt troll anyone or get on anyones nerves. thatsfine\r\nIce Science: ty jinx\r\nIce Science: sigh\r\nTheRedBaronJJ: also 2v1 in reports we win\r\nIce Science: got a message\r\nIce Science: im gonna make a forum post\r\nTheRedBaronJJ: go for it you were just as bad as us man\r\nbearindownonya: we were bad?\r\nTheRedBaronJJ: Ehhh to a degree haha\r\nbearindownonya: btw, riot reviews the games and chats soooooo, idc\r\nbearindownonya: go ahead. post way\r\nbearindownonya: make a subreddit\r\nTheRedBaronJJ: lol\r\nbearindownonya: make a forum\r\nbearindownonya: a blog\r\nbearindownonya: post it on fb\r\n\r\nSigh, look at RedBaron &quot;2v1 in reports always win&quot; sigh...\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I feel I HAVE to report, cus if I don&#039;t some asshole like this guy and his friend will report me. This guy didn&#039;t win, he got mad -real mad. So he extracts his vengance by reporting me. And yes, I got a message telling me I was a douche bag. This leads me to think that no history of reports must be established.\r\n\r\nI got threatened by a duo Q that they were gonna report, they reported me - I got a message saying how &quot;not in line&quot; my &quot;recent&quot; actions were...\r\n\r\nWhat a fucking joke.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing is, in game, there really wasn&#039;t anything bad happening - jesus it was a BOTS MATCH. All I did was ask to get some science a few times. \r\n\r\nThis is why my alt account is chat restricted - not because it deserves it, but because the system gets worked.\r\n\r\nBRB I need to science, does riot?","replies":[]}
