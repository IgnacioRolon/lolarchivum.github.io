The dynamic queue? I struggle to imagine what the vision was behind that. Surely it wasn&#039;t to punish- ahem de-incentivize solo play... Right? \r\n\r\nGive us solo elo in a solo league. Solved. Spend a month fixing that. Then do whatever! Argh, yeah I am with you community on that dynamic queue vs solo queue. It&#039;s like who wants to play pick ups against the New England Patriots?\r\n\r\nHowever something strikes me in between bashing my teeth out of my mouth only to replace them with my keyboard keys. While queuing I&#039;ve come to notice (it takes a long time for me to read words) every lane has a nice and neat name to it... Mid, Top, Support... then Bot..\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s two bot though... (you wanna try evening *hinting* at doing anything else in bronze?) I see through the bullshit though, Riot doesn&#039;t want to overtly back a meta (but I was sure I had read some honest admittance to the emergence of a strong meta, and that it was growing increasingly difficult to remain unbiased i developing future content) - that&#039;s FINE Riot! Be up front about it man! Why not back a meta? It gives structure to your game! Sadly, there are so many people playing your game is there still a strong middle class? It feels like a strong lower class on my end... Then again... I am LoL lower class... Time to thug up and make that rent my good sirs!\r\n\r\nNow understand I&#039;m Bronze, so I&#039;m wrong. But still! Who the hell else goes &quot;bot&quot; man?! You wanna try queuing for &quot;bot&quot; as anything other than ADC? I&#039;m sure the experience is unique to me... The outlier in Bronze..! :(","replies":[{"poster":"Nahui","date":"2016-04-02T05:43:29.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC is attack damage carry. Anything with AD as a primary stat is an ADC. Zed is, riven is, Darius is. \n\nThey don't wanna specify what to play. Notice how no other lane is forced a role. The best they could do is \"Marksman\" but that's forcing a role. So, they call it bot.

You're arguing semantics.\n\nYes ADC is AD carry, does Morde come to mind? Why did you say Morde and not say, Ashe?\n\nThat's precisely my point. No one but trolls or top tier players take anything other than Jhin \"bot\". \n\nI'll just spell it out I guess... ADC doesn't mean \"I do attack damage and I carry\" (what does carry even mean? Another post entirely because if you think you can answer that you're wrong) ADC means \"I am the primary ranged means of attack damage on my team and I always go bot lane.\"\n\nYour move.","replies":[]}]}
