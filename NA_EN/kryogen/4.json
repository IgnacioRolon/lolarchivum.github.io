But my qualm is, once a game nearly concludes I normally begin to type my usual \"gg\" or perhaps even \"gg nerds!\" (just kidding I never use that one but its hilarious!) but the chat text field resets I believe upon the beginning of the Nexus explosion animation - anyways, just a small thing perhaps a quick fix?
