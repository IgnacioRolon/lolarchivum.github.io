I think I got reported because I won, and I won hard and my enemy had nothing else to do but report me perhaps? I'm not even vocal, like ever. Jesus check the logs riot the only things I could have said was \"gj ____\" and \"thug life\" &lt;- that one usually spoken after I die saving some teammates or securing an obj because I'm bronze and I love it.  \r\n\r\nI didn't ask for the thug life.\r\n\r\nNo serious, this hit me in that face like WTF? I didn't deserve this report. I feel this guy is clearly abusing the report feature. Maybe he had some friends? It was a normals game, and seriously there was no toxicity at all for once! Until this moment I thought that there were systems in place to weed out false reports etc. But this... wtf riot?\r\n\r\nI want to be vindicated. Smite me, whatever dig up my history, but its this most recent game where I got the message man and I'm seriously scratching my head because not only did I not swear, but I don't think I said a damn thing. This is like getting reported for breathing.","replies":[]}
