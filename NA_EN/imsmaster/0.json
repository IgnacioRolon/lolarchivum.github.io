I tried to update it many times but it always stuck at 33% and this massage pops up \"Unspecified error occurred please check the logs for more information\". And then i tried to reinstall the game but it also didn't work, repairing neither. I try to delete some files to force repatching but no luck for now. If you can help me with a solution I will be very thankful.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T15:20:24.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point in the process, the patcher is attempting to download and update your game files.  Unfortunately, something is going wonky with your network and preventing a strong connection to the patching servers.  I recommend going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot this for a fix.

I removed the links you posted because those logs usually have personal information on it.  The guide provided is pretty good at resolving local network issues.  If you think the issue might be with how your ISP is routing to the game server, then we can run a traceroute instead.  To do this, download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).  As your host destination, route to 31.186.224.42 which is for EUNE.  If the connection guide doesn't help, use the WinMTR and let me know what you find!","replies":[{"poster":"ImSmaster","date":"2016-10-18T16:46:02.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run the program WinMTR and then run the game and the patching process seems to have stuck again to this level.\nhttps://gyazo.com/75b3e07b03394b8ab1b6efee01c2fac6\nhttps://gyazo.com/9a6810dc8b7cb32f8c70d383d7738f3d","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-18T17:00:10.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update.  It looks like your network is trying to go through a lot of devices before even reaching your ISP, and is getting a lot of packet loss or blockage along the way.  If you have someone who is an administrator of your network, reach out to them to see if they can tune up your network.  If you still have issues, reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so our tech team can take a look.
