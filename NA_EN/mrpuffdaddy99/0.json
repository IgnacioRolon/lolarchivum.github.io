I'm suffering\r\n\r\nSo I tried to download the new update today for league and for some reason it would not finish downloading it would reach the end and then the launcher would disappear and then if I opened league after it would start the download all over again. So I decided to reinstall. I installed the files off of riot website and it installs and I have the league icon, but nothing else happened. And whenever I try to open league client from applications or from the icon on my dock, the logo will pop up but nothing happens. I've tried like everything, nothing on youtube or these forums is helping me. I don't want all the money and time I spent on this game to go to waste.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-07T03:34:14.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having some problems with the Mac admin settings not allowing League to properly update.
