Same with my friend who started playing with me on the same day. We went so many days I personally went about 2 weeks without getting a key fragment not sure about him. What's the percentage chance after each key? I feel like its common for the first ones to open some chests then it becomes rare all of a sudden. That's exactly what happened to me and another person. They mention a curve but not an exact figure estimate or anything. Just a curve doesn't tell you much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-05-11T00:30:41.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They must be wins. They must be on a champion you own. The more keys you get in the time frame, the less you get them later. I don't know the time frame they have but let's say 2 weeks. If you earn your first 3 keys early on in the week, you will get them far less in the later half of the week.","replies":[{"poster":"TW Nevaeve","date":"2016-05-11T00:35:57.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But through out the weeks I've got some wins, even some Ss, still nothing.

I would LOVE a little time saying something like \"You've earned 5 key fragments so far this month\" so I know when that resets I can go ham on getting more again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
