This event can be done on stack 3 or 4 times so this doesnt need to be done in team fights or 1v1s","replies":[{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-08-26T08:55:45.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I failed to see the \"challenge their skills\" in your idea. Just some mandatory pre-fight actions, like old Rengar stacking passive before the gank or old Vlad stacking his E on minions.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-26T09:38:12.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at his match history he hasn't played a mechanic intensive champion in forever (if ever).
