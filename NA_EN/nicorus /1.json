At this point we are pretty doomed and anyone experiencing the issue will remain suffering from it. We just get the same answers over and over about installing hextech repair tools and all that stuff nothing works. And its not my hardware. Literally only game I am having this problem on and lets be real even a toaster can run league fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T05:25:03.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing a few posts directly related to EU having these fps issues on patch 7.22, but I'm 100% sure if that specific issue was cleared up by now or not. I was able to grab these steps from one of our EU support agents, so do me a favor and gather some of this data and shoot it over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!\n\nTO DO\nIn order for us to investigate further, we'll need some specific logs. For this part you will need to submit a ticket using the Support Site as you cannot attach .zip files on boards.\nI have attached a link for an app called Hextech Repair Tool that will assist you in gathering these logs:\n\n**HRT:**\n\n- Download the HRT from [**here**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool)\n- Install the HRT as admin (Make sure you don't change any settings and stick with the default)\n- Run the HRT from your desktop as admin\n- Press Start\n- Wait for the tests to run and attach the results (LoL Logs) as a zip folder to your response. These should be on your desktop after the test.\n\n\n**The last piece I require is the PassMark CPU Score:**\n\n- Click here to obtain the .exe file.\n- Install and Run the application.\n- When prompted, use the 30-day free trial by clicking \"Continue.\"\n- Once in the application, click on \"Run\" under \"CPU MARK\" (the yellow square)\n- When the test is done, make a screenshot and attach it to your reply.","replies":[]}]}
