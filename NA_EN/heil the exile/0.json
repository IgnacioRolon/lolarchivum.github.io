I was unable to get into the loading screen and i tried to reconnect numerous times but it would not let me. I was given 5 20 minute queue timers and I was really pissed. Is there any way that i could avoid something like this from happening to me again so I can finally get back to my favorite game &lt;3\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T20:30:52.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely there is! Some context on this, the most common reason the client won't be able to load into a match is if there's a problem with it reaching the game server. Most of the time, this is caused by network settings that provide an unstable connection to the server. We can determine if this is caused by local settings if you work through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure everything is compatible.\n\nLet me know if this problem persists through those changes.","replies":[]}]}
