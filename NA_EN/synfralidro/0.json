Taken from the 2014 Season Ranked FAQ:\r\n\r\n> DEMOTIONS AND DECAY\r\n> \r\n> WHAT IS DECAY?\r\n> If you are in Platinum or Diamond, after 28 days of inactivity in a particular ranked queue, a couple things will happen. First, you’ll be hidden from the standings in your league. You will also lose LP depending on your current tier. Every seven days thereafter, you’ll lose LP until you play a match in that queue.\r\n> \r\n> In the Master and Challenger tier, players will decay after becoming inactive for 10 days; this is to ensure only the top active players are being showcased.\r\n> \r\n> The number of LP lost following each period of decay is shown below:\r\n> \r\n> Master &amp; Challenger: 250\r\n> Diamond: 50\r\n> Platinum: 35\r\n> If you fall at or below zero LP as a result of decay, you’ll be placed into the next lowest division. If you’re already in division V of your tier, you’ll fall into the next tier down (for example, Platinum V to Gold I.). Tl;dr: don’t take a break from ranked for too long. :)\r\n> \r\n> *Decay does not occur for players in Bronze, Silver, and Gold.*\r\n\r\nMy question is when did these take into effect? Early on in the season I had achieved Gold V and took a break, but when I returned I was Silver II.  Since this I have climbed back to Gold V, so I'm not being totally affected by this, but I'm still feeling a little annoyed by this and worried that other players may not be receiving there deserved rewards because of some oversight.","replies":[{"poster":"The Don Waltz","date":"2014-11-11T07:26:46.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the other hand, this did negatively affect me as I was away from NA League for a very long time, causing my decay to drop me back down to Silver I, where it is to be immortalized as my rank for season 4.
