This [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) is a great start to troubleshooting the interruption in connecting to the server. Be sure to follow all those steps and then them out in a custom match.\n\nIf you're still seeing the reconnect button, reach out to our Tech team in [a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll be able to troubleshoot further.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tammerlane","date":"2017-11-29T23:48:49.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
