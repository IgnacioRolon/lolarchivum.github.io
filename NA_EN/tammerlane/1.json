I purchased the set of five yesterday, but I can't do the same today as it says I've reached my limit. \n\nIt seems Riot has limited the chests for once the entire weekend, rather than each day. \n\nOr it's a bug, and their system didn't calculate the sale of yesterday until today. I checked my 'sales receipts' in the client, and it shows everything that happened yesterday, including the opening of the King poro chest and the skin that popped out, with today's date on it. and that's true with the sale of the set of five chests. Strange.","replies":[]}]}
