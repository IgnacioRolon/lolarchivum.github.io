But where is our top lane? \r\nNow I&#039;m still taking classes in graphic designee and am nowhere near good enough to designee it my self. But i feel Arcade {{champion:83}} would be perfect... Now Riot pleas hear me out. When {{champion:83}} uses Omen of War he should summon bashful \"Inky\" form the Pacman Ghosts, His Omen of Pestilence should summon Speedy \"Pinky\", also when {{champion:83}} uses Omen of Famine he summons shadow \"Blinky\". Now for his ultimate i thought Instead of the directional pad that appears under the Champion you ult there should be an Atari joystick appear above the targets head AND WAIT FOR IT........................ IT MOVES WITH THE TARGETS MOVEMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \r\nI had to think of the best cosplay for {{champion:83}} to wear, THEN SUDDENLY IT HIT ME! *******DIG DUG******* YES DIG DUG&#039;S OUTFIT WOULD BE PREFECT!!!!!!! AND THE DRILL DIG DUG USES WOULD MAKE IT SO EASY FOR {{champion:83}} TO DIG RED/BLUE TEAMS GRAVES!!! MWHAHAHA-MWHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! \r\nNow for Quotes!!!!!!!!\r\n1. \"Monsters Lie beneath the dirt\"\r\n2. I&#039;m really bad at making quotes but the first one was clever right haha because you know *Dig Dug* hahaha...haha..ha. ill just stop now (v.v)\r\n\r\nall i ask is you check this out. You don&#039;t haft to do it, I wont be mad. But maybe leave a comment on how you feel about it???

He was designed to be a jungler but, like Mundo, he makes a better top laner due to his sustain and map pressure with teleport. \n\nAlso. Yorick can jungle as well. But i like the idea of a new skin for Yorick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
