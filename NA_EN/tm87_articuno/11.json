I cant take it anymore from the toxicity in game, the trolls, and the so called &quot;balance&quot; for champions. By far this mage update is more cancerous the your stupid ass ADC update. Now before i  start id like to note i don&#039;t normally bitch about stuff like this, that aside I&#039;m done with this game. I&#039;m done with the player base that is never punished when 90% of them are toxic assholes that if you give there enemy lane one kill they intent feed for the rest of the match (Now idk if i&#039;m just unlucky but this happens every other game for me. but even more often in ranked) now lets get past the player base that has been shit sense day one. THIS SEASON NEEDS A UNDO BUTTON. Im sorry... i know yall work hard but what the fuck were u thanking. at this point as we speak someone forgot to ban voli, malz, swain, hec, zyra, ireal, fuck it THE ENTIRE MAGE UPDATE and now there going to lose a game because of it. THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF BALANCE. fix it!!! cause its fucking annoying! Also find a way to make it to where u dont lose lp cause someone on your team is ruining down mid giving kills away cause the jangler didn&#039;t gank his lane so now he is 0-15-0 and now your -21 lp... there is alot wrong with the game at the state its in. IF Anything  ADD 1 OR 2 MORE BANS. well im not gonna keep going cause i could type all night about this stupid shit. i loved this game and i know you dont care that im leaving But i hope that yall finally realize that your game balancing skills are shit you make champions ether to song or to weak there is no between. so for the last time i say goodbye and PEACE LOVE AND LOTS OF DRUGS!","replies":[{"poster":"GGXJ9","date":"2016-06-27T08:12:28.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you have played as long as I have and im diamond 2/diamond 3 while you are silver 5... its just you.
