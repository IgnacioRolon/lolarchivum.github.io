I *probably* did deserve it, but I didn&#039;t use any racism or homophobic slurs and I didn&#039;t tell anyone to kill themselves\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any chance I can appeal the ban? I&#039;m not saying I shouldn&#039;t have been banned, I guess I&#039;m more or less asking for clemency or mercy, some sort of second chance I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2017-07-14T00:05:22.152+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are 4 tiers of punishments:\n\n1.) 10 game chat restriction\n2.) 25 game chat restriction\n3.) 14 day ban\n4.) Permanent ban\n\nYou start at tier 1 and every subsequent offense moves you up one tier (though it is possible to drop tiers if you go long enough without a punishment). So, if you have recently received a 14 day ban, then I'm sorry to say that you're not going to get the permanent ban lifted. A permanent ban is the next step after the 14 day ban, and you're even warned when you get the 14 day ban that your next punishment would be a permanent ban. At this point, you've already received multiple chances to change your behavior, and you refused to do so.\n\nIf you haven't received a 14 day ban recently, then it _might_ be possible to have your punishment reduced, but you will need to contact [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask them about it. If they say no, then you're out of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-07-14T00:02:43.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless it was done by mistake/error of the system; no","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-07-13T23:59:23.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You already got plenty of warnings, you ignored them.

I know how the system works and you get perma banned after your 3rd punishment, but that 14-day ban was your FIRST punishment and I think getting permanently banned for saying something like that is ridiculous, unless you said other stuff that you are hiding. Have you made a support ticket about it?","replies":[{"poster":"A Very Bad Bard","date":"2017-12-09T22:59:40.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why they made the IFS, it does the player behaviour department's job for them. it just highlights keywords, and if you get a couple of reports, they insta charge you with a ban.
