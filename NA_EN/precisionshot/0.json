I had just recently played a ranked game, and our ADC was fed and by mid game we had already taken down mid inhib. Then our ADC decides to purposely farm, avoid combat, and intentionally die to the enemy team. Due to this unsportsmanlike conduct, the rest of the team ended up losing. The hardest part is, it was ranked.\r\n\r\nA few things I like to ask is how do I report this conduct with physical evidence (I.E. Screenshot, recorded game) and would there be a possibility to be refunded LP for the other 3 players who had to endure this?","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2016-08-16T19:05:35.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You report it as Intentionally Feeding, which also encompasses actively assisting the enemy team and actively not assisting your team. I had a Jax in Ranked who refused to engage in any team fight or help take objectives. Our Anivia was a little batshit, but she did make good calls and was pretty good at coordinating efforts, which Jax just called her \"trolling\" and \"not knowing how to play.\" Anivia literally helped bot lane wipe out an invasion, and when we had free reign to take the tower, Jax recalled with full HP and refused to help. Then, every time a team fight erupted, he turned away and went to farm in the jungle, then accused everyone of bad plays and feeding. It was obnoxious and it cost us the match. I'm tired of getting plagued by people who do stuff like this in Ranked. Being a support main is like playing Russian Roulette with 5 bullets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-08-16T19:00:50.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No possibility for refunded LP.

You probably have your faults. I mean smurfing skews this of course.","replies":[]}]}
