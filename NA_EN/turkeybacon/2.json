Would love a visual breakdown of him as a character and the direction they are taking the Lunari. \r\n\r\nUnderstandably they are progressing the Lunari from Diana's ancient armor and crescent blade. Additionally they probably had to tone down his clothing to allow his weapons to read clearly in game but he's overall just not clicking together for me yet. His weapons feel off as they are more modern and alien/insectile than I would expect of a moon cult set in Runeterra. \r\n\r\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/aphelios-ability-article.jpg?itok=M2DWBoNL\r\n\r\nIn any case, any discussion from the Riot team about his visual would be great to help me appreciate his visuals more.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2019-11-26T00:57:58.692+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the invitation.

She is a Rakkor raised by the Solari who found the ancient armour of the aspect of the moon - a warrior-avatar of the forgotten Lunari sect. By contrast Aphelios is a monk of sorts, equal parts minimalist utilitarian (the black suit) and divine ritualist (the holy robes). He's not dressed to take a hit, he's dressed to perform a ceremony. He is also dressed in the way of the modern Lunari which have likely made changes particularly because they are few and living in hiding. When they walk amongst the Rakkor they must hide their true selves so when they are free to wear what they want rich forbidden colours are on display. Were Diana welcomed to the modern Lunari I could see them dressing her similarly to Alune for a religious event, celebrating the return of their scion. I'll also just point out that LoL champions represent the most extraordinary characters in the world of Runeterra. They are the ones that really stand out from a background of fantasy tropes.

Diana's blade seems to be able to launch out beams of moonlight, so it's not at all a stretch to see that honed into a projectile weapon, but Aphelios is so different to the rest of the Lunari (and the Rakkor in general) we felt it needed a unique material. Something rare and potentially fragile, something only wielded by him, held and empowered by his sister's magic, something once enervated would be useless to allies and enemies alike. Shaping the moonstone was then a careful balance between the Lunari theme and the gameplay requirements. For each weapon I imagined how he would hold it and tried to connect them to weapons other marksman wield as a way to ensure that if you play LoL, playing as or against Aphelios you'd immediately have some idea of what was going to happen next (oh it's like Caitlyn's rifle, oh it's like Gnar's boomberang etc). Every day I'd have people come by and I'd ask them to guess what each weapon did until I was reliably getting correct answers. On top of that each one was tied to a celestial phenomenon - this served to further reinforce gameplay (Black hole has a CC effect) and give them a colour identity to support gameplay learning and recognition. I imagined the Lunari sort of like the Eldar in 40k, sculpting these smooth graceful shapes inspired by the phases of the moon, swooping crescents and curves of the phases, orbits of the moon, flow of the tides.

We all love this game (even if it sometimes sounds like wailing and gnashing teeth), and it is so cool to get these glimpses behind the curtain.

There _is_ space, it just isnt part of the same plane of existence as Runeterra. Those things you said, sun, moon, comets, shooting stars and meteors, they exist, but they're on the celestial realm.
