At the time, I remember seeing strong opinions on both sides on the forums. Some people loved old Trundle, some love the new one. Was it a controversial change? Certainly.

The skills weren't changed at all, only cleaned up a bit and adjusted for today's meta.  In fact, I think he was nerfed a bit by no longer being able to Ult Dragon/Baron for objective securing.  It was a unique aspect of him that really helped.\n\nBut the real issues was people like GrumpyMonkey blatantly lying to Trundle players even two months before the announcement.  I remember him quite clearly saying that we still had our leprous troll, just getting a VU.  I remember him stating that they would give Trundle his 3 limb walk, but that never happened.  Just so many lies and deception that Trundle players felt that Riot gave them the finger and walked out of the room.\n\n\nThen there's the retcon in general that destroyed an amazing character.  The idea of \"we can tell more stories\" was used by Riot but destroyed by others.  The fact of the matter is that Riot doesn't tell stories with their characters.  They're trying to do better now, but with 121 champs and counting, it'll be years before we hear anything about Trundle in lore.  And that's a hope.  The point was to connect him more to Runeterra, but they didn't help it at all.  They changed him from the unloved martyr to the douchebag ice troll.\n\n\nAlso doesn't help when people like Morello say for months that Trundle was a mistake(pre-rework).  How would you feel if you had to hear devs say over and over again that your favorite champion was a mistake?  \n\n\nThis doesn't even get into the destruction of my favorite skin ever in the game, Lil' Slugger Trundle.  Now he's Adult Softball Trundle.  You killed the old school baseball charm that made me love it.  I refunded that thing so fast.\n\n\nAs you can see, Trundle is still dear to my heart.  Every now and then I'll go to YouTube just to watch an old video of him.  My favorite champ with my favorite story was destroyed.  There was no success in the change.  It did nothing to help the character.  All it did was make him generic and uncreative.  And yea yea I've heard that it hurts Riot to hear these things, but it's the case.  I never play Trundle without Traditional on, even though I always used Lil' Slugger before.  But that thing's just intolerable now.\n\nSo failure of an update imo.  I know many will disagree and I'll get downvoted because of my passion for old Trundle, but that's how I feel.

Nice playing with you a while ago; we should do that again. (I'm one of Fish's associates.)\n\nLike TerraRising, I'm going to take this opportunity to speak not so much to you but to Narrative, though your own good example of community engagement ought, I think, to serve as an admonishment to them.\n\n>  I would argue that sometimes we very much respond to feedback... re-designing the colors on the Warmonger Sion skin is the most recent example I can think of. From gameplay, Varus indicator was one from a patch ago.\n\nThat's the thing: Riot is normally really good about community engagement. Maybe it's all an elaborate ruse, but my impression thus far is that Riot takes community ideas seriously. Rioters come onto the boards to gather community ideas and share their own. They'll debate those ideas, and in many cases they'll at least *adjust* their plans if the community makes a compelling argument.\n\n**[The Narrative team has done essentially none of this.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/OKEINvJ7-lore-and-community-engagement)** I suppose there was the time where they tweaked Jayce's lore vis-a-vis Viktor.\n\nAnd then there was the time when they decided it was \"too hard\" to have a League of Legends in their League of Legends lore, and erased the players from the game, along with the League itself. Understandably, they exhausted every alternative before taking such a desperate, immersion-shattering step, and (of course) came to the Community first asking for ideas and feedback to help them find another way.\n\nOh, wait, no. They didn't. They deliberately avoided the topic for months, even years. Then they rounded us all up and retconned us to oblivion. (Or at least, they **[tried](http://leaguefactions.net/2014/09/04/riots-lore-retcon-and-factions/)**.) Then they posted a bunch of plastic corporate smile-talk nonsense. It was deeply condescending, and deeply un-Riot.\n\nAnd then they proved their point by releasing lore that couldn't work with an in-universe League of Legends. Oh, sorry, I'm like 0/2 here; they released two lore updates that conflict not at all with the League. (If anything, the League helps explain how Azir managed not to get beaten up for his lunch money by Noxus.)\n\nAt this point, I'm wasting words on them. It's been made abundantly clear that, barring an internal revolt of some kind, the Narrative team is committed to going Smash Bros. with League and stripping away not only the game's plot but our place in the universe. Okay. Cool. If so, I have only two things to say.\n\n1. If Narrative is going to throw their hands up in the air and abdicate their responsibility to give League itself a plot, in favor of their new Adventures In Runeterra fantasy series, then they should at least back off and stop telling people on teams like yours to strip out (e.g.) voicework that mentions Summoners. If \"we're still Summoners in-game\", then let us stay Summoners in-game.\n\n2. We in the lore community will just **[pick up where they left off](http://leaguefactions.net/lore/)**. We're not a team of 30 professional authors with an unlimited budget and an office full of ultra-talented coworkers. We're just a handful of people chipping in our free time to make something. But through **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** and other such initiatives, I dare say we've done pretty well. If Narrative is abandoning us, we'll keep going ourselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snakethrower","date":"2014-10-01T19:36:48.052+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense - but if this this is true how is it that the last 100+ pages of feedback to the Cassiopeia rework have been uncommented and the valid critics have been completely ignored?\nThe vast majority of players hate how her concept changed by reducing her kit to a single spell and giving her a passive which completely contradicts her former self?\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4851396","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaoscontrol","date":"2014-10-01T11:45:49.089+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I'm sorry that it feels we \"never act.\" I would argue that sometimes we very much respond to feedback... re-designing the colors on the Warmonger Sion skin is the most recent example I can think of.\n\n\"cough\" Sion Traditional Skin, you got feedback start working on it :D \"cough\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2014-10-01T03:33:16.321+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel I should have clarified.

But at the end of the day, you deleted a good character, and used his name and kit to make a dumb new one. (by that, I mean that new trundle is borderline retarded. I mean, he sold his race into slavery to become king of the slaves, in order to \"save\" them.)\n---\nI also feel you are feeling unnecessary heat on this, partially because you probably worked on Trundle's new art, and partially because Trundle has become a martyr of lore that fans have rallied around. The Lore team has not only botched him horrifically, they botched shurima and Frejlord alongside it, and get upset at the fans for not liking it *even though they refuse to talk or listen to fans before or after the fact, and when they do they get short with the fans and sometimes flat out lie.* \n\nAnd yes, I am counting Skarner, Rammus, and Amumu as lies, as they claimed that the bios would be accompanied by more story, and when pressed they claimed that the story would come with the event. If you are going to delete something to make way for new things, at least follow through with the new things or accept the loss and revert. Don't screw over loyal fans and then throw it in their face like it was their fault all along.\n---\n\nI really hope you pass this thread along to the new Lore lead, with the statement \"Try to maybe address the complaints this time around.\" He needs to see it. The only reason most like the Sion event is because A) No real retcons, and B) it isn't some story that substitutes for lore, but actual lore. Sion probably has the best lore since judgements stopped being a thing. We actually see him get built, get made into the champion that he is, and it doesn't belittle or delete who he was at his core.

The new look could've been more reminiscent of the old Trundle (hair, dance, same voice actor). More importantly, there was no reason to erase the best lore ever written in League (debatable, sure, but it can not be argued that, say, Jax walking into the Institute of War and the doors swinging open without judgement was better storytelling). It would've been far better, and easier, to simply continue the lore. Finally let stories evolve, characters evolve. A new alliance formed and Trundle found some restraint for the plague wrecking his body in the frozen lands of Freljord.\n\nInstead, we got a completely new Trundle, with a completely new character. Rather than the wily wiry underdog, we get a brutish new figure.\n\nIn comparison: Karma remained the same character. Sejuani remained the same character. For Sion it was announced in advance he was to be re-envisioned entirely anew and even now he fairly closely matches what he used to be.\nTrundle ceased to exist and a new character was inserted, which Riot pretended was the same character.\n\nThat is the major gripe the naysayers have.

The communication hasn't been improved. Look at what they did with the Cass rework. It was put on PBE for a very short period of time, and even though players tested and very outwardly said that she was incredibly weak and lost her theme, Riot pushed her to live and look at where she sits now. Urgot tier. Making a mistake and then claiming to need to improve in the future does nothing.

Probably, but we would have rolled it out differently and communicated better.\n\nThis comes across as saying, \"Hey, even with all the input and negative feedback we got, we still would've done this because we know better than you.\" And this is the sentiment people feel emanating from Riot constantly. This superiority complex disenfranchises the community, and rapidly destroys constructive feedback which you then close your comment by asking for. No offense, but why even bother to ask for feedback? Everyone, yourself included, knows that even if every single player in NA responded to that post and told you they hated the new trundle, Riot wouldn't revert or make new changes to him.

Bring back old Trundle with lore (evolved ofc to fit into your new world) and gameplay intact and then take new Trundle, give him a new name and give him a proper kit that does the Ice Troll King theme justice.

I don't think old Trundle would've been that power-hungry. Not that big and bashy. Even now he is supposed to be the runt, yet he looks like a huge hulking troll. He would've become their leader and tried to save them, but while doing it probably realize how they are just looking up to him because he can beat people up now. The old lore had this key point where Trundle realized his tribe was a bunch of simple-minded (excuse the blunt wording) dicks. The new lore is just Trundle being a cunning brute, beating everything and if that doesn't work he tries to lie his way out, then he becomes leader and power-hungry. This is entirely unlike old Trundle. It might be whom old Trundle would've become etc., but it's not who he was. We aren't looking for a new champion here and trying to define him, we are looking at an old champion and trying to fit him as an ice troll.\n\nAlso, more importantly, just read the old lore+judgement, listen to the old Trundle VO, then listen to the new Trundle VO and tell me that's the same troll, because that's the Trundle most people will now hear.\n\nTrundle is the reason I have no faith in the new lore. I feel like they just bluntly took a character from the lore and put a similar one in his place because he had no connections and they wanted a henchman for Lissandra. I don't feel like they put in the care they should put in every single one of their champions. Until Trundle is Trundle, I'm afraid I'll have no love for the lore department. If this means I have to abandon their lore to avoid having one of my favorite characters bluntly crushed and replaced with a shade of his old self again, so be it.\n\nApologies if I sound aggressive, I care about Trundle and have been upset about this quite some time and honestly Riot really quiet on this part as far as I know. I want to love the lore, I just can't right now. It's nothing personal and I definitely don't want to shy away from good discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2014-09-30T22:18:49.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely understand the emotion. I was never very attached to old Trundle, so I'll probably never see it perfectly from your perspective, but I still think it's a very similar character. New Trundle is bigger and bashier, because his new race of trolls are generally bigger than his old race. Since trolls are very bashy in general, it's not hard to draw the conclusion of bigger = bashier. \n\nAs you pointed out, most people say new Trundle is way more power hungry. I actually don't think so. Both Trundles took upon them a burden because they thought it was the best for their people (and to earn their respect): Old Trundle took upon the curse, while new Trundle challenged their chieftain, got humiliated, then risked his life to get his weapon as another solution. \nIn the end, both Trundles earn power over their tribe (although different types of power) and both decide to use it. Old Trundle gets to decide their fate, and decides to take revenge on them for all the years of being treated bad. New Trundle became their chieftain and decided to seize the moment and unite all the troll clans under himself. I'd bet both of them would have done the exact same thing in both situations. \n\nAs for his VO's, to me both Trundles just sound like vicious brutes with a bit of comedy to them. Both constantly talk about beating things and how much it's gonna hurt, but also things like \"I'm troll judge, troll jury, and execu... troll!\" and \"I'm not heartless. I **love** beating.\" They even share some quotes, like the taunt \"If you want me to hit you less, die sooner!\" None of them show any kind of sympathetic or kinder side, but that's probably because they are still trolls on a battlefield.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-09-30T22:42:40.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Trundle took revenge because he realized what his tribe really was after his sacrifice.

This realisation is replaced by a hunger for power.\n\n\"The Freljord is mine!\"\nHis new VO oozes power-hungry all over while old Trundle never exposed any of this.

You managed to clean up his bugs and his clunkiness and gave him some QoL buffs that he desperately needed. Through this, you managed to make him a viable pick without throwing him over the edge into OP territory. He still has clear strengths and weaknesses and it feels like you're playing a big troll smashing people's faces in with a club. 10/10\n\n* Art/Visuals: Great. He looks the way he should be, as a troll with a club that will smash anyone who gets close to him. Pre-VU he did not look like one of the best duelists in the game. Now he does. I still prefer the Cursed Troll look over the Troll King look, which is why I usually use the Traditional skin, but that's tied to the lore update so it's understandable. 8/10\n\n* Lore: Terrible. Not the new lore you replaced it with, but the WAY you changed Trundle's lore without asking for any feedback from his player-base. You pretty much came to us one day and said \"Hey guys, we don't like the way Trundle is right now, so we deleted him. Here's the new Trundle. Deal with it\". I know it's not what you wanted to say, but it's how it felt to us. And you got lucky that you made this mistake with Trundle, who has one of the smallest player-bases in LoL. If it had happened with Caitlyn or Lee Sin or Zed, you wouldn't have gotten one month of \"Riot killed Trundle\" threads. It would have been much, much worse. 0/10\n\nOverall, it was a potentially good update that was completely ruined by your arrogance. If you had just talked to us about what you intended to do with Trundle's lore and asked our opinion on it, I can assure you that you wouldn't have gotten half the hate that you got.

Were the QoL changes enough to make Trundle enjoyable? Yes.\n\nBut with this comes the fact that without even a VU or a lore retcon, would he have been enjoyable? Well, if we are following this from a gameplay perspective in isolation than yes. Now let us factor in a retcon/lore rework. Not everyone plays a champion based on viability. They also don't play a champion based on lore most of the time either. So when people, who are emotionally invested in the lore of a character, disagree with drastic changes made to that character, that is a very legitimate argument. If the QoL changes were done at a separate time as the VU/retcon, the trundle VU/retcon would be an overwhelming failure. The ONLY thing keeping it afloat is by grouping the two of them together, and suggesting that his pick rate saw a dramatic increase due both to the VU and the QoL is misrepresentation of the facts. Trundle is still a Troll, albeit without being a leper. That small adjustment wasn't the causing factor of his pick/winrate skyrocketing. That increase in viability and pickability was from the QoL changes.\n\nAgain, if the QoL changes were released before/after the VU/retcon, the VU/retcon itself would be considered a massive failure. And that is how you have to look at this. You can't put it all in a bag, mix it around, and look at the end result then. You have to dissect the release and contemplate causality, because otherwise you are left with sentiments where players focused on viability and competitive play say it was a success, and those more interested in the personality and lore of a character say it was an abysmal failure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2014-09-30T20:54:44.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">while Urgot is neat, part of the problem is that not many people want to play a downright disgusting monster.\nI do.
