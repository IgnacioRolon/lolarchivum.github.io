Your Hypocrites.\r\nYOU KNOW DAMN WELL that there would be keyboards and curse words flying on your biggest stage.\r\nHere&#039;s the deal riot.\r\nNot all of us are world champions, but we are all competitive. \r\nWhen your competitive players join up Queue and get dealt a face roller you expect them to just stew in the loss and ignore it, we all know you cant give instruction in game, its never the players fault they are 0-20-0, and any mention of it will escalate the conversation!\r\nNext, the overly sensitive group of players give those that dared to give instruction a bad report, hell often times groups of 3 or 4 will play terrible but all report those not in their group for even saying a single thing!\r\n\r\nRIOT THIS IS NOT A ONCE IN A WHILE OCCURRENCE, ITS DAMN NEAR EVERY GAME IN SOLO Q.\r\n\r\nThe result of its consistency is more intolerance and rage leading to.....  \r\n\r\nBANNED for NOT STICKS AND STONES... but WORDS. \r\n\r\nThe pool of Crybabies that don&#039;t really care drowns another competitive player and grows larger and more sensitive with their death. This issue is self compounding as actual gamer&#039;s give up from bans or chat restrictions O LORD DON&#039;T GET ME STARTED ON CHAT RESTRICTION.... So now your punishing an entire team that picks up that player? wouldn&#039;t you say that in itself is stacking the deck for one team or another? Where is the logic in this?!?! It creates MORE PROBLEMS AND FLAME.\r\n\r\n  \r\nJordan was the GOAT, the mans shit talking was just as good as his athleticism. you don&#039;t know competition if you don&#039;t understand that shit talking is a part of it....\r\n\r\n\r\nSo why are u Hypocrites? because you care more about the size of your player pool than their skill level. Because your fucking greedy, that&#039;s why. And I hope you burn in fucking hell for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-15T15:44:58.072+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Riot does not expect you to just stew in the loss. Riot does, however, expect you to conduct yourself in a sportsmanlike manner.\n\nPlayers of professional sports are expected to do the same - be sportsmanlike. That's the point of a red card in soccer (football), the point of a 15 yard penalty/ejection in American football, the point of a power play in hockey... There are penalties for starting fights, verbally abusing someone, harassing, or constantly berating your teammates or the enemy team.\n\nCompetitive BSing such as saying \"nice tp\" to the enemy after they TP in to their death? Not likely to be punished. Constantly harassing your **teammates** of all people? Yeah, you'll be punished.\n\nRiot does not expect perfectly nice behavior. They do, however, expect you to remain sportsmanlike. Gracious in victory, humble in defeat. Not bragging in victory and harassment in defeat.","replies":[{"poster":"Noname01e1qq","date":"2017-11-15T15:59:28.202+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":8,"body":"So tell me about fighting promotions, no cursing or belittling there?\nDid Jordan ever shit talk?\nEven golfers take jabs at eachother.\nYou dont get penalties in any other sport for words.... not even in other ESPORTS","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-15T16:03:01.787+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't get penalties in any other sport for **the rare offhand remark that is in the competitive spirit**.\n\nYou do get penalties in other sports for using hate speech and/or for constantly harassing or belittling someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Noname01e1qq","date":"2017-11-15T16:09:53.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"You are just wrong.
