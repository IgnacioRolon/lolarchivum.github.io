I took up the teemo &quot;persona&quot; and tilted the other team in all chat. The popup said my comms were &quot;extremely inflammatory and offensive&quot;, while all i did was say &quot;I have more kills than u LMAO&quot; in various manners. I called the lux trash once, but that was due to her calling me a %%%%%%, so I think it&#039;s fair to let that one pass by (if that was the ONE reason than got me the ban). Couple of smileys here and there and i told the vei that he&#039;ll stay iron, since he can&#039;t land his q on a sedentary target at point black distance (not really inflammatory as much the truth).

It&#039;s something most people don&#039;t address because it gives them  a sense of power when they report someone postgame and see the instant feedback report (trust me, i know). The fact of the matter is, toxicity is ever-present in competitive environments. Hell, even my ban notification says that the vast majority agree the game is intense and competitive.  You can&#039;t really get rid of it without getting rid of the competitive feel of the game that attracts so many players. There&#039;s also the the fact that the majority of toxicity in the game arises from other players trolling. When one person runs it down mid or intentionally messes up in a game, that effects of it are unavoidable. On the other hand, to deal with &quot;toxicity&quot; there are measures, such as the mute button, making the effects of it minute compared to trolls. Yet the ones who get banned are the ones who react to the trolling, not the root of the problem itself, because the trolls are &quot;just having a bad game&quot;. I&#039;ve been playing league, first casually, for a long time, and in my knowledge, riot has made ZERO EFFORTS to combat the issue of trolling, while they&#039;ve done everything from banning T1 to implementing an honor system for the sake of toxicity. The only concept that barely worked was Tribunal, and it worked because the ones judging you were peers, other players, who didn&#039;t hold any prejudice against you. Don&#039;t know why they took that out. Every time I reported someone for actually trolling, I&#039;ve gotten no feedback reports, while I&#039;ve gotten plenty for reporting someone saying something as shallow as &quot;you&#039;re stupid&quot;. It&#039;s to the point where I don&#039;t report people for being toxic anymore, **because I acknowledge that what caused that toxicity wasn&#039;t them as a player, but rather the game itself, meaning they don&#039;t deserve punishment.**\r\n\r\nYou can look at other competitive games that have lasted years, just like league, that aren&#039;t dying (unlike league lmao, tho the kda thing was pretty snazzy imo), and you&#039;ll see that the companies those games were created by don&#039;t create an artificial snowflake environment for their players. **They understand that a significant part of a competition is to not crack under pressure or give in to insults, so they give the players that responsibility. **CS:GO is a great example of this, as the game has no bans based on toxicity, but rather if u just intentionally suck at the game or troll. Valve understands toxicity, at most, warrants a mute and nothing else.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nGot banned for legitimately no reason, check chat logs, I explain why toxicity is in the essence of competition and therefore league, so hard to get rid of and ban for (hard to summarize).\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, I don&#039;t even care anymore if my account doesn&#039;t get unbanned. I&#039;m happy that riot themselves decided to end my league career here, as I was about to reach the end of the line anyway. Not here to play in a make-believe environment of happiness and positivity lol I like the real world better. I will miss the old days of league though.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTheChosenBurrito","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-01-21T17:07:13.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all,\n\nThis thread has derailed into inflammatory and toxic comments and there is not productive discussion able to go on.

You don't see professional tennis players, for example, screaming insults at the top of their lungs or provoking their opponent during a match. You also don't see them saying \"haha you suck\" at the end of it. They shake hands and respect each other. \n\n-----\n\n> On the other hand, to deal with \"toxicity\" there are measures, such as the mute button\n\nIf you have to mute someone, the damage has already been done. It's like blaming someone who got shot for not wearing a bulletproof vest 24/7. Just because there's a way to shield yourself when it's needed, doesn't mean it should be perceieved as \"Oh, I can flame, they can just mute me if they don't like it.\" \n\n-----\n\n> Yet the ones who get banned are the ones who react to the trolling, not the root of the problem itself\n riot has made ZERO EFFORTS to combat the issue of trolling, while they've done everything from banning T1 to implementing an honor system for the sake of toxicity\n\n-----\n\nYou can react to trolling, but you cannot go out of your boundaries. People \"reacting\" to it usually means them flaming a troll, basically, and breaking the rules themselves in the process. On top of that, gameplay related offences are harder to monitor and require more information than chat related ones. Everything is crystal clear in one's chat log(s), whereas gameplay analysis takes more things into consideration. \n\n-----\n\n> The only concept that barely worked was Tribunal, and it worked because the ones judging you were peers, other players, who didn't hold any prejudice against you\n\nIt didn't work. That's why it got removed in the first place. It took an extremely long time to punish a player, making speed one of its major issues. In order for a player to feel the impact of their punishment, said punishment has to be handed out **quickly **(and that's exactly what the Instant Feedback system is capable of doing). Otherwise, the effect of a system is highly neglected and disregarded. Taking up to a month to punish someone is simply unacceptable, which is why Riot now have a much better and faster system in charge of dealing with toxic behaviour.\n\nAlso, how can an automated system be prejudiced?\n\n-----\n\n> Every time I reported someone for actually trolling, I've gotten no feedback reports\n\nThey don't always pop up. That's intentional, so as to reduce spam.\n\n-----\n\n>  just like league, that aren't dying (unlike league lmao\n\nLeague isn't dying.

I've had a smurf just last season that at level 17 went through all 4 punishment tiers in a week and got permabanned. Even then, I had 3 SEPARATE games of toxicity (separate from the other tiers) to justify the ban. I felt it was well deserved, I was havin a bad week ig. Ain't about no more chances, it's about having a consistency of toxicity for EACH AND EVERY TIER, and here, I only have one game of literally passive aggressiveness towards the other team.\n\n\nI'd just like to say thank you for being extremely objective in your responses to me and my post. Everyone else seems to love to use some form of ad hominem to argue, but I just find that as a waste of time. I feel like we got to something here... Thank you\n\n\nEdit: \nLooked through the links you gave, and every link you gave shows several comments of either profanities or insults against a specific player on their team SEVERAL times within a match, such as \"stfu u moron\" or \" no iq talon\", or even references to drugs, like that one dude LMAO \"anyone here vapes?\" This makes sense in the context of riot's rules (not that I agree lol), because there were several occurrences of **pure** toxicity in the logs, such as profanities, but all i literally said was \"trash\", and that was once throughout the whole \"inting tenmo69\" persona.\n","replies":[{"poster":"theChibiTina","date":"2019-01-21T05:44:33.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem. I mostly just wanted to provide proof that it's possible to get banned for one game so it doesn't look like I'm just pulling it out my ass. lol. Was the toxicity in the other account really vague or maybe over a short period of time (a few games within the course of a couple hours)? I know the system can take some time to process the report or sometimes they receive a manual review. Like maybe someone put some notes in their report that triggered a manual review and by the time it got reviewed a few games had stacked up? To many factors to know for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenBurrito","date":"2019-01-21T05:49:39.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I hate to say it but it was to the point where I would join games and just call everyone n%%%s and run it down.

But even your response to someone who responded to you was toxic.\nYou literally said \"lmao 'go read the summoners code' fam,\" and implied that for doing so they do not have common sense.\n\n\"Stay iron\" is definitely a problem.\nBut honestly, I imagine this was less of a single comment than it was that you repeatedly, over the course of the game, seemed to constantly harass them.\n\nFew things though.. In my experience, people who add \"fam\" to the ends of things they disagree with and immediately follow it up with something toxic (like you did here) are pretty toxic in general. I imagine this was not a one-game thing.\n\nNow, I do think people seem to take things way too personally and get offended more easily than they should... But in the end, you posted a string of things that never seemed to stop. This is more than friendly banter or trash talking. You wanted to really drive it home that you felt they were trash and would be \"iron\" forever. That is a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenBurrito","date":"2019-01-21T04:57:46.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-01-21T07:03:01.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheChosenBurrito,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vLz8VWhz,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-01-21T04:57:46.829+0000)\n>\n> Check yourself for a minute.... Your&#x27;re telling me I&#x27;m toxic for something YOU IMPLIED after reading what I wrote. Let me repeat. YOU claim I&#x27;m toxic for something YOU IMPLIED. You&#x27;re blaming the way YOU think on ME.\n> \n> Now, in response to the iron comment. In hindsight, it may have not  the nicest thing to tell someone to stay in iron, but you seem to be misunderstanding a few things. There really was only 2 things I said to my team. One was that iron comment to veigar, and the other was the toxic trash comment for her using a gay slur to lux. The rest of it, which you claim be of me trying to hammer home that I was a significantly better being than them, was literally to THE OTHER TEAM. HAH IM TEEMO AND I BIG KDA THNA U  was to THE ENEMY TEAM, NOT MINE.\n> \n> There nothing here for you to imagine or imply, I provided the chat logs, so there&#x27;s no need to &quot;imagine that this was less of a single comment&quot;.\n> TY you tried, but next time at least read the chat logs i provide if you&#x27;re not going to read the post.\n\nNo, I am not blaming you for something I think.\nI am stating that this is in /addition/ to the other things.\n\nAs for hammering them home.\nBeing toxic to the enemy team is still toxic. And in your \"enemy team only comments\" you were constantly stating how bad your team is. You are clearly toxic throughout that entire post. Just look at the way you respond to me? And everyone else.\n\nAnd I read the post. You provided a copy and past of a single game. Which is what you claim got you perma banned. However, I can almost certainly guarantee that you have previous marks against you for toxicity or you would not be perma-banned. Perhaps you should actually read what is being said before attacking people and claiming that they did not read what you said, hmm?","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenBurrito","date":"2019-01-21T15:00:17.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-01-21T15:19:32.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheChosenBurrito,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=vLz8VWhz,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-01-21T15:00:17.266+0000)\n>\n> To start off, you legit blamed be for the way YOU think on me, I&#x27;ll let that one slip, considering everything else you&#x27;ve said in the reply is ridiculous enough to deserve a response.\n> \n> So you made two points, one that toxicity towards the enemy team is still toxic. My sole response to this is the same response I&#x27;ve said throughout this chain. The TIPS that appear at the start of the goddamn game literally mention that tilting the other team is completely fine. THE GAME ITSELF ALLOWS TILTING THE ENEMY. I honestly don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re basing your argument on, but whatever I guess.\n> \n> Second, you said I was stating how bad my team was constantly on /all chat.... lmao... and you said you read the post...\n> \n> I literally wrote in the post several times, and in RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENT, that I WAS THE TEEMO, saying HAH INTING TENMO69 MORE KEEL THNA U in /all chat. Third person my guy, not my own team... Literally nothing, and I mean nothing to do with my team whatsoever.\n> \n> \n> You go on to imply that I lied, because YOU YOURSELF SAY that THIS ONE GAME IS NOT WORTHY OF A PERMABAN, meaning I must&#x27;ve not provided the rest of the logs lmao. Riot literally has primary access to all the logs and recordings of games... don&#x27;t go around bullshitting ppl. For real... just stop.\n> \n> Now you seem to be hurt by the way I&#x27;ve responded to you, and you think I hurt others when I responded to them. I&#x27;ve used the same level of aggression, if not less, as you. If you get offended by purely objective statements... I honestly don&#x27;t know what to say to you. As some short man said... Facts don&#x27;t care about your feelings,\n> \n> GL in life.\n\nHonestly, all you did was say I was a liar while claiming to be the victim?\n\nWhat I actually said is nothing like what you claim.\nAnd what I said was completely accurate based on what you posted.\n\nOne game is not going to get you perma-banned generally. I did not say you needed to provide other logs. What I meant is that you must have had previous restrictions. Are you claiming that you did not?\n\nAs for being hurt? Nah.\nYou have not offended me at all. I am merely pointing out that what when you say in all chat \"inting Karthus\" and so on it is clearly commenting about a person.\n\nOn the part of tilting your enemies... No where at all does it say you can harass them.\nYou comment so much in the allchat that it is pretty easy to take that as harassment.\n\nIn the end, you provided a log that many people have pointed out is actually in violation of the rules and is toxic. Much like Riot pointed it out to you as well. What you do with that knowledge is up to you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"UKP LK","date":"2019-01-21T04:30:58.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh you dont get it do you, flaming/tilting enemy team is not allowed either, you have to play nice, thats riot rule.
