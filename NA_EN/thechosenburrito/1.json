Later, when our jg should have been ganking, he got killed by a creep (I&#039;m relatively new to the game so I call it the rock creep). I pinged him to fall back, but he didn&#039;t, instead, when I asked what he was doing, he said &quot;stfu&quot;. I asked him why he was being toxic, and instead of him replying, Singed, our top-laner, called me a &quot;toxic whiny little bitch&quot;. I pointed out that he was being toxic by saying this, and he immediately follows by encouraging me as a troll on global chat. He told them to report me and most of them said they would. I tried to explain what happened on /all chat, but no one replied, so I assume they thought that I was a troll, as Singed was the one to talk first. Singed continued harassing me all game, and Xin Zhao continued ignoring bot lane, so we pretty much lost. I reported both of them post game and provided an explanation of what happened. I simply don&#039;t understand why I get a chat restriction for &quot;unsportsmanlike conduct&quot; when I was the victim of the entire situation. Is it because even though Singed was the one to call me several profanities, he was the one who got more enemies to report me? If that&#039;s how it is, the entire discipline system is messed up. It&#039;s unreasonable to simply ban someone because a considerable amount of people reported him. The actual events of the game should be reviewed and assessed before a punishment is given. I honestly don&#039;t mind the chat restriction, but I&#039;m just surprised at the fact that I&#039;m the one who got punished. I hope Riot could address this issue, and also that no one else, especially in low elos like me, suffers this situation. Thank your for spending time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-06-11T01:17:00.044+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't a contest to see who was the most toxic and will be punished in that specific game. \n\nThe system works on consistency x severity. Meaning you would have had to build up a pattern for the system to recognize that you were toxic (even if it is just mild toxicity) often enough, and needs to be punished . \n\nYou have no idea what XinZhao and Singed's behavioral history is like. The system will review their actions based on their history, at the same time, you will be reviewed based on your history alone.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenBurrito","date":"2018-06-11T01:21:02.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Understood, one question though. Does the system have more incentive to ban a player if multiple people banned them?

The system is purposely programmed that way to prevent premades from abusing the solo guy. \n\nAlso, false reports don't mean anything. The system has the capability to filter out false reports.\n\nThose two points together means that:\n\n1. There is no need to ask for reports\n2. There is no need to defend yourself against people's reports\n\nAsking for reports is typically a threat to try to get someone punished. If you don't like what someone is doing, just report it yourself. No need to ask for reports. \n\nCounter-flaming someone back as \"defense\" is also not necessary. Infact, counter flaming counts as flaming, so the system will just treat you as a toxic player. If you need to \"Defend\" yourself, typically the mute button is good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"TheChosenBurrito","date":"2018-06-11T01:28:39.982+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info, I think I understand now why I got punished.
