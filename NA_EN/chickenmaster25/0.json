I can't ALT+TAB, can't use WINDOWS button, can't move my mouse. I'm guessing that the game crashed my computer. Sometimes the last heard sound output from the game freezes and keeps on repeating that sound endlessly. Then I'm forced to restart my computer since the screen is just stuck there. Then sometimes after I reconnect back to the game, after a few minutes it freezes again. It is completely random, fps is smooth all the time, yet the game just suddenly freezes.\r\n\r\nNote that this had never happened ever in my about 1000 of my games in League of Legends. It just started crashing three days ago, after Patch 6.18. Although I don't know if its the patch, I was busy after the patch and didn't play for about a week. When I started playing again, this started to happen.\r\n\r\nAlso take note that, I had been using my computer when I wasn't playing league for that week, and my computer never crashes. Even before the patch. It only crashes when I play league, no other games crashes and freezes my computer like that.\r\n\r\nI've done some research, and found that people had the same problem as me few years ago.\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2335302&amp;page=1 \r\nAnd this: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1947342 \r\nAnd this: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2556111&amp;page=1\r\n\r\nPlease help! I can't play properly and team keeps flaming me for going afk for about 5 minutes while I quickly try to restart and reconnect to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:55:26.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may be caused by hardware issues or driver problems, as they're common causes for system freezes. I recommend first ensuring this isn't caused by the Xbox Game Bar (if you're running Windows 10) by [disabling the game bar entirely. ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) If you continue to have issues, I recommend working through the steps in our [Bugsplat & Crash guide.\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)\n\nLet me know if those steps caused any change in your freezing.","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenMaster25","date":"2016-09-19T13:29:13.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE2: Literally the next game after I said it was fixed, League made my computer crashed.

Visual C++ is *very unlikely* to be the cause for entire PC Freezes since freezes are usually the result of driver or hardware issues.\n\nI strongly suggest working through **all** the steps listed in the Bugsplat guide and let me know if anything changes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChickenMaster25","date":"2016-09-19T09:25:55.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: May this be because of Microsoft Visual C++ issue? Yesterday I reinstalled league and I don't think the client checked if I had that program and downloaded it again so there are two of the same Microsoft Visual C++ program thing.\n\nPlease look at this screenshot: https://postimg.org/image/y1v6liggx/\n\nThere are two Microsoft Visual C++ 2005, and I'm pretty sure there was only one before I reinstalled my game. Or did I get it wrong? Maybe there are two at the first place? I don't know. Then I decided to try LoL in Garena, the League of Legends in Asia, cause I was too tired playing  and crashing every 10-30 minutes. Downloaded overnight.\n\nThe next day, I tried to play League of Legends in NA, and the first game it crashed again, but the next 8 games till now the game haven't been crashing my computer. Maybe I was just lucky, sometimes it may not crash in a few games. I'm not sure, I'll update you again after I play some more games.\n\nAny thoughts about the microsoft visual thing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChickenMaster25","date":"2016-09-19T03:42:34.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But can I fix this problem by completely formatting my computer? Meaning to format all data and completely start over again like when you get your new laptop. I pretty sure none of those steps in the Bugsplat & Crash guide will work, I tried some and I've seen people fail multiple times when I made my research lol. Will formatting help this issue?","replies":[]}]}]}
