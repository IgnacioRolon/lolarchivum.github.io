I get in game, around 30 ping, everything seems fine. After the first few minutes (~5 minute mark if I had to guess), I will just straight up disconnect, and never be able to reconnect to the game. Luckily, I have access to my landlord's ISP (Rogers) and use that laggily to finish out the games when it happens, but there must be a better solution! To be clear, I have disconnected and not been able to reconnect later in games as well, but 8/10 times, this is how it goes down.\r\n\r\nMy best assumption is that the games which go bad are hosted on a set of servers that is having connection issues with Bell? But why am I alright for the first couple of minutes?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know anything I can do to solve this, or help you guys/Bell figure it out. I'm coming to this board before Bell, as getting anything useful out of them is 10000x more difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T23:21:53.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could certainly be an issue with how your ISP is reaching the game server, or even local issues.  You should run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, which will help rule out local possibilities.  There are also some steps there which may allow you to change some of your routing.  Give it a go and see if it gets any better.","replies":[]}]}
