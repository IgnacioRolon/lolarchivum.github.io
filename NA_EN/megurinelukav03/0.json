I'll join a game (I mainly play bots) and every 30 seconds or so my ping will go from a solid 40 to up over 600 then after a few seconds drop back down again. I have upnp enabled on my router so I shouldn't have to manually open the ports for the game though I can try that and see I suppose. Anyone else having the same issues? anyone have these issues and fix them? I'll all ears for suggestions. This is really making the game unplayable and unenjoyable for me. Those of you curious why I only play bots, its because I get super anxious and nervous rather easily, multi-play isn't good for my sanity at that point. xD","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T00:40:08.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't hurt to make sure your settings are configured, and you can also use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically do that.

Your game is not worth all the bs hoops I have to jump through to play it. Everytime I try to play this game I get some problem or other that crops up. Total frame skips for one....click around the map and it will actually skip frames even though I'm @ 150fps. It's always something with this game and this was the last straw.","replies":[]}]}]}
