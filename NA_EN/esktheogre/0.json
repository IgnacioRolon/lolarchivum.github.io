Then my team blamed me , as the soraka support for his feeding top and asked me to apologies. I am not a humble person, i have no reasons to be and i speak towards how i play. If i play like shit i apologies, if my team feeds 20 kills by the 10 minute mark three matchs in a row it gets hard not to be salty. Then my  adc fed and got mad when we had lost all towers and told them no i wont but wards because you are all playing like shit and i cant afford to support you entirely. \r\nThis was the third match of what genuinely felt like playing with a team of bots and the enemy team repeatedly apologies to me on their behalf. Keep in mind i had been supporting the entire match regardless of  a large portion of my team legitimately trolling me and flaming me in chat.\r\nAs for the second part. i dont understand why riot thinks that \"toxicity\" is saying stop being a %%%% when your teammates refuse to get objectives and hen flame you for taking a tower or anything. The general community of silver is toxic im guessing but i cant even mute then entire team or then i get reported for ignoring people or if i make a bad play i just get flamed without me knowing and end up with an even higher chance of being banned or muted ect.  This is a video game with people ranging from the ages of like  9-30, (at least out of the players ive met) and those are the people who are going to shit talk and flame people for being garbage. \r\n\r\nI suppose the point i'm making is this isn't remotely worthy of a ban,  especially when the matches where genuinely full of either trolls or new players. The lol community needs to grow up and learn to mute or communicate. People swear and theirs a chat filter and a mute button , why is it bannable for swearing or being toxic again? especially when its a competitive moba, something meant to be taken seriously not a place to screw around and it should be expected if you play horribly or are trolling. The players have no control over it so its an even more frustrating roll for us all.\r\nOn another note , I am constantly getting commended but because since i was  banned I can no longer receive commends? how does that make any sense. If i'm rude on a few occasions but have hundreds of commends built up over years that are now erased and are unable to be replenished?\r\nI've been playing this game for five years, ive had many many accounts on all your severs and have spent upwards of a 700 dollars at this point and have never asked for anything and have almost never gotten help with any ticket ive ever submitted. So maybe this will be a more effective place to post.\r\nGame 1\r\nEskTheOgre: praise the sun, for we may be as incandecent as it\r\nEskTheOgre: i cant tell if you trolling or actually this salty , but imma mute you. just a heads up love\r\nEskTheOgre: just mute\r\nEskTheOgre: i like dogs :D\r\nEskTheOgre: so easy\r\nEskTheOgre: damn\r\nEskTheOgre: what?\r\nEskTheOgre: what?\r\nEskTheOgre: ive literally had him muted all game\r\nEskTheOgre: hes feeding cause hes shit probably. go gank\r\nEskTheOgre: gj birdy\r\nEskTheOgre: that called skill. miamore &lt;4\r\nEskTheOgre: we dont really need a gank haha\r\nEskTheOgre: i tried so hard :C\r\nEskTheOgre: wut\r\nEskTheOgre: ?!!?1\r\nEskTheOgre: i thought i had like 400 health mb i guess\r\nEskTheOgre: how do i get these teams everytime?>\r\nEskTheOgre: just loooked at the score.\r\nEskTheOgre: birdy we gotta carry em\r\nEskTheOgre: you havent muted him yet?\r\nEskTheOgre: please report, the toxic trolll lmao\r\nEskTheOgre: prob trollin\r\nEskTheOgre: so close\r\nEskTheOgre: cancer\r\nEskTheOgre: secure\r\nEskTheOgre: atacvk\r\nEskTheOgre: you can fight look at his build\r\nEskTheOgre: ....\r\nEskTheOgre: why give away a kill\r\nEskTheOgre: ?\r\nEskTheOgre: when its 13-4\r\nEskTheOgre: im not gonna bother supping when my team is feeding\r\nEskTheOgre: dont even care, literally third team like this in a row.\r\nEskTheOgre: probably because no one is doing shit but feeding\r\nEskTheOgre: and flaming\r\nEskTheOgre: and you made  a really stupid play when we are so far behind.\r\nEskTheOgre: im silver\r\nEskTheOgre: was gold and would be if you guys could play for shit.\r\nEskTheOgre: ?\r\nEskTheOgre: they wonder why im made at them right now\r\nEskTheOgre: well report and gg i guess.\r\nEskTheOgre: ya hes a troll.\r\nEskTheOgre: he flamed everyone on both teams and fed\r\nEskTheOgre: they blame me for our top feeding some how. \r\nEskTheOgre: its impressive to me\r\nEskTheOgre: 2v3\r\nEskTheOgre: nvm\r\nEskTheOgre: end quick please.\r\nEskTheOgre: you fed early ....\r\nEskTheOgre: as did top adn jungle.\r\nEskTheOgre: got tema just push\r\nEskTheOgre: they are  down\r\nEskTheOgre: had two teammates nextto me watch that lmao\r\nEskTheOgre: please do. im so sick of these trolls.\r\nEskTheOgre: you all played like shit and fed 20 kills 10 minutes in.... im not gonna waste gold for you.\r\nEskTheOgre: thats why i didnt buy one\r\nEskTheOgre: as i said the same thing  earlier\r\nEskTheOgre: gj trying to contests\r\nEskTheOgre: first match of the day and we get these kids. gg hopefully your lucks better then mine.\r\nEskTheOgre: feed\r\nEskTheOgre: yes, we are losing becasue we cant see them in our base\r\nEskTheOgre: how do you fiugre?

You announced that you were going to use mute at the start of the match, which would have been your best defense to protect yourself and focus on the game.  To be fair, the comments made by the other player were pretty repulsive, but it's not an opening to throw the match off kilter.  Retaliating just adds you to the pool of negativity, and everyone contributing to that will be reviewed. \n\nHonors in some games also doesn't excuse contributing to bad experiences for others, and neither does how much you spent.  You don't have to be a shining flower among everyone you see, but you also don't have to use chat to argue, lash out, or demean others.\n\nYou've received penalties in the past, so this was the next step up the ladder per the [Instant Feedback System](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-).
