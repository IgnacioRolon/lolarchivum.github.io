Right now in many cases it&#039;s damage is no better than a sheen, and in some cases worse than a base sheen. This should never happen, AP junglers invest a lot of weakness into the early clears, they need to get some pay off from it. Upgrading your item only to have it deal less damage is a kick in the balls, a player should never have to worry about this. I&#039;d go as far saying regardless of it is op it should be changed.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s all the time I have, see ya.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-06-26T04:29:41.214+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, for it to be even close to slot efficient, it needs at least 60 AP.

Ok, I'm going to build more anyways, and the mana sustain seems worth it.\nHaving a shit AP ratio? Now you're cheating me out of some serious damage potential.\n\nIf they make it have a 50% AP ratio and the AoE works like Tiamat instead, it keeps the AoE damage under control while still making the spellblade worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Definitely Bait","date":"2015-06-26T02:17:35.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just imagine what buffing it will do to champs like Diana and Skarner..

Dynamic spellblade gives you better early scaling without buffing late scaling.

Such that you can switch it whenever you deem it necessary. Just keep in mind you won't clear as well or have extra gold per camp however, so do so come a time whenyou would be able to clear fine with late game items and might find yourself with ample gold, especially since around the 40 min mark things are more centered around big objectives/team fights which is where the bulk of your gold will come from at this point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-06-26T06:44:59.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> Right now everyone agree's it's weak, I don't play AP junglers or jungle at all, so I'm not going to debate one way or the other, all I will say is I'd rather an item be a little underpowered than a little over powered.\n\nYou literally just told us why you shouldn't be taken serious. \n\nI like how you are careful to mention only part of the passive.\nExtra +30% of your AP\nDamage is AOE\n8% missing mana restored \n1.5 second cooldown \n\nThis does plenty of damage, helps clear, and offers mana.\n\nThe item works as intended.","replies":[]}]}
