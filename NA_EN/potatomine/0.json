It seems to break so many rules for how League of Legends abilities are designed, what reason is there for it to linger for so long after missing? Heck I can understand if it did the &quot;plop&quot; at the end and then went away, but why make it linger? Surely this is power that could be moved to a better place on her kit?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-05T03:38:58.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It forms a useful obstacle and can be used to clip unsuspecting moving targets with a larger AoE, like any skillshot that explodes at the end.","replies":[{"poster":"PotatoMine","date":"2018-08-05T07:42:51.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about the plop, I'm talking about it staying around after for multiple seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}
