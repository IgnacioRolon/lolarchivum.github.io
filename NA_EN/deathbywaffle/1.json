I really hope they have some super bad ass skin or something for him when he comes back, because if not, a lot of people are going to be upset. I know personally, if that stunt where pulled with Udyr, I would be complaining so damn hard, and be so infuriated.

They just made jokes about it, and suddenly became surprised people were annoyed.\n\nIt isn't one way or the other. There are and were multiple better ways to handle this, and it isn't that they didn't handle it the right way, they just didn't do anything after the disabling, aside from make jokes towards people legitimately wanting to know what was going on and why he was STILL disabled.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-08-03T00:29:08.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could say something about colorbind mode, etc. There would probably be some issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-08-02T23:20:50.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they had only disabled him in the lore-centric game modes, that wouldn't have bothered me nearly as much.

What about that don't you get? \n\nNot to mention the new skin is being terribly received because...we want a pirate. Gangplank is no longer a pirate. If that is what you consider a Pirate them wow.

I get that a lot of effort went into the skin, the event, everything. But when you take something from someone, something they purchased, that's scary. Yeah, you have the right to do it in the ~~EULA~~ TOS, yeah yeah. That doesn't make people feel better when all of a sudden they find that something they purchased has been taken away from them without a gamplay related reason. Riot hasn't had the best of track records on communication in the past. There isn't a whole lot of trust. Especially in Lore. That's hard to hear, I know, since I now see you are a Writer (I was on my phone before). But a fair number of people tend to be afraid of what Riot does, be it is my main going to get nerfed next or have his/her/its lore completely removed/retconned and then ignored for months going on years. \n\nYou got to see people working hard and putting in a lot of effort. All we got to see was Rioters going \"Yep he's dead.\" for several days and waiting anxiously for any thing at all. There was a massive conspiracy theory going around for a while that he was disabled due to a bug with his E barrels and Draven. People didn't even want to believe Riot would disable a champ without a gameplay reason. So I get that you are angry and don't feel like your/other Rioters' hard work is appreciated.
