You know, like football or something.  But there are some good reasons why dynamic queue makes LoL a lot different from how people would get to the NFL.\r\n\r\nTo get to the NFL, you know what people do?  They play college football.  And even that is broken up into divisions and you mostly play teams from your own division.  A division III team is not expected to win against a division I or even a division II team.  This is good for a lot of the players since it lets them play games against others that are mostly at a similar skill level.  Obviously there are some very good players even on lesser teams and some lesser players even on great teams.  This is pretty much inevitable.  But even still, this is just like how it felt in the old solo queue.  You were in a game of players mostly around your own skill level so you could try to figure out how to outplay or just stay 1 step ahead of what they were planning to do in order to try to win.\r\n\r\nNow what does dynamic queue do?  Does it really get you ready for the NFL (or LCS or whatever) or help you improve or anything like that?  IMO, it fails to do that.  It actually takes away a lot of the potential gain and a lot of the potential competitiveness that a player could experience.  Here&#039;s why.  Instead of being a division III team against another division III team like everyone would want to play, one team has a premade with a couple NFL players on it.  Not only that, they can tell the rest of their premade how they should build and strategize as well.  The result is more like either you don&#039;t stand a chance since your team didn&#039;t do the same, or you&#039;re the receiver they just never throw to since they have so much more communication with their other receiver and he&#039;s just that much better of a player so they just always throw the ball to him.  In other words, you do nothing and get a free win anyways.\r\n\r\nIn either case, this gets in your way of figuring out how to get better.  You&#039;ll try to think about why you won or lost, and it&#039;s simple.  Because one team had some ridiculous smurf premade.  This stops you from thinking about a lot of the other important things you&#039;d want to work on to improve your game.  And sadly a lot of the things you should improve to really get better are a lot harder to get much practice on in this setting.  On teams where you just win for free, you never had to figure out how to win teamfights or anything and just won them no matter what you did.  You might even reach false conclusions about what&#039;s good.  Against teams where you just lose it just feels depressing and like there&#039;s no validity in the system because your bad opponents are increasing their rank without actually being any better, so that it makes you feel like rank is meaningless and that anyone could get to diamond if they got good enough friends to use smurf accounts and boost them.\r\n\r\nContinuing from that last point, it really makes me feel not competitive about wanting to get a high rank.  It just doesn&#039;t feel like it means anything anymore.  It just feels like getting good or getting to a high ranking doesn&#039;t really matter anymore as there&#039;s no measure of how good you are anymore.  In the old solo queue, it actually felt like your rank measured how good you were.  Now that there&#039;s no measure of how much you improve, it&#039;s really not feeling very motivating to improve since you don&#039;t even know what improved your game and what didn&#039;t.  It just feels like the game is now just always normals and ranked essentially is just more normals.  It doesn&#039;t seem like the game I&#039;d keep playing for generations or anything, at least not in its current state.","replies":[{"poster":"zmmby","date":"2016-04-15T06:34:24.146+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":8,"body":"no need to complain anymore since they dont care, too many kids are buying riven and graves skins\n\njust pick the most broken champ of the patch, build tank bruiser items and pat urself on the shoulder like the rest does \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"franticFurball","date":"2016-04-15T08:57:31.823+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":7,"body":"Or I just quit playing this joke of a game, and go to overwatch ^^ Stopped buying RP a long time ago anyway, League doesn't deserve my attention any more.","replies":[{"poster":"PDE5 Inhib","date":"2016-04-15T11:35:25.029+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":21,"body":"Have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"franticFurball","date":"2016-04-15T17:08:16.265+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I will, thanks :D\nHere is a short list why:\n\nIn overwatch...\n\n* I wait 10 seconds for a game **no matter what I want to play**\n* I am not fixed to a role\n* I am not trapped for an hour in an unfun game which the 2 jokers who make it unfun refuse to surrender\n* My fun cannot be lowered by selection-trolls or abusive premades\n* It measures actual, PERSONAL skill\n* Its more dependent on personal skill (Aim, speed, tactiacal thinking) than on following the joke of a FotM - pseudochoice that nowadays counts as meta\n* If you want to be an assassin in Overwatch, you have to actually deal with the fact that you are squishy...tankyness is an inherent attribute of the heroes, not something granted by an item build\n* A game doesn't include tedious 20 minutes of \"farm and run away all the time\"\n* A game can't be drawn out by cowardly \"pull back, kitekitekite no-interacion\" gameplay\n\nAnd as to spending money on looking good: Yes, Overwatch has skins :D\n\nOh, and did I mention: If someone goes AFK, the game is over after a few minutes.

The only thing i hate is the fact that you get really messed up against premades because of their communication and if you're on a team with premades there's no communication whatsoever. When you get 4 man dived under turret in bot and see how well it was executed you can't help but smile and cry at the same time because, you know, fking dynamic que.
