Not just stuff like Mundo OP, but even things like Thresh has been top tier or close to it since before I ever started playing this game.  And I&#039;m platinum, so that really says a lot.  So why hasn&#039;t he just simply been significantly nerfed yet?  Well, here&#039;s why:\r\n\r\nHook:  LC$BIGPLAY$\r\nFlay:  LC$BIGPLAY$\r\nLantern:  LC$BIGPLAY$\r\nThe Box:  LC$BIGPLAY$\r\n\r\nThe Riot balance team member probably tried to nerf him like 100 times now, but his boss always told him that money is the most important thing, and we need to keep the LC$BIGPLAY$ champions high tier to try to make the LCS more exciting, not caring much about the balance of the game for most of its players.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the game is then badly unbalanced for most players and many of them are abandoning their favorite champions for ones higher on the tier list in order to try to win.  It&#039;s a less fun experience for everyone, even the players that stick with their good champions.\r\n\r\nNow I know it&#039;s easy to get all caught up in stuff like Mundo OP here in the preseason, but that kind of imbalance will get fixed soon enough.  The difference between what is wanted by normal players and what is wanted for the LCS is a big one, and the real source of the problem leading to the real vast majority of the imbalance in the game once most of the recent seasons have gotten past their respective preseasons.\r\n\r\nNow, how do we fix this?  Well, there&#039;s one solution that could eliminate both problems at once.  And it may seem a huge change to some, but I think it would lead to more enjoyment by just about everyone.  Here&#039;s my proposal:\r\n\r\nWhat if we had an LCS of Diversity?  You might say that the game will never be balanced well enough for that to happen.  That&#039;s OK, there&#039;s another way to make it happen.  What if we had an LCS with a few new rules?  Something like each team can only use each champion once.  This would make the LCS much more appealing to most players since they&#039;d really like to see all the diversity, all the plays that are made with each individual champion, all the new picks, new strategies, etc.  How well things worked for that one team that used the worst champions in the game in the first match, in an attempt to get slightly better champions than their opponents in future matches.  And this would still be a very competitive tournament.  In fact, I&#039;m pretty confident that the best team would be about as likely to win as in the current LCS.  But it would probably draw a lot more fans of this game into watching it.  And it solves the whole issue of the game not being able to be balanced for us non-LCS players, so I think most players would be happier this way.\r\n\r\nOf course it might need a little fine-tuning, such as no ban phase once each team doesn&#039;t have many champions left to choose from, but it could definitely be made to work if enough effort is put into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2015-12-09T23:09:14.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be fun to see a tournament played with rules that were different like \"you can't play the same champion twice\" or \"you can't play the same role twice\" Not sure i would watch a whole months long league with those rules though.\n\nI think they need more tournaments like the All-Stars where they do some stuff that is different but it feels like there is no room to organize them with the LCS and other international leagues. Not that the leagues themselves are bad for the game just kinda restrict what they can do.","replies":[]}]}
