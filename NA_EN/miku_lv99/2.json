It's another when there is the existence of the blatantly obviously hugely favorited champion by the balance team.  People said they should quit or something if J4 was nerfed before him, and look, J4 got nerfed but he didn't.  So now he's pretty much the definitive jungler.  And if you lose against him, I think it'd just feel like there was nothing you could do.  You lost since the game was just that unbalanced and he was just that much better than your team's jungler.  I feel like if he's ever on my opponent's team now I don't think I can bring myself to even play.  I will just have to dodge all of them.  Yes I know he can be beaten but pretty much only if he screws up.  He is so overloaded it seems like he can come out of almost anything ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"vIbvdOwbko","date":"2015-02-27T03:02:36.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find me someone that makes zero mistakes playing this game and I will admit that Lee Sin is too op(in their hands, to say).\n\nOtherwise can you low elo scrubs stfu about Lee Sin already lol?

It just feels like there's just nothing I can do to prevent losing to him.  He'll either ruin my mid or top lanes so they're so fed my team doesn't stand a chance, ruin my team's jungle, or my adc will push all the way to their tower to the point where he can just waltz in with a lane gank and be able to get my adc killed even if I do land a stun on him.  He seems to have very little counterplay and even the counterplay you mention is not sufficient to win games against him.  And my team's jungler is never as useful as he is.\n\nOther thing is, I can never seem to snowball against him.  I'm seemingly almost always winning bot lane.  But then he camps it.  And then my adc keeps going too deep and we probably both end up dying.  And Lee is so powerful at that stage of the game that you can't even safely ward the tri bush if you're on the purple side of the map.  I can have my adc be like 5-0 at 15 minutes and yet my team still probably finds a way to end up losing the game.  Is there some better way to take more advantage of being way ahead?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordDarkshayde","date":"2015-02-27T02:26:54.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just like any high mobility champ. Learn to land a single hard cc on him and he can melt quite easily. I don't outright fear any champ in this game cause they can all be beaten with proper mechanics and teamwork. Stop worrying so much about \"OMG SO OP\" and just play the game to the best of your ability. Yes, he has incredible gank potential (learn to ward so you can see him coming), yes he has easy escape potential (guess what if he's escaping you kicked his ass just let the kill go and concentrate on objectives). No champion in this game is too OP you just need to learn how to fight them.","replies":[{"poster":"Zmuecat","date":"2015-02-27T02:37:03.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't wrong, everyone in this game is beatable, but it's about how much of an upward climb it is for the champion pool to deal with.\n\nHalf of the tips you give for Lee can also be said for any jungler, and the argument \"Just learn to CC him and you'll be kay\" is poor as well, just about every champion will melt if they get hit with a CC or two and focused.\n\nLee isn't impossible to beat, but the gap needs to be lessened. He has too much in his kit, a couple of things in there are completely unneeded (spell vamp at least, probably doesn't need a slow given his 2 gap closers). You could take away the damage from his ult and it would STILL be game defining.\n\nSame could be said of Thresh, but that's another thread and I'm just throwing him out there cause THE CHAINS, THE CHAINS.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-27T02:29:08.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play nidalee.
