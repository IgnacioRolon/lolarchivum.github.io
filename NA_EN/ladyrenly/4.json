This means Malzahar cannot be in your base taking your inhibitor at 6-7 minutes. \r\n-Even more increased passive gold generation, so even if Eve/Shaco/Zed get through, you won&#039;t be completely starved\r\n-You can just freely duke it out on an open map without worrying about towers\r\n-You start at level 3, not level 1. Some champions have too much of an oppressive level 1 in URF, being able to have all basic abilities right off the bat helps level the playing field somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it&#039;d be worth a shot to see how it fares out, to perhaps make URF a bit less snowbally and remove the restrictive feel the game mode has being on The Rift. I just want to get 6 items and fight, not have to constantly have to base past 8 minutes because no one is dealing with Malzahar and lose before I even have a chance to get full build going.","replies":[{"poster":"L4T3NCY","date":"2016-07-23T22:33:46.055+0000","up_votes":105,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hmm, still wouldn't really solve for the pick-clumping around particular popular champs.

I close the gap with E, but wait if I do that I'm basically offering up a free kill because she has that much more damage.\n\nok lets try aatrox, this time facing a leblanc, she keeps using her Q to poke me into oblivion and any attempt at engaging are met with a dash + tether, at this point no matter how skilled I may be I cannot win because the ranged + CDR advantage is too big.\n\nso melee turns out not to work, lets try a ranged champion, say, miss fortune, this time I'm facing a zed, not only are the minions at my tower all the time I also every 2 seconds have to dodge his Q and have no way to retaliate due to his insane poke range with W + Q, again, no matter how skilled I may be I'm not going to kill him but he will be killing me''just dodge'' fine concept in normals, not when he uses his Q every 2 seconds as no doubt eventually you'll get hit.\n\nI could go on and on, the point being some champions scale vastly more with CDR then others and the counterplay that exists in normal/ranked doesn't anymore when you take it to urf, facing evelyn in normal as zac? rush a visage and that evelyn won't be killign you any time soon, rush a visage in URF? you won't be able to beat her no, you in fact still won't be able to come close with dying horribly.\n\nso as you see, even if you are more skilled then the other player you will still die, sure you can avoid dying to a evelyn because of her short range so tower keeps you safe, at least early on, but you cannot avoid doing so against a zed or leblanc if you do not also happen to pick a OP champions\n\nnumerous champions have been called OP in URF and therefore it is not true? as a matter of fact so many champions are OP that for that reason the game is less fun, take a E from urgot you're dead, hecarim charges in with E and roflcopters you to dead, zed infinitely spams w/q and you're dead, alsitair annoys the living hell out of you by nearly perma ccíng you and being unkillable and you kill yourself, why do you think so many people want URF to be random? because they are tired of seeing the same 16-20 OP champions being picked and banned every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Psi21","date":"2016-07-25T21:19:17.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IS3E531E3F964391,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qEvWW8l9,comment-id=0006000a00010002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-25T16:02:49.233+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m having the same experience in every URF game where I see the exact same 16-20 champions being picked and banned every game because their power level is way higher because they benefit more from massively increased CDR as opposed to other champions.\n> \n> and yet games are being won by evelyn&#x27;s on URF by doing nothing but mashing Q because the ability has a 0.3 sec cd as opposed to the CD of katarina her Q.\n> \n> ok so I pick zac and am in lane vs evelyn, her Q vastly out damages any of my abilities due to the cd and range and she outruns me because of her W, so what do I do?

And I have sent in tons of surveys.\n\nyet I'm not talking about low elo where you can actually take any champion any lane without being shat on unlike URF due to the OP champions.\n\nyou're right, evelyn doesn't take down teams, then again neither does kat by the same excuse ''just cc'' so argument invalid.\n\nlovely counter argument ''just cc her'' to bad some champions flat out don't have CC and the only thing they can rely on is out damaging the enemy which doesn't happen with for example, a evelyn, or their CC is a skillshot whic hevelyn can dodge with jer W ms boost, leblanc can dash away from it, riven can dash away from it, zed blinks away from it etc etc.\n\nobviously it's about 16-20, which is why you see almost the exact same champions being banned every game because everyone is well aware of how OP they are with the few try hards being excepted who play to win not for fun.\n\nonce again, that is simply not the case as explained previously, I never claimed I'm a great player, not good just average so claiming once again I'm crying/salty because I'm not rekkign face is a shitty argument that holds no ground, I'd have thought you would've come up with something new to accuse me of but apparently not.\n\n\nand yet the majority of posts about URF claim the opposite, there is no skill involved in using a ability every 2 seconds with no repercussion because of extremely low cool downs and no resource costs, there is no managing resources, there is no managing cool downs which subtracts from the skill requirement, add in the fact the fact some champions vastly benefit more from massive CDR and it will be made clear that less skill is required as some champions simply become OP.\n\nyou claim it is not true the same champions are being picked otherwise yet the threads that are made after URF gets released every time blatantly proves otherwise.\n\nflash and fury? in URF? what are you even on about, there is no flash and fury when all you do is hang around tower dodging shit because you dare to choose a champion which doesn't have point & click CC or very long range abilities.\n\nof course it makes a difference if you make it like ARAM, because only the try hards can be bothered to make several smurf accounts jsut to get an OP champion they can easily win with, the majority does not.\n\nthe fact that you compare it to ARAM and smurf accounts means you do know that OP champions exist, otherwise you wouldn't possibly show what the ''problem'' could be, that being try hards who make several smurfs and dodge till they get the champion they want, so the most OP champion, simple as that.\n\nwhy would I care if you've been here since beta? you could've been here since alpha, you could've made the game I don't give a rats ass as that has nothing to do with this conversation","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2016-07-24T03:47:59.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yus!
