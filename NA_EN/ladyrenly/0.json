And then when they are about to expire he can back off so they take a couple hits.\n\nVoidlings do TONS of damage when they fully grow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-04-09T07:38:38.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malz and Brand are teh best Tank Shredder's in the game.
