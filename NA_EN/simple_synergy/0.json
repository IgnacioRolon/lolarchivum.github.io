I&#039;m having trouble understanding what toxic is to Riot now, because I&#039;ve never been punished til now, and as far as I&#039;ve known never actually being toxic, the game started with me telling someone on the enemy team they forgot their items, if that isn&#039;t sportsmanship what is? I&#039;m sorry but telling my ADC I can&#039;t tower dive level 3 and that I&#039;m sorry, ignite took a kill, isn&#039;t toxic, Can Someone that&#039;s ACTUALLY working for riot tell me what the standard for toxicity is? because it&#039;s ridiculous is telling someone thats flaming and telling people to kill themselves that they are being childish is toxic, then I don&#039;t want to be part of this community anymore, I&#039;ve spent many seasons over different accounts and none of them have been punished til now?!{{summoner:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"MikiTheMaster","date":"2017-09-20T14:41:31.863+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"System is fucking broken , they shouldnt ban people for flaming , if someone is 0/10 you have the right to tell them they fucking suck , when they play yasuo top in ranked and they arent even lvl 4 with him and they go 0/10 you have the right to say that they are shitheads(which they fucking are I mean shouldnt you play ranked to climb and if you wanna climb better play your fucking main , dont first time in ranked) \n\nThey should maybe ban people that flame others when they die like an ally has been slain - Yasushit : REPORT JG NO GANK WAH WAH (translation - I'm a fucking crybaby that can't win or at least hold my lane without my jungler's help) Or when jungler ganks them and takes kill they say KS like wtf ??? and if jungler doesnt gank them they say REPORT NOOB like what the fuck do you want from your jungler bitch he cant be top 24/7 camping your arse he has to gank 3 lanes plus farm jg wait a bit and he may gank , geez.\n\nSo dont ban people that got tilted cause their whole team is 0/7 but ban someone for being racist or for blaming people for some minor things. Also i see someone that writes ''fucking retarded braindead team'' get banned but i dont see people that write ''Polish/Russian noob/%%%got kys'' , like isn't racism bad.

Responding not only fuels them to keep going, but it opens you up to being punished.\n\nIt's not up to me to say if you were right or wrong in your actions. That's just my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Simple Synergy","date":"2017-09-20T04:23:56.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get the punishment it tells you that your peers were the one to judge you, so it is OUR place to judge what is toxic and what isn't, much less, if muting is the solution to toxicity, then why have a report system at all? it doesn't make sense, we shouldn't need to sit in games with 4 of our teammates muted and have even less communication giving us greater chance to lose just because the fact some of our teammates see it as appropriate to  tell people to kill themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-09-20T04:58:36.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-It doesn't tell every peer, it only tells the person who made the latest report.\n\n-And it's not up to the community fully to decide what's toxic, because there are people who actually believe telling someone to KYS isn't toxic because they are on the internet.\n\n\n-The report system is there if, you feel someone is toxic and you report, the automated system flags the acc for review and if the acc is bad enough a manual review by a riot member will take place and if that member thinks it toxic will distribute punishment.\n\n\n-Otherwise people would actually be banned for the simplest things, or falsely banned far more than they are now because a player got salty.\n\n\n\n-More proof that a large chunk of this community doesn't know what's considered toxic is how often people come to the boards to question why they got perma banned because they didn't use curse words but flamed someone into oblivion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juggernaut628","date":"2017-09-20T04:26:33.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT is the entire purpose of the report system.

WOW! Had a fiddlesticks act like a cocky asshole who thought he was god then cuss people out in caps, with no punishment (he went on to add me AFTER the game and laughed at how he wasn't punished and how I was then called me a pussy). GREAT SYSTEM RIOT. Punish someone for saying \"stfu\" and \"scum\" but ignore the all-cap cussing fit the entire team endured. bravo.\n\nI personally think saying someone is shit isn't bad at all but going out and spamming random insults all game clearly is.","replies":[]}]}
