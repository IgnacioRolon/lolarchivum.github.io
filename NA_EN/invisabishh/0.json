Maybe not back to the original speed, but something around those lines. Now that her W gives no movement speed on spell-hit, her Q is allowed to be buffed. \n\nThe bad part about the old Q was that you literally sat in lane and she could chase you with Q, it having a fast travel time, and giving her W stacks, but that will no longer be the case. Having your Q be faster will be a nice buff that won't break her, and it will help with chasing which is what Eve is good at.\n\nAnother change that I would like to see is her ult cooldown being lowered. It's ridiculous that early game  the ults CD is 150 seconds, with a miniscule 30% slow, and  damaged based on 15% of your CURRENT health. Again, I have no issues with it being current health, but for what it does it's a LONG cooldown.\n\nAnyway, these are my suggestions, feel free to add something else/comment about my changes. \n\n**Edit:\nFor those who are unaware of the changes, here they are:\n\nEvelynn:\n\nShadow Walk (passive) re-stealth time reduced to 6/5/4/3 at levels 1/6/11/16 from 6 seconds at all levels.\n\nDark Frenzy (W) Passive has been changed to changed to -\"Passive: Evelynn's spell hits on enemy champions reduce Dark Frenzy's cooldown by 1 second\" from \"Evelynn's spell hits on enemy champions grant her 4/8/12/16/20 Movement Speed for 3 seconds (effect stacks up to 4 times).\"","replies":[{"poster":"Support Evelynn","date":"2015-03-16T22:52:02.993+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"+1 buff my favorite stealth monster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-03-18T02:12:55.599+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":10,"body":"So I played a good amount of Eve last season and have been helping Jag test the Eve changes internally.  Here's some of my thoughts on the changes having played her in a number of playtests:\n\nThe thing I'm personally most excited for is the passive CD change.  It makes you super sneaky in a late game fight that gets drawn out.  As long as you don't die instantly it's pretty easy to get in, deal some damage, and get out back into stealth to hide/search for your next opening. \n\nThe W change overall has felt like a pretty big in/out mobility buff in mid-late game AS LONG AS YOU GET A BIT OF CDR (magus anyone).  You trade some training potential (especially in the early game) but having that slow cleanse up every few seconds to escape/close is invaluable given the new passive CD.\n\n**Also note that these are intended to be buffs so if we're off the mark here and she loses power from the W change we'll follow up on it.**\n\nTo answer your thoughts about the lowering of her early game chasing power and R CD:\nEve is a character who brings something INCREDIBLY powerful to the game, the ability to dodge wards.  This gives her a massive advantage when it comes to ganking unwarry opponents.  I can just run up to a guy, sit behind him, wait for him to burn an important spell, and then engage with my allied laner and demolish the fool :D.  \n\nSo since Eve has such fine control over when and where she starts a gank we feel like it's appropriate that her actual contribution to ganks isn't as powerful as say, a Vi R.  With that in mind, lowering that training potential on the W in the early game to make room for mid/late game buffs (where she tends to fall off) seems appropriate to us.\n\nThinking about Eve's R 150 sec CD, we tend to give long early CD's to ultimates that enable hard to avoid gank and kill situations in the early game so as to create some downtime between \"I'mma kill you now\" moments.  Vi R is an obvious candidate for a long cooldown given its range and guaranteed nature.  Globals are another big one since they let Pantheon be in your lane whenever he wants.  Less obvious are the ults on champion who can reliably dodge wards like Eve and Rengar.  At the end of the day, not having any way to see Eve coming creates similar situations to TF porting in behind you, there's an extra champ in your lane that you didn't prepare for.  It may not be Assault and Battery but Eve's ult does give a significant boost in ganking power.

However, since before her rework, in her nerfed state where picking her more often than not forced a dodge, I mained her. I played her as a jungler then, then as a solo top, and then she was reworked. I floundered a bit, the jungle had changed by the time she was reworked, but it turned out, that with her q changes and the fact that her ult dealt Max % damage, Mid Evelynn became one of the top mid laners in Season 2. \n\nShe was **not** given a 150 second cooldown due to being a strong jungler. She was given this massive nerf to her ult on patch V1.0.0.154 (January 16, 2013, same patch when Thresh *blessed* our games.) It hit her range from 800 to 650, her cooldown was nerfed; 150/120/90 seconds from 120/90/60, and the biggest change was her Max hp % damage changed to current % hp. \n\nThis was entirely due to her play pattern of 100-0 burst from stealth as a mid laner. \nThis was at the height of DFG Mid Eve. I mained it and I can honestly say it was true bullshit. She was able to burst from stealth because her ult range was bigger than DFG's, while her stealth's range was shorter than both. Basically they couldn't react because they couldn't see while she could still pop her ult/DFG from outside her detection range. (Stealth 700, DFG 750, Ult 800)\n\nThis patch essentially killed mid Eve, who saw a lot of competitive play, the biggest pro I remember was Alex Ich. \nThen she was picked up again as a Jungler, and essentially never saw a change until 4.1, one day shy of a year later. Which was also the patch that killed the ap Eve dream because it changed Ravage's damage. She only became a jungler because of Spirit Stone, and I think this was also when ward changes were introduced so pink wards weren't invisible anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TonguePunchBox","date":"2015-03-18T06:13:26.839+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of the changes make a little more sense now, but honestly two things.  First off, the invis during team fights.  horrible... Literally, its gonna be useless, the range at which she can be seen is HUGE, and if you disengage all the way out of that range, wait for all DoT to come off of you, and turn back invis, chances are half your team just died.  To make it better, if there are low people, the DFG nerfs made your ult useless so your only ranged finisher now has a 0% chance of finishing.\n\nWhile these changes sound great to me in theory, I don't think they by any means are going to be a buff for Eve.  If Riot really wants to fix Eve they should listen to their community.  DFG was removed, give eve's ult % maximum HP back.  It takes kills that could be hers away through out the entire game and makes it nearly impossible for a champ reliant on ganking to get half her kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InvisaBishh","date":"2015-03-18T03:35:45.760+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gypsylord,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGngh6pe,comment-id=0015,timestamp=2015-03-18T02:12:55.599+0000)\n>\n> So I played a good amount of Eve last season and have been helping Jag test the Eve changes internally.

I don't like that i'm in range to Q but if i'm a bit too far away, the will outrun the animation, it does not feel good.

Sure, if Eve gets some CDR to help lower her W cooldown she can get more done with her W, but CDR is so low on Eve's list of build priorities that this is a little saddening to see.  As an assassin, Eve wants damage first and foremost, and while she'll likely get one of the jungle enchants that gives her CDR, she's not going to build enough CDR to benefit that much (especially given how badly AP Eve has been nerfed).  Bruiser Eve has the opposite problem where she'll have the CDR to stick well, but not enough damage to really benefit.  And none of this is going to help her early game, which once again is getting cut back by Riot in an attempt to help her mediocre lategame.\n\nR's CD: While we all understand that Eve's R is strong because of the rest of her kit, it's frankly not lending nearly the same power to a situation as an Amumu ult (same CD).  A global ultimate that simply slowed someone 30% (which, face it, is what her ult boils down to at this point) and gave a shield would likely be put on a level with Gangplank's ultimate (125 at first rank).  Her ultimate does pitiful damage (at every level), adds only weak CC to a gank (until level 11), and has most of its power budget chewed up by a shield that encourages you to use your ultimate to engage rather than pick off stragglers.  It doesn't reasonably deserve a 150 second CD, it's entirely outclassed at first level by every ultimate in its CD class.  Eve's ult doesn't offer a significant boost in ganking power (from a longtime Eve player), it offers a mediocre one that has a surprising amount of power sunk into areas that won't really help you gank.\n\nFrankly, if you want to really buff Eve, her ult needs changes.  The shield really doesn't fit an assassin and benefits her most when she builds heavy resistances rather than damage.  %Current health is quite lackluster on an ultimate ability for an assassin.  Both of these feel incredibly unrewarding to use and are almost always shrugged off by tanks (who don't get hurt by the % damage due to having built MR) and squishies (who shred through your shield anyway) alike.

This \"buff\" fails to take into account that a huge portion of Eve's playerbase often builds ad/bruiser or even tanky Eve. So with this \"buff\" all you are doing is enforcing a buildpath on her that is in many cases sub-optimal. 1 second per hit on a 15 second ability is nothing. Ok, with max cooldown it's a 9 second ability, but like I said, max cooldowjust isn't very efficient in my opinion. That's not to mention playstyle-wise, you don't want to pop your w for engages because it should be saved to counter any enemy slows.\n\nThe nerfs to her w hurt her early game. In the world of Evelynn, we like to call the early game: \"the game\". If you don't get a successful gank in the first handful of minutes, you will struggle to be relevant for the remaining 30 minutes. A nerf here is just beating her while she's down.\n\nAnd any Eve main can tell you that stealth becomes all but irrelevant in the late game. You might be able to get a lucky pick mid teamfight, but if you somehow miraculously have the damage to solo an enemy, then you will flippin pop in 2 seconds once you're noticed.

Well have you played her this season? Because she's nothing like last season. You have so many passionate (okay, a few dedicated) Eve mains on these forums, why don't you address their thoughts on what she needs? None of these changes address the issues with Eve.\n\nIt feels to me like you are balancing Eve from other champions' perspectives rather than what it should feel like to play Evelynn. Since there are no Eve mains at Riot, ask us! We know where she's weak because we play her everyday!\n\nMy suggestion would be (not my idea) make her q do increasing damage the more it hits the same enemy. That way you get rewarded for sticking to an enemy (although you did just nerf her capacity to do that). Either that or bonus damage or health back vs monsters to help her farm.\n\n\n**Bottom line** there are times when you can tweak a characters kit and try to move power around to make them better, and there are times when a champ just needs straight up numbers. Eve will not improve unless her numbers are raised no strings attached. Ya know, like that out of left field nidalee jungle buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Widder88","date":"2015-03-18T20:58:00.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DynamiteGazelle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EGngh6pe,comment-id=00150008,timestamp=2015-03-18T09:47:46.302+0000)\n>\n> Since Eve's Q cooldown is so low already, I very rarely buy cooldown at all. This \"buff\" fails to take into account that a huge portion of Eve's playerbase often builds ad/bruiser or even tanky Eve. So with this \"buff\" all you are doing is enforcing a buildpath on her that is in many cases sub-optimal. 1 second per hit on a 15 second ability is nothing. Ok, with max cooldown it's a 9 second ability, but like I said, max cooldowjust isn't very efficient in my opinion. That's not to mention playstyle-wise, you don't want to pop your w for engages because it should be saved to counter any enemy slows.\n> \n> The nerfs to her w hurt her early game. In the world of Evelynn, we like to call the early game: \"the game\". If you don't get a successful gank in the first handful of minutes, you will struggle to be relevant for the remaining 30 minutes. A nerf here is just beating her while she's down.\n\nI honestly think that Evelynn is one of the best late game scaling champions, and the efficiency of CDR is one reason for that. \n\nCDR increases the DPS of any ability, the CD doesn't matter. A short CD only means that you can actually make better use of that increased DPS in a short fight.\n\nAn example how useful CDR actually is for Evelynn:\n\nLets say you have already 5% CDR from runes/masteries and 20% from a Magus enchantment. And now you have to decide between buying sorcerer shoes and CDR shoes. You are fighting an Adc with 42 MR.\n\n{{item:3020}}  will increase your Q-DPS by (100+42*0,94)/(100+42*0,94-15)-1 = 12%\n{{item:3158}}  will increase your Q-DPS by 75/60-1 = 25%\n\nAt the moment you have 2 good reason for building 40% CDR (E and R) and one godlike reason to build 40% CDR (Q). With the W change you will have just 2 godlike reasons to build 40% CDR (Q and W).\n\nSo it is definitly not true that Riot is enforcing a sub-optimal buildpath in my opinion. Maybe URF mode will convince you. It convinced me too.\n\nBut there are people who are not building CDR, and for them the change will suck. I don't know why Eve's W can't have two passives. Yasuos entire kit has two passives! Evelynns W passive was so sensible and beautiful :( Even if the change is a buff, it doesn't make that much sence, because it resets on kills and assists anyway. Kills and Assists will be less rewarding.","replies":[{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-03-18T21:58:37.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you're right in that CDR can be great if you're going for pure dps, but like I said there are many people who don't build max CDR. In fact, most of the build guides I see and all the recent games on probuilds do not max CDR either. So yeah it can be good, but is everybody doing it? I don't think so. But these \"buffs\" are assuming everyone is.\n\nI personally don't like building pure dps because you have to be stupid squishy to output damage, and melee range + squishiness isn't a great combination usually.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skaed","date":"2015-03-18T20:22:30.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No argument against the power of Eve's passive, but I think you're way off on her power curve. Eve simply does not function that way anymore, counter-intuitive as it may be. The S5 jungle changes make it really hard to get off early ganks with any frequency, which were her primary strength in S4. She's already gotten a lot of scaling buffs and early game nerfs which means overall I would argue Eve is actually a lategame champion at this point. She's got a really expensive optimal build, but it does do very strong DPS for a jungler. On the other hand, she's probably the worst early game duelist among junglers. If champion.gg is even slightly accurate, I think it backs me up pretty well on this:\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Evelynn\n\nThat's one of the highest winrate discrepancies based on game time that I've seen on the website. She's got a power curve comparable to Jax. Also, if you're going to remove the W speed proc then PLEASE revert the nerf to Q's missile speed.
