When i see other people get LPQ i only ever have seen the 5, 20 minute waits, Whatever happened to the shorter ones, were they removed?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T18:40:31.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LPQ timer is based off an account's trend, or history, of leaves.  It will start with the lowest amount unless you are frequently leaving, in which case the timer will continue to escalate.  It's necessary to continue playing without interruptions in order to return to a good standing with leaverbuster.  I hope that helps clear some things up, but let me know!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
