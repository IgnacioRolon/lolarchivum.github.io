Gracious as I am for a response from this very busy team, the result wasn't what I was looking for. If anyone was/is experiencing the same problem and found out how to fix it, I would appreciate if you could tell me how I could fix my issue. No one in my family is really computer smart and I had to rely on Youtube videos to even manage to have league accessible to me, and we all know how many Linux help guides there are out there for specific cases like mine... Not many I know. Here's my previous post: \r\n\r\nHello Everyone, I hope you're all having good luck with solving the trouble you have found with the patch and your launchers!\r\n\r\nI'm here to ask for help regarding the new patch as I cannot get onto league any longer. Yesterday it was working fine, but today (I assume because of the new patch), I cannot seem to even open the launcher. Unfortunately... I have been \"blessed\" with having Linux as my operating system. Numerous difficulties have already been sought out when trying to first download League months ago when I first started. Because of my circumstance and the rare amount of Linux league players that I know (none). I find myself in a pickle that I cannot solve myself no matter how hard I try to fiddle with buttons as I am not very computer smart. The Linux Ubuntu Launcher I use is \"PlayonLinux\" found in the Software Center. It's strange but, it's still a godsend as it's my only way to play League. https://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-1135.html This is a link to the launcher's website. As you can see there is other people looking for a fix to this problem, but none of them have been answered. If there's anyone that has any answer to this I'd be appreciative of the help. I have not been playing very long but, am itching to get back online with my friends and get back to learning {{champion:136}}  and {{champion:412}} \r\n\r\nUbuntu 14.04\r\nAnd I still have plenty of space on my memory.\r\n\r\nI have uninstalled League on this Launcher but when attempting to re-download it; I was met with this message:\r\n\r\n\"PlayOnLinux has encountered a fatal error. PlayOnLinux will stop the installation process. Visit www.playonlinux.com to get further information\"\r\n\r\nI'm still looking through this site, but will take any help I can. Thank you for reading.\r\n\r\nHave a great week everyone and if you have any tips please feel free to post, losing hope that I'll get back to playing league and my {{champion:136}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tangoboots","date":"2016-10-31T13:38:12.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My uncle who has a profession in programming came over to see what the problem was with my league launcher.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to assist you in troubleshooting this, as we don't have [official support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements/) for Linux.\n___\nIn this instance, it kinda sounds like the issue is more of a configuration or problem from the PlayOnLinux side rather that directly with the League client. I strongly encourage you to hit up the [PlayOnLinux Forums](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/forums.html) for additional assistance with this.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please let me know.
