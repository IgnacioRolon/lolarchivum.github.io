I want to see somebody try to explain why he has all these gates of CD, mana and cast times when he is immobile as can be.

Now the champion has to be within the AoE cone at the end of the animation, which can take upwards of .5-.75 seconds if I recall. I would argue that this was a needed change, but he wasn't properly compensated for such a huge gap in his kit now. A good player can recognize the cast animation and use E or Q to get out of the way every single time before the silence lands. It is one of the reasons Cho'Gath dropped to a 47% win rate in plat+. He used to be a hard counter to champions like Riven and Yasuo, but can't pull it off much anymore. To give you an idea, Yasuo can dash through Cho before his cast animation can finish and completely dodge the silence. They also nerfed the silence duration as 'compensation' for -2 seconds on his W cooldown, but it didn't really help.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-01-20T05:16:30.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah.
