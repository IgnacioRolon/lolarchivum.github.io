However i notice frame freeze whenever an effect pop up(champion skills)  or a something pops up like who kill who. Notice after the frame freeze(like 1-2sec)  from a skill then from that point on the same skill don't freeze me anymore. For example, Ashe's hawkeye shot freeze me for the first time, however, sequential hawkeye shot don't freeze me anymore.  But other skill do like ashe ultimate(first time).  So is there any software that is required?  anything that i need to do ?
