This is especially important for the mid-/ and botlaner, since this i where most of Lvl1-invades happen.\r\nBut now I rarely see this being done by my mid/bot-laners. And sometimes we do get invaded, give up a kill and maybe even another one or two flashes. This is almost always followed by a &quot;gg mid, thx for giving a kill to &lt;&lt;insert enemy midlane champion here&gt;&gt; by the very person who did not help covering the river with a ward.\r\nAgreed, 1 kill might not decide the game, but it gives an early advantage, sets the tone of the game and may even pressure your jungler to start elsewhere, losing time which may have severe effects on lane-pressure.\r\n\r\nI am now playing on Gold/Plat-level. Back in S4 when I was playing with mostly Bronze/Silver/Golds this was not the case. In 99% of games people were covering immediately at the start of the game. \r\nHave players become lazy? or do they not care anymore? Has this LCS-level of earyl game knowledge gotten lost over the years?","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-11-07T12:40:15.282+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cant buy green wards so other laners are forced to save them for themselves\n\ncoupled with any jungler who buys {{item:1409}}  typically clears while they're there anyway making the ward unnecessary to begin with, and thus reserved for objectives like dragon, baron, or for their team mates instead of themselves.\n\nits not that people dont want to, its that they outright cant without pink wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Chio Stellar","date":"2016-11-07T12:52:45.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to avoid a misunderstanding.

People don't want to use a 120s CD that they will need for covering their lane a few minutes later.
