Whats your idea?","subforum":"Maps & Modes","up_votes":63,"down_votes":10,"body":"Hey Summoners,\nI was thinking a bout something like teambuilder for ranked. not exactly teambuilder, something between draft and teambuilder. look at below picture:\nhttp://8pic.ir/images/3cghmb92caaz38qi3c3s.png\nAs you see in this mode you select your prefer(s) and then LoL will find a group for you.\nnote that you just select your prefers lane(s), not your champ.\nthen when LoL find a group four you, you will see something like this:\n\nhttp://8pic.ir/images/5kua18ix0zv8a0nfibeo.png\n\nAs you see summoners' lanes are specified...\n***\n**why it will be better than present ranked mode?**\nAs you know every ones aren't good in every lanes. even in high levels like LCS, best summoners have specified lanes. for example dyrus is a top laner.\nsuppose you are in a team that someone wants top but because he is last pick he cant go top and he should go for example sup and he is horrible in sup so you will lose 90%...\nor suppose you are horrible in jg and you are last pick and you should go jg. if you dodge you will lose LP and ..., if you play you will suck.\nas you see in traditional ranked mode win or lose depends on your chance. actually **pick order depends on your chance.**\n***\n**weaknesses will improve in future... we will see a different ranked, and this mode will start an evolution**\nwe have 3 weaknesses in this mode that 2 of them will improve easily in future:\nbefore any thing i want to ask Riot to make a beta version of supposed ranked mode. it will improve really important problems, as you know. if this supposed ranked mode has some problems we can improve them in future. i am sure this supposed ranked mode will be a begin for an evolution to this traditional ranked mode and i am sure most of weaknesses will improve by the time.\nany way lets see whats the weaknesses and ideas for improving them:\n\n**1. Waiting time on queue will increase just a little bit**\nhere is ranked! there are so many summoners that can play in every lanes. they can fill what you want. i am sure waiting time wont increase a lot. if waiting time increase a lot we there are so many ways to reduce that.\n\n**2. you don't want play meta strategy? ok, it can solve in future**\nRiot can add some thing like it to proposed ranked mode:\nplease select your team strategy:\nx Top - x Mid - x Adc - x Sup - x Jg\nx = the number that your team will have those roles.\nfor example you can select:\n2 Top - 1 Mid - 1 Adc - 1 Sup - 0 Jg\nthen system will match you with the players with same information.\nWhy in future?\ncuz we have to reduce waiting queue time first of all. this idea will increase waiting queue time.\n\n**3. New Ranked Order!!!** *a bout encouraging summoners to do all lanes!*\n**This bellow idea doesn't not relevant our topic. it just show in proposed Ranked mode Riot can encourage summoners to do all lanes.**\nThis below idea will be a big evolution, as you know evolution need time and no one don't hope and don't except Riot to do it early...\nThis part of this passage is a bout Pretty much of disagree persons that say: traditional ranked mode is good because make you do every lanes.\nI am really disagree with compulsion, but as you know encouraging a bout right things is necessary. in proposed mode for rank you won't encourage to do more lanes and your ability to do more lanes isn't important in comparison with traditional ranked mode. but i found a way to improve this weakness.\nI start showing my idea with an example:\nas you know everyone aren't talent in every things. for example i like physics so much and suppose my physics score is 100%. i am so so with history and suppose my mark is 80% in that. i am horrible in geography and suppose my geography score is 60%. then my average is 80% in this 3 lessons, right?\nbut just average isn't important, isn't it? when i say my average is 80% you cant understand i am better in physics or geography.\nWith this example lets see when you say a person is silver 4 what you can understand a bout that person? i think this kind of showing abilities isn't enough at all. you don't know when a person is silver 4 he is better in jg or mid or other lanes. maybe he could do so much better when pick order didn't make him to do his worst lane for so many times for example. as you see in this traditional ranked mode your division won't show all a bout you. \nbut whats my idea?\nwhen Riot add proposed mode then you will have rank and division in each lanes for example a summoner who is a good Mid laner and Top laner is silver 4 in Top and Mid, and suppose that assumed summoner is bronze 1 in Sup, bronze 3 in Adc, bronze 5 in jg. it means you have rank in every lanes not just one rank for every lanes... note that Riot will have average for summoners like before but except average rank summoners will have rank for each lanes too. for that assumed summoner average will be bronze 1. \nme and professor donger {{champion:74}} (!) will show you formula of calculating average in this new ranked order!\n\nhttp://8pic.ir/images/7bobgznc8vctbkkz8sgq.png\n***\nguys i know you will maybe afraid of waiting time for queues or maybe you think with this new mode people wont try to learn other lanes, but i still answer you it will be fairer than traditional ranked mode. pick order really depend on your chance... if Riot just add this mode just beta version you will see you was wrong. \nwaiting in queue will be normal, it wont take long as you think and this mode even will save so many times for you because dodging will slake and quality of games will increase so you wont waste your time like this in traditional ranked mode. \nyou will see people will still try to learn new lanes like before because its not this traditional ranked mode that make summoners to learn and do new lanes, this is in human nature that always want do new and different things...  \ni just say:\n**RIOT PLZ ADD A BETA FOR THIS MODE NEAR TRADITIONAL MODE **\nthen ask from summoners that whats their idea.\nthis proposed mode will change Ranked way and will provide a new base that is so much better than this traditional mode and new ideas can make that better and better...\nat last; those summoners that like this lovely idea (!): plz do something! do everything that you think will support this idea.\n**_ I will continue FIGHTING if you continue SUPPORTING ** \n***\n**I am sorry for my great idea, Riot You do not deserve to take my time, now you create my idea as new champ select and you didn't say even thank you to me,\nFuck You anyway**","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-02-05T00:00:32.943+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/ZtjdmZD.gif","replies":[{"poster":"slipstreem","date":"2015-02-05T04:43:05.745+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can get behind the idea on only 1 condition, your ranking is based purely on the individual role so challenger tier becomes the 40 best of each spot, there are 40 challenger junglers, 40 challenger adc's and so forth(maybe make it 50 but allow players to be on all 5 lists).

Those still happen way too often.\n\nAnything that does something about the guy who gets stuck with the role he doesn't like and instead of facing his fears he makes you miserable. Just, anything besides the current way of picking stuff, because the fact that one player can ruin it for everyone else and make their team miserable for a minimum of 20 minutes (else *you* get penalized) is freaking stupid.\n\nEither that or allow some kind of vote-kick, whatever it takes to deal with -that one guy-.","replies":[{"poster":"Daryush","date":"2015-02-06T03:38:49.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cornerstone1","date":"2015-02-05T14:35:51.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There would be a long queue time waiting for the unpopular lane of the moment.

Whats your idea?\n\nNo. I disagree with this completely. Just because everyone can't play every role doesn't mean we need to make a teambuilder. Ranked games were meant for people who wanted to test their skills and be able to do all roles. Of course those are good points, but imagine how hard it already is to find a jungle or support, it would be way harder in Ranked team builder.\n            Also, you need to take into consideration of people who do not play meta champs (Such as Rammus, Urgot, Poppy, Amumu, Mundo, Kennen, Teemo etc.), and they would be quite disappointed at having to wait an hour before getting into a game. \n                Another thing is that people in LCS know what to do when playing roles like top or adc or jungle, but they just found their fit within a specific role. Also with the point of the support issue, you all need to learn what a support does and how to play one, other than that I cannot help you if you play ranked and cannot play support.\n                To me, it is just like team builder but draft mode, it provides no challenge to fellow ranked players and its just an easy way to get LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-02-05T02:08:53.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hypothetical here. \n\nI suck at Jungle, i can do it but its Bronze 5 status in skill (im barely Silver in the lanes i do good in anyways).

Perhaps more importantly, this may inspire Riot champion designers, consciously or otherwise, to continue to design champions specialized for particular roles, whose kits will simply dominate more versatile and less targeted champions.\n\nMore concerning to me, such a system would discourage players from learning roles other than the one they prefer. At present, most players will be forced to play a role they are not comfortable with at some point, such as top main filling in as a support on a team saturated with top mains. This means that most players are at least aware of the mechanics, duties, and challenges of each role, giving them a better understanding of game strategy and team fighting tactics. It may also make people a little more empathetic towards people in other roles, but I have yet to see concrete evidence of that. If ranked were set up so one never had to play a role they did not already know, many people would lose the motivation to learn the working of other roles, and the lower levels of ranked would be saturated with people who have little knowledge of proper team composition, champion kits, and general strategy, not to mention angry ADCs who just cannot understand why top lane keeps losing to Yorick.\n\nWould a ranked team builder system reduce lobby arguments and trolling based on having one's position \"stolen?\" Probably, but I don't think it would be the best option for the game, at least with the type of community it currently has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ColinFly","date":"2015-02-04T22:28:29.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still the issue of somebody queiueng (I'm not going to take the time to figure out that word, sorry) up as, say, Support preference and just instalocking Fizz and troll Mid lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Epic Guy","date":"2015-02-04T22:15:35.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dammit why cant I rate up more than once XD\nThis idea is great!","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmperoMleA","date":"2015-02-04T17:46:13.732+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please like the post\nif you like it i will give you ashe and ahri mobile number B){{champion:22}} {{champion:103}} {{summoner:6}} {{item:2047}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RIPOMZ","date":"2015-02-04T17:45:34.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a good idea you dont have too wrry bout not gettin the lane your best at so yea i think  riot should do it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kameryn","date":"2015-02-04T17:12:51.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I LOVE IT it will finally fix that awkward who' s what situation!{{champion:74}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heisenbergs","date":"2015-02-04T15:27:00.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it ;)\ni hope LoL add this mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"holybluman","date":"2015-02-05T07:40:32.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a Good thing to add but With a small change it will still act near the same thing but will allow player pick up to three roles that they wanted to play and maybe four  and have the unwanted role be uncheck so they can work on the least good role to get it better when they want and play on their good roles or they can just fill in the left over roles.\n\n\nLike this  Player a is good at adc, support and mid but not as good at top and sucks at jug then player a then op for the roles of adc, support and mid and leave the other two roles out, while player b is good at top, jug and support, but can do adc but not as well and cant do mid so he or she will op in and out of the roles they want and don't want too they want to work on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2015-02-04T16:54:27.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Love it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"EmperoMleA","date":"2015-02-04T16:56:46.085+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"that is a great idea with this we can take the best one in their role not a douchebag{{champion:115}} {{item:3187}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xarthan","date":"2015-02-04T21:59:29.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it is a good idea the only problem being that this mode you will always have hard long fought games because you get what you want every single time that is not  a bad thing but the reason riot will never put anything like this in is because it removes all challenge in climbing the ladder it just lets you do your 1 role over and over and you never have to learn any other roles riot wants diversity in their game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"buneter","date":"2015-02-04T18:26:13.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"why not just have the captain ban 3 champs and then you build a team like normal and the game matches you with people with diffrent champs and diffrent bans","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bob McFreewin","date":"2015-10-07T01:42:17.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreativeMatrix","date":"2015-06-21T03:59:38.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MAKE THIS HAPPEN!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kholdstare13","date":"2015-04-08T15:03:07.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say we do this, but on the Crystal Scar instead.  \n\nWe can have 2 positions:  bot, and everyone else.\n\nI just want a ranked queue for Dominion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-02-05T23:37:38.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few problems you could run into though","replies":[{"poster":"Daryush","date":"2015-02-06T03:33:56.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant understand what are you talking about. this picture that you showed wont occur never. each teams need 1 top, 1 mid , 1 adc, 1 supp , 1 jg. when system find them your team will build.","replies":[]}]}]}
