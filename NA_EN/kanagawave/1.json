I don't think the leaver buster is justified if I didn't leave at all. I was loading in and it never happened. is there any way I can have the leaver buster uplifted I've left something on riot games support already.","replies":[{"poster":"KanagaWave","date":"2017-05-04T02:01:26.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know its when i leave google chrome open i just have a bad computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T20:51:23.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the leaverbuster happened for that match, it would have only happened if you were gone enough to get marked for leaving.  In this case it sounds like a surrender vote passed.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) penalty only applies after having a history of leaves, not just one game.  If you're having consistent crashing issues, give me some info on what's going on including error messages.  We can't remove leaverbuster, but I'd like to help resolve the origin!","replies":[]}]}
