I've had some bad games, and a few games that were losses almost right away. I know that I need to improve and whatnot.\r\n\r\nI'm here just wondering how to keep my chin up and continue on. I can deal with a couple losses in a row. 3? 4? 5? Fine I suppose, though I'll be a fair bit agitated for an hour or so. But 10? It stings quite a bit. Especially since a few of those games definitely could have been won.\r\n\r\nI only have 300 games this season, yet I see people on here or on my friends list who have waaaay more. Sometimes 1300 ranked games. How does one keep their chin up for that long?","replies":[]}
