Chat restrictions are given out when you show higher than average levels of toxicity in your games.\n\nA good example of this is what you've mentioned below - *all i really did say is rekt nub get good cuz he was 0-10 and he killed me and he said REKT u noob*. \n\nIf you don't have anything nice to say, it's better to say nothing at all. However, I to encourage you to communicate with your teammates, and even let them know when they're doing something awesome, such as getting first blood!","replies":[{"poster":"PsychoSim","date":"2015-05-12T23:00:02.483+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd get irritated if someone said that to me, so I'm good with some repercussions to verbal harassment.\nI understand heat of the moment chat stuff... the tongue is the hardest thing to control, after all.

It's gotten to the point where I just immediately mute everyone in chat because you people seem to think every little thing is restrictable.  I believe we live in a country where freedom of speech exists, although please correct me if I am wrong.  While it may be true that there are some cases where people are extremely toxic, lower levels of toxicity should not be banned because yeah, I'm gonna get pissed at people playing like garbage in a ranked game.  There are many people who do not belong in ranked and know they don't and just play it because it is more of a challenge.  there are people trying to climb out of bronze and people like this need to gtfo.  I had a person play a champ they have never played before and fed like crazy.  Bitch that is for normals.  Learn the mechanics of the champ before you take them into ranked.  I didn't take Bard into a ranked match until after practicing him for a good month at least.  Now I feel comfortable enough to play him in ranked and do quite well with him.  These are the people who bring out the toxicity in everyone else.  I'm sure if you did a study, you would find higher levels of toxicity in lower ranks because that is where the people who should not be playing ranked are.  I'm sorry if you believe that the world is all sugar spice and everything nice, but it's not.  There are worse things in this world than me telling someone to not play ranked until they can increase their performance (such as terrorism, people shooting at cops, etc).    There are worse things for me to tell someone that are much more worthy of chat restrictions than calling someone a noob.  I jokingly call my friends noobs daily.  I don't get duct tape put over my mouth or fired from my job.  What's so wrong with this guys saying \"rekt nub\".  REALLY?  Please.","replies":[{"poster":"GroundRuleDouble","date":"2015-05-13T14:38:44.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might want to check what Freedom of Speech actually means.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ice Weasel X","date":"2015-05-12T23:52:40.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BADxW0LF,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=fPn7EUwL,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-05-12T20:59:09.191+0000)\n>\n> I believe we live in a country where freedom of speech exists, although please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n1. Not every player of LoL lives in a country with freedom of speech\n2. Freedom of Speech doesn't apply to private establishments.  The game and the forums are property of Riot, and we are bound by their Terms of Use.\n3. Even though Riot can't stop you from saying what you want, they are well within their rights to punish you for saying it if they don't like it.  They are within their rights to silence you.  They are within their rights to permanently ban you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-05-12T17:15:40.739+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat restriction. It's most likely from you saying things you shouldn't have in chat.\n\nBe polite before, during, and after games, and it should go away.
