It definitely sounds like your client is unable to maintain a stable connection to the matchmaking and game servers. Most of the time this is caused by local network settings that prevent a solid link from happening, so I recommend working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if those changes caused any improvement.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
