I would like to start off by saying that you guys have dramatically improved League in many different areas within the last few years. I&#039;ve been playing this game for about 5 years now, and I just love it! Although, there are still a few things that I, along with many others that I run into in game, feel is unfair and uncalled for. \r\nIn the PC gaming world, there are so many variables when it comes down to performance and computer compatibility with games. Fortunately, League of Legends among many other games do not require much to run properly. But, very often then not, gamers with computer issues (namely; Random computer crashes) end up getting penalized by leaver buster for things that seem way out of their control. \r\nPersonally, I hate to leave games if I do not have to. I try my best to no to start a game if I know that I might have to leave within the next 45-60 minutes, but sometimes when I start one with a clear conscious, my computer crashes or something happens with my HD and I get knocked out of game for long periods of time. Long enough to cause the game to end shortly and get penalized by leaver buster. THIS SEEMS TOTALLY UNFAIR! ):\r\nIf there is a way that you guys can program leaver buster to notice when people actually leave games or when their computer is simply having issues, this would definitely boost our experience in League of Legends! Well hey, wasn&#039;t leaver buster created for equality anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-14T23:56:32.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be easily exploited by people to leave games freely, unfortunately.\n\nYou should simply not play league until you can stabilize your operating system or replace broken components. If you need technical help, there are plenty of places to get it (i can probably help, as well).","replies":[{"poster":"ToGcHa","date":"2017-05-15T14:05:16.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I could definitely use some help!\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-15T19:33:51.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Describe what is happening and your hardware, OS, running software and drivers with as much detail as possible.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-05-14T23:39:21.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToGcHa,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hQLzFOqa,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-05-14T23:35:27.566+0000)If there is a way that you guys can program leaver buster to notice when people actually leave games or when their computer is simply having issues, this would definitely boost our experience in League of Legends!

Even if they DID develop some high-tech program that could tell if your computer crashed or you just DC'd intentionally, it would still be able to be tricked by force shutting down the computer or just pulling the internet.\n\nSo this is a problem that you'll just have to deal with, sadly. But you should be largely okay unless your computer/network crashes on a regular basis.","replies":[{"poster":"ToGcHa","date":"2017-05-15T14:04:48.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2017-05-15T01:20:13.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know; Leaver Buster only strikes if you are constantly leaving games?\n\nIf you're computer is crashing so often that LB kicks in, then maybe you should see what's wrong with the computer instead of forcing 4 others to go through a game that can be up to 2 hours long.","replies":[{"poster":"ToGcHa","date":"2017-05-15T14:03:34.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this is not the case.
