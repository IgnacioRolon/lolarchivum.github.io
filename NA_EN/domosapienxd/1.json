You basically become your worst enemy in your own game as you attempt to play well to score a good grade.\n\nI know it&#039;s not possible to accurately grade a player on their overall performance; no system like that exists (to my knowledge), but because of such, a lot of players who perform the utmost on a team typically get shafted by the rating system.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/qD2Vl/74ec1293d4.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/qD2Zt/c8354a6f05.jpg\n\nThis game is a good example. Now obviously it&#039;s not shown here, but this game, I completely owned the map. If I came to a lane, it was going to be taken. Period. I ended up just crapping on top lane (which was nice) and shoved top so hard. Because everyone in low High Gold/Low Plat is selfish, the enemy team decided to attempt to capitalize on me pushing by starting fights with my team constantly. This is where Lee got a majority of his assists.\n\nDespite my presence in team fights of being able to kill enemies outright, despite me crapping on my lane with ZERO ganks, despite me applying absolute pressure to the map wherever I go, I get shafted by the system and get rated S-.\n\nI don&#039;t think it&#039;s news to anyone, but we&#039;ve all seen plenty of cases where it would seem you should get a higher rating than you did but someone else who actually has a lower KDA than you, lower CS, lower damage (etc) somehow gets the grade you deserved.\n\nTell me if you recognize this: &quot;How the f*** did I get an A+ going 14/3/6 w/ 210CS on Ashe and yet my 4/3/9 140CS Rammus Jungle gets the S flat?&quot;\n\nLike, that is beyond frustrating.\n\nLook, ever since the introduction of the character rating system, I&#039;ve taken a lot more pride in the games I do well with certain champions. The system alone has made me want to play champions that I, for the most part, lost all desire to play. Case in point: Illaoi.\n\nIllaoi&#039;s character, lore, and overall design quality (looks, VO, etc) is some of the BEST design since Nautilus (Nautilus was probably my favorite champion release before Illaoi). I played a lot of Illaoi when she first came out but because the rating system felt so ham-fisted with it&#039;s limited ranking and next-to-no effort requirements, I was pretty dissuaded from playing her because not only was there not really any challenge to the rating system, but her release was so disappointingly underwhelming and she tapered off so quickly in the meta, there wasn&#039;t really any room to play her. But with the release of the extended mastery system, as I said, I feel a sense of pride in playing her now and I&#039;m working my ass off to reach top-mastery with her.\n\nWhat confuses me even more is that the system is somehow offering grades based on performance in comparison to global statistics(?) yet my previous games, I&#039;d gotten S flats for significantly lower performance 2 days ago (was just getting back into the swing of Illaoi so my scores were pretty moderate), yet when I score a hot game like this (compared to my others), I&#039;m served an S-.\n\nIt&#039;s such a slap to the face ESPECIALLY when you know just how big of an involvement you had on the game. If I had the replay, I&#039;d gladly throw it up here.\n\nPlease, do something about this system to appropriately reward players for their efforts. This is the same reason I stopped playing Garen to attempt to get max mastery. I&#039;d played so many games with him doing so damn well over the last 10 months, but no matter how well I did, I couldn&#039;t get my last S flat rating to get my 3rd token for top mastery so I gave up. It&#039;s that frustrating ESPECIALLY because of how big of an improvement I&#039;ve made as a player. To paint a brief picture, I&#039;ve harped on top lane for the last 5 seasons. I HATED top lane. Everything about it. I sucked at it too. Garen, Darius, and Cho&#039;Gath got me into top lane at the end of Season 5. Guess what my main role is now? Top lane. F***ing... What?\n\nJust... freaking...

In other games, I had higher CS paired with lower (arguably worse scores) and yet received an S flat.\n\nIn my OPINION, the grades don't match the effort/play.\n\nMy other shove-top-lane-with-no-effort-because-no-one-can-kill-me games seem like such cake walks and include almost no team involvement and I get S flats with those games. For games like this where I'm romping on every lane I visit and busting my ass, I get a separate award. It just doesn't make sense to me on paper. If there was some integrated leaderboard interface that would appear during end-game screen (which wouldn't be a bad idea since the end-game screen is kinda dated), it might make more sense to me since I'd be able to see.\n\nBut like I said, on paper, the numbers just don't allign and it's confusing/frustrating. I personally believe the frustrating comes from not knowing EXACTLY what there is I could've improved on in that game. The game is going to go it's natural pace and if a player is making the most out of it that they can, in tandem with global ratings, they should be awarded appropriately.\n\nI don't know. Consider this a butt-hurt and whiny way of offering a suggestion to Rito.
