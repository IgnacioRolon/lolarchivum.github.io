COMIC FOR BRIBERY INSIDE!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","embed":{"description":null,"url":"http://imgur.com/WiBNAKe","image":"http://imgur.com/WiBNAKes.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://puu.sh/qv9yl/1476f3db16.jpg\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#039;m currently sitting with. I&#039;m 21 RP away from one more Project Cache which would be the last one I&#039;d be able to buy. Even if I do get it, the 2 cores wouldn&#039;t be enough to complete the final first strike icon for Ekko so I&#039;m gambling on the hope of getting one more Augment Cache Fragment from the Project Cache to add to the 2 I already have in order to get an additional project core from that cache.\r\n\r\nI own all first strikes of the original Project Skins (except Yasuo) and have it for Ashe and Katarina. I&#039;ve accepted that I won&#039;t have the entire collection because I&#039;ll end up missing out on Yasuo... but I&#039;m trying to get it as complete as possible in the mean time. The last one I have a feasible shot at is Ekko&#039;s.\r\n\r\nPlease, Rito! I&#039;ve spent all I can on this game for this month and probably the next few months to come until Christmas. :&#039;c\r\n\r\nI made a comic for you &lt;3{{champion:245}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:245}}","replies":[]}
