Please let me know &gt;:)\n\nThere was a thread about this on the Concepts & Creations boards recently, and I think there are definitely a few strong candidates.\n\nFrom Ionia (since that's the strongest connection currently) you have Akali and Jhin. The former has a number of cool flower effects you could have (petals exploding in her cloud, etc), and the latter almost speaks for itself with his existing flower thematics and the chance to design some outfits with his flowing fabrics and exaggerated motions. A Shen skin where the blade is a floating lotus blossom could also be really cool, with petals bursting out to mark his dodge field, and a flowerly shield around the target of his ultimate.\n\nOn the existing-skin subject? Karma is pretty cool, but I'm not sure Irelia sells the theme enough -- I feel more could have been done with making her blades look like petals, and maybe a bit more oomph could have been added to her particle effects. It feels more like a skin recolor than the Karma skin, which really sells the alternate fantasy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xScarfy","date":"2017-05-20T16:17:47.143+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Janna would be perfect for the OotL theme, given her calm personality.
