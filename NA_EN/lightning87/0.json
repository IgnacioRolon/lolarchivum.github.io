I'll do that next time I play. I do have Plays and Baron replay. Haven't had problems with either in the past, but I have had problems with similar programs so I don't know why it didn't cross my mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-16T18:35:20.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing on the client like this can be due to a third party program that's interacting poorly with League, especially after a patch. If you have any apps running like play.tv, overwolf, lolrecover, etc remove them.  This should get you fixed up but let me know!","replies":[]}]}
