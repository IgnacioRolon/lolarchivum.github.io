Specifically dashes and blinks give too much safety to otherwise bad decision making.  Many people point out that the lack of counter play to it is annoying and allows too big a \"get out of jail free card\" for too little fore thought.  I once read a quote that said only instant hard CC or point and click hard CC counters mobility.  This to me makes it obvious that such mobility is problematic in balancing the game.  I was wondering why not make an item that counters such mobility?  Not a hard shut down like you enter the field you cant move or anything just something that lowers there effectiveness.  What I currently envision that item looking like would be similar to maybe void gate or wards in that it is destructible so that it wont be there for ever and have a limit.  At the same time it should have a large range where things like dashes lose range and speed.  Its effectiveness should increase as time goes on rewarding fore thought and not just reactive play.  The end result is something like your team places the item down near dragon.  Now enemy zed cant put his shadows down as quickly or as far so he has to destroy the item first.  Before the item gets partial effectiveness he has 1 minute and at 2 minutes he cant make plays anymore.  If he destroys it before then he now has his normal free reign during a battle, if not he will be crippled in using his dashes during a skirmish or team fight.  Give me your 2 cents","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-15T07:03:32.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should likely point out that while 'flash' abilities have always been a pain, Dashes haven't been. The one thing about dashes, excluding very specific ones like Malph, Hec, and Vi ults, any displacement can stop the movement completely, even if they're targeted. Diana was actually recently-ish buffed because of the amount of champions with displacements who would use it to stop her R.\n\nFlashes, thankfully, are very few in numbers and have actually been nerfed quite often. We can look at Kassadin as one of those 'Flashers' and he recently had his range nuked. Ez has a cast time on his own, so it's not hard to catch him with a CC or something as he's doing it so you can quickly catch him. Dashes on the other hand are rather quick, but a quick displacement and it's ended. In Rek'Sai's case, if you push her back as she's popping up from her tunnel, sometimes she's tossed back to the beginning of the tunnel and THEN knocked further back. Likely an odd bug though.\n\nAlso, when it comes to Zed.... He's got a bit too much mobility and safety for an assassin. He's got a huge weakness with how you can just use a Zhonya's or QSS, but his safety is just scary.","replies":[{"poster":"planters","date":"2015-03-15T14:27:58.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point.  I feel though another tool to give for contention would be an interesting way to make dash/flash champions a little less perfect for almost every situation.  Though I have to admit it might just be a handful of champions.  When I thought of this idea I was thinking of Lee sin, Zed and Leblanc not so Ez and reksai.  Though I still feel it might be something to increase the viability of some champions at higher levels like anivia or kogmaw.  Not that they need  a lot more or that im a high level player just saying if there is a way to actively make fights happen it would be interesting.

Not saying it is not an option but I feel reducing it via a more contestable and proactive manner is much more beneficial.","replies":[]}]}]}
