No LeaverBuster. I then go into a match right after patching the Ivern patch. (I left the match earlier BEFORE the Ivern patch. Just something to remember.) It boots me, tells me I have corrupted files when I restarted League (It told me this only after the patch, it let me login fine before it said this.)\r\n\r\nGives me a LeaverBuster.\r\n\r\nI go through that LeaverBuster, no problem. Go into another game. I had lag, so I restarted to try to fix it. Wouldn't let me reconnect. Another LeaverBuster.\r\nI start to try to get rid of THAT ONE. When I get into Champion Select, I try to ban a champion. I kept mashing my mouse to ban. It wouldn't go through, and the timer showed up that I have 10 seconds. Still wasn't letting me ban.\r\n\r\nInternet's working fine, as it sure did kick me out without an issue when I couldn't ban, and my web browser was working just fine. Have to restart my LeaverBuster. Neat.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is - Check your internet AND your patcher before every game.  It might just be a bug with the patching and champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T04:30:54.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your case, it sounds like an unstable connection to the servers may be the root of all your issues. Please note that each server you access, this site, League, youtube, netflix, etc are all in different geolocations and your network route to each is different. This means it's plausible to have a connection issue to one server but not another.\n\nAs a preventative measure, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your local settings match what we recommend.
