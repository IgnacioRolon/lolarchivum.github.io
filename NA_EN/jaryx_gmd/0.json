So for the past few days, my laptop has been restarting on it's own free will. While I am mid game. After a few times of being behind and stuff, League puts me in LeaverBuster. Since it was only 5 minutes, I was ok with that. Now, it's up to 20 minutes. I recently just finished 5 queues of 20 minutes on LeaverBuster and just now, my laptop restart again. Mid game. Not only am I going to get reported for leaving the game early, but I am on 120 minutes of LeaverBuster. Are you serious? None of this is my fault (Maybe). My laptop is restarting on it's own. I am running Windows 10 on a Dell Inspiron 5565. I don't know why this occurs. Can Riot please add in a feature in the next patch/update where players can submit a form so we can explain why we left early? Thanks if you actually read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Reset213","date":"2017-02-07T02:28:00.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is your fault sadly, you continue to play knowing your laptop will shut off. \nRIOT says that ruins other players experience.\nIF riot did allow a form that did that, imagine how many AFK'ers would use that excuse.\n\nAs to why your laptop is cutting off, here's a few possible reasons:\nBattery is loose.\nCharger is loose.\nCheck task manager, you may be running too many programs and LoL just overloads it.\nBattery could be faulty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-10T03:05:10.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of your intent, your absence from a match negatively impacts **everyone**.
