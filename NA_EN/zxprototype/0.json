It helps explain a group of changes and the mentality behind the shift as opposed to being just a collection of sometimes seemingly random alterations.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I think I&#039;ll still be consuming hours of discussion videos and podcasts every time a new patch goes live, but this set up will help me digest the new patch a lot easier.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotAether","date":"2017-12-14T22:32:07.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for walking us through your thoughts! We figured 7.24b would be a good candidate to test these changes since it's a pretty small patch overallâ€”I think 1050 words, whereas we usually come in at 2-3x that many. That helped offset the potential risk of the new structure being _more_ confusing, since buckling down and reading the whole thing is a significantly shorter task this time around.  \n\nOne thing we haven't come up with great solutions for is (a) one-off changes like {{champion:33}}, and (b) changes that have a broader effect than their placement in the notes imply, like the {{item:3134}} stuff. If anyone's got suggestions, we'd love to hear 'em!","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2017-12-15T01:19:07.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality probably deserved a section of its own like Rammus. It affects almost an entire class of champions, and every position except Support.\n\nSidenote: I like what you did with the Azir section. Having all 18 values in an unbroken row is almost unreadable for doing comparison, I appreciate that it was broken into chunks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2017-12-14T23:24:08.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate reducing quippy comments to increase readability.

(Ex: \"Q mana cost increased. W Damage increased at all levels.\" That sort of thing) Since it's way more reader-friendly to see that stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotAether","date":"2017-12-14T22:34:53.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if we decide to stick with this organization style, per-champ contexts will make a return as the balance team gets back into the swing of more complex changes. 7.24b was almost entirely simple numerical buffs/nerfs with each champ being strictly buffed or nerfed. Typical patches include more complex changes focused on power reallocation, mechanical adjustments, and other stuff that warrants some walking through. Same reasoning applies to why the quick summaries were missing!","replies":[{"poster":"Daedric Etwahl","date":"2017-12-14T23:23:04.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good to hear!
