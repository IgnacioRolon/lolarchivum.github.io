Since you think your ISP isn't routing your connection to us in a very good way, let's try running a traceroute to see what's going on. Grab WinMTR [**here**](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and for the host use our NA server 104.160.131.1.\n\nOnce you've ran that traceroute, copy what it gives you and post it here for us to take a look at!","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-18T02:20:16.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should have added I am on a Macbook pro, I can't download the software as it is only tainted towards windows...

That sure makes it a little difficult to use the tool eh?\n\nLet's try using something called [**Ping Plotter**](https://www.pingplotter.com/download/macos) instead. In the Target field, enter the following addresses one at a time: 192.64.170.252 and then 104.160.131.1. Also, be sure you've set your test parameters for Trace Interval to 1 second and Focus Time to 5 minutes, and then press the play button on the left start to run it.\n\nOnce the trace is over, take a screenshot of the results and shoot it my way!","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-18T04:07:34.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will have it for you Tomorrow night!

I'd like for our tech guys to be able to work one on one with you to get this fixed.\n\nTo get started, [**submit a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and pick \"I am having technical issues\", and shoot your traceroute their way too!","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-19T20:43:44.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a nice trip, ^-^ Thank you so much!

I've ran a full scan on my rig, fine.  Only thing I can think of is that it's LoL server side.  This has been happening the same amount of time. I use Verizon Fios, typical 42 ping and I've been getting upwards of the 250-300 range of ping spike.  This typically happens against certain players but not all enemy players.","replies":[]}]}
