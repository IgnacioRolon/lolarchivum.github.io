D:\n\nI've seen this issue a few times, specifically with Macs, and it's usually caused by one of two things, either an *unstable connection* to our servers or a more serious hardware issue with the Mac itself. Let's focus on the more likely, which is the *unstable connection*, commonly caused by network settings that conflict with League. Our [**Mac Connection Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) covers the steps that most frequently resolve this issue, so I'd like you to give those steps a try.\n\nLet me know if this resolved the issue or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2016-12-15T05:48:12.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaaah you have confirmed my suspicions, see, I use a ethernet cable and that makes all my connections perfect, the problem is my mac then, recently (twice... in 1 month) the hard drive crashed, and twice its \"been repaired and should be fine\" soooooooo, I do believe I am seeing the same effects, might be time to give apple a call, thank you sir for your hasty response.\n\n(also, while we are at it, I saw some other people talking about this, suddenly dropping to 0 fps when you load into the rift is a thing for me as well)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-16T00:20:05.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were also experiencing the FPS drops on your Mac, this could *also* be caused by a potential hardware issue. Not entirely sure that's the cause, but if solutions like the ones listed in our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#section-mac) don't help, that would by my guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2016-12-16T00:23:15.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for all your help! I do believe that it has something to do with my hardware then something in game at the moment based on what I saw in the FPS guide, I did manage to reinstall the game and repair the client, and that has so far stopped the game from freezing after I get done in champ select.\nSee you on the rift!\n... I mean, probably not, but that would be cool :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
