Some may refer to him to Satan the destoryer of elo the conjurer of your demise who&#039;s every waking breath is bent on making you cry that Teemo. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to start off by pointing out match ups. and how Teemo&#039;s spells and runes can alter by who he fights.\r\n\r\n{{champion:58}} He&#039;ll take {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:14}} because renekton has no dash level 1 he&#039;s doomed, but if you were to not take sorecery for the 20 ap you probably wouldn&#039;t be able to dive him level 2.\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}} You&#039;d need {{summoner:3}} To be able to survive her level 6\r\n\r\n{{champion:57}} {{champion:54}} You don&#039;t need {{summoner:4}}  because they&#039;ll just come to you. {{summoner:7}} {{summoner:21}} {{item:3155}} \r\n{{champion:85}} nullifying orb and {{item:3155}}  all you need.\r\n{{champion:6}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:24}} insert conqueror user. you need{{summoner:3}}  \r\n\r\nThis is just the tip though. It doesn&#039;t mean free win or anything like that. You work when playing teemo, you think when playing teemo. It&#039;s part of what makes me love teemo. \r\n_______\r\nwhy&#039;s he so bad then?\r\n\r\nFor one is just that complexity. It&#039;s good, but most champions take one rune page and  the same build almost every game. A teemo that shuts his brain off is going to lose. But Teemo&#039;s got {{item:3151}} which can do an enormous amount of damage from the passive stacking on his mushrooms. This means that the low level teemo&#039;s get to abuse this to raise their mmr. To a spot they shouldn&#039;t be in.  Creating a &quot;why is the enemy teemo on my team so bad, but every enemy teemo solo carry&quot; feel. \r\n\r\nThe higher up the more {{item:2055}} {{item:3364}} {{item:3147}}  these destroy that playstyle which creates another problem smurfing. Most teemo players smurf. Some smurf much more than others, but it&#039;s where the bane of teemo resides. They find themselves wanting to improve, but they will keep losing considerably without the reliance on the item.  It&#039;s like a drug that cripples the mind sets of Teemo players.\r\n\r\nThe otherr thing I wanted to speak of is His blind. Teemo&#039;s  Q a few years ago used to blind not upon impact, but actually as soon as it was casted.  This meant empowered auto&#039;s from champs like {{champion:58}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:202}} could be able to miss their attacks if you could cast it. However NOW this isn&#039;t the case. These champs if casting their auto as you Q will no longer be blinded. They can further ignore it by using abilities to wait out the duration. With attack speed Teemo may find it impossible to blind certain champs like {{champion:4}}  from stunning him Because his Q is so slow unaffected by attack speed. That unless the enemy is lagging considerably to allow you to blind them before empowered auto-ing his blind can feel entirely useless. \r\n\r\nTeemo vs conqueror.  Teemo&#039;s poison procs it which may not sound bad, but because he has a mere 330 base speed level 1 unless you have exhaust you will always lose the trade. Looking at you {{champion:23}}  E level 1 it can be very exploiting against him and it&#039;s why I&#039;ve started to give up the idea of wasting a spell on {{summoner:4}}  and just giving a flat out fight to the death because teemo needs to be at his best early game. Him not having flash sucks, but id rather have a 180 second cooldown than a 300 one that I still died in because im so slow that I have no escape. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s awful, but I know there are other champs out there that are suffering if not more than teemo. {{champion:10}} {{champion:16}}  So I don&#039;t feel to bad.\r\n\r\nAll I wanted to say. TLDR. Improve his blind to be more reliable. Liandry&#039;s gets abused to much by Teemo&#039;s Mushrooms which puts them at a mmr that they can&#039;t be useful without.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2018-06-24T19:36:59.873+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me shorten it up for you to the point people will actually read your post.\n\n\nPost Summary = Outdated kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-06-24T22:20:01.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Teemo's Q a few years ago used to blind not upon impact, but actually as soon as it was casted.\"\n\nThat's not true at all.

Blinding Dart\n\nPreviously, Blinds would check your status when you began your attack. This meant that sometimes attacks that looked like they should have missed would land right on target. With this fix, you should feel a lot better about your tossing poisonous darts into the eyes of enemy marksmen. Blind 'miss' window changed from on-attack declaration to on-attack launch (For reference, 'attack launch' is when the missile is created for ranged champions, and the moment before an attack hits for melee champions).\"  https://www.reddit.com/r/TeemoTalk/comments/58bxvz/teemo_patch_history_a_look_to_the_past/ I'm guessing this was really close to season 6 because I remember it in season 6 xd\n\nI understand a lot of people use lol wiki to learn, but the one thing I and many others learn is that they are outdated.
