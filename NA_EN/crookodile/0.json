I've seen fwii's top Talon smoke a number of games including my own so hunted to see if he had any guides. He actually has quite a few out there!  Haven't done a full read through but I saw some insightful nuggets in this guide [HERE](http://www.lolking.net/guides/422811) (lolking site).  \n\nCarrying often isn't solely about what you can do in late game team fights, but how you get your teammates ahead leading up to that point.  Good luck. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Crookodile","date":"2017-10-04T13:45:51.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks a lot for the advice!
