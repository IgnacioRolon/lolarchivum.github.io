You might be able to reach out to your ISP to see if there are any current issues, but you can still reach out to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if there's anything our tech team can help with!","replies":[{"poster":"Aanxious","date":"2017-07-24T06:46:35.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T20:20:28.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss can cause some pretty weird shit to be quite honest xD. Sometimes you can have like 50% packet loss, but your fps and ping look perfect! Your other post mentioned being curious if it's being caused by hardware issues, and that's actually a possibility as well. \n\nI'd suggest hitting up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) where they'll be able to look into those network logs a little deeper. They can also guide you along troubleshooting your hardware to cover all your bases ^_^.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
