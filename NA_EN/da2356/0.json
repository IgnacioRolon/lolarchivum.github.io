I have had no problems on this computer, and my internet connection is pretty good (no connection issues but high ping from time to time).  I get into champ select and we are about to start.  League game client has now booted up, but it crashes.  I get kicked out of league and when I try to reconnect league made me download the whole game over again.  By the time I am able to log on, the game was remade, I was placed in a 5 minute leaverbuster ban, my MMR went down drastically, and I lost Lp in a game where I thought our odds were pretty good (however it's league and anything can happen).  Could someone please explain?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T02:36:09.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that sounds pretty crazy. I've rarely seen instances where the **entire game** has to be reinstalled and patched unless there are some serious issues going on with the drive that League is installed on. I'm curious how you were able to see a drastic MMR drop, since true MMR numbers are not publicly available. Regarding the Leaverbuster penalty, the system was acting as intended, because regardless of intent, your absence negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a big reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why we are unable to modify penalties associated with Leaverbuster.\n\nIf you encounter issues again, let me know so we can troubleshoot. If you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[]}]}
