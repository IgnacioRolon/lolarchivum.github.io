Explain this to me, WHY DID YOU EVEN CREATE A LANGUAGE FILTER??? Better question. If you don&#039;t want your players cussing on your rift. Why do you even make it an option to turn the filter off?? I think that&#039;s pretty bull that you&#039;re going to ban someone for cussing when you consider the following.... THE PEOPLE WHO REPORT USERS FOR OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT SITUATION FOR TURNING THEIR LANGUAGE FILTERS OFF. If they don&#039;t want to hear people cuss, they need to turn their language filters back on. Stop punishing AMERICANS for using their FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT.  Plain and simple. Like I said, these people need to stop reporting people for offensive language, that shouldn&#039;t even be an option to report players for offensive language because of the double standards you have set on the subject. Now un-restrict my fucking account and everyone else&#039;s you restricted and or banned. And then either pick one, PERMANENTLY turn the language filter on, or stop banning people for offensive language.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-07-13T23:47:27.486+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"We do not punish for cussing.

I don't think it applies to private companies who want to regulate speech within their own service. Plus, a lot of people who play even on NA (like me) aren't American, so I'm not sure it would apply to everyone anyway.\n\nThat said, I see your point about the chat filter. If you don't want people to swear, have an absolute chat filter. That's the way I see it too. By giving an option to turn it off, Riot is saying \"_We_ don't mind if you swear, but for those players who don't want to see it, we have an option.\" If they're chat banning people for doing so, this clearly isn't the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-07-14T15:30:33.779+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think the First Amendment is to prevent politicians from restricting your speech.

It doesn't protect you from the consequences of what you say to people.
