She doesn't get MULTIPLE stealths off if you start to burst her. At most ONE, because burst is instant and once you have a target you throw it out there. She can only try to Q to avoid that initial burst, which requires reflexes or predictions.

So my assumption is vayne will always have some moments in a fight even when R and Qing very well that she can be targeted by point and click.
