The ones that spam pings you even if you mute their chat, stalks you in game by interrupting you trying to get cs and shoves the wave, ints your opposite laner and tells the enemy in all chat where you are.\n\nI guess everyone has this experience of a dreaded game that is not simply \"tilting\" but outright unbearable. The question is what is the probability of this happening? From my experience, it seems  (even with my impatient personality) that the odds of this happening is around once in 8 months and since I played around 300 ranked games this season that would be a 1500 to 1, by counting by that there are 5 teammates on your side.\n\nI don't know if this is high or not, but if you manage to get through this one match, maybe you will not get into another the whole season if you are lucky. I wonder how is everyones experience. Maybe we can make some data out of here to encourage people to endure the storm.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-09-18T03:14:05.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive only seen that maybe 2 or 3 times in the 5 years or so of playing this game.

Much more often is the slightly disgruntled ADC that AFKs for 30 seconds when the support takes some CS while they are respawning, then thinks better of it and just passive-aggressively cries all game while still being slightly useful.\n\nSo, pretty rare. In both cases i got a cheerful notification of their new permanent vacation post-game.","replies":[]}]}
