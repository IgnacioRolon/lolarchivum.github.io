He swings faster with these two attacks, which deal 25-93 (at levels 1-18) (+15% of bonus armor) bonus magic damage and reduce his base spells&#039; cooldowns by 1-0.6 seconds (scales down with CDR).\n\nSo basically, if you activate reaver, not only you will make your whole team invincible, but able to spam your stuns, heals, shielding, and enhanced autoattacks? How fabulous can you get?\n\nThe gem knight sololane might be even viable.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T01:04:56.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will require a really dumb build that will only be good for memetic seal clubbing (AP Panth, anyone?), anyone with any idea what they are doing will exploit the huge weaknesses it makes.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-05-10T01:15:48.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It enhances Taric's kit and how it revolves nicely. \nI fail to see how to \"counter-exploit\" a spammable stun. Reaver alone gives 20% cdr, tarics passive reduces approx 1 second per passive hit, reaver active gives 20% refund per hit.\n\nTarics stun is 13 second cooldown max level. So 4 seconds **per one cast of his spell**. \nSo if you accidently smash your head on your keyboard and spam the passive out. It would be around 2 seconds. That is a perma-lock.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-10T01:27:07.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The weakness is with an attack speed build, he has shit damage/sustain/defense and is effectively useless while his ult is on cooldown, and he has no way of engaging reliably.\n\nAny decent top laner will bully him out of existence before he gets enough items to be a threat, or will just wait out his flailing spam and kill him.","replies":[{"poster":"HÃ¥ppy","date":"2018-05-10T02:29:27.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would he need an attack speed build, his passive gives him that attack speed already.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asterfix","date":"2018-05-10T01:11:39.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll duo with you botlane with ADC Dark Harvest crit Thresh","replies":[]}]}
