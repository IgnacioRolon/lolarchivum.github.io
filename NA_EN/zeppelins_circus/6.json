You have no idea who are you talking on the internet.\n\nC-3PO was made from scavenged parts, FROM WATTO's MOST PRIZED stuff that Anakin earned (or stole). He is actually extremely expensive, and he made him just for the purpose of helping his mother. He was supposed to have plating but Anakin sadly left him unfinished. But, Anakin's podracer's coloring was blue/silver/gold. Actually a combination of R2D2 and C-3PO. So my hunch is he WOULD have painted him gold or silver anyway. I guess it is you who don't see the background here, C-3PO is the amalgamation of Anakin's kindness, like that wooden locket he gave to Padme. Not some \"functional gear\".\nArtistic value is a weakness? Wow I guess even the most murderous droids in SW canon, IG assassin droids and Droideka's will have a word with you regarding how much \"art\" they have in them. Art can be deadly as heck. Like this guy says. {{champion:202}} \n\nYes and I am a virgin near my late twenties and it is the norm here in Japan because I used to work until 9:30AM to 12:30 AM with low pay and sometimes showing up at Saturdays to work until I got my current job.

That&#x27;s like saying because Twilight was fucking terrible you have to be desperate preteen girl to still like vampires.\n\nIf you do not want parts picked out of your argument, it is best not to include it in the first place and keep it concise. Decoration is weakness right?\n\nIG-Assassin droids are literally made to look like a skeletal Muun with no other purpose than to look bare-boned. Which equates to lower durability. Also Droidekas are like that not for mobility. but due to the caniballistic nature of the species that created it wanted it to look like them to instill fear from design, EVEN IF THEY CAN'T WALK if they do it. Dude, having gold plating is a minor inconvenience compared to these \"decorations\" But they DID do it. Artistic value is a high virtue that people will put priorities above functionality.\n\nAnd yes, vampires are a out-exhausted genre as well. When was the last vampire that was actually great and fear-instilling as it was supposed to be. Same thing as the mecha-genre. It must not be overused and not be universalized. It loses the awe or majesty. I'm not against the mecha genre, I'm against \"cloned lazy mass production.\" That i can't tell apart which is which.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kha%27Zix/Skins?file=Kha%27Zix_MechaSkin.jpg\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fiddlesticks/Skins?file=Fiddlesticks_PraetorianSkin.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"otakoteep","date":"2018-10-24T12:42:29.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zeppelins circus,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6wAyfWzu,comment-id=0002000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T12:03:48.589+0000)\n>since the recent two gundam series flopped miserably, AGE and orphans sucked balls with extremely large plotholes.\n\nwhat are you smoking? it's been Build Fighters and Iron Blooded Orphans. also, from what i understand, IBO is getting a sequel ..... i have NO idea how with the way they ended it but yea not exactly 'flopped'","replies":[{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-10-24T12:49:20.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=otakoteep,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6wAyfWzu,comment-id=00020000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T12:42:29.018+0000)\n>\n> what are you smoking? it&#x27;s been Build Fighters and Iron Blooded Orphans. also, from what i understand, IBO is getting a sequel ..... i have NO idea how with the way they ended it but yea not exactly &#x27;flopped&#x27;\n\nI'm smoking the good stuff. If you haven't seen it all, I advise to not jump in the conversation.\n\n1. I don't consider build fighters canon to the any part of the universe. I consider it as manga spinoff value.\n2. Orphans sucked balls because they introduced a universal allmighty weapon (Dáinsleif) that would make fighting with mobilesuits totally absolutely obsolete. It was theorized mid-season that it may cause problems to the plot. And it DID. Almost ALL major deaths on the protagoniosts side were caused by this awful plot device. Also the letdown on Gundam fracking Bael. That deflated the whole buildup it is also now a damn meme here in Japan of how awful it was. The mobile armors were rad though.","replies":[{"poster":"otakoteep","date":"2018-10-24T13:13:00.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. well sorry if you don't what to acknowledge a series as 'canon' to a series that has MULTIPLE TIMELINES.  or do you want to tell me that there is a way to have GN drives in the same timeline as Unicorn?\n\n2. you mean that thing that kinda missed the mark on barbatos and gusion? wouldn't that be the same as comparing a nuke to any of today's tank? aside that, Bael, i feel was handicapped due to the pilot being a narcissistic asshole.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeppelins circus","date":"2018-10-24T13:23:50.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=otakoteep,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6wAyfWzu,comment-id=0002000000000001000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-24T13:13:00.959+0000)\n>\n> 1. well sorry if you don&#x27;t what to acknowledge a series as &#x27;canon&#x27; to a series that has MULTIPLE TIMELINES.  or do you want to tell me that there is a way to have GN drives in the same timeline as Unicorn?\n> \n> 2. you mean that thing that kinda missed the mark on barbatos and gusion? wouldn&#x27;t that be the same as comparing a nuke to any of today&#x27;s tank? aside that, Bael, i feel was handicapped due to the pilot being a narcissistic asshole.\n\n1. I simply mean that it's value is low compared to others that it is not considered equal.\n2. That thing technically killed the protagonist in the final episode and forced him to go berserk mode and go suicide shortly after. It made a fatal hit, blown off his left arm, and made holes in its armor. The weapon itself is light enough to be carried by infantry mobilesuits and can be shot hell mary with ludicrous accuracy. In a animation that is focusing GUNDAMS, its just not thought out as well.\n\nAnd about Bael. You seriously need to check the episodes back again. That mobile suit literally killed its owner because of how much a piece of worthless junk it was. Actually the pilot himself was top notch.

Every mech looks the same and acts the same.\nMecha designs make so much frequent references from other franchises and trends, they tend to become nigh impossible to tell which from which due to overlapping. If you watch those shows you \"may\" can tell the difference, but for the majority who do not watch them on a regular basis, it is just trivial.\n\nThe problem here is that Riot released dozens of skin lines, which are hard to tell apart for the regular consumer.
