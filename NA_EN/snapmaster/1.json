Normally, I wouldn't take the time to nitpick over a relatively minor issue, but like many others have pointed out, the color scheme for it does not fit the general pattern set by the rest of the set of skins. I like the general model, especially of the spider portion, but it's so jarring to have her color scheme so drastically different than the others. I understand that Riot came out and said that they didn't want it to look so similar to her base skin, and I can see where they're coming from with that line of thought, but as it stands it just feels off. \r\n\r\nI hope that Riot will take another look and reconsider their decision. Elise is my favorite champion, and I've always felt her skin selection to be a little lackluster, so when I heard they were doing a Blood Moon skin for her (One of my favorite lines of skins) I was excited, up until I saw the palette choice. I know my thread is just one of many on the topic, but I'm hoping that if enough people speak out on this that Riot will give it some more thought.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-25T17:48:55.839+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"We'd taken a look at the feedback about the pinkish color that we'd received, and it has been updated.
