I called it from the start the minute I saw the enemy team choose Thresh. I just got bombarded with 'OMFG PLEASE NO\", \"AFK\", \"Choose a real support or dodge queue\". Keep in mind that every other position was called and I told them that it wasn't my first time doing it, I've done it multiple times with success in Normal. The twitch jungle was just icing on the cake.\r\n\r\nEvery lane won, and we eventually were just able to push every lane to inhibitors. But at the end of the game, the team was like \"lucky top and mid won or else bot would lost it for us\"....It's as if arrows across the map securing a kill for Rumble twice and Syndra once wasn't helpful.\r\n\r\nPoint: Why do people hate Ashe as adc AND support? She offers so much utility against non healing support comps.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2014-10-03T15:07:57.805+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guaranteed consistent slow, global stun, long range vision, plus ranged harass?

Normally I also go IE, Talisman, and then either Locket or Crucible, but if you don't want to be 'as supportive' you might trade the Locket/Crucible for BT or if you have someone like a Sivir ADC trading the talisman for a BT also works. I find that supp Ashe with a Talisman makes her relatively safe though because she has decent MS.\n\nThe way I really think of building Ashe support though is 'Do we need tower push or do we need utility?' The first 3 items I listed are items I try to get for her during laning phase, after laning it's more of a decision as to if we're lacking in utility (shields/heals) to keep people alive during the fights, or if our problem is after the fights pushing towers. If it's the towers we need I'll often go for a more damage heavy build so that it's easier for us to clean up a teamfight, and we have more tower pushing power.","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2014-10-06T13:26:06.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This exactly!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-10-03T15:29:03.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it a lot of fun myself. I usually manage to do that once or twice with friends, works most of the time barring a jungle camp.\n\nHowever, it is not a comfortable pick for randoms for 2 reasons.\n\n1) They more than likely have not used it or seen it done with any success prior, if they had seen it at all. It's rare you will find someone who has seen it consistently do well, so there's going to be a stigma.\n\n2) It's not as reliable as normal supports. Ashe, even support, is squishy with no real escapes and one hard cc (even if it is the longest duration in the game with some distance). Obviously a good Ashe support will still be better than a bad, say, Thresh. But in this world of flash, blinks and dashes on almost every champ the one main thing you get out of Ashe (constant, reliable slow) simply doesn't do as much.\n\nHave you tried Team Builder?

When arrow is on cooldown you have little peel for your carries. Sure you have a slow, that's not gonna do too much against gap closer popular picks like Khazix, Leesin etc. \n\n2. Your harass is weak as you can't afford to build a meaningful amount of ad.\n\nI think it tends to either work quite well, or very horribly :P It depends on your team. If you're behind, an Ashe support isn't going to turn any tides, but if you're even/slightly ahead, it can work out okay. I just think there are better picks. If you take her for the stun, why not a Morgana/Zyra who have skillshot roots on much lower cooldowns? With build in utility/harass included.\n\nTL;DR - I'm not saying its the worst support idea in the world, but there are just better alternatives :) Well done on trying new stuff though I'm always a fan of breaking the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2014-10-03T15:28:57.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe support is nice if you're one of the last pick. Like the OP said, she picked Ashe support because she saw the thresh. Ashe support doesn't work very well against heavy gapcloser teams, but Ashe support is normally very successful if the enemy pulling all the weight is a melee bruiser like Darius or Garen or Shyv who might have some mobility buffs but are very susceptible to Ashe's kiting.\n\nIf you're in a no heal botlane and you can keep even at the beginning of laning Ashe supp with a Zeke's rush often puts your lane out on top because you have more damage and more sustain than the enemy laners at that point.\n\nEdit:\nAshe has been a secondary support for quite a while, Riot officially lists her on the same support level as Leona, and peple have been playing Ashe support for a long time.

You don't *have* to kill them. All you need to do is push them out of lane 1 time after level 3/4 and the ADC/Ashe should be able to clean up the tower giving your team more objective control around baron and if your ADC is smart they should be able to freeze the lane close to their turret so that they can still continue to farm.

She pokes well, but after using her root and ult, if someone was able to dodge those, she knows that she's dead.

If you have a smart Quinn and a smart Ashe you always have vision everywhere.\n\nI definitely prefer Janna over Morg though. I know I'm giving up damage (I actually build Janna with exactly 0 AP), but my Janna is a lot tankier (2.75k hp, 41hp per5, ~200armor, ~150mr, locket shield, crucible heal, etc) than my Morgana and she just has so much more control over the battlefield. Janna is definitely my favorite support right now and she's so much harder to counter than Morg. I think the only support I have problem laning against as Janna right now is Soraka just because she can be pretty passive with her overall healing nature, she doesn't really get in range of the knockup, and Soraka is just going to outsustain you in this passive aggressive farm and outsustain/damage lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2014-10-03T15:24:04.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, she's the only support other than GP that could conceivably build a {{item:3050}}  and not feel bad about it.
