If whimsy is cast on her a second time, the sound effect will work properly. Once cast again, the initial bug appears. Basically every other cast of whimsy will have a never-ending sound effect from what I&#039;ve noticed.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-30T22:20:07.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Neato Mojito (cute name :3)! \n\nThanks for the report! We'll take a look into this today and see what's going on! ^-^\n\n**EDIT:** I wasn't able to get a repro on this one. Have you seen this occurring in more than one game? If so, I'd suggest doing a client repair 'cause there may be something wonky with your audio files.
