When i connected it was about 14 minutes in, we ended game att 23 minutes. After game i had to type ''I Agree'' cuz i unintentionally leaved for 14 minutes, and my team didnt remake for some reason. It also says that im ineligible to earn loot. This account is only level 6. And i still got honor level 2. So, do i still earn champ capsules when leveling up? Or does this only affect the hextech chests?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T02:22:16.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, that just means that your chances of getting key fragments and such would be locked until you've shown the system enough 'reform'.

Meaning you wouldn't get any XP, any mastery points or any chests that you have to unlocked during that game only.\n\nAlso, teams cant remake after 3 minutes. Anything after that they have to wait till 15 minutes for a 100% agree'd forfeit.","replies":[]}]}
