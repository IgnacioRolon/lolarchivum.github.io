Either (a) you have the damage to push them out of lane, but likely never kill them, or (b) they have so much sustain and/or effective health that you can&#039;t do anything to them that doesn&#039;t include &quot;take a ridiculous amount of minion damage while they ignore you/disengage effortlessly/opt to not participate in laning against you in any way&quot;.\n\nIs this a problem that you guys see/agree with (or have plans for?) or do you view this situation differently? On a personal level, these tanks are incredibly frustrating to lane against; it&#039;s like playing against a brick wall in most cases.\n\nEdit for those arguing over definitions: there's definitely some nuances to the terminology. Riot still hasn't posted the list of the dozen terms they use internally that they mentioned a few days ago. If a red responds, maybe they'd be willing to categorize some of these champs for us? :D\n\nI specifically chose the 2 named for the lack of both solid ranged poke as well as mobility options (other than slows). In contrast, Darius/Malph/Poppy/Shen/Mundo all have at least one or both of those options. Trundle could go into the same camp as Singed and Nasus (depending on if you count his speed field as a serious mobility option or not).","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-01-11T18:13:40.659+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"God bless, we still have tanks viable in the top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Maxxston","date":"2016-01-11T18:25:04.552+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xApexPredator,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ew8uq3FM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-11T18:13:40.659+0000)\n>\n> God bless, we still have tanks viable in the top lane.\n\nTrue, there's definitely a discussion on whether or not tanks are in-meta right now at all.

Until he gets close to a couple hundred stacks he can't duel very well with most top laners. He is so easily bullied out of lane, every time he goes to q, hit him. If you can push him constantly and hit his tower, make it fall quickly, he can't do much. It's really hard for him to farm after his first tower falls, and then you can go push other lanes. This coming from a nasus player and what has always been effective against me. If your lanes are ahead, he's so behind he can't even tank, or get to the adc to whither them.

He kept trying to poke me out with his Q, and then I would heal up with my Q AND get stacks. It was super frustrating for him, I could tell. He'd try and zone me out with barrels, but I completely ignored him and kept farming without losing much health at all. Oh the joys of being a Nasus player.\n\nOn a more serious note, Nasus has more counter than people give him credit for. His early game is terrible, with an 8 second cooldown on his Q and only 10% lifesteal. If you can deny him farm in the first ten minutes of the game, you should be good to go. He'll either spend the rest of the game farming to catch up or dying in teamfights. Because of his farm-reliant playstyle, he usually has to sit out early and mid game to get those coveted Q stacks. This means no TPs anywhere unless you want to miss out on 3-5 waves of fresh minion meat, which equates to roughly 100-150 stacks. If Nasus gets 600 stacks by 20 mins, and the other lanes are all getting stomped on, chances are he's not going to make much of a difference. Chain CC shuts him down pretty fast as well, because a lot of his survivability is reliant on lifesteal + Q. I was playing against Varus and Lux, and Lux would snare me so Varus could ult me and the rest of the team took me down pretty fast. Nasus also has no gap closer, which is why a lot of people take ghost. You wanna 1-shot the carry?
