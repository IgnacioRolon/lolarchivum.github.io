I WAS NOT TOXIC TOWARD ANY PLAYER!!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"The absolute worst thing you can say i did here was get up set that League of legends made me play with players that had flash when i didnt.... EARLY ON (over 10 games ago) and i tilt'd a little bit because its not fun playing against someone with an advantage. I admit tho i did curse that (1 ) game (game 3).\r\nBut as i remember chat bans are for plays who are Consistently TOXIC.  Game 1 and game 2 I had done nothing wrong, I was not cursing or calling anyone bad.  In fact if you look at game (1) ( 5 players were constantly toxic and got on all chat to tell everyone to report me) even though i never said anything bad about anyone. didn't curse or place blame. Is this truly fair? or is this a mistake? \r\n\r\nPS. I've been permabanned 2 times. I've learned my lesson and avoided raging and even learned to not curse or insult when being attacked. Yet because 3 trolls on my team and 2 on enemy team report me. I was genuinely surprised when i saw the chat ban.  look at the chat logs and the only time i ever say anything super negative it was directed towards the game, not players in it. And i take 100% for that, and i never complained like that after that 1 game because i realized that i was being a baby.\r\n\r\nAS far as game 2... The support auto locked miss fourtune and and started stealing cs from me in lane(even tho i was the adc role ), wouldn't build support items. Just straight trolled me and i felt i handled it well. Yet its being used against me for chat restrictions because miss f and the Toxic vayne top reported me?\r\n\r\nWhere is the fairness\r\n\r\nHeres everything ive said Hopefully i can get my restrictions taken off immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if not cool, i'll go play a different game. You guys show that you dont care about players who are trying their best to not be toxic. We don't live in a perfect world. and if you say mute all. thats like playing with bots. this is a community game. What fun is a game without a community to enjoy it with?\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nImJustBetterMan: tyty\r\nImJustBetterMan: good trades\r\nImJustBetterMan: just watch for level 2

Its so pointless and derails the game into focusing on chat, which you seem way too focused on. Thats cool if thats why you play, we all are into different things.
