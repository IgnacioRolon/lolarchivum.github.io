Kills wont necessarily win you games but staying alive allows you to be in the game and contributing to the match. You can't help your team if you are dead with respawn timer. \n\nBest of luck to you and welcome to League!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T01:13:11.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good first step would be to start out in some Co-Op vs AI matches as that will let you freely experiment with more of the gameplay mechanics. If you post this over in Gameplay or Player Recruitment you'll get a lot more visibility as well and more people can hop in and give you pointers ^_^!","replies":[]}]}
