These configurations aren't supported and are prone to causing conflicts in-game like this. I recommend completing a reset of your input settings files with the following steps in order to resolve this conflict. First, **log into the League Client** then navigate to your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, hop into the Practice Tool so you can check if this worked.
