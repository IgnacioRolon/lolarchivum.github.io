Like, come on, I killed your whole team with 3 items, how can I not be stronger with a full build? \n\nWhile I agree with you in general about the state of damage, that statement is misleading. With ability damage, especially burst damage, they do hit a hard cap somewhere mid-lategame. That's *usually* when ability casters like Renekton and Pantheon fall off, because they no longer \"one shot\", because at that point, base stats coupled with a little defense make one shotting (bar perfect execution of a single target assassin) impossible. \n\nMost early game snowballers fall off that way. In a way, a 3 item AP Malphite (at the stage of the game he's supposed to be in at 3 items) is far scarier than a 6 item AP Malphite at 30 minutes in, even if he's the most fed guy and the first to complete his build. You are one-shotting people who with {{champion:54}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3108}}{{item:1082}}  is because you are level 11 vs probably a level 8 {{champion:51}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3095}}{{item:1055}} who have lower base stats, 0 defense and because you've maxed your main damage skill.\n\nYou won't be one shotting anymore {{champion:54}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3102}} vs {{champion:51}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3095}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3139}} at level 18, especially if their support has some form of mitigation for their team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Bob Boberson","date":"2018-11-14T19:40:17.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"By one shot do you mean you were incredibly low and they happened to kill you?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zardo","date":"2018-11-14T12:25:05.895+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe on most adcs that's true, but jhin probably just auto q autos the assassin while running at Mach 20 to dodge all skillshots..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2018-11-14T12:44:57.075+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"hyperbole is very fun isn't it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beast Brawler","date":"2018-11-15T18:35:52.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy, put more power into abilities and less into the items so that when you're fed and ahead, you do better.

Even if the Assassin midlane is 0/3 with just a dirk or mid game, the Irelia thats been feeding her ass off all game just finished her Trinity, it doesn't matter if you have two or sometimes three completed items over them; they'll still destroy you instantly if you dont play around them.\n\nNo other class can honestly say that they still have to play around a behind assassin or bruiser when they're ahead. :/\n\nNo matter what the boards say, at high levels of play the only time botlane really mattered was during Ardent Meta. This can be seen in every worlds in existence. What was important this worlds? Mid and jungle. What was important in seasons 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1? Mid and fucking jungle. Bot lane was important one worlds and they had to grossly over buff multiple factors to make that happen.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-11-14T16:46:37.294+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah except ADCs werent doing it in LATEGAME but by the time they had shiv and BF sword. \nMaximum at two items IE and SHIV they were three shotting everyone.\nIs this lategame? \nBuilding two of the cheapest items? \nYou had your freelo for three seasons now. \n\nYet everywhere in soloQ in every elo lucians, kai'sa, jhins etc. run around carrying game after game. \nMaybe it is you? Cuz reading this is what every adc player wants: being the best at everything at all times while doing nothing for it.","replies":[{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-11-14T17:20:42.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, they weren't. They never were and if they were, it could have been remedied by nerfing the damage on shiv. Furthermore, the game has changed pretty drastically; late game is two items at 25 minutes. And if it isnt by your book, Jax needs to be absolutely gutted since he is doing late game damage with just Trinity. Uh, I'm sorry, is late game *one item*? \n\nAnd good job naming two ADCs who dont build crit. One is even an early game champion. Jhin also doesn't even need to build crit either for that matter. So where are champs like Cait, Trist, Varus, Kog, Xayah at? Take away Stormrazor and where are jinx, twitch, sivir at? \n\nMaybe what ADCs want is what everyone else already has. Agency, lane diversity, early as fuck late games, damage to both tanks and squishies(bruisers anyone? Literally gets to blow up both tanks and squishies indescriminately with usually just one item to their name but yeah, ADCs want too much for wanting relevance; I mean it's not like they have to worry about that behind Assassin 1 shotting them from full health either if they're ahead either because, while their items are expensive, they literally get the best of both worlds with both damage and tankiness).\n\nIf a class is going to build full fucking damage with 0 options for defenses, 0 agency, 0 early game power, and 0 lane diversity with no hope of being able to even survive the stiffest of breezes, then they should be 1 shotting everyone with absurd damage.\n\nAnd good job ignoring how every worlds ever has been about mid and jungle and the first time it was about bot lane, everyone whined and screamed until riot changed it back.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
