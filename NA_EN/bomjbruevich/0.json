Occasionally it says that the AMD driver had stopped responding and has recovered. I recently changed my video card and power supply, but the problem still persists. The driver sometimes also stops responding when watching videos and then reappears after the screen flashes from black. My graphics card is Radeon RX-460, with intel-i5 processor and I do have the latest drivers. Let me know if theres any additional info I can post that will help.","replies":[{"poster":"BomjBruevich","date":"2016-08-18T22:41:16.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response.
