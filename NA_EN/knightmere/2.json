Here is why","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/landscape/aatrox-justicar.jpg","image":null},"up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://funplay.live/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Justicar-Aatrox-Skin-Spotlight-League-of-Legends-520x245.jpg\n\nAs far as I understand it, Aatrox{{champion:266}}  new lore roughly tells the story of an ascended who where ripped of his freedom and became enslaved and trapped in his weapon after his mortal mind went mad after Azir&#039;s{{champion:268}}  death and the fall of Shurima. This makes me believe that Justicar Aatrox is the ascended version of Aatrox{{champion:266}}  -Him before he went &quot;mad&quot; and lost his freedom. \n\nBut why do he sound like and talk like the warmonger we all know as the red classic darkin{{champion:266}} ?\n\nIn his new lore, the ascended aatrox -Justicar Aatrox- was created to fight the void, which this voice lines also indicate:\n_**&quot;I stood against the void. Now... I would welcome it&quot;,**_ which doesnt really makes any sense for justicar Aatrox.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nHere some of his voice lines (and the issues concerning them)\n\n_**&quot;I am Darkin! Your gods fear me!&quot;**_  (Justicar Aatrox is not a Darkin, is he? Doesnt Darkin mean \"the fallen\"?)\n\n_**&quot;They think me defeated, enchained. But I am unbowed... Noble is this carnage.&quot;**_ (Justicar Aatrox is not &quot;enchained&quot;) \n\n_**&quot;I cannot die... until all life ends.&quot;**_ (Justicar Aatrox was supposed to kill the void, not ALL life)\n\n_** &quot;My darkness was not born, it was forged by my prison.&quot;**_ (Justicar Aatrox cannot have experienced this, yet)\n\n_**&quot;For my imprisonment, they will suffer!&quot;**_ (Same thing again)\n\n_**&quot;I have no goodness left, it was taken from me, stolen! I... am the nemesis of life.&quot;**_ (Same thing again. Justicar {{champion:266}}  is before this happened)\n\n\nWell, tell me what you think. Personally I like the new aatrox despite what people say. He is currently really good to certain things, but also really bad at other -Which is ok if he has the tools to deal with it. BUT: I don't like hearing classic Aatrox voice lines when playing Justicar Aatrox. Kinda makes me  want to just play without any skin on...\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Tin Obliterates","date":"2018-07-08T20:23:12.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I still agree that Justicar should have a new VO, didn't some Rioter say that Justicar Aatrox isn't actually his ascended form?","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-07-08T20:55:07.332+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's confirmed not his ascended form because Rioters said it has the potential to be a skin (it isn't one yet) and the skin lore puts it in the Arclight skin line.","replies":[{"poster":"Knightmere","date":"2018-07-09T16:15:19.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even though justicar Aatrox is in the Arclight skin line, is it realy a reason to believe it couldn't be the ascended Aatrox as well?\n\n\nWell, even if Justicar wasnt his ascended form, I still believe Justicar Aatrox needs different voice lines that fits the feeling of the skin better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"X1complex","date":"2018-07-08T20:50:20.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what what?? link?","replies":[{"poster":"Tin Obliterates","date":"2018-07-08T20:52:34.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=X1complex,realm=EUW,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rbgyEa5R,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-07-08T20:50:20.914+0000)\n>\n> what what?? link?\n\nI'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to find the exact quote and post it here asap.\n\nEDIT: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/wXNfNgnc-so-uh-given-their-history-as-ascended-are-arclight-varus-and-justicar-aatrox-their-former-look?comment=0007","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Malpercio","date":"2018-07-08T15:53:57.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's kinda a fucking cool way to look at the skin, and definitely makes it a bit more interesting than just 'holy version'.\n\nBut yeah, VO is offputting if imagined that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"X1complex","date":"2018-07-08T14:57:18.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely and utterly agree with you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinzley","date":"2018-07-08T14:27:17.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-08T21:55:26.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give him old Aatrox voice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knightmere","date":"2018-07-08T15:03:53.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice to see people's reaction at my post this quickly!
