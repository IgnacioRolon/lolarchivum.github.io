I have done some New work on him, and this is what I came up With. Here is the link to the old post: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/GvaLVsO8-juggo-the-marksman-juggernaut-champion-concept   (Check it out as well, and tell me which was better!)\n\n\nSome stats may be bit unerpowered/overpowered but that can be tuned and balanced so I dont think that is a problem. \n\nIntroduction:\nJuggo is a juggernaut marksman, who can deal damage from range. He is not the  typical &quot;squishy&quot; marksman, and is a hybrid between fighter/tank and marksman. To Balance this, he have high cooldowns, and really short range on his 2 first basic attacks (passive) With reload time after four shots. His movement speed is also quite low (300 at Level 1), but he has his Q, that can give him a free dash in any direction.\n\nSome base stats:\nHe uses energy, not mana. \nEnergy: 400\nBase movement speed: 300\nRange: 400\nAttack speed: 0.65\n\n\n\nAbilities:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yANxgXz.jpg\nRecon (normal mode) and War Machine (ultimate mode)\n\n**Passive: Recon**\nZooming Scope: Juggo gains increased attack range every time he hits an enemy with a basic attack, stacking up to 4 times (400/520/640/760 range). After the fourth bullet, he need to reload. The reload process takes 2 seconds, and it is fixed (building CD won&rsquo;t change the reload time). \n_Overdrive: removed\n_\n\n**Q: Nucleon Accelerator**\nCost: 100 energy \nCooldown: 20/18.5/17/15.5/13 seconds\n\nPassive: Nucleon Bullets: Juggo uses special ammunition, so that his basic attacks can restore some energy 35/45/55/65/75. \n\nActive: Juggo transforms all the energy in his remaining bullets into one, resulting in an extremely powerful shot. This shot will deal as much damage as all of them combined (but overdrive passive isn&rsquo;t added). The shot restores half the energy of the combined bullets, and is a skillshot, not a basic attack. This shot will also push juggo backwards, based on how many bullets he combined into the shot (200/300/400/500 range). This shot isn&rsquo;t stopped by minions, but by the first large monster or champion it hits. He must reload afterwards, but the cooldown on this ability is decreased for every bullet not used (1 second less for each).\n(How the skillshot will look like, is a way to balance this ability)\n\n\n**W: Energy Field\n** \nCost: 80 energy\nCooldown: 40/35/30/25/20 seconds\n\nActive: Juggo places a field of energy (as big as Yorick W), that slows enemies inside by 5/8/11/13/17%, but when they go through and out of it they will be \n\nslowed 10/15/20/25/30% instead for 1 second. Hitting a Nucleon Accelerator shot at them while the slow persists will stun them for 0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1 seconds instead and deal bonus magic damage.\n\n\n**E: Energy Converter**\nCost: 20 energy\nCooldown: 20/19/18/17/16 seconds\n\nPassive: When Juggo uses energy, some of the energy is converted into health and heal him over 3 seconds. The health is equal to 1/1.5/2/2.5/3x the energy cost + % if his maximum health. (If he uses 90 energy, he will regenerate 90/135/180/225/270 + % of his maximum health) \n\nActive: Instead of refilling energy when basic attacking, he ionizes the energy in each shot/melee attack so that they deal bonus damage instead on impact. He uses the energy when ionizing it, so that E&rsquo;s passive will be triggered as well on each attack. When this ability is on cooldown, the passive is as well. \n\n\n**R: War Machine**\nCost: no cost\nCooldown: 120/110/100\n\nPassive: Fast hands: removes 0.34/0.67/1 second from his reload time\n\nActive: Juggo jump into the air with assist from some powerful thrusters and transforms into a machine of war, then lands on target area. The area where he lands is ionized, damaging enemies inside every second and slowing them by 90% for up to 2 seconds. Juggo&rsquo;s base movement speed is increased to 320/340/360. \nJuggo can still attack from range with his left arm (range = 500 at all time, and his reload time is always 1 second) but if he is in range = 200 from an enemy, he leaps to them and uses a powerful melee attack (range = 125). Every melee attack deals 65/130/195 + 1% of his maximum health as bonus physical damage (and restore twice as much energy), but the first one on an enemy deals 75/150/225 + 2% of his maximum health as bonus physical damage instead and stun them for 1 second.  The ultimate last 8 seconds, but timer doesn&rsquo;t start before his feet is on the ground.\n\n\n\nHey! What do you think? I am so excited to hear _**YOUR**_ thought on this!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-10-15T11:44:37.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">This shot isnâ€™t stopped by minions, but by the first large monster or champion it hits\n\nI'd change that to stopping at the first large or epic monster rather than any monster.\n\nI'm also a bit worried about the potential power of this one ability (Q).  If you use it with 4 shots ready, wouldn't that be a 400% AD ratio?  That is some incredibly powerful poke coupled with escape from retaliation through the self knock-back.  If that does damage to minions it passes through, that is also pretty powerful waveclear.\n\nAnother part that worries me is the E passive.  That is potentially massive lane sustain, making it impossible to knock him out of lane.  He doesn't even need to hit the abilities for the regen.  I'd consider making it only heal if the ability hits a champion.  You could then increase the healing on this a bit as well.  That would enable him to heal a considerable amount during fights (like a juggernaut) without being immovable in the early laning phase (which was one of Mord's biggest problems).\n\nOther than that, it looks fine to me, though he'd likely be played in the top lane where the short attack range is relatively long and his cc can easily combo with a jungle gank.  Oh he'd also likely not build any crit or attack speed since the on-hit damage isn't worth the loss in attack speed, and it's effectively impossible to build a large amount of crit without building attack speed items.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay919","date":"2016-10-16T14:41:49.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=m9YYWmKq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-15T11:44:37.906+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d change that to stopping at the first large or epic monster rather than any monster.\n> \n> I&#x27;m also a bit worried about the potential power of this one ability (Q).

Typical juggernaut playstyle revolves around low mobility, high damage, high tank. Make his base movespeed 330 instead of 300.\n\nChange energy converter so that instead of him using energy and getting HP, make it so that every time he deals damage to an enemy, he heals for 2/3/4/5/6% missing HP. Hitting multiple enemies (for instance when he uses his R) multiples the % missing HP heal by however many enemies hit. Cooldown is 10/8.5/7/5.5/4 seconds for every instance of damage.\n\nAt least this way he is more of a juggernaut because he heals by dealing damage (like how yorick, nasus, darius, illaoi, etc. all heal off of doing damage in certain ways) instead of healing for the sake of spell spamming. The %missing HP heal reinforces the juggernaut idea because he should be building health and damage.\n\nMinions do not activate heal, non-minions do.\n\nJust some thoughts from a hardcore {{champion:122}} (one of the most prominent juggernauts out there) main","replies":[{"poster":"Knightmere","date":"2016-10-16T11:08:32.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice, good idea for E right there.
