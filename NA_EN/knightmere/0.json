Quinn is a marksman and a scout, who can seek out enemy positions fast and one who can attack in a blink of an eye before retrieving/falling back. When I see the \"demacian raptors\" I think more about a kind of _cavalry_. Something bigger, tougher, better armored, and something with much more mass that can deliver heavier charges. On the other hand, it can't be too heavy, or it wouldnt be able to fly, but demacian steel is light so that shouldnt be a problem... \n\nAgain; I think of the raptors as cavalry, with long spears that can pierce enemies it charges down or stab infantry from the height if its eagle(?), or just use the benefit of heaving a long weapon to attack other  people from a distance (not throwing, that would better fit light cavalry, something I dont think this should be)","replies":[{"poster":"Häxel","date":"2018-07-25T23:37:52.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, an airforce is an airforce.

So that someone sits on a dragon similar to how kled sits skaarl, sejuani on her boar or nunu on willump? Well considering that we already have quite some riders, lol is more of a 2d game so flying characters don't add much in realityand even if this dragonrider works with diffrent abilitys, the abilitys would probably similar to how quinn already feels with jumping lightly threw the air (this is cause old quinn also could do the same abilities with valor).\n\nSo yea, i personaly think such a character wouldn't add much and would be boring.

Well, wouldn't it be even more boring to add another champion who just walks... we already have over 100 of them... So what is your point?\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n\nAnd I said cavalry, because that is a \"medieval  term\", because there were only infantry, cavalry and artillery before  and no airplanes or flying knights (suprising, right?), and a flying raptor sure isn't infantry or artillery, but it is a mounted warrior... \n\nMy idea on cavalry that already exist ingame, would indeed be something like kled or sejuani. Kled _is_ the cantankerous cavalier, so _cavalry._ In game it doesnt have to make a difference wether its mounted or flying or not at all, just look at sejuani... But that would be boring indeed. But a really nice solution to the problem is just to go back to what **_cavalry actually is_** and what it is **_used for_** and take the essence or keypoints from it:\n\n{{sticker:sg-jinx}} \n\n1. Cavalry is fast moving, unlike infantry and artillery (surprise!)\n2. Mounted soldiers have an advantage of being higher off the ground: while enemy infantry can hardly reach up to their knees with swords, a  mounted warrior can easily reach for their heads... but 1 footman vs 1 cavalryman still has _the _advantage__, so why have a lone rider in the first place? Point3:\n\n3. Flanking. Cavalry is extremely good at flanking. THe champ could have a passive somewhat similar to fiora passive or shaco's backstab: u deal more damage to the flanks or back of an enemy. this could be achieved by the demacian raptor by having a form of **_jousting_**, (yes, I know{{champion:240}} ).\n\n4. Cavalry charges, especially from shock Cavalry, have the ability to just neglect whatever armour the enemy is wearing. Even if their weapons doesn't pierce their armor, the footmen would suffer great injuries, some of them as blunt impact trauma. Ingame it could so easy as to just let the rider to deal true damage when charging.\n\nbut there are just so many possibilities... {{sticker:sg-lux}} \nHard to cover them all","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChemicalBuster","date":"2018-07-24T22:41:52.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'd probably remove the helmet to give the champ more character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NocaNoha","date":"2018-07-24T19:23:43.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A slight issue might be that Quinn is already in the position of such champion.. the Demacian cooperation with wildlife? haha\n\nAlso, am not sure how would the champion move around, I mean.. sitting on a big bird and throwing spears while moving a bit left/bit right seems out of place for such a warrior and mounting/dismounting is already on Quinn with a different type of \"bird\"\n\nHe/she would have to move constantly at a higher speed to justify the theme.. and I don't think that would go along well with the league mechanics xd\n\nMaybe rework Quinn into this type of warrior? :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"SennaFirstPick","date":"2018-07-25T11:06:38.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we can make quinn like him tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roren from LAS","date":"2018-07-25T01:35:39.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the same, i just love that armour, looks fancy {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackom1","date":"2018-07-24T20:42:04.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It made me think of quinn and valor being reworked into a knight on a demacian raptor.
