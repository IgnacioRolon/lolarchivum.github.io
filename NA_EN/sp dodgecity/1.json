Slowly but surely I&#039;m climbing so I&#039;m happy with that. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;ve noticed though, and this confuses the hell outa me, is that I&#039;m S3 but most of the players in my matches are above s3. Last match for example had only one S3 person, me. We had three S1&#039;s, Two S2&#039;s, someone in their promos, one S4, and a Gold5.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \r\n\r\nI get that mmr trys to make it balanced and puts teams together with roughly the same overall MMR rating or whatever. \r\n\r\nWhat I don&#039;t get is why I have to face-off against literally no one in my ladder. In Tennis for example, I played it in High-school (made it to state too :D) If I wanted to move up the ladder on our team, I had to play the person directly above me. I couldn&#039;t go against the number one dude and then rank above the person barely higher than me. I had to play and beat that dude first and move up. Then our coach could mix things up if he saw we kept beating people way higher on the ladder. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\n\r\nAnyways, even though my mmr might put me against people above my ladder, I feel like I should still go up against the people my rank. In S3, I should go against S3 players until I&#039;m S2, and if I&#039;m winning so much more than usual, after the promotional wins the game should then put me where I should belong. (Which I believe it already does but you still have to play against people higher than you to even get to that point.) \r\n\r\nI dunno I feel like the system is both choosing who I go against as an individual but my individual results are team based. \r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} \r\n\r\nMeh, hopefully someone can help me out with this, also looking forward to the ranking system change in 2019, hopefully that fixes this shit.","replies":[{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-10-11T16:44:34.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"have a brother that's D3 who has a smurf account who can duoboost you","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoulNibbler","date":"2018-10-11T16:00:53.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LP you get will be based on a comparison of your team's MMR and their team's MMR. if you are outmatched you would get more for a win, lose less for a loss.\n\nSometimes your MMR can be SLIGHTLY higher than your visible rank; in this case your average opponent will be higher.\n\nYour visible rank will always gravitate toward your MMR.

In short, it all will work out the way it&#x27;s supposed to.\n\nYes and no.\nThe duality between the MMR and the tier system is inherently flawed. If your MMR is way above your tier you naturally will gain more LP in the tier system. This in itself could work, the big problem here are promo games. In theory some people can tank their MMR so hard that they could go up against people nearly a league above their current rank just because they couldn't manage to win their promo games.\n\nThis entire problem could be fixed if the system manually put you at the elo of the tier you'll be put after winning your promo games.\nSimply said: If your MMR is gold 2 (extreme imbalance example) and your rank is silver 1 you should have to play against a gold 5 team in your promos instead of a gold 2 team/ or you shouldn't need to win promos at all.\n\nThe big complaint about ranked in this regard is that it feels like shit if you have to win way harder promo games than your average player just to achieve the same rank. The difference between tiers in silver isn't that big so it's not that much of a problem in there if you're a more or less consistent player but the higher you go the bigger the skill difference becomes.\n\nJust imagine a plat1 with a diamond 4 elo having to play through an extended dia5-dia4 promo just to enter diamond while the plat1 with a diamond 5 elo has an \"easier\" Bo5. **The \"gateway\" to a higher tier should universally be the same which it isn't right now.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nevurwin","date":"2018-10-10T22:21:52.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The longer your queue time is actively searching for a match, the more it broadens its specifications.  On the other hand, you shouldn't really be paying attention to their ranks, the skill between S3-S1 and even Gold 5 is so similar that it shouldn't alter your matches. Its more of a mental barrier if anything and could really ruin your proper mindset before the match even starts. \n\ni get your whole ladder idea, i played Tennis too , and we did things the same way at practice. We could challenge teammates for their spot, 1-3 singles, 1-3 doubles, and the reserve players. But in League this doesn't really work. you would be waiting forever if matchmaking had to search for 10 Silver 3 players everytime you queued, note these players also have different roles selected as preference... There would be a very high auto fill rate, or you would just be waiting for 10min+ everytime.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-10-11T17:13:36.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me IGN: LeftyRaydy\n\nI can play a game with you and see what's going on.
