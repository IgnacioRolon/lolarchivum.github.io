Let Nunu and Willump somehow lift Amumu&#039;s curse. Willump will cure Amumu&#039;s depression and Nunu can have a human (or yordle, i can&#039;t remember) friend. I don&#039;t know how or why they would meet but it needs to happen. Amumu would be all like &quot;Do you wanna be my friend?&quot; then Nunu would be all like &quot;That would be AWESOME!&quot; Willump could try to stop him because he can sense magic but Nunu could just break the curse with friendship or something... I&#039;m not a story writer but I really think there&#039;s potential there. Just dont let Nunu contract the curse or something. that would be sad.\r\n\r\nPs: Can we get a new Nunu &amp; Willump emote for the boards? the other ones give me the creeps, i&#039;d love too see some cute ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-31T00:07:32.199+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirmed - Nunu, Amumu and Lulu all hang out.\n\nAlso, Swain brings the pain to Kayn and Vayne, in lane or on the Dalamor Plain.","replies":[{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2018-08-31T04:41:56.757+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"but who brings the rain?......
