Adc already has items that cover healing, people that peel for them,  people that set up for them, and tons of MS in there items. They dont need red buff too.  You know who really needs red buff? The melee champs trying to stick to the enemy.  Sure in a pro game with 4 tanks and cait, give her the red buff.  But in a normal solo que game with Bruisers and melee carries like yi, they can make more use of it.  \n\nAlso the only person who decides who gets red buff is the jungler.  If you take it away from him with out asking or away from the person he wanted it to go to then dont be shocked when he gets pissed.  I have had MANY games where mid takes blue or adc takes red and the jungler flips out ( and usually for good reason). The jungler then either divides his team because of the jack ass who didnt ask first, or throws the game to make sure that carry loses elo.  This is very common to see in korea and is getting more common here in NA.  So please just ask your jungler if you want the buff and he will make the call of who its best for.","replies":[{"poster":"CrisisEchoes","date":"2018-04-03T03:16:59.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually asked sneaky on stream and thats the answer he gave me... but he must be wrong, my bad.

If in most cases it _is_ the adc getting fed, so be it. In other cases it may be the champion that scales best (like everyone letting kassadin get 16 asap).
