I recently moved into a new house that has AT&amp;T Uverse through DirecTV. Now suddenly I cannot login. I get the \"Unable to connect to the login queue, check the server, follow the guide\" message. The server status is fine and my friends have been playing so I know it is Uverse that is causing the issues. I have run the Hextech repair tool, opened the appropriate ports, made sure I have a firewall exception, and re-installed League of Legends. Nothing seems to work. Any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-04T22:42:37.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been hearing any issues with AT&T UVerse lately, but you might actually be onto something.
