I use to think ya because they a bad players and I thought that until the reset promotional. The problem is oddly more simple they that, It more then them just being bad players they don't understand the widely established rules of the game.\r\n\r\nSo oddly enough that all important way to get out of bronze V. Is to not play by the rules, the way win is to be better then the other guy. In way to carry. Say you play ADC you be lucky to get peel, Tank your team may always of never follow you in, Assassin do expect and help, Jungler Help on ganks only sometimes, ans support don't bother looking at you adc's farm.\r\n\r\nof course you being good helps because you could just out play the. But if you play to you conferred zone you will be in a better place then following what they think as a meta.","replies":[]}
