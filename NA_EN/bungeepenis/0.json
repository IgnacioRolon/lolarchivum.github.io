I can leave the screen by pressing com+opt+esc and it brings me to a screen saying the game has crashed, please try to reconnect. I tried restarting my computer, tried re-installing league, shut down league, played using different wifi's and still it happens. I would really appreciate if someone could help me out! (p.s if you need pictures in order to help me, require them from this email [**removed**])\n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"ThaRealSlimShady","date":"2016-05-04T04:20:06.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T23:46:34.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, troubleshooting a problem after Champ Select can be incredibly tricky to do as it can either be a connection issue, or some type of hardware issue.  Both of these issues have almost the exact same symptoms.  Most commonly, the issue is that your computer was not able to connect to the individual game server.  Since it wasn't able to connect, it doesn't know what to display and therefore gives a black screen.\n\nTo hopefully resolve this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [Connection Issues Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).  It has the most common solutions to get rid of this black screen and get you back onto the Rift.\n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing any issues!","replies":[{"poster":"bungeepenis","date":"2016-05-05T08:00:41.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to play all different game modes (custom, co-op vs. al , PVP)  and the problem still occurs. This might maybe mean its a hardware problem, right? or do you still think there is a possibility of connection issue? I also recently moved houses resulting in the WIFI being worse but I dont think that has anything to do with my problem.","replies":[]}]}]}
