I&#039;ve got about 600 ranked games on Thresh from season 3 to now, and he&#039;s absolutely my favorite champion to play. I own every one of his skins, save for SSW (I thought that World Championship was boring, so I skipped out on buying the skin), and so, naturally, I bought this skin immediately along with the matching icon and I&#039;ll be getting the ward later today.\n\nI thought I&#039;d list some pros and cons below, and I have some questions about the skin for any Rioters who may read this:\n\nPros:\n\n* Starting off by saying the lantern is easily my favorite part of this skin. I love that it&#039;s a black hole, I love the animation for when it&#039;s thrown down, I love how it changes after 40 souls (though that number feels a TAD low), I love how Thresh has lines for when he throws down the lantern. I just love everything about it.\n* Eldritrch space horror! That in itself is a wonderful thing.\n* The Death Sentence particles are great! It has particles along the entire chain, which is really cool. What sells it is that Thresh turns red when he lands the hook and his head tendrils go crazy with excitement. It feels so much more rewarding landing it than it normally does.\n* His joke, taunt, and dance are all pretty nice. [RIP George](https://www.facebook.com/leagueoflegends/posts/10157221125110556) every time I use the joke.\n\nCons:\n\n* His autos are well animated, but the sounds of the autos landing feels very quiet. Almost to the point it feels questionable if you hit someone, which makes them feel kinda weak. All of his other skins have a definite flaying sound (get it?) when you hit someone, and it feels more rewarding because of that. This skin&#039;s autos feel weak for a soul draining eldritch space horror.\n* The box also suffers a bit from the same problem. Because the sound of the box walls breaking is replaced from a loud shattering noise to a warpy space reverberation, it&#039;s a much more subtle sound. As a result, it might come off as weak to some players. The walls, being dark as they are, may also be hard to see for some players. They&#039;re not so dark you can&#039;t see them, but they&#039;re definitely less noticeable.\n* I&#039;d call this my only real gripe with this skin, and it&#039;s not even anything combat related: his singular laugh track. I found it strange and very disappointing a legendary skin has less sounds for an emote than his base skins. It&#039;s even more of a letdown once you realize the voice modulation of the laugh makes it so you can&#039;t laugh too quickly in quick succession without the animation playing in silence, so you not only have one laugh, but the delays between it makes it feel even more disappointing. He definitely could have used  more laugh tracks.\n\nSo those are my thoughts on the skin. Sorry if the cons seem long, but it&#039;s a lot easier to write criticisms than what I like. I&#039;d recommend it for Thresh mains or anyone who loves space horror or the color purple. I might recommend waiting for the early sale for everyone else, though, unless you just NEED the skin for some reason. I&#039;d give it a 8.5/10.\n\nIf any Rioters read this, I do have a question. His laugh really does bother me. Is it intended he only has one laugh track? It feels wrong that a Legendary skin has less laughs than his base skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2016-06-18T21:49:33.920+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the thoughtful review and feedback. I am the team lead for the cross-functional team that created Dark Star Thresh. Pleased to meet you.\n\nIn terms of the audio feedback, on Point 1 & 2- do you mean it literally isn't loud enough or the design of the sound isn't as impactful as you'd have hope for?\n\nAs for the laughter...that is an interesting POV and something I will keep in mind for future skin development. I am a big fan of spamming emotes (Tahm Kench laugh all day) and I understand the satisfaction that can bring. We wanted to time his laugh to the animation of him bringing up champion faces in his black hole orb, so that explains the delay from a product design perspective. That said, I'll take another look at the laugh variation with the team.\n\nAlso, apologies for DS Thresh being disabled at the moment. A bug was discovered by players that causes a major hitch in gameplay performance when an enemy DS Thresh emerges from fog of war. We are currently working on a solution to that problem and hope to have it fixed ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Lawful Good","date":"2016-06-19T04:42:08.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for responding, Pabro! Nice to meet you.\n\nConcerning the sounds, I've absolutely no problem with the sound designs themselves. I think they fit the theme perfectly, and the dark \"warping\" sounds are badass. The auto attack sounds are also not at all as negative as this post made them sound, having played it more as well. I just feel as if the autos and box are on the quiet side. The sounds are powerful sounds: gravitational warping, reverberating, etc. I think it's their volume that makes them feel weak more than anything. I don't think they'd need much volume increasing, but a bit might be nice.\n\nAs for the laugh, thank you for the response on that. My comments on the volume of the autos and his ult felt like minor notes to me. I honestly felt like it may have been my own personal experience with them, so I felt a bit self conscious making them sound like as big of a deal as I made them out to be, but his laugh really did get to me.\n\nI want to say again, I absolutely love the lantern, and I have to give you major kudos for its design. My duo partner/ADC buddy loves it too, because the sounds of it and the lines Thresh gives when placing it or when someone accepts it feel really amazing.\n\nMy 7.5/10 felt a bit harsh after getting used to his autos more and having played his older skins while waiting on the fix, so I'd change my rating to 8.5/10 now. It's still easily my favorite skin he's gotten, and I absolutely don't regret the purchase at all. As for the bug, things happen! I'll be happy to play him more once he's re-enabled.","replies":[{"poster":"Pabro","date":"2016-06-19T19:45:28.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No sweat!
