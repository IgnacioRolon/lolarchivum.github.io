It puts me into the game loading screen, everyone will be at zero for at least 2 minutes, and then everyone will go up at the same percentage, or it will usually say \"failed to connect, please try again\". I never really had this problem, My internet seems to be find, and I have nowhere else to turn.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T22:52:06.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your network might be hitting some weird hangup when it's trying to load into the actual game. You do need to make a new connection to the game servers, so let's double check those network settings just as a first step. Adjust your port forwarding and DNS settings following those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but definitely, let me know if that doesn't seem to help.","replies":[{"poster":"lukala93","date":"2017-11-02T19:04:24.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have almost the excact same problem,\n\n-I load in a game and it stays at 0% for     everyone for a solid 5 minutes.\n-Everyone's percenrage starts climbing in sync and never geos higher hen 48%\n\nWhat I have figured out is that from the moment the percentage starts climbing, the game starts. *WHILE THE GAME THINKS I AM LOADED IN*. So a lot of the times when I join into a game I immediatly get kicked for being inactive. So I retry and basicly restart the cycle.","replies":[{"poster":"lukala93","date":"2017-11-02T19:23:39.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So okay now i am mad,\nI just tried to play a single game, tried to reconnect 5-6 times but failed, and now I got the 20 min low-priority que.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
