Before he what was an auto-attack based champion, one cc ability, and a slow? That wasn&#039;t very unique, Jax, Trundle, Nasus, Yorick, and many more are similar.  But then after the change &quot;, he is just riven, wah!&quot;, really? He has one ability similar to Riven and they aren&#039;t even that similar.  He still holds his main concept down, Undying, war loving, with some CC, and heals.  \r\nI know losing something you love sucks but there are over 100 champions to play with, they are all similar to each other in some way Lux and Morgana both have kits centered around landing a hard cc skill shot, but they aren&#039;t compared like Riven and Aatrox are.\r\nI guess my point is that old Aatrox was not popular and did not fit into the current game very well, much like old Warwick and old Urgot.  The update brought them into a position where more people could play the champion and have fun.  \r\nI am sorry they took something you loved but you will love again if you give it time.","replies":[]}
