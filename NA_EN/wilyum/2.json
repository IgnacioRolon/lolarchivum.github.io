I don&#039;t care that you got a bunch of skins for free. The only skins I care about are ones I&#039;m willing to buy because I think they are cool and considering the thousands of hours I&#039;ve played this game over the years I don&#039;t mind supporting the company by buying a skin every now and then.\n\nWhy are some of you so proud that you exploited the bug? What because Riot has made decisions about balance you don&#039;t agree with? Cool story dude. You got a bunch of free stuff and made a bunch of people feel cheated good on you.\n\nEdit: also people who didn't get skins for free, get over it. If you like a skin buy it to support the free game you play. I've never spent so many hours in a game and this game is free","replies":[]}
