This got me chat restricted???  Can&#039;t tell my 0/8/0 Jax top to not steal camps, can&#039;t say that was stupid after I see 3 people chase teemo under tower and die, and can&#039;t tell my blitz to stop grabbing people when we are running away.  Oh and the Jax didn&#039;t get banned for flaming me or for feeding, ten deaths and flames no ban.  LMFAO did not realize how worthless riot&#039;s punishment system was, won&#039;t waste my time trying to report anyone anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Uriel","date":"2018-09-01T14:26:55.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wilyum: just report jax\nWilyum: reported\nWilyum: report jax and blitz\n\nTelling people to report someone isn't desired chat behavior.

Makes sense to me, so tired of seeing trolls who don't get banned because they are having a \"bad\" game.  Losing lane is one thing trying to steal a fed jungler's buffs and camps because he didn't gank is troll.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hshtagniemehrcdu","date":"2018-09-01T16:37:13.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wilyum,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8ld7BRE7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-09-01T14:28:33.573+0000)\n>\n> So saying report Jax is reportable?

Imagine the behavioral system like a leveling system.  You can be at 99% when you started the game anad that jax could have been at 30%. You minor offense got you 1% and jax's flame got him 50%. At the end of the game, you reached 100% and max is at 80%, resulting in you got punished and he didn't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpleYukari","date":"2018-09-01T15:27:07.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Wilyum: no im not\n> Wilyum: im not toxic\n> Wilyum: saying someone is trolling isnt toxic lol\n> Wilyum: saying someone trolled isnt toxic bro\n\nHow ironic.
