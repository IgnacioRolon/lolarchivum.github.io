We asked him if he was playing Graves support, if he was trying to trade Graves to me, and he just did not answer. So I picked a support and was just ready to play the game.\r\nHe proceeds to die a lot, I don&#039;t know if it was trolling or what but he would go into the enemy jungle and just die over and over. \r\nIf he had played well I wouldn&#039;t really care that much but for someone to steal jungle away from my nearly 70% win rate Warwick to play their 50% win rate Graves only to feed irks me. Later in the game, he kept saying he just wanted to double jungle... No communication in pregame about this, not to mention this strategy is garbage and he was supposed to be support.\r\nSo, is stealing a role punishable? I reported for trolling and feeding (as well as flaming, he flamed our top and mid repeatedly) but I want to know if stealing a role itself is punishable.\r\n-21 LP cause I was trolled.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-12-16T05:17:02.554+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda hard to tell if that was punishable; they try not to punish alternative strategies.\n\nHowever, his not communicating his intentions in the pre-game, along with seemingly going jungle sound suspect, so I would have reported it. That was very good of you to go support, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-16T05:27:42.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"You appear to have willingly gave up the role. You took his role as well.\n\nIf you had stuck jungle out, and then he played jungle, that'd be a cut and dry punishment. As he saw you take a support, he has a reasonable defense that he was merely filling the role you had left open when you took his role.\n\nNext time, force these trolls to actually do it in game - then they'll get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2018-12-16T07:14:20.894+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grudgingly swapping your role because someone else appears to intend to play a role other than they were assigned is not the same as agreeing to swap roles.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2018-12-16T09:08:55.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, but can you really claim theft afterward?  If he decided to go bot and now you have 3 bot laner and op cannot reasonably go jungle without smite or whatever supp champ he picked.  Will the graves then be called a troll for going bot with smite to fullfill his assigned role?\n\nI don't condone what the graves did, but i'm not sure you can call it role theft if there is a reasonable expectation of a lane swap happened.  Either he goes jg and be called a thief or go 3 bot and be called a troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2018-12-16T14:58:26.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But here's the problem. Once OP took sorry, **it gives the \"troll\" a valid reason to continue going jungle*.\n\nIf OP had taken jungle like they were assigned, the troll could've swapped Summoner's and played their assigned role, or even played their assigned role with smite, which isn't an invalid strategy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ı Sona ı","date":"2018-12-16T05:52:39.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, yes it is punishable.
