League worked perfectly fine for me, yesterday I played the game and went to sleep, when I woke up at 6am and tried to login, error showed up that I'm unable to connect to the authentication service. Now its 8pm and I'm still experiencing this type of an issue. \nTried euw, eune and pbe accounts, none of them worked, same message on every single of them, \"Unable to connect to the authetication service\"\n\n**Things that I did was:**\n\n* Running client as Admin\n* Disabling firewall\n* Running in safe mode\n* Disabling windows defender\n* Restarting my router\n* Trying with dns \"8.8.8.8\" and \"8.8.4.4\"\n* Repairing with Hextech Repair Tool \n\nAnd still the same error.\n\n**_EDIT:_**  Mostly Comcast users have this issue, my ISP is DSL-Elektronika, so it's not the only Comcast that is affected by this unfortunately. \n\n**_EDIT2:_** Day 2, I'm currently using VPN to change my IP Address so i can play some League, still can't login with my own IP.","replies":[{"poster":"MIDWEST WHATTTTT","date":"2017-10-21T19:11:11.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same issue, comcast ISP as well.

Essentially, the VPN told your ISP to try routing your connection a different way (which is something Riot has absolutely no power over, connection routing is 100% on your ISP). \n\nLet me know if any of you are still having issues so I can help you take a look and figure out the best steps to take from here!","replies":[{"poster":"ddoA","date":"2017-10-23T12:38:26.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any type of fix for this issue?
