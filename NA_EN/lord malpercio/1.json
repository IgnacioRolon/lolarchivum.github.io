Some people do, because some exploits will add a perceived depth to the game. If you know much about some competitive games, you might know that there's still some debate over whether or not \"wavedashing\" is considered an exploit in Smash Melee, but regardless of whether it is or is not you still have to learn it. In original DotA there were some quirks from the WC3 code that allowed for allied creep denying that reduced the experience the enemy got from the creep and allowed for stacking neutral camps. Similarly to Smash Melee, these quirks were at first considered exploits, but then people realized how to use those quirks effectively and you were forced to learn them because they were useful. \n\nYou think League praises exploits? You guys hate them more than any sort of competitive community I've ever seen. You outright refuse to have to learn them, no matter how beneficial they could be. In any other competitive game, you'd just get strange looks if you weren't taking advantage of everything you could to advance your character's metagame and improve your general gameplay as long as it wasn't an outright busted tool that was immediately considered cheating.","replies":[{"poster":"Terchio","date":"2017-01-18T06:39:00.204+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't even like Dodge for its RNG. There is no excuse for keeping champion abilities that work in similar fashion to the Konami Code. If it's a legitimate combo, fine. If it's a random string of inputs that spits out a new and unique outcome unlike the 5 abilities you have on your screen, and you're the only champion with that \"ability\", That should not stay.\n\nAnd DotA is a bad comparison to make. Sure, code allowed creep denying, but part of the reason LoL exists is because they admitted to themselves that such an ability will hold back an enemy's gameplay in ways difficult to balance, and they held that out of their game. Afterall, AD characters have a general advantage when trying to deny over a support or caster, since a caster can't damage their own creeps with spells, usually. Riot made the right choice in removing that, and even removed random-like effects such as dodge and universal crit chance (for those who remember, every champion used to have inherent crit chance), yet somehow thinks giving Riven a new free Cleanse effect is something worth keeping, with no clarity on the effect whatsoever? No, this isn't the straightforward gameplay Riot has generally been known for. Riot is the company that boasts about their clarity. Yet, for some reason, some of these champions are given unique effects that you not only can't read up on easily for one special champ, but then you need a sandbox to perfect it in the first place, **which they still have yet to release**. I am glad they did decide to implement it, from the sounds of things, though. Now we'll have to just wait to get that... soon...\n\nRiot's never been perfect, but allowing Riven's shenanigans has been a particularly glaring low in their game over the years. Every once in a while, we hear about champions getting clarity injected into their kit, for both allies and enemies. For whatever reason, Riven is the grand exception of that. The kicker for me is that **they even removed invisible autoattacks within Nidalee's kit** to help balance her out. I'm in shock that she made the cut, and Riven's still Riven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KorZod","date":"2017-01-18T01:47:27.850+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every smash character can wavedash, altho some can better than others.

Timing was much easier if used in combination with other abilities on her kit (buffering), but could be done with just the E.\n* We don't have a repro on any other displacement cancelling effects besides that one with the E. It's possible there's something else, none of the bug reports we've got had demonstrated other cases yet however.\n* Similarly we've seen reports the bug could be used to cancel non displacement CC, but haven't seen a demonstrated case of that occuring to investigate (if you've got a good repro would love to see it).\n* This bug's been live on Riven for at least a year (probably a lot longer). Given that, difficulty exploiting it reliably in game, lack of increase in average power after the bug began getting discussed, attempts to exploit the bug often leading to Rivens just wasting their abilities mid fight and dashes/displacements in general being able to override existing dashes/displacements we concluded this was not a disable worthy bug. \n* The recent Teemo disable by contrast was due to a bug where Teemo would phase in and out of invisibility (passive proccing, AS included) while in brush even when in combat. That was a newly introduced bug that happened very consistently, had a noticeable power impact, could be reliably exploited and was very different from other normal behaviors.
