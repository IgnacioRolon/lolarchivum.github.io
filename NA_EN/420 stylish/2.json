Or would I get roughly half off for already owning three of the chromas? Just curious, because I'll have enough IP to buy 3 of them as well as RP to buy the bundle, but if I get a discount for owning some of them then I may as well blow my IP on as many as I can and buy the rest with RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2016-08-25T06:01:42.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bundles should always taken into account what you already own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-25T22:21:32.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all bundles are *Flexible bundles*, however, Chroma Pack bundles are.
