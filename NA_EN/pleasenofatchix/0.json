If you get behind in some games or matchups you are just cannon fodder and nothing can change that; especially with all the free damage that runes give now. How much CDR is in the game, etc. There is more to it than people just magically got worse or somehow all the good people quit. If anything, its not the good people quitting its the bads who aren't having fun. People who are good at things don't quit them. Thats why if you go play, say WoW Arena, you are going to be facing people with glad and arena master titles in the 1500-1600s.","replies":[{"poster":"PleaseNoFatChiX","date":"2018-02-20T23:27:29.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with that being said why are former pro players and top streamers losing more games now? even when they are doing well is it fair to them that they can't win a game do to bad teammates?","replies":[{"poster":"TreeDayBan","date":"2018-02-20T23:50:50.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Former pro players are just that.

Now the difference between two players of equal skill isn't who has T2 vs T3 runes, because everyone has the same access to the same shit and it comes down to player skill.\n\nAlso, you got robbed of nothing. How long did you utilize the old rune system when you put money into it? You paid for a product and used it, and likely had a considerable advantage over PLENTY of others (many like myself only had T2 runes, and that was once the 1IP sale became a thing) for a decent amount of time.\n\nYou CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR RUNES dependent on who you're playing against. I don't see how you CAN'T do that now. The option wasn't taken from you - if anything, now there's quite a bit more variety than just flat stats. For example: Sion won't want comet against someone like Cho in lane because the poke now means nothing, so you can take other keystones like Grasp/Glacial Augment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2018-02-20T23:06:17.847+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.  league has fewer players\n\n2.
