Back then I never understood how the system worked and assumed that I had deserved it although I was bummed about losing the hundreds I had spent on it. Fast forward 2 years later and I became curious to how the permaban system worked because of some boards i stumbled upon. Soon I realized that while many of the people on the boards had logs that were fairly toxic and had multiple warnings, I saw that my chat logs were not at all as toxic as my punishment would perceive. While I had only received a single 2 week warning before my permanent ban, several others had received plenty even though they had said worse. I've been informed that the worst word you could use in the game is ''kys'', however the worst I said was ''stfu''. Sure that type of language is unacceptable and I agree that I should've received my punishment to the extent of the language I used, but a permaban? After a while I'm starting to wonder if my permaban is really justified. Here are my chat logs.\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nPoopity786: why lol\r\nPoopity786: according to the rules of blind pick\r\nPoopity786: he didnt say jg\r\nPoopity786: idiot\r\nPoopity786: so?\r\nPoopity786: im using logic\r\nPoopity786: yes\r\nPoopity786: i am\r\nPoopity786: top\r\nPoopity786: selfish or not\r\nPoopity786: its legit\r\nPoopity786: 6 cs jg??\r\nPoopity786: dafuq lol\r\nPoopity786: nah\r\nPoopity786: lol i got jg rightfully\r\nPoopity786: and they are mad that i did it\r\nPoopity786: i got no leash cause you guys are mad tho\r\nPoopity786: thats why im not\r\nPoopity786: no i didnt\r\nPoopity786: i got it rightfully what\r\nPoopity786: nobody called it\r\nPoopity786: and i got it\r\nPoopity786: u guys dont understand\r\nPoopity786: no matter how wrong u see it is\r\nPoopity786: i didnt do anything wrong\r\nPoopity786: lol and then u guys are using foul language and negative attitudes\r\nPoopity786: technically you guys are the ones supposed to be reported\r\nPoopity786: lol\r\nPoopity786: i might be an asshole\r\nPoopity786: but im a fair asshole\r\nPoopity786: lol\r\nPoopity786: yes\r\nPoopity786: im following rules\r\nPoopity786: u guys arent\r\nPoopity786: because u are using foul language and a negative attitude\r\nPoopity786: yep\r\nPoopity786: what\r\nPoopity786: says the one cussing me out for being fair?\r\nPoopity786: riven\r\nPoopity786: you have more deaths\r\nPoopity786: what\r\nPoopity786: you guys are so mad that u arent even making sense\r\nPoopity786: im not doing it on purpose i dont think i am\r\nPoopity786: ok\r\nPoopity786: sorry\r\nPoopity786: i got too much lag\r\nPoopity786: i didnt even say no what the fuck\r\nPoopity786: whatttt\r\nPoopity786: lol\r\nPoopity786: ok\r\nPoopity786: pls listen to me guys\r\nPoopity786: i rightfully get jg\r\nPoopity786: then they trash talk me\r\nPoopity786: i say im sorry\r\nPoopity786: and stop talking\r\nPoopity786: and they keep on trash talking me\r\nPoopity786: then now they say report ME\r\nPoopity786: no\r\nPoopity786: pls report them\r\nPoopity786: i didnt steal jg tho\r\nPoopity786: k\r\nPoopity786: pls report them for me\r\nPoopity786: its a 4 on 1 so they wont listen to me\r\nPoopity786: if u got common sense unlike these uneducated idiots\r\nPoopity786: pls help\r\nPoopity786: i honestly dont want a ban\r\nPoopity786: for doing nothng\r\nPoopity786: see\r\nPoopity786: she said im inting\r\nPoopity786: then she does that\r\nPoopity786: but then they say report me\r\nPoopity786: whatt\r\nPoopity786: exactly\r\nPoopity786: not an excuse\r\nPoopity786: because i got no leash\r\nPoopity786: ok negative harassing and verbally abusive team\r\nPoopity786: pls report them\r\nPoopity786: ty\r\nPoopity786: ggwp\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nPoopity786: lee leash?\r\nPoopity786: he mad at me?\r\nPoopity786: then why no leash lol\r\nPoopity786: ty\r\nPoopity786: varus what are you doing\r\nPoopity786: what\r\nPoopity786: because i had no e?\r\nPoopity786: but fine?\r\nPoopity786: it was ur fault you died\r\nPoopity786: super aggresive\r\nPoopity786: that is not an excuse\r\nPoopity786: and if they ganked twice you should be way less aggresive\r\nPoopity786: then how was she able to ult you\r\nPoopity786: u are bad\r\nPoopity786: nah u are just bad kid\r\nPoopity786: so much salt\r\nPoopity786: he's mad at me\r\nPoopity786: idk why\r\nPoopity786: lol nice\r\nPoopity786: yeah with you on our team\r\nPoopity786: xD\r\nPoopity786: wow\r\nPoopity786: i was typing instead of attacking tehre\r\nPoopity786: stfu\r\nPoopity786: not u alistar\r\nPoopity786: the idiot is feeding most and yet he says\r\nPoopity786: stop feeding\r\nPoopity786: YES\r\nPoopity786: wow\r\nPoopity786: you are so r%%%%%ed that it hurts\r\nPoopity786: have fun doing it yourself llol\r\nPoopity786: ff pls\r\nPoopity786: dude\r\nPoopity786: you have the same deaths\r\nPoopity786: omg\r\nPoopity786: guys this azir had 4 deaths while the rest of us had 3 or less deaths\r\nPoopity786: and he said we were feeding\r\nPoopity786: and then gets mad and says reportm e\r\nPoopity786: autism\r\n\r\nI was definitely toxic, but after only 1 warning, the first game a 2 week ban, and then the second permanent ban, I think I really should not have been permanently banned. My teammates and the opposing team in both games appeared to be just as toxic if not more and yet I was the only player banned. I hope that my permanent banned was invalid and I get to play on this account once more as a reformed, new player. If I'm wrong my apologies as I was definitely a toxic player.","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-01T05:20:30.563+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> My teammates and the opposing team in both games appeared to be just as toxic if not more and yet I was the only player banned\n\nThey are responsible for their actions.
