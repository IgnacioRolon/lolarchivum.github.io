At first me and my teammates decided she was inting and trolling and then left the game but after some research i saw that this was indeed her first ranked game, all other games before that were BEGINNER games i will repeat BEGINNER.\nSo the question is the following, was that a bug in the system or Riot is currently testing me if am about to crack, because currently i am under a chat restriction.\nThanks a lot i hope to hear some opinions on this one.\n\nEDIT : Actually it will be better if i just give you his op.gg \n<Removed By Moderation>","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2018-03-12T16:39:17.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This just perfectly demonstrates how the matchmaking system works.\n\nIt's pure bad luck on your side, I feel sorry for this. If you want to play games with better matchmaking go for Dota or HoTS. In LoL you get this....\n\nAt least she has 95% winrate, kappa :D","replies":[{"poster":"féed lord","date":"2018-03-12T17:21:12.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man i am pretty sure that 100% winrate is what tilted her after being 0/5 at 6 min to go afk lol.\nStill i prefer to think that i am being punished for my bad behaviour in the past that to believe that with a gold 5 mmr i play with players that just finished playing with bots..

We have rules against naming or shaming here, regardless if someone is guilty of something or not, and in this context, it's considered as such.\n\nThat being said, players are fully within their right to start playing ranked whenever they feel like they're ready, and they're allowed to pick whatever champion / summoner spells they'd like to use, as well as build whatever they want.

Generally yes, feeding and leaving can fall under the category of toxic behavior. That being said, I'd like to point out that it's entirely possible that the feeding was unintentional and they left out of irritation for performing poorly. That isn't to say that it wasn't intentional, but it's definitely a possibility. If you suspect the feeding was intentional, all you need to do is report them using the after-game report system (and leaving games is also report-able).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-03-12T20:43:19.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"removed by moderation\" \nI don't understand your language/grammar here,,,,","replies":[{"poster":"Kyaza","date":"2018-03-13T03:07:46.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=n3nqL1Q1,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-12T20:43:19.884+0000)\n>\n> &quot;removed by moderation&quot; \n> I don&#x27;t understand your language/grammar here,,,,\n\na moderator removed the link","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-12T18:49:59.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you first play ranked, you are placed in silver2 MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"féed lord","date":"2018-03-12T19:33:06.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kei143,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=n3nqL1Q1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-12T18:49:59.316+0000)\n>\n> When you first play ranked, you are placed in silver2 MMR.\n\nSo it it turns out that its safer to be bronze than being gold is that right?","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-13T02:14:18.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you get past gold3 ELO, you won't see them again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
