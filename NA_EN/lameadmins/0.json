Are you so mad that you're blind to your own behaviour? Theres a certain limit to everything. Yes calling someone a noob CAN and WILL get you banned it' called negative attitude. And negative attitude is not welcome in the league community. I'll admit I'm not angel. My main account RedTrinketGoneHa was banned back in January this year for calling someone the n word, and I had just previously been punished for the same thing before I got my perma. Did I spend a lot of money on the game? Hell yeah. Was I mad? Damn right! Was I deserving of the ban? Absolutely! Did I come to cry on the forums? Absolutely not, because I KNEW that I was in the wrong. I wasn't blinded by my rage.\n\nEven this account I am not perfect with just yesterday a Morgana was flaming atbme BIG time in my Draven game which we won!? Basically she was saying she was gonna slit my parents throat and all nonsense like that, you know what I did, ignored it. Plain and simple. I might have said something at first but I tried my absolute best to block it out. Cause flaming someone else for flaming you is not worth your own ban. And I'll admit I flame a bit on this account sometimes but it isn't way as bad as my old account. I welcome Riot Tantrum to post logs from my old account and logs from this one, I mean maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I do flame and act negative a lot on this account. But not one time in MONTHS have I gotten a message saying I was reported or a popup.  Feel free Riot Tantrum, I'm not scared.
