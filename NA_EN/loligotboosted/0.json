I think this can be left alone, unless they do something snazzy like with darius&#039;s basketball hoop on head\n\nQ Concept - \n1. Tentacle with a headband \n2. Rolled up towel (If you don&#039;t get it, look up towel-snapping)\n\nW Concept-\n\n1.) Illaoi uses her basketball to dunk with her next attack.\n\nE Concept-\n\n1.) Again Tentacle with a headband\n2.) The tentacle towel will be whipped out and make a satisfying smack while grabbing their soul (towel-snapping 100% relevant)\n\nR concept-\n\n1.) Illaoi summons a Basketball goal from Ouroborus and slams her basketball through the net (like darius). \n\nExample illaoi ultimate w/ the towel snapping idea\n\nhttp://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5357f06769beddb37cca22b2/towel-whipping-anti-bullying.gif","replies":[{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2016-11-18T19:55:29.341+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I saw the gif, I thought the fat kid was your idea of Illioaioa.

And it could be 1350 skin or 950 instead of another legendary skin (I would love one for illaoi but less chance of that happening)","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-11-19T18:35:03.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marauder, Car Salesmen, Elderwood, Underworld, and Dun Master Ilaoi... she has many great concepts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drink Arizona","date":"2016-11-19T13:09:57.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this skin idea a while ago. Instead of the tentacles still being there, why not trade it for a bunch of basketball poles / backboards just smacking down on people. simply because that would be fucking hilarious. or even just what you said.
