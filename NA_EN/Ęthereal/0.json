We have also already played 2 games together using the duo and have not received the icon for doing that either. Is it supposed to automatically unlock for us? Or do we have to do something else to receive the icons?","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-04-19T18:41:02.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may take up to 2 days","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-04-21T16:24:27.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 weeks* :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SupernaturaLs","date":"2017-04-23T11:12:39.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MissaCat","date":"2017-04-23T06:08:39.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to know since i REALLY want the icon :) My friend already got it 2 days after sending hes gift. but i still havent got mine.
