Now I have to go through another game to maybe get 1 LP feelsbad, I know a lot of other people feel the same. I'm asking for 1 LP because if I lose this next game, I most likely will have to win 2 more games, knowing that I lose as much LP as I gain.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T22:19:35.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man, that's so unlucky! I wanted to reassure you that Riot has not joined the illuminati and are not involved in a conspiracy to keep you from entering promotions. While I cannot grant you the 1 LP you're asking for, I believe that with hard work and focus, you'll enter your promotions without a hitch. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
