It&#039;s like the SKT Alistar kept the wooden shield for his ult instead of the actualit&eacute;s SKT logos, it&#039;s kinda unfair for the poor Kalista... As it&#039;s not a 750 RP skin, I think it can be possible to have this little change before the live release.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-01T20:26:37.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey nyamou - \n\nThanks for the feedback!
