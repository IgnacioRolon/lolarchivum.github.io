I just don&#039;t even know what to think about what happens in those games now that I think about it. I almost never think, \"Wow, that guy is really good and just outplayed me.\" It&#039;s always just, \"0/7 Draven feeding Vayne, GG!\" This happens soo many times to me and it even gets to the point where I actually believe that the key to winning is the (insert percentage here) percent chance of actually getting someone on my team who can carry, or getting teammates who at least don&#039;t feed. This also seems to happen waaay less than 50% of the time. I like to think that in the year that I have been playing this game that I have improved, but it really seems that no progress is going on.  I think that whenever I lose it&#039;s just because of people like that Draven or whoever is feeding in the game that I am playing. Believing that I am perfect and that Draven is the only one who did wrong and not taking into account my own mistakes.\n\nBut the thing is, whenever I think that I understand that it is also MY fault, another game comes around and I&#039;m just blaming my team again. Like it&#039;s almost like it&#039;s hard-wired into my brain that I should just be blaming my team. But honestly it&#039;s so hard not to blame your team when they are 0/3 only 5 minutes into the game. It almost seems that they are so far ahead with those few kills that there was actually nothing in my power that I can do to stop them. Like sure, I can look at what I did wrong in the replay of the game, but what do I do about the things that the player who was actually doing the feeding did wrong? \n\nI&#039;ve entered a countless number of games with the first words of, \"At least try a *little* bit not to feed, please?\" Want to know what happened every single time I said that? We lost. Maybe 300 kill gold or however much gold they get isn&#039;t actually a lot, but I feel that whenever we see their score (3/0 by 5 minutes), we just instantly think, \"Oh, this games over.\" And I remember watching a video that was actually about Dota and it was talking about \"sudden defeat syndrome\", which is when your \"entire team just gives up\". I feel that if this happens to one person (ie, by feeding a vayne), then this will eventually spread throughout your entire team. (blah blah blah if you want to hear more ramble like this then just ask and I&#039;ll share some love)\n\nAnyways the main point here is that I always seem to blame my team even when deep inside I understand that I really shouldn&#039;t and that I don&#039;t want to be blaming them.","replies":[{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-08-31T08:40:32.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to just not say anything. Sometimes its just 1 small unlucky mistake or a bug that causes someone to die. I've had games where I feed FB to an invade and the team talks shit, so I go on tilt. Other games where I feed FB to an invade, people just laugh it off or say nothing, and then I come back more often than not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Floooooooooooops","date":"2015-08-31T07:15:56.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eat oranges be k{{summoner:4}} _away_","replies":[]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-08-31T03:55:54.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By never really relying or expecting things out of them.

Yes, you'll be blaming your team for loosing a teamfight, but don't forget you were a part of that team. If you're getting on your teammates for mistakes, don't forget to find your own.\n\nHonestly though, if you're gonna say something about what a player should and shouldn't be doing, please be considerate. You can inform those tanks on your team that they need to peel for you, but don't be a jerk about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2015-08-31T03:51:45.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think if you try to phrase it as a suggestion or an idea, its pretty hard for it to come accross as toxic.  Usually when you are bossing people around, they dont like it and it is a form of toxicity.\nThe other thing is if people dont follow your suggestion, or say no or whatver, just drop the subject.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-08-31T03:49:42.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me it's all a matter of focus.  When you're blaming your team you are focusing on the part they are playing, when you should really be focusing on the part you are playing.  Could you have done anything?  If yes you should focus on what could you have done, and how you can continue to apply that in the future.  If no, don't worry about it as it is out of your control.\n\nThe \"blame game\" is something hard wired into a lot of people, just keep in mind the only winning move is not to play.  It's not an easy thing to overcome, believe me, but it makes a whole lot of difference in the long run if you succeed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-08-31T03:34:53.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to blame your team.
