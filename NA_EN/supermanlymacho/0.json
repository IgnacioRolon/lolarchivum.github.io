After this new patch, all TFT games starts while i'm still on the loading screen. Then when the game comes up, i have like 2 seconds or less to pick a champ from the roulette, usually cannot. Anyone else experience this too? \r\n\r\nAnother bug that persists since previous patches is that sometimes some of the champs available to buy are bogus and cannot be purchased. You click, drag and nothing works so, you lose that champ. \r\n\r\nExtras/suggestions: How come noone complains about having Leona stun for so long?? 5/8/11 seconds is beyond broken.\r\n\r\nPlease add the option to change chat font size on TFT.\r\n\r\nAdd option to mute enemy pings (too many players spam this).\r\n\r\nThe Victory/Defeat animation is now broken, really low resolution.\r\n\r\nWe would love the ability to spectate TFT games too!\r\n\r\nThe item field could be arranged in a much more confortable way. I believe that the 5 gold urns space could be shrinked and moved up to allow a \r\nbigger and wider item field.\r\n\r\nTFT Match history/replays?\r\n\r\nFix the accidental pickup of pirate treasure box when going or coming from another player's field. Sometimes we want to leave the box untouched while stacking coins so we can pick it much later and complete the \"20 coins in a single round\" mission.\r\n\r\nThat's it for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcelia","date":"2019-08-03T12:46:59.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me.
