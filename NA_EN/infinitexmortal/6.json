If you have mmr to move up you should move up when hitting 100, if u have lower mmr you should move down when hitting 0. So why do i have to win 2/3 rigged games at 100 to move up or else drop to 68 lp?!\n\nI mean wtf riot. Before promos i win a game, win another game destroying the enemy so hard they cant take a tower. Then i get to promos with a free win, team cant take a single tower and feeds like crazy clearly outmatched. Next game Garen feeds 2 kills afks and the adc is ragging how they just lost the last 3 rounds and got demoted. Again no  tower taken..... I've seen enough of these promos to see that 9 times out of 10 they are far more in the enemy's favor than mine. And why if they are separate games from the 0-100 do they make you go back down to 68lp instead of 100 with a chance to win and retry them? At this point it is clearly obvious they only exist as a wall to slow down climbing in order to force people to play more games. That is poor game design and has nothing to do with an mmr based rank. \n\nSo i ask again, Riot, what is the point of these clearly onesided promos in an MMR based ranked system other than a cheap artificially forced wall to slow progressing rank and extend required play time?","replies":[{"poster":"Scottsc20","date":"2019-04-04T01:11:44.460+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":5,"body":"No one will ever convince me that promos aren't rigged.

If you match up two 1200 players against each other, the expected result is 0, or a 50/50 chance of winning for each of them. The actual result will be either +.5 or -.5, and that will be used when determining the new performance ratings.\n\nThe goal for the matchmaker is to get that expected result for all 10 players as close to 0 as possible. It doesn't care about winrates, it only cares about performance over time. If someone with a 10%wr is in your game, it's because their mmr was in the same neighborhood as you. There's no consideration for giving you worse players when you're in promos.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xhaiden","date":"2019-04-04T10:55:22.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=InfinitexMortal,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HT3liJXb,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-04-03T23:19:03.904+0000)\n>\n> Why in an mmr based system does this wall exist? If you have mmr to move up you should move up when hitting 100, if u have lower mmr you should move down when hitting 0. So why do i have to win 2/3 rigged games at 100 to move up or else drop to 68 lp?!\n> \n> I mean wtf riot. Before promos i win a game, win another game destroying the enemy so hard they cant take a tower. Then i get to promos with a free win, team cant take a single tower and feeds like crazy clearly outmatched. Next game Garen feeds 2 kills afks and the adc is ragging how they just lost the last 3 rounds and got demoted. Again no  tower taken..... I've seen enough of these promos to see that 9 times out of 10 they are far more in the enemy's favor than mine. And why if they are separate games from the 0-100 do they make you go back down to 68lp instead of 100 with a chance to win and retry them? At this point it is clearly obvious they only exist as a wall to slow down climbing in order to force people to play more games. That is poor game design and has nothing to do with an mmr based rank. \n> \n> So i ask again, Riot, what is the point of these clearly onesided promos in an MMR based ranked system other than a cheap artificially forced wall to slow progressing rank and extend required play time?\n\nTo STRUGGLE longer. This system  was made like this TO KEEP YOU STRUGGLING LONGER AND LONGER (so you spend 10x times longer in LoL).  You argue about quality content - but this system is mainly about \"QUANTITY  (keeping  most players trapped in LoL grinding and grinding for as long as possible) \".  There's literally thousands of topics where balance/mmr/matchmaking is question for being so faulty - and yet, this was the most ignored subject of all time. A mmr system made just for 0.00001% of the whole LoL community (since only top tier players from Challenger, Master and the higher division of diamond - seem to claim it works for them). Same as  you get easy wins - due to such poorly matchmaking - same you get impossible games - where the game is already lost since champ select. You're just wasting time and loosing and loosing and losing (again, impossible games) - then winning and wining and wining (free wins - where the enemy team is in your shoes dealing with close to impossible chances of win). And  that's the idea... Same as gambling systems - aimed  to keep you hooked to that experience - by exploiting  the reward system in our brain  (the release of dopamine whenever you win a game). \n\nJust think about all the games you played in Rank recently and out of 100 games -  how many games did both teams really struggled for a Win - due to being balanced?  🤨","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarameI Frappe","date":"2019-04-04T04:23:43.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cause they want you to grind since it'll mean you'll be continuing to play their game?

That may have been the catalyst, and it sounds like it was a mistake, but you didn't get the restriction from that alone. You get punished after multiple reports spanning multiple games. \n\nThat begs the question, however... If you got reported in that game for self deprecation, were the other flags raised due to similar behavior? If so, that's pretty ridiculous, and is a prime example of their \"punish first\" system which relies 100% on automated garbage. Self deprecation exemplifies why their system fails so miserably... You can definitely get flagged for playing as Sona and saying \"wow this Sona is trash\", meanwhile someone who trolls all their games will go largely unpunished, because they don't want to ban someone who is legitimately trying yet plays poorly. All a troll has to do is refrain from chatting while trolling. \"TK grabbed you and walked you into the enemy team?
