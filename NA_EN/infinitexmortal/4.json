Once it’s travelling she can’t move it in the air, so just take a few steps back.\n\nA GOOD Zoe will cast this over walls with her ult. \nLiterally just move to the side.  It has a low detonation radius so if you’re even a little bit off it won’t hit.\n\n\nIf you get E’d, well then you deserve  the horrible 1000 damage at level 6.\n\nAnd also: in order to do max damage the Q needs to travel a VERY long distance. Basically a cast directly behind you, plus flash plus an ult forward then recasting it for like 2000 units of movement. I’ve tried it out.","replies":[]}]}
