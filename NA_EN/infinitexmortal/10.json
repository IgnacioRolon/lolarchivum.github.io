HE IS BROKEN NOW. Any player beyond the skill of a bronze 5 gets 2 kills with him the game is over. He already has the strongest basic ability in the game and retarded amount of crit dmg and you keep buffing him? The new items were a buff to yas not a nerf he did not need extra help. Learn to balance your damn game. you already ruined botlane making it so bruisers are more viable in bot than adcs and u go and buff the most cancer champ in the game who was already buffed from the adc changes??? \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"OniZetsu666","date":"2018-06-20T23:03:01.958+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Yas is just too damn forgiving with his kit.

I was so far behind and i thought i threw the whole game, no one else did anything either. I then got 2 fucking items, got caught in the jungle, then 1v4 quadra. like REALLY, WTF is that?!?!? That should NOT be a thing!!! i SUCK at yas, he's one of my worst champs... and i can still 1v4 quad, he's just kinds BS...\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/27a34791e80346d80c44fdb4ae424812\nBest i got as proof, this was a while ago","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-06-21T00:31:19.031+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's a Champion that has every advantage in the game in his Kit.\n Zero Counterplay.\n The People who play him become dependent on the absolute Bullshit  in his Kit that they Lose the Basic Game knowledge to play anything else","replies":[{"poster":"Hencho101","date":"2018-06-21T18:06:51.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean that getting:\n• 100% crit off 2 items\n• A shield for playing the damn game and moving\n• An ability to to make marksman useless\n• Mobility out the ass\n• CC\n• Short cooldowns\n• One of, if not THE best level 2 in the game\n• Free armor pen\n\nIsn't good champion design?
