Having your ult not working over multiple patches/being completely ignored is getting terrible.\r\n\r\nThis bug can happen 3-4 times a game easily - to the point I don&#039;t even think the original bug fix was tested (How long did the original fix take a year?) as almost every single Brand main noticed it in there first game/takes no special way to recreate.\r\n\r\nI know Brands not a popular Champ - but Champ breaking bugs should be a top priority. Rather then see another twenty topics over the next month being completely ignored/can we get anyone to at-least address your aware/care?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-04T18:15:04.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nSo, this definitely isn't in the realm of skins, so I don't have a ton of context here, but wanted to pop in and let you know that I've gone ahead and checked the status of this issue.\n\nIt's a known issue on our end. It appears that it'll be resolved in patch 6.3 if all goes according to plan!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wickedfates","date":"2016-02-04T18:19:31.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well there ya go, a riot comment first post =^D\n\nthat being said, i think it has come up before now, and they have been aware, thats why the fix is coming out.... did u search the forums first? im just curious\nsome more, cuz brand is important:\n\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/6EHfFXFI-does-riot-not-care-about-brand?comment=0002","replies":[]}]}
