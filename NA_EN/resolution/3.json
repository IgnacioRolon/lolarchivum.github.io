Meanwhile, he can't sustain you beyond whatever Relic Shield is giving, he can't peel, he can't snare. He can only poke, in such a way that may steal CS, and in such a way that likely won't do much damage at all since he's underfed. \n\nThe whole point of Zed is to get fed, snowball, and rapidly eliminate enemy carries.

He is doing for the sake of \"fun\" and \"trying something different\", and that someone approves of it. Sure, they'll lose, but no rules are broken. In lane he may feed from failure of dodging skillshots, but afterwards he actually *tries* to stop dying. That's not trolling.

What's the reason? It can either be \"you took my role\", \"I just feel like it\", anything that promotes \"I want to make sure you guys are mad/angry/tilted/whatever\". Absolutely no incentives of trying to win, or obvious signs of trying to lose, such as purposely walking in to feed. After lane? AFK, or just giving up. If that's not trolling then I don't know what to say otherwise.\n\nTLDR approval of others and the purpose of playing all matters. Just because something is \"off-meta\", that doesn't mean it is \"troll\". Same goes vice-versa, if anything.

Not sure about Vlad now, but he used to combo with Jhin.\n\nYou're welcome to disagree with me, but do you really think these were \"terrible\" examples?\n\nSince when is \"offensive AD support\" a thing? Poking is ideally from as far a range as possible. Garen needs to be in melee to effectively lane-bully, and doesn't close that gap well. He lacks any slowing capability, which means that he doesn't help his ADC engage. As support, he'll be underfed, which makes his potential to bully the lane significantly worse than it might be at Top. And if you go full tanky with him, his offensive impact will be negligible. Tank supports are a thing, of course, but they're usually characterized by CC, gap closers, sustain, etc. Garen has none of that. \n\nRegarding Vlad, I was referring to his post-rework. Much (most?) of his damage comes from his AoE E ability, which happens to be a great wave clear tool when you're playing him at top, but not exactly something you want a support firing off bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-08-01T06:52:27.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only trolling/griefing if you're intentionally ruining the lane/game for your teammates.

It's one thing to pick a champ that isn't traditionally support, like Amumu, Kayle, or various other AP poke-mages, with the expectation that you can still fit the support role. But I honestly don't know how somebody could pick Garen support with good intentions.","replies":[{"poster":"ReshiKillim","date":"2016-08-01T07:12:23.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be done, depending on how you play it and who you're up against. There's a lot of things that can be done with the support role, one of which is a Garen meat shield for the ADC (against someone like Ezreal).\n\nAny champion can be played as a support without it being trolling, just like any champion can jungle. Doesn't make it a good or smart pick, but it's not trolling. Although I would be pretty upset if someone took Garen support in ranked, as long as they play the role they called properly I've got no problems with it.\n\nIt's been stated by Rioters on several occasions, that you can't be banned for off-meta/unconventional picks (Like tank Akali was at first considered to be trolling). \n\nI'd definitely say that things like Garen, Jax, or other champs not usually picked in the botlane aren't supports I'd like to have in ranked as I wouldn't have any idea whether or not they'd do well or do badly.\n\nSome of my personal favorites to take as a support, are Kha'zix and Shaco. Definitely not great in the botlane, makes it a lot harder to pull off good plays, but doesn't mean it's not viable nor does it mean the player is trolling.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"moonborn","date":"2016-08-01T08:01:06.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i doubt whether support team had this confirmed.\nnormally from what i read from countless posts from riot they made clear that nobody can be banned for building different items or picking one or another champion that \"is not supposed to be there\". you can go soraka mid and you are fine. or karthus support.\nyou also don't even have to build a sightstone if you don't want to(which is a bit selfish but it's your call).","replies":[{"poster":"Crossette","date":"2016-08-01T13:15:34.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He posted this.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/8PXRZ\n\nThis is more from trying dumb shit in ranked and not talking to the team about picks, it's like the rush of people that are going to first pick Kled without knowing what the fuck they're doing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-08-01T12:56:57.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game against Ekko support as Bard.
