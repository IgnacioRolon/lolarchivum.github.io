I have played this game for 8years and I will not stop. My favorite gamemode is just normal summoners rift when I play alone but when I play with my friends there's nothing better than good old 3v3. \r\nI kid you not, I love 3v3 just as much. Me and my friends always play it around autumn time because the theme is so fitting. I love the variety as well. \r\nAnd to see that this gamemode will be gone just like dominion is no more...makes me just really sad. \r\nThis is a fast and nice gamemode and adds variety to the game, leaving me refreshed and wanting to play more of 5v5 and 3v3. It's also a place where I have so much fun with my friends. \r\n\r\nPlease do not remove 3v3 Riot Games. \r\n{{item:3104}} {{item:3070}} \r\nI never write, I don't complain but now I hope my voice is heard, Save Twisted Treeline! \r\n\r\nPlease keep a part of the Leauge of Legends that I love. {{item:3170}}","replies":[{"poster":"Padoµch","date":"2019-09-03T09:58:02.398+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":2,"body":"They wont listen, they dont care about people playing it at all.

The Dominion community used to hold tournaments and everything. Back in the day, there were even a few games with competitive SR players pitted against top Dominion players. The removal of the forums and \"Maps % Modes\" just really killed any kind of constructive discussion anyone could have about alternative game modes to Summoner's Rift. \n\nRiot went out of their way to make sure no one would be interested in Dominion before they removed it. 3v3's treatment hasn't been much different, from little things like not including missions, champion mastery and so forth, to near complete neglect in terms of upkeep.

The number of players actually isn't high enough to keep the game mode; that's why Riot isn't keeping it. It's around 1% in Brazil and virtually nothing in Korea.\n\nhttps://dotesports-media.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/11095139/gamemodestats.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lrrr Omicronian","date":"2019-09-04T03:32:53.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MQriNVEw,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2019-09-03T17:23:31.321+0000)\n>\n> It only has a 2.5% play rate - and that's in NA, the region where it's played the most.\n\nThat's A LOT OF PEOPLE.

Giving it a normal draft would make it even better and that would take basically no time and money to do that. Instead of working on Twisted Treeline they decide to make TFT a permanent game type. I personally think auto chess sucks ass. It is a boring, minimal interactive game type and will definitely end up dying soon.\nWhat happened to Nexus Blitz? That was a very fun game mode with a bunch of random mini games, and the time it took to complete a game was way shorter than a SR match. Or why not make URF a permanent game type?
