Ekko's early clears end up taking forever if he goes tank, but end up being extremely dangerous if he goes AP. Fizz has the same issue, except that not only does he not have good survivability in jg, but he cannot reliably gank until 6. This is also true with Kayle and Ekko to some extent considering how difficult it can be to judge how the enemy laner will react when W is placed. Fiddle cannot kite jg camps, and only has 1 damage ability that isn't a channel, and Nid is so heavily based on single target elimination that camps like raptors and krugs screw her entire clear over. If she needs to heal, she must go into her human form, which has no AOE abilities, hindering her clear.
