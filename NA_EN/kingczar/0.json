It's just preferable.\n* **Double top**: He wants to go top. You want to go top. So do it. You think split exp sucks? Yes, it does. That's strategy. You end up taking another role to save split exp? Fine, you made your best judgment. He made his WHATEVER judgement. No emotions to it. It's rando queue. You get random results. Duh.\n* **Strategic choices you don't agree with**: Welcome to the world of people that aren't you. It's out there. It's not that hard to find, it includes EVERYONE. Well, except you of course. \n* **\"Auto-locking\" (Why is this still a term)**: It doesn't matter whether you take 1 second to lock, or 10 seconds to lock. It takes the exact same sequence of actions, and therefore is the exact same thing. Whether you feel like passing your champ choice by your team or not is up to you. It's your pick, your choice. If Rito wants to get around to having democratic votes on these things, I'm sure they'll add that feature some day. I wouldn't hold your breath though.\n* **Proxy farming**: Someone thinks the wave clear and gold farming will outweigh the disadvantages of repeated deaths as singed? Maybe they're wrong, maybe they're right. Maybe they're stupid. Maybe it doesn't matter because it's their call, not yours. Stop acting shocked at rando tactics. Stop comparing proxy farmers to people who repeatedly walk into the enemy team, stand still, and wait to die while spamming \"end the game please\".\n\nThings that ARE bannable:\n\n* **Immediately harassing someone for ignoring role calls**: Your allies don't even have to HAVE roles! IT AINT LAW! They can go soraka and jungle/roam/farm botlane for all anyone cares. You think those tactics are unbearable? (I mean, they really do suck...) Then why are you still queueing in randoms? Go get a ranked team together.\n* **Continuing to harass players for not following nonexistent rules after game starts.**\n* **Continuing to harass players for harassing you back:** \"He started it\" is something most people grow out of in kindergarden (or so I've been told, but the internet leaves me doubting.)\n* **Using the word \"report\" and THEN harassing players**: NOOOO, that doesn't give an \"official air\" to follow-up \"troll\" insults, and therefore it does NOT nullify the toxicity of said \"troll\" comments.\n* **Basically... harrassing ANYONE EVER**: Yes, you thought it was just people you sort of liked. Or people that were nice. But no, you are legitimately not suppose to harass people IN GENERAL. \n* **Cussing on forums** (probably, I'm just wagering. You may get banned here too.)\n\nExtremely obvious things that every League player should understand by default, but many refuse to:\n\n* **You prefer predictable champ-select outcomes that are agreeable to you?** Get a team together of peeps with predictable champ-select behaviors that are agreeable to you.\n* **You have emotions?** Great. Use them on something other than people not doing exactly what you want them to do in a videogame. You were already ticked before your allies started replying with things you found offensive. If they started first, fine, report them and ignore them.\n* **Does the negativity bother you?** Well... now you know how you come off to other people.\n* **Does anyone expect you to turn off your emotions?** No, they expect you to use the mute button. Hold tab, mouse over, click, done. If you're genuinely pissed at people's chat, you get rid of it. No one fans a flame with a diesel-soaked towel while crying \"WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSE TO DO, IT BURNS!\" expecting people to understand what on earth is being said. You responding to offensive chat with offensive chat, that's flame-fanning. It's also flaming. STAHP IT.\n\nSomeone add this breakdown to a sticky-thread for all future web-ragers to go through, please.
