That doesn't mean that you go up them one at a time for each time you receive a punishment.\nIf your behavior exhibits enough toxicity to warrant it you can go from just chat restrictions or a small ban to being permabanned right out. In this case it's obvious that you were toxic (very toxic at that) in the majority of the game in three games consistently. Doesn't matter what your team did or say, you are responsible for your actions and what you say.","replies":[]}]}
