Please, enlighten me on how you possibly find that to be enjoyable in any form of sensical matter because I&#039;m really scratching my ass trying to understand that. \n\nI don&#039;t have time to wait for the game to drag out another 8-10 minutes because you&#039;re &quot;having fun&quot; dying literally over and over, and to the point where I cannot even play the game. I get a large player base are filled with children because it&#039;s a game and they have no sense of trying to get a job, but when I work 45 hours a week, I&#039;d like to at least play a game that is reasonably balanced, not a fucking slaughterhouse. \n\nSo please, stop playing the act of a terrorist who is holding everyone else hostage on your team because you&#039;re &quot;having fun&quot; when clearly everyone else but your duo queue isn&#039;t. It&#039;s unbelievably frustrating.","replies":[]}
