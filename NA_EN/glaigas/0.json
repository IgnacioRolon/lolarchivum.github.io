An added quest for 5 points before Saturday would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-17T16:24:40.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player support isn't able to modify the game like this, but I hear your plea.  I'm not sure there's much we can do here, as the missions and the pass try and offer a healthy amount of tokens.  We do like to review each case individually, though, so if you don't have enough by the end of the event hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).  I can't make any guarantees, but the feedback is good and it's worth taking a look with you directly.","replies":[{"poster":"glaigas","date":"2017-10-17T16:28:33.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, hopefully i can sneak some games in on the job :D !","replies":[]}]}]}
