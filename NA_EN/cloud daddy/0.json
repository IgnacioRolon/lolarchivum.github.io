As if I had stopped mid-breath, and then held my lungs cruelly waiting. My mouth open, throat hollow, unable to pull in air. My chest, the horrible tension on my thorax.\r\n\r\nMy limbs and muscles refuse to move. I cannot**_ breath_**. I am choking. The pressure builds. The stillness spreads to my chest and limbs. I want to scream, to tear at my face, to wail&mdash;but I am trapped. I cannot move. I cannot move&quot;\r\n\r\nLike come on riot, less than 10 lines in and you already can&#039;t spell the word breathe? I mean you&#039;ve already used breath twice, at that rate you should know the difference. This is what editors are for, jesus. Multi-million dollar company can&#039;t even proof read their shorts.","replies":[{"poster":"nuclearwarpotato","date":"2018-06-26T21:18:13.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHHHHHHHHHH SLIGHT SPELLING MISTAKE WTF RITO TERRIBLE COMPANY AHHHHH LEAGUE IS DYING AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-26T21:48:17.053+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, this made me actu-lol.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-26T21:43:59.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for highlighting! This was tagged for correction at the QA stage of being prepared for Universe, but for some reason it hasn't been changed.\n\nThe version that the editors handed over was correct. I'm not sure how/where little typos like this creep in - I guess it's something to do with translating into 20+ languages in 5 days?
