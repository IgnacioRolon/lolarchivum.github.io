Teams aren't ready to except a sniper on their team. People want ganks, not for the enemy laner to be terrified of the jungler- to the point that they literally won't go past the half way point ;D. Yep, snipes that good.

Her q is really neat, but it isn't strictly part of her damage potential in a fight. It's a meh tier poke that functions more as a scouting tool than as a ranged attack.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2014-12-13T05:10:19.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I plan on trying AP Rek'Sai when I eventually get her in ARAM, but no one will really use that build on the other maps for anything but an experiment.","replies":[]}]}]}
