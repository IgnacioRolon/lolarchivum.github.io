Or those that cannot play with volume settings? (I for one rarely use sound because it interferes with either the music I'm playing OR is too loud for my family and my headset is missing). I don't think this would create an unfair advantage. I do, however, think it should be a very short indicator so that it can't be used just because you weren't listening for the sound and needed a second indicator.

Being deaf basically takes away half of the gameplay, since  sound effects not only are indicators, but also include regular game sound, like the announcer, background music, and champion lines (yes, I listen to those).  As a result, giving deaf players visual options to make up for the sound effects they cannot hear - at the very least, the sound effects that impact gameplay - is a step Riot definitely should take.\n\nAbout 1 in 20 people (I'm no expert on statistics, but I believe this is about right) have some form of hearing loss, ranging from mild to profoundly deaf, and tens of millions of people - possibly hundreds of millions now - play League (in 2014, 27 million people were reporting playing _per day_, and that was 3 years ago).  So, it stands to reason that there are at least a significant number of deaf players in League, and therefore Riot should create visual options to replace the sound effects they cannot hear.  As Kerkoc said, disabling the sound when the visual indicators are activated is a fair tradeoff, so the combination of the two doesn't become an unfair advantage to hearing players.\n\nThis is a gameplay update I personally believe Riot should implement, and I hope that someday they will implement it.  After all, they have color-blind options, so surely the next step is to cater to the deaf player base, and improve their League experience.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-11-14T17:38:50.545+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^\n\nI agree 100%.\n\nI am not deaf myself but I sympathize greatly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ventra117","date":"2017-11-13T20:38:56.255+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a great idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian Vulpix","date":"2017-11-13T22:22:34.506+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The word COWWWWAAAARDS! should appear whenever Sion ults, with larger font sizes when he's closer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2017-11-14T16:24:50.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"I would say no.

This sort of specific information could be easily exploited and would take more resources to apply to every ability. Furthermore in the case of piercing abilities (Yasuo tornado) designing a visual cue to say \"you hit something\" could turn into \"you hit something **here**\" or make you **think** that's what i means. This could affect clarity when paired up with other aspects of the game. \n\n>\"...or even just players who don&#x27;t have the in-game sound on too much. Many hearing players put on music or play in loud environments, so having these visual aids would benefit everyone, not only deaf players. \"\n\nOkay, let me first say I don't dislike the idea. I do, but it has a big problem. Specifically tacking into account that league in it's core is a competitive game having visual aids for sound cues could be exploited. Those who are deaf would have a better experience because they'd be able to perform better but those who aren't deaf would also perform better with the added info. \n\nThe option would be to simply make it a toggle as many others have mentioned here. You can either hear the sounds or see them. Sadly there are those who are not 100% deaf and can hear somewhat. I would dare to say those would enjoy to hear what they can from their games especially with the unique VOs some skins get and such; harder to appreciate but it's still enjoyable. Having to compromise to have a better edge could feel bad.\n\nAll this said I guess the option would be to be able to submit something to validate how deaf you are and be given access to enable the visual sound queues. Given how Riot adds new settings and toggles to preferences (like the arcade \"accent\" in SR) it would be easy to hide/show it per account. \n\n>\"Seeing how League has one of the largest playerbases out of any video game in the world, it&#x27;s for certain that there are thousands of players with disabilities who play League. If there is a way to convey the full experience to them as well, they deserve to have it.\n\nAgreed, despite my bitter sweet relationship with League I can't deny how huge it is.

Riot already made this mistake accidentally with certain skins, such as with Zombie Brand, whose change in animation could be used to detect invisible units. This is why I think it would be important to design cues that specifically _don't_ convey more information than they should, and why it would help to design a methodology for this. In the end, however, I still think this is completely feasible: in the case of an impact cue, for example, having some sort of non-directional screen tint or flash, or something similar on the ability icon or champion itself, could potentially convey impact, even multiple impacts, without revealing any more information than would the equivalent sound cue.\n\nUltimately, while the competitive integrity of League is something that needs to be preserved, I do not think that really goes against providing services to players with disabilities. Colorblind support is widely accepted, for example, and isn't seen as an unfair competitive advantage. Even without going into the nitty-gritty of impact cues, global quotes and whatnot, something as simple as subtitles for champion soundbites (or just quotes added directly to the chat feed, visible only to them) could already provide an immense improvement to the enjoyment of deaf players, who currently have no real way of experiencing a champion's in-game personality outside of their look.","replies":[{"poster":"Mushkai","date":"2017-11-15T01:22:57.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, thank you. ^^\n\nI pointed out the competitive aspect because from what I glanced there weren't many posts about it.
