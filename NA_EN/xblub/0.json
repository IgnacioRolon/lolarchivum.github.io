Diamond 5. Ed of the season and actually im really happy about it. But there is 1 Problem which I cant deal with. Everytime im playing normal with friends (silver/gold) i get matched with other silvers obviously. In my opinion, to play normal is training or testing new champs. So i played Gangplank for the 2 time in my whole life. Obiously after 10 secs (like seriously every single game) someone of enemy team opens the all chat \"Why do we get matched with Diamond\" and Im thinking evey single Game \"hell, deal with it instead of crying or at least try to improve, to become better\" Im really annoyed of this, cant play normals anymore cause the flame is damn insane. well wasnt the whole story yet. I left my Lane 0 2 0 cause of 2 ganks by nocturne. I started to just farm to get my Items ( actually this is what Gp has to do, isnt it?) and I made it in the end of the game to the highest farm and 8 5 3 stats. Here is the worse part of this community: In endscreen ( I lost) the renekton asked me if I am elo boosted or something, cause I did bad in his opinion or w/e. I told him that I just tried out a new champ and that im actually Mid-main. His answere was \"dude, u are diamond\"\r\nand here is my Point. DIAMONDS ARE NOT GODS. WE DO MISTAKES. WE FAIL. AND WE LOOSE.  (sorry for caps I have to make a point)\r\nBut seriously, there is a reason why we are in Diamond, there is a reason why u arent be in Diamond. And U DO NOT deserve Challenger and we are not eloboosted or ebay accounts only cause u killed us ONE TIME.  this is not in an offensive way but pls. If u think someone high elo is bad keep it in ur mind or use ur adventage and rape him or w/e but dont annoy us so god damn hard with ur trashtalking every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Chronobre4k","date":"2015-11-08T16:59:13.333+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's pretty easy to fall into the mindset that diamond-tier players are these sort of _gods_ just because for some of us, that kind of skill seems so far out of reach.

I see plat support mains in my normal games playing solo lanes and probably half the time they do really poorly because an assassin mid or something is really different than a tank support. Personally I would probably get stomped as ADC all the way to bronze ELO games.

D5/P1 players have a big advantage over gold players, but not as much over a P3 player probably bc the elo/mmr gap is probably half if not more than that in difference. I played a second account to solo and see if I could get to gold w/out duo or if I got carried, and it was bronze to start where I could pick up something similar to stuff I play (maokai in the game I'm thinking of) and still do really well, but when I hit mid silver I couldn't do that any more really. If it's high silver and GP is really different or you haven't played w/ him/vs him much (which would make sense given he's on perma ban) then you may have just an okay game instead of really strong, but vs low silver many P1/D5 players I've seen/played w/ can stomp even w/ something they aren't used to bc there are many basics that people get wrong at lower ranks such as judging damage in trades (so the higher elo player can figure out from a few trades how the match up is and then use that to win and get kills while the lower elo player didn't learn much from the first trades).\n\nOf course that's all assuming that the higher elo player isn't solely a 1 trick who was mechanics based.

If you hear \"God, you're (below plat, and sometimes plat too). You fucking suck at this game, you just need to git gud if you want to improve (no advice on improving, just don't suck so much).\" all the time than when you have someone who is perceived as being part of the group saying that and they don't stomp you there is a lot of misdirected animosity. I think there needs to be more understanding that high elo players tend to main certain roles or champs and be great at them, but not at the whole game necessarily, but there also needs to be more understanding that being at the 50% mark for a community doesn't make you complete shit and pointless.\n\nTexas doesn't have the best education in the US, but my high school was top 10/top 5 in the state, I started college on a full ride academic scholarship despite not being in the top 1/3rd of my graduating class (then transferred schools junior year), and although the university I graduated from wasn't a top school I graduated w/ honors while working a full time job, and attended an ed psych program at UT that is top 10 in the country where I got my masters. It took me a little while to learn to not be a prick about being smart, but by the time I was finishing my masters I had an appreciation for what those top 1% and .5% of academics look like and I stopped being a prick to people w/ an average education. I found that to be pretty true for most of the people I studied w/ and so I'm always kind of surprised when it isn't just gold players insulting silver and bronze bc they don't understand how big the gap to the top is, but diamond + players often being really rude instead of encouraging improvement in lower elo players. You guys know how big the gap really is and can explain that a bit of improvement will go a long way toward moving up, and sometimes I see high elo players saying that, but often it's just really insulting stuff. I think when people see that it's easier to remember the rude players instead of the nice ones and so that frustration gets taken out on guys like you who seem to be nice and pretty chill w/ low elo players (not all \"lick my boots scrub I'm fucking better than you\"). Not sure if that makes it any better to put it in that perspective, but I think it's something that's always going to be there as long as the community takes such an abrasive approach to dealing w/ players below their own rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2015-11-09T19:16:51.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=T RexHasTinyArms,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=s0LtqEmJ,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2015-11-08T19:23:28.143+0000)\n>\n> I think there's sort of two parts to it.

If the account is boosted, it means it has diamond/plat elo, you won't be playing with them at the first place. Seriously people never learn how matchmaking works? Well, I don't really understand it fully since I'm not a Rioter afterall. I got matched with a lot of plat and diamonds (while I'm actually only Silver 4 this season, I don't really climb or play ranked that much), IMO I think this is probably happening if that diamond/plat player is queuing with his/her unranked/lower rank friends. I do found out that they are duoing, I've met a plat player duoing with his unranked friend, therefore I got matched with them, pretty obvious. \n\nIf that diamond/plat player is actually NOT queuing together (solo), means that your elo just somehow reached them, (or their elo is the one who dropped, but it's really rare). Boosted accounts elo will drop sooner or later anyway, they won't stay there for long, since loosing games will lower your elo bits by bits, if the account owner can't cope with the elo. \n\nAren't you suppose to be happy about it? I got really happy getting matched with diamonds or plats, and it actually gives me motivation to play ranked and climb. Sadly I didn't have enough time to climb and I prioritize having fun in normals instead :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kwon Ri Sae","date":"2015-11-09T05:53:57.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with this.

If i won against a diamond i wouldn't say anything (i have before actually i remember she was an ahri) but the second they mention \"cant believe i lost to garbage tier\" or something like that it just goes out the window.

When we see Diamond, or even plat for that matter, we are WELL aware that this guy must be really good at the game, since we can't even get out of bronze or silver, and they managed to pass gold. But the thing is, we don't always know WHY. So we just assume everything is the problem. Some it might just be map awareness, some it might be mechanics, but we don't always know for sure, and assume because its everything, you have great control over everything in the game. So when we do manage to ever outplay or get a kill on a Diamond or Plat, we still don't understand the fact that A. People make mistakes and B. Plats, nor Diamonds, are invincible and all-knowing. We get mad, because we assume automatically that was what we lacked in, and thats how you all got to plat+. That about, imo, sums up why bronzies and silver medals act like that sometimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spacesuit Spiff","date":"2015-11-09T00:07:49.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im d4 and i routinely get dumpstered by silvers when i try to play top in norms.
