I tried the support forum to submit a ticket but i always got an error when i tried to log in. I sent an e-mail on one of Riots e-mails you get when they give you a receipt when you purchase stuff and i am still waiting for a response.\r\n\r\nThis is the ban message i got:\r\nGame 1\r\nDark Reaper142: Akali is a top laner champ too\r\nDark Reaper142: gj\r\nDark Reaper142: reason?\r\nDark Reaper142: no ss\r\nDark Reaper142: no nothing\r\nDark Reaper142: our jg is afk\r\nDark Reaper142: gj\r\nDark Reaper142: surr 15 plz\r\nDark Reaper142: then come help\r\nDark Reaper142: Dude i just asked you to help\r\nDark Reaper142: And you are going to tell me to kys\r\nDark Reaper142: You have my report too buddy\r\nDark Reaper142: Enjoy your suspension\r\nDark Reaper142: Report our Karm, he is raging for no reason and telling us to kys and using hate speech\r\nDark Reaper142: thank you\r\nDark Reaper142: ok\r\nDark Reaper142: np man\r\nDark Reaper142: go back to base\r\n\r\nI would i assume the reason i got banned was when i said &quot;kys&quot; but as you can see i just repeated the words of a toxic teammate that was flaming as for no reason because we asked him to help us. So yeah i don&#039;t know what else to try or if my account can get unbaned. It is also a bit sad cuz that day i bought 4 skins that i wanted and now i can&#039;t play with them :(\r\n\r\nI also want to add that before i got the perma ban, a month before i got a 15 day suspension on my account which i deserved :P \r\n\r\nIf you have any thoughts please post them i would really appreciate the help. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Just the Lip","date":"2018-05-24T06:38:51.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"asking for reports on a player is also against the rules, which is stupid, cause u have a afk on purpose, or a inting player, of course ur gonna want to ask for reports so u dont have to play with them again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ekitaih","date":"2018-05-24T06:41:32.019+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HellawhiteIII,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=AFUJNjmK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-05-24T06:38:51.275+0000)\n>\n> asking for reports on a player is also against the rules, which is stupid, cause u have a afk on purpose, or a inting player, of course ur gonna want to ask for reports so u dont have to play with them again.\n\nAlthough asking for reports is illogical because it only takes 1 report to flag the game. \n1 report = 9 reports. \nBut I gather that it was the use of “kys.” It’s kind of silly to repeat something you’re going to report someone for, IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Reaper142","date":"2018-05-24T07:19:25.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh with you yeah it is kind of silly that i repeated that, i could just report it and be done with it.

It only takes mild toxicity to get banned after the 14 day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Reaper142","date":"2018-05-24T09:00:41.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it was not recent it was like 1 and a half months ago, but that suspension was deserved because i did hardcore rage back then.

In game time is all that matters. You have to play an appropriate amount of games without any toxicity before you can be considered reformed and have a lower punishment. Don’t ask me how many games, I just know that if you get a 14 day ban, take a year off from League then come back and immediately flame someone, you’ll get that hardcore perma.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Reaper142","date":"2018-05-24T07:22:18.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My thoughts exactly man!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-05-24T06:43:17.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"After you get a 14 day suspension your account is on thin ice and the next game you are reported in with any level of toxicity gets you a permaban. At this time you should be on your absolute best behavior, saying only positive or helpful things or nothing at all.\n\nThat said, in these logs you were negative (asking to surrender at 15 instead of just staying quiet and throwing the surrender vote out there) and you harassed your team (asking for reports and taunting him with the threat of suspension).\n\nI would definately say that yohr punishment was deserved if this is the behavior you show just a month after being told your next punishment is a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Reaper142","date":"2018-05-24T07:10:25.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The surrender 15 tbh with you yes it was on a rage moment so yeah that can be a foul. But for the asking to report part i did, i am just letting the enemy team know that we have a rager and a toxic player that needs a report i did not force anyone to do the report, if they wanted they can report him if they don't it's ok. Also i want to add that almost all of the team i was playing (before jg was afk, which he as a cool guy) were arguing and saying that they will report him. After the 15 day suspension my behavior was 10 times better than before, but yeah i had 1 or 2 times a bit of rage like: (what are you doing you idiot, fuck this shit etc etc) the hardcore rage i had was long gone and i am being 100% honest with you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nankyoku","date":"2018-05-24T09:18:15.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"People who say this was a permabam because of the toxicity and not because of the dumb AI bot flagging \"kys\" -even if you didn't say it- need to drink a cold cup of coffee and wake up.\n\nLevel 4 honor player here who never flames (though I used to many years ago), I'd report you for this chat but this does not deserve a permaban in any way.
