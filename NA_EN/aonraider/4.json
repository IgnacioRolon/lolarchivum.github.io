Wouldn't mind bouncing thoughts and ideas off you sometime if you would like.  \n\nPlaystyle is a big thing when I play him botlane.  Being mindful of your position and knowing when to let minions die to avoid unfavorable trades is by far the largest hurdle I've had to work with.  Aside from that I'd say knowing exactly what your support can provide to you is the second most important thing to learn as you go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2016-09-04T03:34:46.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play him bot.
