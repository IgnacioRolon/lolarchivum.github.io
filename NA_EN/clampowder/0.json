He had bought the new chroma skin \r\n&quot;Which I found out later into the game&quot;\r\nIn the loading screen, His splash art was just the normal Teemo Splash instead of cotton tail splash. But his champions name was Cotton Tail Teemo but not Blue Cotton Tail Teemo &quot;Or Whatever his blue version is&quot;\r\nIts obviously got to do with the new chroma skin.\r\nI attempted to get screen shots but I&#039;m not sure what the key for screen shots is...\r\nNot sure why it happened or if it&#039;s a one time thing. I am broke so I wouldn&#039;t be able to test it but maybe someone who does own the new chroma can test it in a custom skin. \r\n\r\nI will visit this post whenever I have time to answer any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-07T22:23:30.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was an issue on out end, but it should be resolved with the next patch!","replies":[]}]}
