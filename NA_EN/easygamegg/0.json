You were super passive aggressive and you repeatedly accused others of trolling. That's definitely negative. And I'm sure it was in response to somebody being an asshole to you or ignoring you, but that doesn't magically absolve you from responsibility for your actions. Riot expects us all to make the choice to not make situations worse by retaliating.\n\nAccusing others of trolling or griefing in chat will usually just make them troll or grief more, and if for some reason they aren't a troll or a griefer then it will just make an innocent person miserable and make them want to ignore you and not help you even more. So no matter whether they are genuinely trolling or just an idiot it's never going to work out in your favor if you flame them.\n\nIt's a chat restriction, not the end of the world. Chill out and learn from your mistakes.\n\nTo give you an opportunity to learn, here's a list of the things you did in that chat which likely could have triggered a punishment:\n\n* \"do we not have a jg\"\n* \"griefer\"\n* \"keep griefing\"\n* \"kids\"\n* \"afk more\"\n\nAdditionally I don't recommend you waste your time with purchased accounts, they will be caught and punished. And Riot won't notice or care. All you'd accomplish is hurting random strangers that had nothing to do with your punishment. Your anger is a lot less righteous if you do scummy things in retaliation for being made angry.\n\nLastly, your admission of intent to do this has already been recorded by Riot so they are aware that this account's owner bears ill will towards the game and it's players. If they catch you on other accounts you may see them punish this account as well. They have ways of tracking you, using alternate accounts won't protect you fully.","replies":[{"poster":"EasyGameGG","date":"2018-04-13T20:29:26.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":23,"body":"I'm extremely good, I very rarely lose lane, or  fail to carry.
