In other words, the odds of something happening at least once are equal to 100% minus the odds of it never happening. This makes sense; if it must either happen or not happen, then you can capture the entire universe of probabilities with those two probability values.\n\nSo, for example, let's say you roll five d10s and you want to know the odds of getting at least one result above an 8. The odds of rolling a 9 or 10 are 20% for each roll. The odds of rolling something else are 80% for each roll. So the odds of rolling a 9 or 10 on at least one die are equal to 100% minus the odds of rolling an 8 or below five times:\n\n100% - (80%)^5\n\n= 100% - 33%\n\n= 67%.\n\nI didn't learn this until my sophomore year of high school. I thought it was pretty eye-opening as to the nature of probability; one of those things that's really obvious once you learn it, but is actually quite enlightening. It's somewhat related to the equally important concept of independent events. Critting on one attack doesn't make it any more or less likely that you'll crit on the other.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbInZ5oJ0bc\n\n…except in League, where Riot actually coded the crit mechanic to make probability work the way people think it does before they study probability. Not that this was a dumb decision; it's just kind of funny that within League probability works the way laypersons think it does.

At a 50% crit chance, there are 4 possible outcomes all with equal probability:  XX, XO, OX, OO, with X being a crit and O being a non-crit.  Throw out OO, because we're assuming one of the hits is a crit, and we're left with 3 equally-probable outcomes.
