I just restarted playing league after a year of not playing. Why did it give me 20 minutes after only 1 afk???","replies":[{"poster":"Nasus Withers","date":"2017-08-15T02:18:44.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you were afking a lot a year ago before you stopped playing, the system will remember that. You can improve your status by playing many, many consecutive games without incidents such as afks. The system will not improve your status just because you didn't play for an extended period of time. hopefully this explanation helps you understand what happened. As for how many games you have to play consecutively, I had 20 minute leaver buster 5 times (almost all of those in a row) and it took me what I think to be 100 consecutive games each time to improve my status step by step.\n\nI am not sure, but I don't think this is the right forum for this thread. pretty sure this belongs in player behaviour and moderation","replies":[{"poster":"Pootis555","date":"2017-08-15T03:04:01.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played like 8 in row without afking :/ and thanks","replies":[{"poster":"GLBuck","date":"2017-08-15T16:19:31.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean if you're afking 1 in every 9 games, thats still over a 10% afk rate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-15T04:19:32.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically our system will take into account how many games you've left/afk'd in vs how often you're playing games to finish. It looks like there was a significant time gap between your afk's, but they were still enough to add up to an LPQ.
