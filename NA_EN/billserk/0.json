I love to program, but still have a difficult time focusing on what path I would like to take. I hope to find some rioters in the same field to somewhat get down and chat with me by adding as a friend in League, also it's going to be something I have to do anyways for an assignment where I would need someone from a big company to sit down, chat through email, skype, or face to face. Rioters being the most responsive of any company I know, and really my preferred company to work for, even though I might not become one until after more years of fine tuning my programming. I would love to hear some of your stuff, and what best ways to fine tune my programming skills.\n\nI'll take harsh criticism, it's the best medicine out there. Just wish for no haters or trolls in response to this thread.\n\nThanks You Guys :D","replies":[{"poster":"Krylhos","date":"2014-06-17T18:04:08.106+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings,\n\nThere are many paths in programming. I think the best advice is to follow your passion. Some programmers get geeked out over big data management. Others get super excited about making an interface look and feel awesome. From web to desktop, billing software to game code, the beauty about programming is that there are more flavors than Doritos. \n\nLet me ask you this - what was your primary driver for wanting to get into software engineering?","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-06-17T17:58:30.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"BBQ Doritos or Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Gweezlebur","date":"2014-06-17T21:15:20.632+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spicy Sweet Chili","replies":[{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2014-06-18T16:35:45.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has BBQ in name.\n\n\nWants chili.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDafuq","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keiran13","date":"2014-06-18T05:35:15.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Salsa Verde.

Back when I was 15 I made  private servers for games like World of Warcraft, then got into making more privates servers for games like Minecraft. (Basically almost every game that had -craft at the end of the name lol). Then All of a sudden in these private servers I started making my own stuff happen like creating new projectiles, and UI. I started tampering with multiple things. I got into Action-script for a while with a 2D animation class in high school using Adobe Flash. I've been jumping left and right, but only doing the simple stuff then, now I'm taking classes to get my BS degree in computer science programming.\n\nRight now I'm learning about Dijkstra's Algorithm which is essentially something needed for networking.\nSo I guess networking would probably be my main path of choice at the moment.\n\n\nAlso thanks for the response, really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lao Fu the Tiger","date":"2014-06-18T05:10:44.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, Dijkstra's is a pain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morvrannis","date":"2014-06-17T21:30:12.652+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">  Others get super excited about making an interface look and feel awesome.\n\nOooo yeah...I love me some interface design...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Gweezlebur","date":"2014-06-17T21:26:18.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I find really interesting is playing with new languages, just to see what they're like, what other languages they remind me of, whether they have closures, what it feels like to write code in them.\n\nI got stuck in a language rut once, and I became a much better programmer when I learned to think about programming as a craft, not as a specific language. I once made some really great PHP code even!\n\nFeel free to add me in game, always happy to chat when I am online.","replies":[{"poster":"Hookeo","date":"2014-06-17T22:04:41.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nI had a question for you and any others who wish to respond. Some side info, I'm going in to the second year of obtaining a Computer Science degree at my university.  \n\nWhat would you all recommend is a good way to practice thinking AS a programmer?  The most challenging thing for me to grasp is really just breaking programs that I want to create down to the smallest aspects.  I can envision this beautiful and powerful program, and I can even get it down to different subsections, but then when I sit down and try to code, I always miss some small detail that can, at times, frustrate me trying to fix.\n\nI used to be going to school for Pre-Med and Bio-Chem.  I don't think I was completely prepared for the 180 mindset that is programming.  \n\nI guess regarding what you said, what was a way that you starting to think of it as a craft.  That might be a great place for me to start.\n\nSorry for the long bit!

In the end, each line of code being written is meant to help drive towards a solution to a problem.  It's really easy to write code for the sake of writing code, and forgetting what problem it is that you're trying to solve.","replies":[{"poster":"Hookeo","date":"2014-06-18T02:11:46.790+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've had that problem in a few of my classes.

My main focus is this platform you and I are commenting on. The kinds of things that I work within on a day-to-day basis are building / maintaining HTTP API's; some written in Java, others in Node.

I find what works out well is to not think, \"How will my program do this one thing?\", but rather ask, \"In doing this one thing, what are all the millions of different way each step could happen?\"\n\nReliable code will have recognized that things don't always go well. Reusable code will have recognized that not everyone wants things to run the same way. Great code is able to fit both. With programming, especially early on, you have to be careful about assumptions. Expect the part you are missing to be anything at all, from semi-colons to recursion to reflection. In my experience, I usually get stuck when I get too focused on finding X, when  I really needed Y.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Morvrannis","date":"2014-06-17T21:40:01.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I once made some really great PHP code even!\n\nI never expect to see \"great\" and \"PHP\" in the same sentence, except when saying, \"It's great that I'm not writing this in PHP!\"\n\nBut, definite good advice - build off of the languages you know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-06-17T20:43:48.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Barbarian Bill!
