You're eally hard to understand to be honest.

I guess the E spammers would have been mad.  But is the new playstyle really a healthy one?  She's entirely based around a short-ranged targeted spell that does huge damage and has powerful innate sustain.  She can't really be outplayed beyond dodging her ult.

The community chases power levels much more than they prefer to play their favorite kits or most enjoyable characters.

A champion who has the potential to be played in multiple ways needs a rework then to pigeonhole them into a single play style? Cause that's what you're saying. That means Blitzcrank, who is a fighter/support, Morgana, who is mage/support, Elise, who is mage/assassin, should all be gutted to be reworked into a single role, because according to you, reworks are supposed to remove versatility and create a single play style.\n\nYou know what would have dispelled this animosity? If they had reworked her to retain both of her play styles, instead of stupidly rushing her rework to make it in time for the Shurima event, which stank of half-assery. This rework was half-assed like the rest of the Shurima event, as evidenced by the lore botches, Azir having more bugs than sand particles, and her half-assed visual/voice update that fixed nothing on her and kept really sloppy animations/models. \nCassiopeia was botched hard-core. Her entire personality was and is contradicted by the way she plays now, and she's now nothing more than \"don't die and wait to become OP.\" 75% of her kit is an irrelevant set up for E, and her R has an awkward casting time that makes it pointless considering how close you need to be to land it. Her kit blows now, and they sought to rectify it by cramming numbers and add-ons into E, overly complicating one of the simpler kit designs they had pre-rework.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-24T18:18:35.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> So let me get this correct.

All the champions you mentioned have coherent, focused kits.  It is fine to have kit versatility, even desirable.  Also, clearly League supports role hybridization; two role champions are more common than one role champions.  When I speak of focusing on a playstyle, it's about how the kit works together.  A kit that is properly focused provides higher player satisfaction, because the player has a clear objective and achieving it feels obviously right.\n\nWith Old Cass, you have two playstyles that fight against each other -- the poison mage part of Cass is interested in long poke fights from range, while the snakebite part of Cass wants to get close and burst targets during R windows.  If you try to support both of these playstyles, you either end up with an OP champion or neither feeling like the right way to play.  Old Cass has this problem where the player is never really confident they were doing it right, and the goal state in engagements is not obvious.\n\nIn my view, Riot was correct to choose one and clearly emphasize that as the dominant play pattern.  It would have worked fine to support poisoning as the dominant pattern too, of course.  I think Riot preferred to focus on the E because they have a few good DoT mages, but nobody has a marksman-style magic damage pattern.\n\n> You know what would have dispelled this animosity? If they had reworked her to retain both of her play styles, instead of stupidly rushing her rework to make it in time for the Shurima event, which stank of half-assery. \n\nRetaining the strong poison damage in Cassiopeia's kit would necessitate watering down her single target damage focus.  Not a recommended course of action.  Focused champions with clear strengths and weaknesses are what we want from kit designs.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-01-24T20:53:16.653+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> With Old Cass, you have two playstyles that fight against each other -- the poison mage part of Cass is interested in long poke fights from range, while the snakebite part of Cass wants to get close and burst targets during R windows.\n\nYou know as someone who used to play quite a bit of Cass I gotta disagree with this.\n\n\nYes some Cass were more poke heavy and others were more mano-a-mano happy.

If there was going to be a streamlining, she needed a complete overhaul. \nIf there was going to be such a strong focus on this style of play, then Riot should have put that concept aside for a different champion. Cassiopeia first and foremost according to EVERYTHING related to her lore, quotes, and kit content prior to the rework, is a mage focused on poisoning and slow painful deaths, not insta-deleting opponents with a spammable spell. Sure, she had a strange kit that had somewhat conflicting roles, but to keep her thematic, they should have focused on her poisons instead of her E, as a poison mage is a role that is currently not occupied by any champion. Her kit as it is is not suitable for \"hammer-a-button-in-place-of-autoattacks\" due to the majority of her kit being focused on poisons. The odd piece of her kit was her old passive and her E, and honestly, Twin Fangs should have been replaced with something else instead of elevated to the core of her kit. \nTo properly make a marksman-style APC, Riot should make a kit that emphasizes such a style with all of the skills that lend viability to it. If they enjoy the necessity to create a set up for spam, then one skill should have the tool for that while the rest play off of acting as a caster marksman, rather than emphasizing conflicting roles and reducing the power of all but one skill. Cassiopeia having only 1 skill that replaces auto attack functionality doesn't really solidify her as a marksman APC. It only serves to make her feel awkward and clunky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-01-24T10:03:50.925+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly it seems Riot doesn't understand that ball o stats champs are toxic by design.\n\nIsn't that the whole reason why they wanted to rework top lane?

But my main point of contention is how uninteractive and boring she is to play.\n\nI mean really Riot, in 2015 we have a unique gameplay mechanic that's literally *waiting*? I like to think they're better than this, if only they'd act like it more often. \n\nAnd yeah, once you get there you have the incredibly complex strategy of getting into range, poisoning and enemy then mashing the E key until you get carpal tunnel. You HAVE to build AP to get any meaningful benefit. Sure. melting enemies with a string of Es can be fun, at least until the novelty wears off. Which is pretty damn fast.\n\nAt the end of the day, she should be a bit less powerful, but some of the power should go into more meaningful and diverse gameplay. Goods from the greats and all that (but not straight up nerfs, or we're back to Shurima update, which honestly isn't any better). As the main source of damage, E should be more dependent on the other skills, not the other way around as it is now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUltimateSpear","date":"2015-01-24T19:18:15.083+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is pretty much the problem. Cassiopeia was my first champ I bought, so I can see where you're coming from. Cassiopeia is a super mana hungry champion, but I don't think giving her EXTREMELY high mana sustain and spellvamp for free is the way to go about it. Her old Deadly Cadence passive was much better, in terms of being less obnoxious as hell, because it contained her mana problems without making her \"might as well be an energy/resourceless champ\" in lane phase at least. The E mana restore makes her mana management braindead early and strangely bad late unless you get a tear... It's very awkward. \n\nThat said though, the logic here riot is presenting is mind boggling. \"We wanted to tone down Cassiopeia's oppressive lane bullying.\" Okay, so why did they buff her Twin Fang, which was the reason short range mages and melee mids were tearing their hair out before they could get enough items to fully burst her? Her Twin Fang was where most of her oppression is. It warps to being bad for Cassiopeia on the other end of the spectrum, too. Because her E had so much power her high poke damage was unreliable. (Q was a good poke spell, W had good zoning but it was unreliable as poke) Against high range mages Cassiopeia did struggle. Her Q poke was NOT enough to keep up, unfortunately. ( At least for me. I'm at like high silver now and I started playing at the end of season 3 so bear with me, please.) This translates to basically \"I shit on your melee mid, or Annie, Ryze, etc. but I'm mediocre against poke/ long range burst mages. (Thank god Wyndra got gutted)\n\nNow, with players being forced into the Twin Fang all in playstyle, the issue is all the more exacerbated. She still shits on melee's/short range mages, and now she can farm it up EASILY against these long range poke mages  now because of her health and mana sustain. Rush a catalyst instead of a Tear if you're frightened on getting bursted and then you will be a self-sustaining menace as long as you need to scale up. Honestly, she's still a better lane bully than late game, imo. She's been buffed enough to have a steady 55% win rate.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=10780961#10780961 \n\nThis is an old post with Brackhar, Cassi's original designer, discussing  her Deadly Cadence passive. This passive was honestly pretty damn good considering how mana passives are boring from the get go. But, it enhanced her lane bullying without giving her INFINITE mana sustain, and the stacking mechanic added a sense of rhythm to your spell casts. It was pretty engaging for a mana conservation passive, instead of the one on Twin Fang she has now.\n\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=4613331#4613331\n\n Brackar had intended to create Cassi as a champ similar to Anivia, although mobile and sustained damage focused rather than slow and bursty. You can see from her old kit these elements. Cassiopeia's Miasma was quite similar to Anivia's Glacial Shroud as a good zoning/waveclearing tool.  Also, look at both of these champion's E spells; Twin Fang and Frostbite. **Notice how on their own they deal mediocre damage but with their other abilities they can do a lot? And these other abilities are plenty powerful on their own?**There are other examples, but basically I feel like so many parts of the zoning-control mage/Anti-Anivia are... not the same with Cassiopeia anymore.\n\nI'm going to say a reversion of the rework is in order. And perhaps to never rework her. Cassiopeia's two playstyles as a poison-poke mage/ or all in DPS mage with twin fang appeal to very different sides of her fanbase. If one side HAS to get snubbed, in this case it was  the players that played her as a poison-poke mage, than maybe it's better to leave her with her  slightly awkward, but **EXTREMELY MORE enjoyable and engaging** kit she had before, and this can be based on her old and new passives alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-24T23:04:27.772+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really confuses me.\n\nSome reworks I thought were absolutely amazing (Sion, Soraka, Tristana)\n\nWhile others have been absolutely horrid (Sona, Cassiopiea)\n\nThe funny thing is it has been admitted in both the Sona and the Cass rework that the person in charge did not listen to community feedback. \n\nBoth have admitted this.
