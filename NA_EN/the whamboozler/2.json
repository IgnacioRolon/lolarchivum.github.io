It was all people could talk about for a while and now everyone just sort of... stopped.  She's still an obnoxious, hyperscaling lane bully that promotes a completely uninteractive lane... does no one care any more?  Did she get nerfed and I missed it?  She sure seems as broken and bullcrap as ever to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-02-06T19:48:25.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do look for counter play methods right?

You have successfully done nothing but be condescending.  Good job.   \n\nIf you have any ACTUAL advice and you'd like to post it without fluffing yourself up about how awesome you are, I'd appreciate you putting it down here.  If you have none and you just wanted to belittle someone randomly without offering anything, well then... um... you already covered that.  Thanks.  I hope it made you feel all warm and fuzzy.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2015-02-10T01:09:51.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deitrix,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pMaiKpQe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-06T20:22:20.199+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for posting a snide, insulting post without mentioning A: what those methods are or B: an answer to any of the questions I asked in my post.

Also the only answers I COULD give are not really insults but criticism on the thought process as to how this whole thread came about. I can be productive but uninformed opinions are things I can't help do to how most people here take simple criticism.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-02-06T20:26:46.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She never really was a lane bully... not prior to the rework, not after it. Sure she had more potential before the rework, however now you need to burn all your mana and go \"all in\" if you want that early kill and even that is usually not enough. Her midlane status got trashed pretty much which is why you can see her in the top lane nowadays... that's where the \"midlane rejects\" go.\n\nOnly thing \"broken\" is her passive... since it's useless and you can barely \"feel\" it during the game. It's only relevant until very late game and you need to pack huge amount of AP to benefit from it.","replies":[]}]}
