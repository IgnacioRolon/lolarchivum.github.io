They are the sounds when she lands after her recall in each form.When she lands back to base there were some sounds matching her recall and theme. Just go on an custom game close all sounds but the effect and press b. The second part of her recall, the landing where her board lands first then flies down dj sona the sounds randomly play and not all the time.I find that kinda annoying :/ . I hope someone from riot sees this and at least try . If somene manages to hear the sound in their first try then try again . The sound plays 1/10 (example, not accureate)times","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-31T20:38:44.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xXxDarkSlayerxXx - \n\nThanks for the report!
