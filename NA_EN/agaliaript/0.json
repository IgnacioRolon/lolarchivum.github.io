Let's then say that the remaining 4 players do their able bodied best, waste 35 minutes and lose anyway because... well duh, no shplif mother ducking duh. It's a 5v5 game. 4v5 from 01:00 just isn't fair. Explain to me why I lose the normal amount of LP or ANY LP AT ALL because of someone else's AFK or disconnect or whatever.\r\n\r\nRemakes don't affect LP. But if somebody buys and the game doesn't supply the option to remake, that doesn't count. If the boosted bot doesn't want to ff at 15 because they're 11 and it's Summer and they have all day to play, that doesn't count either. Still lose LP. This is.....un....BELIEVABLY frustrating.\r\n\r\nTell me how it makes sense for it to work this way. Explain it to me.","replies":[]}
