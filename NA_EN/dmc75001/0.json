JUST GAZE IN AWE.**\r\n\r\nYou want Teemo?  Here he is.\r\n\r\nMostly, the reason I was afraid for Teemo was that the retcon would change him into a furry, harmless Little Yordle Scout who would fight for his friends.  No, this skin pays homage towards the intense, killing spirit that Teemo has; and, the addition of this \"Omega Squad\" skin is going to open up a fresh, new perspective on alternate universes in the League of Legends.  It's heavily implied that this version of Teemo could be someone from a post-Apocalyptic universe where Runeterra is ravaged by years of war and conflict.  And, in the center of it all, is this one little Yordle that stands in the midst of the chaos, fighting his final battle.\r\n\r\n>*War...War never changes...*","replies":[{"poster":"Cidem","date":"2015-03-26T18:55:53.829+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always liked Teemo's two-sided nature, a character who rides the fine line between \"chipper compatriot and unrepentant killer\".\n\n\"There is something that switches off in Teemo, so that the lives he ends do not burden him.\" o_o\n\nIt's intriguing to see what he could become, should he fully tilt passed the point of no return.","replies":[{"poster":"TopGallant","date":"2015-03-26T19:22:45.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree he finally just stayed in the switched killer mode....I think Teemo needs a tattoo to add to how gruff he seems now, like of the helmet Icon for the teaser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DMC75001","date":"2015-03-27T01:44:08.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cindem, tell the Skins Team that they're doing a good job with all of these visuals!
