And Riot is bound to make mistakes, but we can't blame them. When's the last time you made one of the most popular MMOs for over 3 years and didn't make any mistakes?\n\nWe are so diluted and argumentative that we just blame everything on Riot. When in reality, all of the complaints we have are just our delusions and false exceptions to the fact that we cause all of the problems that we complain about.\n\nWhile Riot should take responsibility for server, ping, and lag issues on their end, all of the toxicity and arguing is completely our doing. When people complain and say things like \"fix tribunal\" or \"stop trolling\", neither Riot or us as the players would have to deal with that if people just stopped being jerks.\n\nStop blaming everything on Riot. Deep down, you know whatever it is, it's your fault. Get off of Riot's case.\n\nEDIT: I understand that I sound like a jerk. I don't intend to sound confrontational, or anything of the like. I just want to get my point across, and I hope you understand that.","replies":[{"poster":"Crate of Cobras","date":"2015-03-28T14:49:50.744+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":7,"body":"\"Most popular MMOs\". You mean MOBA, naturally.\n\nI'm going to tell you some straight-up shit that is 100% more correct than this Colin Moriarty \"Gamer Entitlement\" horseshit.\n\nThe people who pay money for shop items, and those who simply play the game and generate secondary sources of revenue for Riot, are consumers. Riot is the company that provides the product for the consumers. Consumers have a right to get what they expect, and can choose to stop paying the company when they aren't performing adequately. The onus is 100% on Riot if Riot fucks up. In a capitalist country, this is the solid reality of the situation. \n\nI get that a ton of little babies hate seeing people complain and argue against problems, and want people to just shut up and accept them. This is a mindset fueled by complacency and complicity. This kind of behaviour is why votes for women were opposed in the 1920s. This is why slavery took so long to abolish. The people who want something, which they entirely deserve as I outlined above, MUST continue to make noise, or they simply DO NOT EXIST.\n\nOh, and toxicity on the community's part could have been dealt with far more eloquently than by merely hoping for rehabilitation. Tribunal is very much Riot's business. The community's state is not every person in the community's fault. It's the little shitstains that make games unfun with cunt-like behaviour. Riot could be much more heavy-handed, but wants money and some miserable plea for their salvation.\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kill Commies","date":"2015-03-28T16:19:13.238+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"TIL that being OK with Riot is the same as supporting slavery and oppression of women","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeynaTaggerung","date":"2015-03-29T02:46:11.802+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Loog of Loogends is trying to say stop getting all worked up over issues that oftentimes aren't Riot's fault.

Being nice to a toxic person doesn't make them any less toxic, so perhaps this kind of thing is what they need.\n\nYou know what, I've had my episodes. Not in game. God no. I would never subject my team to that hate that can well up inside someone while playing a game like League. Mobas do have a couple inherent things that can often cause people to become toxic; it's part of the game, and it's not the developer's fault. But when it broke loose in me after getting knocked from bronze 1 to bronze 5, straight down, I was mad. I wrote a thread about how I felt on the matter, talking about how I felt like I was alone when my team feeds, like I was playing 1v10. And you know what? People gave me things that I hear constantly, causing me to complain more. The people in that thread? They never played a game with me. And they assumed that I'm toxic all the time. Never had a successful case against me, because I don't get toxic in game, and I report toxicity when I see it. It's hard to know who to blame for their assumption; me for losing my cool, them for making assumptions, or the community who caused those assumptions to be made in the first place.\n\nAnd then you have another whole class of people that complain when their main gets nerfed, despite the fact that they can take pretty much any matchup in their lane and destroy them in Bronze. Because all Katarina is good for is pub stomping Bronzies, right? Because playing against Katarina doesn't make the game any less fun for players that you stomp, does it? Perfect example, a lot of people were mad when Jinx's zap and pow-pow got nerfed. Zap had a slow that was on par with Thresh's box, and pow-pow used to give more attack speed. A lot more. You know that when they fixed these problems and she wasn't any idiot's one-way ticket to guaranteed victory, some people complained. Even clearly broken champs like Rek'Sai. Her base damage was absolutely insane. I don't know how she made it out of testing without people saying, \"You know, I like it, but don't you think she does a little more damage than most other champions?\" But I know some entitled players that started moaning about how she's no longer viable, she'll never see professional play, Riot are making a big mistake, and how that's their problem with game balance that they nerf anything that that person likes to play. Half the time it's because that person is just bad at league, and needs an op champion as a crutch to get out of bronze. Disgusting.\n\nBut look at me getting all toxic about toxicity.
