But people had to bring it up. This post is about Zed being unfun to play against, disregarding how good or bad he is.**\n\nI'll start off by talking about Zed. I don't think Zed is OP at all, I just think he wasn't designed very well. His core itemization counters most other meta top laners, mid laners, and some junglers (which are most of who you'll be seeing early game depending on what lane he's in). He is also too risk-free of a champion. A major part of league in my opinion is knowing when to play safe and when to play aggressive. However, with Zed, you do both at the same time. If you go in on someone with your shadow, go for a Q, and ult, (which is what I would call aggressive,) you can still escape with Zed. Zed is very risk-free and it is very easy to cover up mistakes you make. He is also pretty much resourceless.\n\nAs a jungle main, I feel personally cheated when the enemy picks Zed. I can NOT gank mid lane (I main Volibear) when I play against a Zed, even when he is on cooldown. There is a VERY small window of opportunity to take Zed down and the fact that his core itemization includes both Attack Speed and Armor Penetration, it makes it harder for the rising diversity of tank junglers to play against Zed. I literally have to build just so that I can counter him in lanes.\n\nHowever, I do see the other argument. If you know how to play against a Zed, I understand how it can be easier to play against him. But it just isn't fun when you have to change your build and even your playstyle just because the enemy chose a tough champion.\n\nZed needs a rework, not a nerf.\n\nEDIT: I feel like many people are missing my point. I have a few things to point out.\n\n1. I do not play ranked.\n2. I play League for fun, not to win, hence #1.\n\nWhat I mean is that tweaking your whole build and playstyle just to be able to beat a champion is not fun. I personally hate any item with an active, making me not like Zhonya's. But if I have to buy Zhonya's to win against Zed, that isn't fun. I just want to build my Morellonomicon and have a fun game while still being able to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Auron","date":"2015-03-25T20:02:33.345+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":4,"body":"The only problem that I have with Zed is that he gets a shadow on his ult.

His energy costs aren't that severe either.\n\nHe has strong autoattacks, so he can easily push the wave and destroy towers.  His passive also makes it extremely easy for him to last-hit.  His primary build path also involves lifesteal, so he can heal himself up while doing this.\nIn other words, he can farm easily and shrug off harass, while he gets to harass you basically for free.\n\nThe early laning phase against him is a pain because you know that he will push you into your tower until you are OOM, at which point he will probably dive you.  All that most mana-reliant mids can do is survive until they can ask the jungler to hold the lane for them, so that they can go back and get some mana.\nBut there's another problem.  You need mana regeneration items to deal with his free pushing - but you also need to rush Seeker's / Zhonya's to deal with his damage output.  You're forced to give up one or the other.\n\nOnce he hits six, he suddenly has massive threat with his ultimate.  A lot of other assassins get a huge powerspike at level 6 that allows them to all-in, but those other assassins have much more risk.\nIf Zed jumps on you and it looks like you are about to outplay him, he can just hit R again to jump to safety.  It's really hard to punish him for being over-aggressive, while it's really easy for him to punish you for the slightest mistake.\n\n\n\nAnother issue applies to all manaless AD casters - runes, masteries and items favour them heavily in a matchup vs a mana-using mage.\n\nA mage needs to buy Sorceror's Shoes to deal good damage, and penetration is a really rare stat.  If they buy defensive boots (Tabi), they have to take a large hit to their damage output.  AD casters get to build Merc's without affecting their damage (other than the cost), and Merc's are an awesome anti-magic and anti-CC item.\n\nMages have a lot of different statistics that they want from their runes - mana regen, armour, magic resistance, ability power.  They need to choose between those (armour or mana regen yellows? Magic resistance or ability power blues?) - meanwhile, AD casters always get to take armour and magic resistance without losing damage, because they have no real damage-choices for yellows and blues.  True, almost everyone takes armour yellows, but in the case of facing a manaless enemy, the mana regen would actually be useful, if you could afford to take it.\nAdd to that, AD casters are mêlée and have scaling magic resistance.\nIn short, AD casters get a lot of cheap or free stats to help them against mages, but the mages have to pay for the stats to deal with AD casters.\n\n\nI've ranted a fair bit. \n\nMy two main complaints are these:\n\n * Zed has far too much free lane threat (waveclear, tower-killing)\n * Zed doesn't have enough risks when he goes all-in with his ultimate.\n\nThey'd also be fairly easy to fix:\n\n *   Make his passive only apply to champions, remove his passive % AD scaling and spread that damage to his other skills (This would greatly reduce his pushing and waveclearing without hurting his assassin playstyle.)\n\n*  Make him unable to return to his ult shadow (second R cast) unless the ult target dies (allows him to escape after assassinating someone, but not to escape from failures.)\n\nWith those two changes, I feel he'd be a much healthier champion, and much less oppressive to play against.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Narasimha","date":"2015-03-25T21:07:39.966+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its not exactly specific to Zed.

You are pretty much forced to buy Zhonyas in order to do that, and for people like me who don't like Zhonyas, it just isn't fun. I have a build that I like and that is fun. I will tweak it when necessary, but to force me to build something in order to win no matter what the situation isn't fun for me.","replies":[{"poster":"SwapShadows","date":"2015-03-25T21:44:32.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"You don't need zhonyas to win, there are many ways to beat a Zed, Zhonyas just happens to be a good one.","replies":[{"poster":"Åron","date":"2015-03-25T21:46:45.177+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SwapShadows,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZYfK8uXc,comment-id=000100000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-25T21:44:32.416+0000)\n>\n> You don't need zhonyas to win, there are many ways to beat a Zed, Zhonyas just happens to be a good one.\n\nCan you name some?
