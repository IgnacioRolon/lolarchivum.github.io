Anyone have a hotfix? It's really annoying having to restart my computer after a game of league, so any help I could get would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T16:37:44.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your game configuration file may be having problems with your PC settings.

It's pretty infuriating because it closes all applications, not just League. So any Skype calls or music app I have in the background instantly gets shut down and I'm forced to hard restart.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-07T15:01:03.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this update!
