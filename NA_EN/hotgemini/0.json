It seems like all they did was add graphics to the old piece of shit and rearrange things in a way guaranteed to piss people off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-12-25T01:29:08.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have yet to see more than 5 people that i legitimately thought were using scripts.\n\nHave you considered that maybe they are just better than you?","replies":[{"poster":"xReadyPlayerOnex","date":"2016-12-25T02:18:04.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=v4EA0O7z,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-12-25T01:29:08.961+0000)\n>\n> I have yet to see more than 5 people that i legitimately thought were using scripts.\n> \n> Have you considered that maybe they are just better than you?\n\nI thought this until I had someone explain what exactly it was...\n\nYou've seen the yasou script. Guaranteed. It's easy to spot once you know what to look for when they're doing it. Somehow magically, perfectly timed... the wall comes up to block your projectile? All the while the guys playing like a complete ass, throwing q's wherever he wants? mmm yeah... better than us... sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-12-25T05:48:34.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I have thrown some perfect walls with yasuo and i suck with him.\n\nI have played against quite a few yasuos and none of them have perfectly thrown their wall every time it was up. Even if they were that would not be the most effective way to use it. If someone is doing that to you then use a low cooldown skill to make them wall, then abuse its really long cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
