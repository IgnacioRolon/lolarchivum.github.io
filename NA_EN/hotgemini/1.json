Leave buster poll","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was in a game, we were actually just starting a game ending team fight and the game locks up. The mouse was moving, tried alt tabing, tried ctrl-alt-del. Then the mouse stopped responding. I had to restart computer. By the time it booted and i could log in the game was over. I was set on low priority ( witch mean you have to wait 5 mins before every game ....). Anyone else believe this needs to be addressed? I can understand ragers and such leaving but actual game crashes and internet outages. If its user done yes it should punish them. If the problem is OUT OF THERE CONTROL. Why does the user get punished? Dont know much about codeing but im sure there a way to tell  how a person leaves a game. For example. Like why would a winning jg up 12-3 quit? Or a 4-2-28 supp quit. Just randomly. I believe riot needs to look over and see what else they can do with leave buster.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-08-09T14:45:22.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've had convo's with riot's support team on twitter about this. i've gotten leaver buster penalties a few times when the game client crashed on me. it was through no fault of my own but i got penalized. i asked riot about it, and what they said amounted to....\"welp there's nothing we can do about it, that's just how leaver buster works.\" they know this is a well-known issue but they won't do anything about it. they would rather it stay the way it is and let it punish innocent ppl once in a while rather than actually put the work into adjusting it. it's just asinine that you can get penalized for \"leaving a game\" when it's their client that crashes and causes you to have to leave the game. and what's even worse is the fact that you can get leaver buster penalties even if you reconnect to the game. that's happened to me a few times","replies":[]}]}
