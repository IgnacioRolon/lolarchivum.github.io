The beta and alpha client window size was too big, but then it gave me a option to make it smaller. Then the client became too small and i can't adjust it back to the bigger client. I tried the instructions in other forums like crtl + or crtl - but I don't think that applies to the mac. Is there any solution? Thank you! Can a rioter please respond Targon blade ignore me and deleted my question in another forum :(.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T00:09:43.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohai, let's get this issue resolved!\n\n\nThe **CTRL +** or **CTRL -** methods do work for the Mac Client, just be sure the client has been selected (click on anything inside the client) before trying to hotkeys. If this doesn't work, you can hop into the settings using the cog icon near the X at the top of the client and change the *window size* using the dropdown menu before hitting **DONE**.\n\nI hope this helped, let me know if you have any other issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Air Ops","date":"2016-12-06T22:54:50.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for verifying with crtl + and crtl -.
