I am, however, overjoyed in viewing other's emotes, but rarely do i find someone else making the attempt to run up to my face and giving me the ol' Soraka's \"this is fine\" as i mow down their carry. \r\n\r\nSo long as you're not one of the heathens who _/mute all_ every game, you can still hear their emote sounds trigger. Often times you'll find people who tend to stay on their initial spawning platform, keeping their desired emote just out of view. Shame....\r\n\r\nAs a fellow Emo(teur) i feel that this does not give emotes the justice they deserve. They are meant to be seen! Shown off! Celebrated at the liveliest of time, and spam'd as a badge of honor!\r\n So i ask:\r\n\r\n**Can anything be done to better improve Emote Visuals for TFT?**","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-09-10T14:27:34.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want an option to remove all emotes entirely, so you can't hear or see any of them.
