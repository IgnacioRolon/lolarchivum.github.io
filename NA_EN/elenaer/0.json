Also if not, why?  It's quite annoying to have to constantly change the runes before every match, especially if I play multiple roles?  I noticed you can purchase rune pages, but at a ridiculous BE price.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-15T23:32:16.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those presets are mainly there for people who are just getting into the new systems or don't have multiple pages bought yet. Buying multiple pages are mostly for convenience as I believe you start with at least 1/2 editable pages.","replies":[]}]}
