I had lost 4 LP 2 games ago and dropped to 0 LP, then I lost another, and then won this game. Just a bug or is it possible to have a negative amount of LP?\n\nI kinda worded this oddly so maybe this will help -\n1st game - loss : 4 LP - 4 = 0 LP\n2nd game - loss : 0 LP + 0 = 0 LP\n3rd game - win : 0 LP + 24 LP = 20 LP?\n\nAfter I re-logged my profile still showed 20 LP.\nI am using the new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T18:00:39.712+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible to drop into negative LP, which is what happened in your case due to losses followed up by a queue dodge.  If your LP is not showing up on the updated client, it may appear properly in the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Eric Sun","date":"2017-01-06T03:03:49.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's interesting.
