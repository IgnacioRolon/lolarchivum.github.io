It is how the big d*cks swing.

(but bans and alt accounts give Riot a lot of $$$$ for people addicted to the game)\n\nThere's a difference between trash talking and talking like trash, something allot of people don't seem to know the difference between. Even in pro sports it has its limitations, which can result in fines or even punishments if taken too far. Nothing in the OPs chat log constitutes trash talking-it's just them yelling and raging at others, and this would definitely not be considered trash talking in professional sports under any circumstances. The only thing that could possibly be considered trash talking is this: \n\n>Delightful Mango: nice hexderinker\nDelightful Mango: attackdmg and attackspeed boorts\nDelightful Mango: nice\n\nThat said though, given their behavior in the rest of the log even that's a stretch. \n\nAs for the sensitivity argument, From [Ulanopo’s Knowledge Base](http://(http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&amp;page=1#post43465401)): \n\n>**People who report are simply being oversensitive. The mute button exists for a reason.**\n\n>Let’s start with the Riot quote on this (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=30696571#post30696571)):\n\n>**_Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?_**\n_Players shouldn’t need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player._\n\n>Simply put, Riot says no. You can scream and cry all you want, but it is their house and their rules.\n\n>With that out of the way, I think the topic deserves some further discussion. The theory is that, if people resolved to care less, then they would be happier. I often refer to this as ”Argument from Stoicism” and I think it is a fairly weak philosophy because it places the burden on the person being expected to endure the behavior rather than the person exhibiting the behavior. “You should be able to handle it” is just a flimsy excuse for being a bully or a jerk. I have to be the bigger man so that you can do whatever you want? That hardly seems fair.\n\n>There is also the issue of how I spend my limited free time. Like most people, I am constantly required to make value judgments between the different forms of entertainment that are available to me and, let's be honest, we live in an age of nearly limitless entertainment options. If I'm having a bad day in League, I can just fire up Steam and play a whole bunch of games that don't require me to put up with someone's BS.\n\n>This is not an issue of weakness or thin-skin; it's a question of choosing activities that don't leave me feeling frustrated and angry. Too many of those experiences and I'll just find something else to do. Riot knows this.\n\nSimply put, people need to stop using \"it's just trash talk/banter and everyone else is just sensitive\" as a catch-all excuse to try to justify poor behavior and just take responsibility for it instead.\n\nAlso, accounts are free, and nothing relevant for any sort of competitive play requires real money spending of any kind. If one wants to spend real money on the game then that's their own choice not Riot's. That said, Riot doesn't want people to make new accounts (though they can't stop them from doing so) and would rather permabanned players (who have been written off as paying clients) find another game to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanyoupipu","date":"2019-11-29T02:33:36.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is completely wrong. \"verbal abuse\" \"toxicity\" all those words are inconsistent and subjective, like feminists redefining \"sexual assault\" to mean cat calling.

If you mess up and someone flames you, get over it and don't mess up next game. \n\nCounter-point: if a player is sensitive enough that they have to flame others or otherwise intentionally ruin the game as soon as someone makes any sort of mistake then they shouldn't be playing multiplayer games since clearly they can't handle the fact that other people are going to mess up from time to time just like they do. This is especially true for those who have the mindset of \"can dish it out but can't take it\".\n \n> I can't stand players that think a few mean words from an anonymous internet stranger are somehow making them the victim, while at the same time, said \"victim\" tries to get someone else banned because they are butthurt.\n \nWhile the internet does make it easier to speak our minds thanks in part to anonymity, it doesn't change the fact that we're interacting with real people, so that shouldn't be a justification for someone to get away with poor behavior consequence free.\n\n> The way I see it, \"toxicity\" if accurately defined, is a well-deserved angry response to incompetence. This is further exaggerated by League's inefficient, ineffective method of determining individual skill. \n\nI see it more as people not wanting to play with someone who is quick to harass others or throw games at the drop of a hat rather than being offended or sensitive. Also, players who become known for having behavioral issues (i.e. Dennis Rodman, Dardoch, etc.) often end up having that overshadow their skill, thus making it that much harder for them to find teams to play for compared to players who don't have those issues.\n\nSure, people shouldn't take offense so easily to insults (though I doubt many actually do), but at the same time the person flinging the insults shouldn't be so eager to say them in the first place, nor should they get off scott free with excuses like \"it's just words\" or \"stop being so sensitive\", as they can only go so far before they no longer work. Being passionate and/or competitive is one thing, being a bully or a jerk is another.\n \n> I would rather have the \"toxic\" player that does his job, over the \"nice\" liability that can't stomach a few mean sentences.\n\nAnd I and many others would much rather see people show some basic levels of respect and decency and not be willing to  intentionally ruin the experience for others whenever they don't get their way. If you ask me those people are the actual sensitive ones since they also often can't handle being held accountable for their actions.","replies":[{"poster":"Kanyoupipu","date":"2019-11-29T09:53:50.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Respect is earned.
