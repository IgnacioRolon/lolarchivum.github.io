She's typically squishy as hell to boot, so she's not exactly the hardest to kill if you can get to her (which *is* the hard part).

An engage support can help make short work of her, and then you're 2v1 against their adc to either finish the engage or just push them out of lane.

Having to force the enemy team to focus an extra opponent when usually that tactic is completely impractical?\n\nI don't really get why it would be unhealthy. A champion making you play a game differently should be (and is) encouraged as long as the new way to play isn't unhealthy. And I can't think of anything inherently unfun/problematic about focusing the support. As long as you have just reward for doing that, it's fine, and you absolutely get that with Soraka because the reason you ignore most supports is because they blow the majority of their power near-instantly - by the time you kill them they don't care if they die. But Soraka's impact is delayed enough due to her sustained healing that there's actually something to be gained by killing her.\n\nDo not think that you ignore supports because they're weak, they're not. Their impact on team fights can be just as big as that of the ADC and if they all had sustained impact as Soraka does, there'd be an argument to focus each and every one of them. Presently people ignore supports because they generally burn their ults and other important moves quickly, so you're not stopping the enemy team doing anything important by killing them. But killing a Soraka before she's had the time to dish out 5+ heals? That leads to her team falling apart at the seams.\n\nSoraka is absolutely strange to play against but strange isn't inherently bad. You have to play differently against her but if you do, you're heavily rewarded. I don't see a problem in that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-09-07T19:51:14.767+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=manbearswine,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsuzIbLp,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2015-09-07T19:00:40.438+0000)\n>\n> *You can't expect people to focus the support as they are generally low priority targets,when a support becomes a high priority target then something is wrong.*\n\npfffffffft, just embrace the cute spacegoat already","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-09-07T20:57:11.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":19,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Puffball Reborn,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsuzIbLp,comment-id=000000020001,timestamp=2015-09-07T19:51:14.767+0000)\n>\n> pfffffffft, just embrace the cute spacegoat already\n\nThat cancerous piece of shit isn't cute.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-09-07T23:18:16.832+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=manbearswine,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OsuzIbLp,comment-id=0000000200010000,timestamp=2015-09-07T20:57:11.006+0000)\n>\n> That cancerous piece of shit isn't cute.\n\nbut she is, look at those hoofs\n\non a more serious note i can't win with her idk why, maybe i'm just bad\n\ni mean she doesn't roam for shit what i'm supposed to do if the opposing support starts to make some plays around the map?

Warmogs is the main cause of Soraka's winrate rising since it makes her 10% health cost be irrelevant since all she has to do is reach 3k HP, not that hard to do at all since she has a 1855 base HP at lvl 18 and warmogs gives her 800 extra, so just add a few HP and AP items and you are done","replies":[{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-09-07T20:38:30.576+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not the reason why her win-rate is high.

It's very easy to achieve and you don't need to \"stay at 3k HP\" you can overshoot it quite easily. Hell you can just start building {{item:3136}} or some other random HP+AP item. You literally don't need to heal yourself at all for quite a while since warmogs is going to keep you healthy as long as you don't get hit so just stay safe for as long as possible while your team pokes the enemy. It's very easy to get some AP + HP since there are options for it and Soraka in general don't build pure AP anyways. You are not there to deal damage. You are there to heal and if you can heal yourself by stupid amounts with Warmogs guess what? that means more heals for you","replies":[{"poster":"Water Breathing","date":"2015-09-07T21:39:03.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regular sightstone is only 150, so it would be 950 HP.

She would need to build Warmogs and Ruby Sightstone at level 18, but VERY rarely do supports get level 18 in games. \n\nAnd even if you think you will get to level 18, you need to sit on the gold, because the build path actually hurts Soraka until you complete it. That's a lot of gold to just waste by sitting on it. \n\nIf you want it earlier, you need to specialize. Liandry's, Riyali's, Rod of Ages are all impratical and / or too expenisve to consider on Soraka. The slow passive is pretty bad on Soraka and Liandry's passive is next to worthless as well. Rod of Ages takes too long to stack. \n\nSoraka isn't getting Crystal Scepter, Warmog's, and Banner of Command before level 14 realistically. Even if she did, she would have so much gold and her team would be so far ahead Soraka would have won anyway. \n\nI would argue you need to stay at 3k HP if you want to be efficient.
