The fun we have cannot be compared to any other game we played. Its really in random matches with random people that can make your day horrible as hell, especially when people like to abuse something meta for a easier win, or if you get a troll who impacts your game more-so than your best player.","replies":[{"poster":"Senamz13","date":"2019-06-05T19:10:32.327+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Whyskered Wyrm,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=MKGdq637,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-06-05T18:59:48.919+0000)\n>\n> I'm addicted because when i'm with friends, the game is just so entertaining to play!

Although we have fun trying to climb the ranked ladder together, most of our enjoyment comes from jokingly shit talking each other on Discord for making an occasional bad play. Without my friend I doubt I’d still be playing this game. Hats off to him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Strawberrycocoa","date":"2019-06-06T20:14:56.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this same problem for a long time. Eventually I opted to just kind of.. stop once the game stopped feeling fun. And the last few years, it's only taken a couple games for me to be so tired of bloated damage and games being decided in five minutes by the wrong champion getting a kill lead, that I put the game dow for a couple weeks before I pick it back up again.\n\nMaybe it'd be different if I was playing the game in the intended way, on a premade with friends and voice comms. But for jump-in solo-queue play, it takes no time at all for the League experience to become horrible enough to remind me why it's just not worth the time investment it once was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Glaricion","date":"2019-06-05T20:08:08.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a cosmic horror's crying, you know something is wrong.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PF8stlP.jpg[]\n\nReally miss when I was getting people to play this game, rather than ensuring that people who've quit stay gone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Inugami","date":"2019-06-05T21:13:58.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing League since early **2010**.\n_Name of my original account was Sir Hammerlock, which was permabanned in 2014.\nName of my second account was Great Fox, which was permabanned in very early 2019.\n_\nThis is my third account. Still playing; though I've never played religiously. It's not an addiction, but rather League serves as an apt alternative to RTS games as currently it's quite a dead genre. However, I do expect WarCraft III: Reforged to steal me away from League for some time.\n\nI don't think I'll truly ever quit playing League. Despite the community, despite my own passive-aggressive toxic ways; it's still a good game. No matter what changes are made, it's still the best MOBA out there hands down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JMHV","date":"2019-06-05T21:30:18.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to admit, I will never understand why people complain so much.

There are many of us who do not care a damn if you are happy playing or not.
