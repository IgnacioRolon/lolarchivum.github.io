I know its not rito, because when I moved my computer to my dorms it works fine. But here at home, it disconnects for around 2 seconds every few minutes in games.

I'd recommend going to the manufacturer's support site and make sure you have the most recent driver installed. If you continue to see this happen, I'd recommend either swapping out the network adapter for another or try a wired (Ethernet) connection to your router/modem to see if this was unique to your wireless connection.\n\nLet me know what you find out.","replies":[]}]}
