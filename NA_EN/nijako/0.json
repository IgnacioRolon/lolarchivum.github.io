My problem is w/ Frontier I usually have around 40 ping which is amazing, but there are times and I feel its becoming more frequent where I have these ping spikes where my ping just sticks at 600+ for the rest of the game. I was reading up on some other people's thoughts with the similar problems and I heard something about the different server. Could that be it? Or is it just Frontier?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-23T19:52:34.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be an issue with your ISP, but there might also be more local issues making it difficult to reach the game servers.
