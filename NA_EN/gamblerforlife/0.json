I understand that the new system concerning Runes, it&#039;s meant to be used by both new players and veterans..but, i feel like it comes at older players expense\r\n\r\nPeople purchased runes for different reasons (collectibles, requirements to play the game (you can&#039;t play jungle with no runes), meta shifts (xp quints, lifesteal in season 4 etc.) .It was an ip sink. People bought these runes for w/e reason..But, nobody purchased them to lose huge amounts of ip in them.\r\n\r\nRiots argument is that we used them, so we got what we payed for. I agree with this..but, we invested so much time in runes, it was a grind to get them for older players. you even made at some point, essential runes cheaper, because it was not very satisfying to invest in runes. And now, you are making them free for everybody. A great ideea, i am not against it. However, i feel like players who invested time (ip) into runes, get the short stick of this deal:|..it does not feel very rewarding for us:|.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s only natural to compare new with old players..and we are not getting properly compensated for purchasing the runes.\r\n\r\nAnother slap in the face, 100ip/rune, considering runes have different prices..basicly, if i have 10 runes of 820 ip, and you have 20 runes of 410 ip, you will receive twice as much ip:|.. why is that?? did we not invest the same amount of ip in runes??\r\n\r\nwith this update, instead of older being happy about it, you made it so that it feels, like we are punished for putting ip in runes:|..","replies":[]}
