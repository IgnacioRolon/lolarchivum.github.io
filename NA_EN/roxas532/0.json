Something very similar happened to me just now. While loading I got a message saying \"Network connection has become unavalible. Please try again.\" It said that every time I mashed reconnect, but everything else worked fine. I'm only play on a hardwired connect, and checked my packet loss to verify there wasn't an issue on my end. I restarted my computer and got back in just in time to connect to the after game lobby when everyone was cursing at me for wasting their time xD. I know you guys will not return lp/MMR but don't ya think branding my match history with LEAVER is a bit demeaning?","replies":[]}]}]}
