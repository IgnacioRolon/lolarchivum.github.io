Basically you have to install both versions of the game and then take with a software like Wooxy the file containing all the text in korean and moving it into the english version. You then have to take the fonts files from the korean version and move them as well. \n\nI do not reccomend this.. it is way too tricky and has to be updated every patch","replies":[{"poster":"Champ","date":"2017-09-03T14:46:03.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand too well.
