I know that this is not just my computer having this problem because some of my friends have had it too. Most of the time when it happens I have to use task manager to close league because it will just sit as a white screen. So if you guys could find a fix to this that would be nice because if im gonna lose lp it better be a game worth dodging.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T04:55:59.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue is most often tied to an *unstable connection* to our servers and can commonly be resolved by working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
