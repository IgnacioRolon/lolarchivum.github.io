I don't know if it's just happening with me or there's something wrong with the game but as I'm playing, the game will briefly lag hard and run really poorly, like I'm running with 10fps or something. However, I'm always running the game with 100+ fps even when the lag occurs it still displays somewhere around 150 fps. My average fps is 250 and I'm sure it's not from my PC. Could someone tell me what might be causing this? League is the only game that is lagging like this.\r\n\r\nPC specs:\r\n\r\n- Asus Strix GTX 950 OC\r\n- Intel Skylake i5 6400\r\n- Gigabyte H170-D3H\r\n- Kingston HyperX Fury black 8GB DDR4 RAM\r\n- PSU 600W APFC\r\n- 1TB HDD 7200rpm\r\n\r\nI'm running windows 10 64-bit with the latest drivers for all my hardware.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-06T19:02:49.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you recently updated Windows 10, make sure to disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as it's been known to be causing some fps and freezing issues for a few players.  There could be other factors like game files or something else dropping your frames too, so I suggest running through the [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to tune things up.
