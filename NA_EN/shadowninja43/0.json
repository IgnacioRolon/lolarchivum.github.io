Based on your physical location, if another region would offer a better experience for you, then I think that would ultimately be the best option.  Even if that means making a new account.  Just in case, though, just hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  It wouldn't hurt to see if we can help with your connection or other options!","replies":[]}]}
