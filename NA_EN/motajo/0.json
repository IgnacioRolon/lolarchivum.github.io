Gems.\n------------\nInstead of stunning its target, Dazzle should charm--for the same duration--if Radiance (Taric's ultimate) is active. Normally when Taric focuses a mote of his power into that small, vibrant shimmer, the target is overcome with awe, and is stunned. But when Taric's glory is amplified (when he ults), his stun sparkle should inspire even *greater* awe. Like a bug flying toward a fabulous, fabulous lamp, the subject is compelled to draw nearer so they can better bask in the polychromatic paladin's splendor!\n\nRiot, whatever your plans for the {{champion:44}} Gem Knight himself, please put this mechanic in! If a rework is still far off, add this while we wait. If Taric's new kit is currently under construction, please have his stun (I'm assuming he'll still have a stun somewhere) that becomes a charm when a certain ability or buff is active (or any suitable \"uptime\"-type thing, really).\n\nFew can grasp the true form of Taric's manliness, and none can deny their admiration when his manly emanations are at their strongest!\n-------\nEdit: Figured I'd put in some more reasoning.\n\n* Since many agree that Taric isn't in the greatest place at the moment,  a small buff to his CC wouldn't break the game. Taric is in queue for a rework at some point, whenever that is. This can give him a hand until then, and even be implemented into the mystery kit he'll eventually get. It shouldn't be too hard to gate the charm further if it ends up working *too* well.\n\n* This can give different CCs some spotlight. Slows and knockups are freaking everywhere, and more than one silence has been removed. While this would be more of a tag team between a stun and charm, it'd still add a little variety.\n\n* It's thematically fitting. A charm would fit well with a character that has both physical appeal and calm charisma. Since the charm would only work part-time at Taric's shack, he wouldn't venture too far into Ahri's theme and step on her toes. Or in her corn flakes. Don't step in people's corn flakes, kids; you'll get your foot soggy and ruin their breakfast.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-01-08T23:17:20.555+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool idea.

What kinds of things have you tried doing with charm? I figured since the charm would only be available during his ultimate (or other \"uptime\" thing), and simply replaced a similar hard CC, it wouldn't be overbearing. I know Radiance is likely on the chopping block; is there another ability or effect that could serve as a temporary window for charm?","replies":[{"poster":"Tsunday","date":"2015-01-09T02:47:18.529+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we're talking about skills Riot seems to be looking to get rid of I'd like to point out there's no way Dazzle will be a point and click stun.
