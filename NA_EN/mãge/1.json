I mean, you basically made an unnecessarily long post about what everyone already knows isn't trolling, good job, but no. Trolling IS real, and it ruins games for people every hour of every day. \n\nNo, the Quinn top isn't a troll. She's just purposefully walking into the enemy team, dying, and then all-chatting \"Report my team, so troll\"\n\nNo, that Brand support isn't a troll. He's just doing everything he can to deny his ADC CS, and when the ADC begs him to stop, tells them \"Fuck you\"\n\nNo, that Duo Jungle isn't trolling, they're just letting a lane get free farm because they want to do their duo jungle thing, forcing everyone to watch them give up doubles to the enemy team because they aren't as good as they thought they were, and eventually they just start doing it on purpose.\n\nNo, that AP Ezreal isn't a troll, he's just constantly going bot, taking CS from the ADC and spamming laugh because the ADC is perfectly fine with it.\n\nYou need to wake up. Trolling is as real as you or me. Denying it under the pretense of \"It isn't trolling to go off meta\" doesn't change that trolling is real, and hated by the majority of the playerbase","replies":[{"poster":"GamerThink","date":"2016-11-06T14:21:14.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confusing off-meta picks with trolling only makes finding the actual trolls harder.

Now if you go duo top without telling the actual top laner then they probably gonna report you.\n\n> Ashe with teleport mid was a thing\n\nAdc mid used to be the meta.  I don't understand how you are arguing against the meta with this one.  It literally WAS the meta until people realized adcs were better bot with a babysitter.\n\n> AP this and that on normally AD scaling champions, before Riot removed most of them, was a thing.\n\nMost of it was cancer as well. Rememver AP yi? zero counterplay to his damage, healed for ridiculous amounts and his q reset on kils.  He was basically an untagetable katarina who then had dmg reduction and a heal.  AP tryndamere?  The most cancerous splitpusher of all time.  Out damaged and always healed back up.  \n\nAp used to work because thats how riot designed champions back then.  With Ability power on abilities and attack damage on auto attacks.  Some of them were fine and legitimately balanced (ap trist for a time) while others were pure cancer and when they were strong they were either permabanned or they solo carried games.  \n\nGoing ad bard or ad ahri today in normals is also not trolling.  Even in ranked I'd say its not as long as your team agrees to let you go ad bard.  As soon as its ranked and your team says no, then its trolling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-06T17:34:36.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"team tele-smite FTW","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-11-06T15:04:40.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Shaco jungle who forgot smite and always ran away from fights that he said he'd help with was a troll.
