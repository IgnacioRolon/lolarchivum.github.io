You can still login to your PBE account tied to the live account you are posting from.  It's currently not possible to swap the Summoner Names, but you should be able to change your name through the PBE in-client store.  Hope that helps clarify things!","replies":[{"poster":"Mãge","date":"2016-10-06T16:37:26.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=gOR73auO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-06T16:30:16.995+0000)\n>\n> Looking into this, I see you do still have an active PBE account; however, old content and summoner names from these legacy accounts will not transfer over to live PBE accounts.
