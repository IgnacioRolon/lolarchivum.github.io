Last year we made a new Q decal for Pool Party Draven and thought it would be great to go back and add unique Q indicators to his other skins, but again it was a nice idea we didn't have bandwidth for. So when Beast Hunter Draven was in the works we took the time to go back and add those in.\n\nI hope players really dig these little touches, but also understand why we can't always do everything.

The omega squad skin is a complete work of art. Nothing in league looks more cool than the enemy setting off explosive mines, only to be knifed in the face by a badass. Riot has truly made their best work with the super galaxy skins and the project skins. They are vibrant, they are brilliantly animated, they have the best splash art (in my opinion), and nothing strokes the ego more than decimating the enemy team with a flashy champion .the special effects on skins like these, are truly what make it worth getting. I know most players hate teemo (whether it's having a terrible one on your team, or playing against a good one) but I adore it when riot throws some love his way, so that players like myself can fuel the fires to the flames of hate (and look good doing it) besides no press is bad press. If no one can accept teemo for being the kind soul he is instead of the degenerate slime they've come to hate, I say this. I wouldn't have it any other way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sn0wD0gg","date":"2016-09-02T00:36:07.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like Teemo yeah he is an annoying champ, but he is good and i think a PROJECT skin for him would be sick.
