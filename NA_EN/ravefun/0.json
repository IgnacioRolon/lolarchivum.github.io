All of my current champions are either top lane or jungle and because of that, I felt like i could learn rumble more easily. But on the other hand i also wanted to experience another lane, such as mid lane, with Ahri. People said she is still strong after her nerfs, but she is hard to learn. Which of the two should i buy, or what other champions do you recommend?","replies":[{"poster":"Ch√≠ckenDaddy","date":"2016-11-05T22:36:44.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:126}}  Can go both lanes, is really fun, high skill cap, and a bit broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AcidTheWarlock","date":"2016-11-05T20:34:25.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rumble is life.\n\nBut you could try Brand or Viktor too.

He is so underplayed at lower elo that people seem to underestimate him and not know how to react to his damage ouptut.\nAhri is harder to learn and has a very high skill ceiling, and may be difficult if you are not used to that sort of kit, but is a great midlane pick right now. Just be aware of the Syndra bandwagon spammers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2016-11-05T19:22:42.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri is good but I feel like she's not that strong in lategame teamfights.
