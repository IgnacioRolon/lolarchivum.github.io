I am just wondering,what comes after the 14-days ban? Do I get rewards(chest/keys) immediately after? Am I on Riot&#039;s radar? And if so,for how long? Will saying even the most insignifiant word (e.g. &quot;stupid play&quot;) get me permanently banned? Thanks for taking the time to read and reply,and I hope I can join you soon,elitists and diplomats of this game!","replies":[{"poster":"VindicatorOFThey","date":"2018-06-20T09:57:30.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">what comes after the 14-days ban? \n\n\nit comes  perma ban , meaning  u will never  play on that acc ever again .","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2018-06-20T10:13:04.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The next few steps are simple.\n\nYou get\n\n* Reset to honor level 0, causing you to no longer get chest and keys, you need to level back to honor level 2 to be eligible again(at least that is what I heard).\n* Placed on the about to permaban list, causing your next ban to be a permaban(this stays until you have played enough games proving you are no longer toxic, from my sources it can take up to 500 neutral games to get back on Riot's not direct permaban list)\n* You are also no longer eligible for end of season rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"LISSANDRA IS KEY","date":"2018-06-20T16:29:16.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also,I think I am eligible for the end of the season rewards.
