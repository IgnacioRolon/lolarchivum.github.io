The In-Game issue i am facing, i am playing with very low Graphics settings.. on my Pentium G2020 2.9GHZ.\nWhy can't i play LoL without reaching 80%~90 more ? At almost all the time while playing your game?.. Can you specify the Processor Requirements? Because i don't believe for optimal gaming it's needed a Dual Core anymore. Since 2014 not sure why i am getting a feeling this game is getting more power hungry..\n\nI need answers to this.. i am on the verge of quiting this game, i will not say it's unplayable but that the delay i am feeling since the start of Season 6 (The whole updating sh that went through as severed the way i am playing there is screen tearing and delay)\nhttps://s16.postimg.org/k6vfbt9qd/LOL.jpg\n\n\nGigabyte Radeon HD7850 2GB OC.\nRam - 6GB.\n\nIt's so lame when a user puts so much effort on spending money to do minimalist upgrades to the system, and after a year the game no longers meet the requirements of what you are playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T18:51:47.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the delay in replying.

It's just strange that i am having this problems but this.. Since the start of season 6 the in-game updates have made my processor consume more CPU","replies":[]}]}]}
