Let me know if that&#x27;s the case for you!\n\n\n\nSorry i have just seen your message now. \nThe only programs i am running are Logitech Software and Pure VPN. \nAnd they don't consume as much, the real issue is on Post-Screen Game and in actual game, my Processor is hitting the 80% resource usage and when i check the process's list.. LoL is consuming almost all my processor! It's around 60%~70% usage. I am using a Pentium G 2020. (Dual-core)\nBought it back then on 2013 it ran LoL fine back then, at 60*% Cpu usage.\n\nWindows 7 Changed from Windows 10 to feel my pc a little faster.\n6GB Ram \nAmd HD7850 2GB OC \n\nThis is hitting pretty hard my performance while playing because i no longer feel my characters reacting fast or moving fast as before, it looks like all the game is delayed and even if i reduce the graphics from medium to very low it won't change much. i am using a HD7850.\n\nI am kinda frustated with this.. because i believe LoL it's starts to demand more of just one regular low budget processor, to much power hungry and i don't feel to upgrade my computer just because lol is consuming to much of my cpu.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarthGinger411","date":"2016-12-01T03:47:55.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client runs fine, but **the real problem** is when the game loads. It spikes my cpu usage and lags horribly. The game doesn't load until I force close the program and restart it manually. Once in game, It runs ok. If I alt+tab to google chrome or spotify or any program for that matter (windows notifications as well), the game freezes. Once again, I have to force stop and restart. All of my drivers are up to date and I've even uninstalled and reinstalled on my solid state M.2. Nothing is working and this problem didn't occur until today, Nov. 30th 2016. When the new client dropped I did notice some issues where the game would lose connection but I was still able to move around but no abilities would pop. Then about ten sec later, everything would pop all at once. I don't know what else to do and any help would be greatly appreciated.\nping: 24\nfps: 264 (uncapped)\nNvidia GeForce 1070 dual\n32Gb ram\ni7 quad core","replies":[]}]}
