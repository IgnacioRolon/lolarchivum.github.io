However I am a strong supporter of lol and love playing the game. I have to go to an activity center to play. The have this weird timer on their computer that makes me log out of my session causin me to go afk and once I get back on I'm either far behind or the game has ended and I get lower priority. I don't play ranked as often due to this but I also don't want to get an account ban over normal games. The sessions end at random moments without any notification.. I just really want to play this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T03:58:18.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd recommend buying enough time to finish all games you queue for. You may want to ask the locals how they gauge how much time to buy based on how many games they intend to play, as I feel this may be helpful in this situation.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
