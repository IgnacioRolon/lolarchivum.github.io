My ping has been a solid 60-63ms ever since the servers moved. About a week or so ago, I started getting a few games where it jumped to 83 (not spikes, but just stayed there for the whole game), and then would go back down to ~60 for the next game. Then it just stayed up at 80, and has been there the last few days.\n\nI went through the connection guide and tried everythere except port forwarding. I'm fairly certain that's not the issue - the only things I can think that might have changed between when it was 60 and now is Windows updates, or possibly something funky with my IP routing to Riot's servers. \n\nI've ruled out local network traffic - this is happening when I'm the only person using our network, and then while I'm only playing League.\n\nI found this post: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/wYUEKyPm-high-ping\n\nI followed the instructions left by the Rioter and ran a traceroute for 5-10 minutes. Here's the results:\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|        Destination network unreachable. -    1 |  660 |  658 |    0 |    1 |   14 |    0 |\n\n|                   No response from host -  100 |  133 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\n\n|te-0-1-0-11-sur03.spokane.wa.seattle.comcast.net -    1 |  660 |  659 |    7 |   12 |   30 |   10 |\n\n|be-37-ar01.burien.wa.seattle.comcast.net -    1 |  660 |  659 |   15 |   20 |   42 |   22 |\n\n|        Destination network unreachable. -    1 |  660 |  658 |   16 |   20 |   38 |   18 |\n\n|be-33650-cr01.seattle.wa.ibone.comcast.net -    1 |  660 |  659 |   35 |   40 |   73 |   43 |\n\n|        Destination network unreachable. -    1 |  660 |  658 |   34 |   39 |   57 |   41 |\n\n|                          50.248.116.194 -    1 |  660 |  659 |   34 |   38 |   56 |   43 |\n\n|                          104.160.129.35 -    1 |  660 |  659 |   34 |   39 |   56 |   42 |\n\n|          ae30-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    1 |  660 |  659 |   75 |   80 |   98 |   79 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  660 |  659 |   75 |   80 |  105 |   85 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider\n\nEDIT: \n\nI ended up having a tech come out to my house. He tweaked a few things, tightened some connections, and it seemed to fix the problem - for a glorious two or three days I was back to 60 ping. Now it's back up to 80 again. No idea why. Might have just been a crazy coincidence that it seemed to fix itself when he was here.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much of a difference 20 ping makes. Don't wanna be a drama queen, but it's really put me off of playing :(.\n\nEDIT: Just got off the phone with them again. I finally got to talk to somebody that seemed to know what they were talking about. Basically they said there wasn't anything they could do immediately, but he did give me a credit on my bill and promised to escalate the issue and get back to me if they discovered anything.\n\nI was given a number that is supposed to get directly to their advanced tech support team: Dial 1-800-934-6489, then press 1, press 1 again, then press 2. Basically what you're doing is working through the robot secretary to get to an agent, so if that exact sequence of number presses doesn't work than just do whatever the robot says to get to an agent.","replies":[{"poster":"xade","date":"2016-09-27T22:28:44.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issues as you Hideous, and I also live in the Spokane area.
