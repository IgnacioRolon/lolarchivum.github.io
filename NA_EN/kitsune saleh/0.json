When you try to access it it is either **very** slow, gives you a blank box, gives an error message, or shows nothing at all, about 90% of the time. It takes about 10 minutes of clicking back and forth to get the store to actually come up. I have talked to friends and they have the same problem. very annoying.{{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"AngryMushrooms","date":"2015-01-10T02:33:05.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't use internet explorer. I have a clean cash, and I still cant get into the shop. I've had this problem for over  a month. ALL of my friends are having this problem as well. Its not a black screen either. Sometimes its black and other times if I click back and forth on the tabs it WILL come up entirely. The main problem is the store won't let me buy anything. I can look at skins or champions if I do the stupid click back and forth a few times, but the RP purchase button does not work at all for me. I click it. It shows me click it. Nothing happens. If I try to buy the skin for my champion while I'm in que for a bot game (yes I thought to try that) it tries to tell me I don't own the champ though obviously I do because I'm in que to play the champ. If I go to my Summoner Profile any of my champs I click no longer show OWNED but instead say UNLOCK CHAMPION with question marks for the RP and IP value. This is NOT related to my computer. It is straight up a League issue. This started happening after their patch in December. PLEASE FIX IT SO I CAN GIVE YOU MY MONEY ALREADY! xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-01-09T23:50:47.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rawk,\n\nThe error you're receiving is usually related to your Internet Explorer settings.
