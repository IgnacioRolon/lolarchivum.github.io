You used to have to aim it and fire instead of just press q and it auto fires.\n\nI preferred the original yasuo Q to the point I stopped playing him after the change.\n\nTaliyah knock up was also changed for \"quality of life\" adjustments and I don't really like how it functions now compared to before when I had no problems with it before, I still try to play taliyah from time to time but I don't \"enjoy\" playing her anymore.\n\nVelkoz is a champion I actually like playing so if history repeats itself any future changes I probably will not like.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ekitaih","date":"2017-12-29T15:21:01.372+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree.
