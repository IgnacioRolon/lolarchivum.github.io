However when i catch up, everything doesnt just appear, it occurs like it normally would but in super fast speeds \r\n\r\nIn game, everything will freeze except for my champ. I can move my champ around fine and my team sees me moving, but i cant see anything else going on as it is all frozen. Lasts from 5 secs to around 30 sometimes \r\n\r\nI added a link of an example of what the in game lag looks like \r\n\r\nMy fps is rly high and I dont know what the issue could be, can anyone help? thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T00:33:51.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This looks like a network problem failing to communicate information between yourself and the game server.  It might be packet loss, but you can use a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to know for sure.  My recommendation would be to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fix that up.

I previously played on a mac laptop up until last week and had no problems with this, problems only started with my new pc. This means that its something to do with my settings on the new pc right?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T16:38:12.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Videos can say a lot of things, but the log reader give solid information on your specific issue.  There could certainly be some settings that's slowing down your network, and unless you have a bad piece of network hardware, it should be resolvable.  I recommend starting out with the connection issues guide I previously linked to rule out possibilities.  You can test them out in a custom game to make sure.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"sna","date":"2017-01-06T00:31:08.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried some of the things on the connection page, but is there a point in contacting my provider? league has no packet loss on my laptop but has it on pc. Also league is the only game i experience packet loss in so its not rly an isp error","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
