Can a Rioter please let me know what is taking so long just to get some sort of answer that at least lets me know im getting closer to a response from a human or could even better help out with the process... this is very stressful it doesnt help that my mother needs the money soon as well.\r\nWith concern, \r\n                        A loyal league player","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-11T19:50:25.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really despise the dishonest act of phishing, and I'm sorry that you had to go through it.  I looked into your case and see that you have quite a few tickets open on this, which can cause delays and confusion in responding to you- one is enough.  The body of the ticket is also not the most detailed, so you may be asked some verification questions once a specialist receives your case.  The queue is currently at a higher volume, so it will be a bit before you receive a response.  In the meantime, I recommend going over the [account protection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) guide to help secure your info in and outside of league.
