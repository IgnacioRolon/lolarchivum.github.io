I checked ur profile and all you are doing is flaming people who got bans.

The whole witch hunt for toxic players  just becomes part of the usually player interaction.\nBefore you had disagreements about whatever and sometimes it ended with a bit of flame.\nNow it ends with flaming, followed by calling each other toxic and reporting each other.\n\nA lot of players just have this narrative in their heads, that they are always right, they are the better players, it's the other's fault, the others are toxic, the others deserve a report.\n\nSo basically until you and many others stop reporting players for shit you are doing yourself, this discussion is just pointless.\n\nRiot probably knows that their system doesn't actually improve player behavior however they don't care, because they also know that players who get each other banned will still pay money after losing their account and on top of that they can still use the system as good PR. \"Oh look at us, we really care, our game is inclusive and blah blah!\" LUL","replies":[]}]}
