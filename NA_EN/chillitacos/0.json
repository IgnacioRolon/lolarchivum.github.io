My first post ever on here. I recently encountered a problem that says \"Connection error: Could not connect to Pvp.net\" while I'm logging in. I had no problems patching 6.21 yesterday. I could play normal league games. Today, however, I could not play league for the day due to this problem. I don't think my connection is the issue here, since I'm pretty sure it's stable. I hope you guys can help me!{{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T15:45:33.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the boards!  It sounds like your network is trying to connect to the login servers in order to authenticate and login, but failing to establish that connection.  Go over the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to make sure your network is tuned up and able to establish comms.  Even if your connection is stable, you can still have problems specifically connecting to a server.  Hopefully, that will get you fixed up but let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"ChilliTacos","date":"2016-10-20T16:10:29.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for replying so quickly! I don't know if this is related to the issues but yesterday I was in a different city in a different hotel. Now, I'm in a new hotel and in a different city. Does this have anything to do with the connection issues? I looked over the connection issues. I've done the DNS fix up earlier myself, but didn't work. Firewall has been turned off also before i even encountered this issue. I'm  not good with computers so I can't fully understand how to do stuff like the Ports that were part of the suggestions. I really appreciate your help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-20T16:21:04.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, it could simply be the condition or internet quality of the hotel you're staying at especially if it's over wi-fi.  The connection may be too poor to maintain a solid connection.  I'd hit up the hotel to check on the quality of your connection and see if they can assist.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ChilliTacos","date":"2016-10-21T08:30:23.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I figured out the problem. It was the hotel's internet server is denying to log into the game. I tried with 3G internet with an another phone and I was able to log in. I appreciate your help! :) EDIT: I also found another solution!!! I also downloaded a VPN for mac and that works too!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
