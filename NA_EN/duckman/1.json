With that in your history, going AFK in a single game could have landed you in the LPQ track and could've caused this one match LPQ to pop up.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draconic Ghosts","date":"2016-11-22T22:40:41.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me today. I have no record of leaving in my last 20 games. I doubt Riot will do anything about it though.\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nJust restarted my pvp client and re joined the queue.
