After I rejoined, It was 13 mins in and I played the rest of the game. I then got a leaver. People told me to do the hextech tool but whenever i click on it it asks for admin password and after I  enter it in nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThis is a long cycle that keeps going on and on and I keep having to wait 20 mins before each game for 5 games when I am really short on time.\r\n\r\nPls halp {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-03T23:45:29.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should only be getting LPQ punishments after the system starts to detect a history of being marked as AFK. It does kinda feel bad, but even disconnections can mark you as AFK if you're out of the game long enough. The system isn't smart enough to tell the difference between a force close quit or loss of connection, but regardless, both of those put your team at an unfair disadvantage which is the main point for getting punished in those situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malum Unos","date":"2017-12-03T16:16:10.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a bug splat and am getting punished so i feel ya.
