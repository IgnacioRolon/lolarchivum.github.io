I think the hardest thing to do as him is the positioning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-11-16T03:20:03.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Karthus is probably one of the best scaling champions in the game, his late game damage is insane and he doesn't even need to be alive to deal damage\n\nCass is similar and has great sustained damage and objective control, takes a lot of micro but if you can get that down her kiting is amazing\n\nAzir is also pretty good for sustained damage output and can be a pretty good lane bully with his soldiers, takes a lot of skill to get the most out of his kit though, so if you're a mediocre Azir it's not really as worth it to play him\n\nAnivia is more of a CC and nuke mage than the rest, not as much sustained DPS, but she has great wave clear and can do some pretty high damage and keep enemies from getting away pretty well, but she is pretty low mobility.\n\nI would also recommend picking up Viktor, he has great poke and burst at all stages of the game and his W controls space really well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BÃ¢rd","date":"2015-11-16T02:42:05.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:61}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mathbalnase","date":"2015-11-16T02:25:51.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't call Cass and Karth 'control mages'.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-16T02:39:19.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno.
