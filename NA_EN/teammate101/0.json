NO!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nMy family watches a lot of Netflix and it creates a lot of packet loss and ping problems for me while I play LoL. To my luck, my router has a built-in QoS (Quality of Service) function which allows me to not only monitor the bandwidth usage of each client connected to the Internet via wireless or LAN but it also allows me to limit the bandwidth available to the clients. \n\nTo my surprise this seemed like the perfect solution yet it doesn't completely fixes the issue with League of Legends despite having the right maths applied to it.\n\nI have a 17MbpsD/10MbpsU Internet speed and I limited Netflix to only use 5Mbps. This leaves enough (more than enough giving the fact that League of Legends uses a mere 10Kbps rate ) speed for League of Legends to work properly without bandwidth throttle. Unfortunately, my ping still spikes up to 150ms or so from 31ms ... It improved a lot to say the least but far from acceptable in a competitive environment (Ranked). Before setting the speed limiter, my ping was surfing around 800-900ms because as we all know, watching Netflix in 4K is asking for trouble. \n\nNow my question is; why do I still get these ping irregularities if the game has enough networking power to otherwise run flawlessly?  This is where I ask the community to pitch in their knowledge about networking and what not to figure out what exactly causes this mess. \n\nThanks for anyone willing to help, greatly appreciated! {{item:3681}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-24T18:07:40.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's great that you've taken action to moderate data, and your issue could just be some local wear and tear.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) just to make sure that this is packet loss.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as well to make sure that everything locally is running smoothly.  Hopefully that will do the trick, but let me know!","replies":[]}]}
