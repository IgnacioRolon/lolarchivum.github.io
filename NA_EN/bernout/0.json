Keys and chest drops are separate from each other. They do not affect the other in anyway at all.\n\nChests drop from getting an S or higher from you or a pre-made with you on a champion that doesn't already have a chest.\n\nKeys are simply by winning a game. But it is _**Pure RNG**_. Meaning it's a chance they will drop. This chance is increased the more people in a pre-made as well. But they are on a nonlinear drop chance, this means that once you earn a key frag the next one has a lower chance and so on for every time you earn a key frag. Then after 30 days from your first key frag drop the chance resets back to it's starting value.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-07-11T21:55:05.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide\n\nit does not say anywhere that you need to have a chest available in order to earn a key. They always have a chance at dropping whenever you win a matchmade game. However, every time you earn a key fragment, the chance of the next one dropping is lowered. The dorp rate does reset about 30 days after you earn your first key at the original drop rate.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-07-11T04:19:49.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keys fragments are Pure RNG when you win if you get them.
