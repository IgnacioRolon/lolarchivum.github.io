I shared a link with my GF and she signed up... she was never prompted for the referring summoner. After she hit level 10, I looked at my RAF page and she was on the Pending Invitation side... I emailed RIOT and they claimed there is nothing they can do. It happened to a second friend and he got a webpage error on the signup page when he tried to do the CAPTCHA requirements... So at least two of my referrals haven't been recorded even though they are using my signup link, presumably because the signup page is crapping out with all the java problems people are having these days... it sucks and my friends were trying to help me and had their first 'RITO pls' experience before playing their first game. At least one of my referrals isn't going to play because of this, but alas, there's nothing RIOT can do, according to support.","replies":[{"poster":"BernOut","date":"2015-08-21T21:23:54.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah, I have heard from a few people that using the referral link is buggy and it is better off inputting the summoner's name on account creation. \n\nWhile it's great to hear that it's not gone yet, it sucks to hear about your friends disappointment.","replies":[]}]}]}
