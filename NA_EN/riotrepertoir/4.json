What follows is our opinion on the state of the champion in the game currently, including not only the things we think went well, but also the stuff that hasn&#039;t quite worked out.\r\n\r\nOur original goals for Skarner were to align him with a Juggernaut playstyle/fantasy and to establish an identity as a powerful objective controller amongst Juggernauts. To that end, there is some stuff that we think is working, and some stuff that isn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what we think is working as of now:\r\n\r\n* **We do think that Skarner succeeds in presenting himself as a much bigger threat around the main neutral objective points of contestation.** Interestingly, when the 6.9 patch launched last week, early data showed that Skarner actually benefits more from his team obtaining Mountain Drake&#039;s buff than any other champion. That was pretty cool to see.\r\n* **As a Juggernaut, Skarner&#039;s access to the enemy backline is meaningfully reduced.** In this way, he does more closely resemble a Juggernaut&#039;s strengths/weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThat said, there&#039;s some stuff that isn&#039;t working, most of which stem from two primary issues with the update:\r\n\r\n* **We probably just shouldn&#039;t have tried to make Skarner a full on Juggernaut.** Without monumental changes to the champion, he probably will not ever be an effective one. The champion had a history of being a sticky, low damage threat, and trying to make him a Juggernaut meant we had to reduce that stickiness significantly, alienating his current player base&#039;s playstyle. Additionally, given the powerful crowd control tools in his kit, Skarner will almost certainly be better off building really tanky and optimizing to maximize his CC.\r\n* **Skarner&#039;s Crystal Spires passive occupies too much mindshare within the game for the play it&#039;s actually generating.** This is especially true for all the non-Skarner&#039;s in the game, who didn&#039;t necessarily opt in to the experience. The sheer level of involvement required for everyone in the game is a large part of what makes the passive feel &quot;mini-gamey&quot; or arbitrary. Additionally, the magnitude of the effects in the zones does lead to Skarner feeling relatively weak outside of them.\r\n\r\nSo what does all that mean moving forward? While Skarner does seem to perform well in his role as an objective controller, he does have the aforementioned issues. Given the opportunity to do some cleanup work on the champion, we would probably look to:\r\n\r\n* Explore options to reduce total mindshare (especially for other players) required by his passive.\r\n* Adjust his stat profile to be a bit less Juggernaut-y and a bit more Diver/Vanguard-like.\r\n* Look to reduce some of his dependency on snowball to succeed.\r\n\r\nGiven this assessment, there may be some follow-up work we can do to clean up some of those issues, and we may try some small scope experimental stuff on the PBE to see how they feel.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry for the delay on getting this out.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Skypual","date":"2016-05-11T18:31:57.790+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":5,"body":"Are you considering just removing the spire passive?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-05-11T18:40:16.476+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":78,"body":"No. We are considering reducing the total amount that people in the game have to play around it.","replies":[{"poster":"WendÃ­go","date":"2016-05-11T18:58:57.857+0000","up_votes":62,"down_votes":11,"body":"Is it really that hard for you guys to admit the spires are dumb?\nOr that Skarner never needed to be an objective control Juggernaut?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-05-11T19:44:54.136+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":55,"body":"\"Spires are dumb\" is not really a conversation.

We need more people like you :)\n\nIf I can probe you a little more: what do you think about Skarner being an objective controller, independently of **how** this is achieved? If spire weren't involved, would you like this aspect of \"Don't you dare contest my dragon/baron or I'll wreck you\"?\n\nBecause Repertoir said that this was their objective with the Jugg Roster Update, and this is in essence the only thing in their \"correctly working category\" (the other point being just a technicality).","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2016-05-11T20:41:47.280+0000","up_votes":48,"down_votes":0,"body":"The spires are the main thing making him an objective controller. Outside of that, he lacks either strong DPS for taking objectives quickly or good AoE CC that would allow him to punish enemies attempting to fight in the narrow entrances to dragon or baron pit. Mechanically, nothing about him works well for those areas.\n\nThe shrines do allow him to be a threat in those areas, but it's mainly through stat superiority. You don't fight Skarner in Dragon pit because he's just a stronger fighter than you there. You don't fight Skarner if he's even a bit ahead and going for your red because you just can't win. It's not very engaging for the Skarner player because it lacks high moments (just hitting harder isn't very fun), and because it means that if you can't control the shrines, you always feel weak.\n\nI'm still not certain that objective control is really his greatest strength. I personally play him for much the same reasons someone would play Volibear: strong fighting for punishing immobile or burst-based champions with the potential for a strong flash-engage. Objective control is a nice side-benefit, but it doesn't factor in very much. Without the spires, it wouldn't factor in at all. \n\nThat said, I don't mind that Riot wants him to be good at objective control. I just don't want him to only do it through stat-stick gameplay that leaves him feeling undertuned outside of them. Given that he still lacks significantly unique mechanics outside of the spires, I can see why Riot is reluctant to remove them, but that doesn't really do anything to help the players out.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-11T20:50:53.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sightless66,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=T5MTYIIt,comment-id=0002000000030000000000010001,timestamp=2016-05-11T20:41:47.280+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m still not certain that objective control is really his greatest strength. \n\nAnd would you like it to be?

However, how do you incorporate spires without making you seem weak outside of them? If they provide something only to Skarner, then he is always going to be weaker outside of them. If they provide something to everyone, such as vision/gold, you make it a bit too much for the enemy to have at their disposal as well.\n\nNot to mention that spires are in set locations on the map. Once grouping starts and you are pushing down towers and having fights in the lane, Skarner completely loses out on his spire passive.\n\nThey're not a great mechanic but there might be a way to make them work. Having them in set places doesn't feel right because as I said, you either have them or you dont, and when you don't, its not always because of lack of control, simply a different location on the map.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-05-11T19:55:00.230+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=T5MTYIIt,comment-id=0002000000030000,timestamp=2016-05-11T19:44:54.136+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Spires are dumb&quot; is not really a conversation.

NOBODY likes playing around them. Its just another dimension to deny success to Skarner, which is WHY people are building in ways that he doesn't need the spires. \n\nYou guys really should look at removing them in the future, otherwise just give the benefits in river/jungle totally (similar to the mana regen in river/jungle), albeit reduced effectiveness, and slightly buffing base stats.\n\nIf you don't want to touch the passive, then what are your thoughts on players trying to bypass the passive completely?

Enemies wouln't have to keep capturing spires, but could still deny Skarner the opportunity to capture it by controlling the area. Now they could also wait out the buff he gets, an option that didn't exist before.\n\nI'm curious if you already have tried something like this before, though? It's a bit simpler, but if you did I figure testing _**could**_ have shown it didn't promote good gameplay or such?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrStingYoGirl","date":"2016-05-11T20:08:27.002+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, diamond skarner main here, reached #1 Skarner NA earlier this season. \n\nSkarner is actually quite strong right now, he's just fairly uninteractive. His ult and Q are already not very interactive spells (I think the last iteration where his Q stacked up to a stun and his Ult consumed stacks to do more damage made him a bit more interesting). \n\nHis passive is also hugely binary. Not only did it singlehandedly destroy his ability to go top lane (which I loved to do), it also put him in the weird place of being stronger based on where on the map he was. This was ok for invading and baron/dragon, but otherwise too easy to play around. Other champions with similarly binary strengths, such as late game scales or early game menaces, have ways to take advantage of their relative strengths to cover their relative weaknesses, but skarner can't other than to get free dragons because his strengths are so cut-and-dry (you may mess up and duel a voli bear at level 2 not knowing how much his bite does early game, but skarner has literal 'do not enter' circles). \n\nThis isn't to say he's bad, in fact I've had great success with him, and know others who have as well. It's just that he's so binary in every aspect other than his E (which by the way is great, love the cd reduction mechanic) that nobody wants to play him. \n\nNow, what would I like to see? First and foremost, make his Q more rewarding to hit consistently. It feels completely useless at the moment. Earlier it had a buff the more you hit it, a permaslow, or a stacking stun. My favorite was the stacking buff because it made skarner scale up as the fight dragged on, which felt amazing. \n\nHis W and E are in good places in my opinion, I like the Cd reduction mechanic on E and the speed ramp-up on W.\n\nHis ult also could use minor tweaking, I'd love to see its duration extended on targets debufed by your E/Q/Whatever you want to attach it to. That way it's still good for the sudden ults out of nowhere (but maybe tone down the initial power so thats its not a case of buy QSS or lose the game) but also becomes more devastating the longer skarner is in the fight. \n\nHis passive, obviously needs a complete rework. The stacking srun was my favorite, but I really like his new E as well. What I would really love to see is skarner storing up crystal energy as he hits his Q, then entering a supercharged state, darius-style when he stacks up, which makes him move and attack faster and maybe empowers his ult. \n\nI'm really glad you're revisiting Skarner, I've played 2000+ games of the little guy and gotten two different accounts to diamond on his back, so I'm always happy to see where he goes. \n\nAlso I'd love to see more skarner players\n\nI miss my kind","replies":[{"poster":"Deadeye Rolf","date":"2016-05-11T23:01:42.132+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a Plat Skarner/Shyvana main since the two came out somewhat near each other.

Playing around objective control never feels rewarding when I play Skarner, and I don't find myself making decisions based around objective control with Skarner anymore than I do with other champions. My success case is much more based around aspects other than objective control than it is based around objective control. Even in the class of tanky bruiser-ish champions, he isn't my go-to for objective control because AoE tank junglers like Amumu threaten to win fights around the baron and dragon with more ease than Skarner does.\n\nI would strongly advise removing the spire passive or weakening it with the eventual goal of removal, and moving him more towards a diving tank playstyle. This would fit his fantasy much better.\n\n>As a Juggernaut, Skarner's access to the enemy backline is meaningfully reduced. In this way, he does more closely resemble a Juggernaut's strengths/weaknesses.\n\nIs this really a positive thing? Ulting the backline is arguably the only big unique moment in his kit right now. He doesn't really have anything else unique going on for him. Smacking the frontline around for mediocre damage and unreliable CC all the time doesn't feel good.\n\n>Additionally, the magnitude of the effects in the zones does lead to Skarner feeling relatively weak outside of them.\n\nUnderstatement of the year right here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"arghilost","date":"2016-05-11T18:33:13.842+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey there, one of the few high elo skarner players on NA here. Some things on your post\n\n1. Reducing/getting rid of the minigame of the spires should be a top priority. If your team is well adapted/team players, you have a very large advantage over the other teams jungler. If your team is lazy/clueless, then you are at a very big disadvantage from the very beginning when the other team opts to capture your river spires. Very frustrating and gives the skarner player little autonomy on if he wants to be aggressive or passive.\n\n2. Please do not change his role from a juggernaut, that would be a huge mistake. There is already a glaring void of juggernauts in the jungle role, this would pretty much send them into extinction/top lane only. You also alienate his playerbase who like him being super unkillable but not really able to get to the backline. I do not want to be playing another vi/wukong/etc. Don't make him generic. He is rewarded greatly for good positioning/playmaking and punished when you dont properly assess a teamfight.\n\n3. On the other hand, a good leaf to take from other champs would be something like a wukong passive. If he's supposed to be an objective controller/teamfighting juggernaut, you could have his attack speed/movespeed scale based on the number of allied champs within a certain radius of him for example.\n\n4. I'm not sure why you guys feel he is snowball dependent? he is one of the best jungle farmers in the game, up there with shyvana level speeds. He definitely is not even close to lee sin/shaco/etc in needing to get kills.

The thing here is that Juggernaut is really just a name for something that is not well defined. It would be bad to say there are no fighters in the jungle but to say there are no juggernauts is trivial since there are only 4 in the game... well, 2 actually if we are to be honest; Mordekaiser is a subject for a some other day but ill speak my mind about Skarner who most people will agree is not an actual Juggernaut despite Riots best efforts. He is and has always been a Vanguard (thats what they call them now isn't it?) no matter how you look at him. \n\nLets compere some quick stats. Out of the 4 so called Juggernauts Skarner has:\n-Roughly the same defense as the others\n-Way less damage than any of the other\n-Way more agility than the others\n-Way more CC than the other 3 combined\n\nThe main objective of the Juggernauts is roughly to wear out the enemy frontline with several slow yet moderately to highly offensive abilities, they can do this also because of their toughness, however their lack of mobility impedes them from reaching the back lines. This is the exact opposite of what Skarner does; with tankyness and movespeed he runs past the frontline (which he cant harm with his low damage) to deliver the moderate to heavy CC to the priprity targets in the back line so his team can follow up. Now i'm not a Skarner main but I'm confident this is what he does best and not fight tanks one on one like Darius or Garen. This makes him a vanguard in my opinion.\n\n\nThat being said, he really didnt change much with the juggernaut update IMO, he is still tanky, he is still fast, he has more CC actually, he just lost damage. So in relation to your concerns, having Riot make him a proper vanguard like the main post states probably wont change any of these things. At least i dont think we will see Skarner change much in the near future, I doubt Riot would turn him into a diver like Vi or Wukong which you stated.  \n \n> [{quoted}](name=arghilost,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=T5MTYIIt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-11T18:33:13.842+0000)\n> \nOn the other hand, a good leaf to take from other champs would be something like a wukong passive.

Its just like the issue with Tarics old armor aura, it is not perceived by the player and is therefore not impactful or satisfying. I like the minigames, they just have to be well designed IMO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hopeful4","date":"2016-05-11T18:57:37.118+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"As ive said many times before: The idea of crystals was good, but the implementation was poor.
