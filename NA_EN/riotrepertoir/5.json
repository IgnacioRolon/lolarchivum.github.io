I know a lot of players want Cass to be more &quot;poison mage&quot; than she currently is, and I think I have a good grasp on how that may be able to manifest, but I don&#039;t really know what that means as far as what they want from Twin Fang. It may just be that you want Twin Fang to remain mostly as it is now, with kit changes elsewhere. It may be that you want there to be more times where casting Twin Fang isn&#039;t the best thing to be doing.\n\nAny opinions on the matter would be greatly appreciated. For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;m probably not going to be able to invest time in hundreds of responses to this thread, but I will check in on it periodically to get your ideas.\n\nThanks,\nRepertoir\n\nEdit:\nThanks for all the input here. I'm not sure exactly what this means is going to come of Cass or Twin Fang, but I am going to try a some iterations based on what's going on here. I don't think this single thread can really provide a singular correct direction to take things, but it's at least given me some perspective on how people feel about the ability. For what it's worth, I'm probably going to test out some stuff where E has cool interactions on poisoned targets that aren't simply a reset (and probably lower the cooldown baseline), and I'd also like to test out some different iterations that seek to put some more gameplay behind when it's actually a good time to go in and E spam (unlike on Live, where the answer is basically always), and make those times really rewarding.

I think it would be more interesting to have twin-fang as a catalyst for enabling her poisons on targets.  Perhaps separating q and w(and maybe R?) into actually different poisons, and having Twin Fang enable a different additional effect based on poisons that are currently applied to the target.  Basic example - if applying twin fang to a target poisoned with noxious blast, the target suffers an additional % hp DOT for the remainder of the poison, while applying twin fang to a  target poisoned with miasma applies a stronger slow for the duration of the miasma poisoning.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimaropa","date":"2016-01-25T06:07:13.210+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":5,"body":"Seems like a good idea.\n \nBut her Twin Fang seems like her only damaging spell late game(which is loaded too; heal, mana refund, cd when enemy is poisoned).\nI would prefer it and also her passive to be changed.

Thanks for hearing us out on this, we ***really*** appreciate it!\n\nFor me personally, I've always seen Cass's E as her \"trusty side-arm.\" It was her key tool for finishing off her weak prey before they could run away, but more importantly, it was her core defensive mechanism.\n\nWhen I played old cass, unless I was ridiculously fed, I found myself using her E more often as my last line of defense before the enemy killed me rather than using it to mow down my opponents left and right. A common situation I'd find myself in would be the enemy dives me, I drop my W and stun them with my ult then Q+EEEEE till they either died, I died, or I escaped some how.\n\nOnce team fights break out, I'd use my E a lot less unless I was using it to kill an enemy that dove deep to kill an ally of mine.\n\nFor suggestions worth trying, I'd like to see you experiment with %missing hp on her E to help emphasize using it as a finisher. I don't think it needs to be turned into a skill shot as the simplicity of a point and click on cass still has merits. I just think the current iteration does too much damage and forces cass to play too aggro at ranges she's not comfortable playing at.\n\nTo me, cass felt kinda like ahri. You skirt around the edges of a fight whittling down your foes until the time was right to strike the killing blow. So maybe try to play up some of those aspects. Focus on the 'back-and-forth' nature of cass and her prey while still giving cass tools to deal with divers while still rewarding the enemy for getting in her face.","replies":[]}]}
