{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2019-04-26T17:00:08.511+0000","title":"Early 9.10 Patch Discussion","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all,\r\n\r\nWith patch 9.9 on its way out the door, we can begin looking forward to what the 9.10 patch could bring to Summoner’s Rift. For 9.10, we’re tentatively working on the following:\r\n\r\n* Riven\r\n* Vayne\r\n* Master Yi\r\n* Runic Echoes\r\n* General Champion/Item/Rune Tuning\r\n\r\n**Riven / Vayne**\r\nThe immediate questions for both Riven and Vayne are “Why now? What’s changed?” Insofar as their place in the game or their performance within the game, not a whole lot has changed, honestly. Both have been powerful for a string of patches, but we didn't think their performance was absolutely out of line for the game. This can be contrasted with a case like Hecarim, whose performance did clearly stand out from the rest in 9.9, and was therefore directly nerfed. \r\n\r\nInstead, Riven and Vayne are both strong and commonly frustrating, even if their performance isn’t crossing critical thresholds. For champions in this situation, we’d prefer to address that disparity in longer-form work, and we’ll do that when we think that’s the highest priority work we can be doing. Taking that and returning to the original question, now is a good opportunity for us to sink some deeper time into them beyond just their power level.\r\n\r\n**Master Yi**\r\nMaster Yi has a history of stomping lower MMR games and being much less effective the higher on the ladder he’s played. We’re looking to see if we can make his performance not so heavily disparate by skill level. Possible avenues include increasing agency but reducing scaling, adding executional skill checks, and/or adding clearer counterplay opportunities against him.\r\n\r\n**Runic Echoes**\r\nWe’ll be looking into whether Runic Echoes is strong enough or if, for example, its best users are being held to standards more comparable to Warrior’s average-to-good users.\r\n\r\n**General Champion/Item/Rune Tuning**\r\nOnce 9.9 has been out in the wild for a few days, we’ll add some more stuff to 9.10 patch based on what we’re seeing from 9.9. Those usually hit the PBE the week after a new patch hits.\r\n\r\nThat about wraps things up! Though details are light, we hope this provides some amount of clarity as to what you might see in the near future.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRiotRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"letsfeedtogether","date":"2019-04-26T17:04:36.229+0000","up_votes":109,"down_votes":26,"body":"vladimir could use a nerf 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tobykachu","date":"2019-04-26T17:14:35.531+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":10,"body":"Vladimir is commonly placed in the same category as Vayne and Riven at the moment and is commonly requested to be nerfed alongside these two.

Any chance you can look into changing stat thresholds for her evolutions if you are going to gut the core evolution item for Kaisa? (As in it is the go to 2nd item to unlock evolutions). Because if this nerf goes through, unless you enter a skirmish/teamfight with stacks it's likely going to be long over before the passive is any useful.\n\nBecause if you keep nerfing the items that Kaisa is forced into because of the evolution thresholds she either needs a compensation buff or changes to how much stats she needs. \n\nAny possibilities about maybe making stat needed scaling down with something like R rank? \n\ne.g:100 ad/100 ap/100% as is still base values, each rank in R lowers these by 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Fajerk","date":"2019-04-26T21:20:43.438+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would not say it is a straight nerf for Kai'sa, especially if they increase the early pen values.\n\nKai'Sa dmg profile really benefits from hybrid pen, thus higher values mid-game would definitely compensate for less passive procs.\n\nThe real issue would be later in the game, at which point there is full pen value present on live. Because of this, I would much rather see passive buffs, rather than evolution threshold changes (especially since stormrazor seems to be due to more buffs as still nobody really uses it).

The champion itself that is not the issue. Even by just looking at the kit, as you mentioned, it is relatively balanced. However, there are two main issues regarding Riven. One issue is Riven's itemization. The majority of Riven mains build Deaths Dance and Spear of Shojin. These two items alone what makes Riven frustrating to play against with the amount of sustain you could get with DD (along with the runes, which I will explain later) along with her being tanky and sticky as well with Spear of Shojin. Adding on about the runes, there are too many smaller runes that give sustain such as Ravenous Hunter and Taste of Blood (Domination), Triumph and Legend: Bloodline (Precision), Time Warp Tonic and Biscuit Delivery (Inspiration). Idk if you or have or haven't nerfed  Ravenous Hunter and Taste of Blood, but having those kinds sustain runes along with Death's Dance makes it way too OP. Maybe just get Grievous Wounds and that will solve everything right? Partially, but that doesn't solve the whole issue. Then we get to the main crux of the problem. She stacks Conqueror way too quickly. Just completing a fast q combo would get her 5 stacks with a snap of a finger. Sure there are others that could stack quickly like Jax or Renekton, but not as fast as Riven. Plus the fact you get true damage along with healing is just absolutely absurd. Even low to players are having success just based on these two main factors. \n\nThe actual main issue that needs to be resolved is the Conqueror rune and the items that I mentioned. If you go with this change, RiotRepertoir, I am sure that the player base will go down and a disservice to the Riven community because of this.\n\nP.S. Please do not gloss over this post pls.

At the moment Rageblade offers too much for it to be a a 2 item buy. \n\nMaster Yi is another one that abuses the Conqueror True damage and the fact he has a both a AD steroid and a true damage one which is perfect for once again {{item:3124}}.  \n\nYou need to **remove the healing** from Conqueror and **make the true damage scale with the enemies HP, targeted mostly to tanks**.  It makes no sense for Conqueror to be good at everything when you have PTA to offer that alternative. Conqueror needs to be **only** good vs Tanks. And PTA only good for small trades and squishy targets. \n\n\n{{item:3285}} and Runic Echoes need to be removed from the first buy choice in both roles. They bring too much burst damage and makes it so they are only valuable to burst mages or assassins. I have been begging for this throughout 2 years ever since the changes to mage itemization and chamption mana pools in the midlane….You didnt solve anything with the changes, you only favoured burst and let the other mages in the dirt. **Artillery mages have serious mana problems right now** , especially Xerath where he cant even wave clear decently anymore and Ludens just doesnt work with their class. And PLEASE **bring back DeathFire Torch**. It was literally the only way for poke mages to have some kind of scaling in the late game. **Comet is unreliable and just useless at points.** \n\nI know you might think that Deathfire Torch was just a \"stat steroid\" however it was a fair rune. Weak in early, strong in late with items. It wasnt overpowered and fit its theme perfectly. It also gave a nice alternative to Thunderlord Decree at that time. **So please bring it back.** \n\n\n#AP itemization:\n\n Needs to have different build paths and items for each class (Battle Mages, Artillery mages and Burst mages/Assassins). I dont know why is this never adressed. Support and AP itemization is honestly so poor.\n\n\n**Void Staff cant be bought by Assassins/Burst Mages and Battle mages, because they are meant to kill fairly squishy targets, not whole teams.**\n\n{{item:3020}} Right now gives 18 Magic Penetration, **The Highest** in the game, and it only costs 1100 gold. Why do champions need 18 magic penetration this early in the game? Just lower it down to 15 again or to 12. \n\n\n\n#Champions Base Stats: \n\nNeeds to be reevaluated and just put in order depending on the champions classes and what they are supposed to do. It makes no sense for an example a battle mage to burst a champion down, or a Artillery mage to have bursty itemization. It also makes no sense that talon has 1000+ base mana while Xerath only has around 800, along with the other artillery mages. Theres examples of this not only in mid lane, but in other champions from various places. \n\n\n\n\n\n#Kletomancy is abused and non interactive and should be removed or make it a lower rune that works for supports only by shielding or healing allies only in a cooldown. The Rune breeds unfair and toxic strategies and exploits in the game and also is literally the only reason Kayle is as strong early as people make it seem. And the nerfs to her wont fix it, and instead only kill the champion for those who want to play her properly. \n\n#Jungler Itemization:\n\nThis junglers items are honestly sad to see. The fact junglers have to take from other roles to actually have their jungler item just makes it seem they are only worth to Smite objectives, thats all. First of all remove all the jungler items, and make it so Smite can be upgraded only depending how many objectives or takedowns you got. Secondly bring creative effects for junglers to use on neutral creatures/monsters along to create a lot more diversity and interactive ways a jungler can interact around the map and also make plays. Atm the jungler effects are dull and are just stat bonuses. \n\n\n#Pro Play buffs and Nerfs: \n\n\nIt makes no sense for a champion to be buffed to be playable in Pro Play while others arent. Why are we favouring this champion and not others? Do you see the fallacy in this?  Also what exactly makes a champion strong in pro play? Is Tahm Kench strong in Pro Play even though hes not top priority and only functions as a protector role, which btw is what he is supposed to do, yet we are nerfing this because?\n\n\nAs you can see we need to change how we approach the balance changes and focus on the real issues and the big picture and not look at small things to change just because we feel like. There are many other issues that I would love to discuss and talk about, and Im always open to give constructive feedback and hopefully highlight the issues that need to be adressed because I think I speak for the majority of people, the game right now isnt fun or rewarding to play and theres champions that were completely forgotten.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YL 666","date":"2019-04-26T17:13:51.897+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":6,"body":"What about Wukong? still nothing for him?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emo Twink","date":"2019-04-26T18:14:20.301+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":15,"body":"Can you let Yuumi settle for a bit before nerfing her for most the season?

I feel that these actions would be excessive. Riven is currently extremely strong, yes, as shown by her current win rate and ban rate. However, it can also be seen that her win rate hasn't been like this in the past by her 48% win rate. So you would be right in asking, \"Why now? What's changed?\" Recent changes that have been major to Riven's increase in strength includes the Conqueror rework and item changes. Of course the Conqueror keystone would buff Riven up a lot, it's similar to the fervor rune that made Riven strong awhile ago, except this one can be stacked with abilities and it also has healing for sustain in fights. Plus, the new item changes like Spear of Shojin and the buff to Death's Dance are also massive for Riven. All of these things work together with Riven's cooldowns and damage, while giving her sustain a big boost. Solution? Nerf or revert these changes that brought Riven up so hard.\n\nPlus, specifically to Riven, her kit is so unique and relatively advanced, so many players have invested a lot of time into learning her and bringing out her potential. In short, she has a big and die-hard fan base. Especially if the rework is big, this one change can ruin the whole game for many of these players. All in all, I just hope that points like these can be taken into consideration as the game moves forward, thank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yamikuro","date":"2019-04-27T19:41:09.906+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"IF REWORK RIVEN I WILL GO QUIT THIS GAMES RIOT {{champion:92}} {{item:3070}}  DONT REWORK RIVEN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT REWORK RIVEN it's my escape of life..don't rework my riven please nooooooo :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moinas","date":"2019-04-27T19:14:21.413+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"Please Riot, don't ruin Riven, I am begging you.
