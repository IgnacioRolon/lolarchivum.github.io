In this, I&#039;ll go over what our original goals were, what we think is currently working, problems that may be worth addressing (as well as ones we accept as costs of the update), and future steps we might take on the champion (if any).\r\n\r\n* **Original Goals**\r\n * Solidify Garen as a Juggernaut:\r\n   * Make him a meaningful damage threat throughout the game.\r\n   * Improve his kitability for opponents.\r\n * Reduce presence and reputation as strictly a situational lane bully.\r\n * Make games with Garen in them feel different or &quot;uniquely Garen.&quot;\r\n * Keep Garen accessible to newer players.\r\n* **What&#039;s Working:**\r\n * Increasing E spin speed with champion level makes his damage scale into the later parts of the game.\r\n * Villainy succeeds in making games with Garen in them feel unique/different.\r\n * The changes to Garen haven&#039;t compromised his accessibility to lesser skilled players.\r\n* **Problems to Address:**\r\n * Villainy sometimes feels like it ends up on odd targets.\r\n * Tactical counterplay (especially for melee opponents), is still quite poor against Garen.\r\n* **Known Tradeoffs:**\r\n * Villainy passive can feel tacked on, though not the worst offender of this.\r\n * Villainy system punishes an opponent for doing well.\r\n * W is even more boring of a button now than before.\r\n* **Next Steps:**\r\n * The next time we are in a position to do balance/cleanup work on Garen (which isn&#039;t something we&#039;re actively looking into):\r\n   * Investigate ways to improve clarity on Villainy target selection for opponents. In an ideal world, a target would never become the Villain and not understand why.\r\n   * Investigate better tactical counterplay mechanisms for Judgment (E).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to let everyone know where our heads are at on Garen, and again, sorry for taking sooooooo long to get this out there.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-05-11T21:05:29.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-11T21:27:55.913+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"W is still damage reduction (30%), it just lost its active tenacity in exchange for the passive armor/MR stacking.\n\nAnd you don't need to be ahead to kill the Villain, you just need to not be completely shutdown. A Garen that went even in lane can still kill a carry that snowballed on another lane.\n\nFinally, I disagree with your suggestion about reducing damage on non-villains. You want Villainy to add a bit of depth to Garen decision making, you don't want \"I should always rush at the Villain and ignore everything else\" to be the correct play in every situation. And if that was the right play all the time, the power budget in Villainy would need to be reduced to compensate for the added reliability.","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-05-11T21:31:44.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":">You want Villainy to add a bit of depth to Garen decision making, you don&#x27;t want &quot;I should always rush at the Villain and ignore everything else&quot; to be the correct play in every situation.\n\nThe problem with it currently is that it feels tacked on. It SHOULD be a decision point. What you're thinking of would only be the case if it were a significant reduction on both parts. \n\nIf he were to get bonuses against the villains, and penalties against non-villains, I couldn't see it being more than 5-10% on each part. Enough to make a difference, but not enough to force him into certain decisions. It simply allows him to access his passive in more scenarios.\n\nThat said, **deleted previous post because it was misinformed.** ","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-11T22:10:31.305+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Villainy IS a decision point currently, I can assure you. That is almost the only decision you have to take. Do you go for this beefier Villain first so that the mark can bounce on someone else, or do you really need to focus the squishies RIGHT NOW, because if you don't they'll just murder your team?\n\nIf that's the kind of decision you want, it's already the case, it's already \"making a difference\". The damage you deal against Villain versus non-Villains is already huge, if on top of that you also reduce it on the other end, there won't be any hesitation anymore. Also, more damage reduction for Garen isn't really helpful, because he is already tanky enough to do his job and a smart team shouldn't focus you first anyway, and if all your mates are already dead, damage reduction won't help you win 1v4. I don't remember the exact details of your suggestion since you deleted, so I can't point to specifics, but the general idea really seems counter-productive to me.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-11T21:56:39.580+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"So as someone who started maining Garen a month or 2 before the rework and who has continued since then...\n\n* I really feel like I'm much more kite-able, the Tenacity lost on W is really making a difference.And yes, it's desperately boring now.\n* But I also really feel like my damage late game is much better than before.\n\nSo good job on that.\n\nRegarding Villainy, people at my ELO (high silver) veeeeery often don't respect it. Every few games, there is a carry that snowballed on mid+bot while I was alone Top, then we group and I one-combo them and they start complaining in /all chat. They don't understand what being the Villain actually means.\nOn the other hand, even if you do understand what it means to be Villain, there isn't a lot of things you can do about it, except kiting, which is always a good idea anyway, even if you are not the Villain. The lack of \"tactical counterplay\" isn't so much an issue with the E, imho, than an issue with the Villain passive.\nAll in all, as the Garen player, I enjoy this passive quite a bit, but I understand that it can generate a lot of frustration.\n\nRegarding Villainy selection: I do agree that there are a few odd cases, like a support becoming the villain for a short period of time due to one double kill a few minutes ago when at the same time the midlaner has 15 kills and counting. But they are not so common, and not really problematic. \nMore importantly, I think that before any work on the **selection** though, you need to define precisely the **objective** of Villainy. Who do you want Garen to be strong against? The highest performing player? The biggest source of damage? The most ahead opponent? I don't really know, I have this vague idea that if someone is doing well I need to shut them down, but I don't really understand what was your gameplay goal with this passive, even if it works wonder from a thematic stand-point.\n\nRegarding the E, there is one easy way to add counterplay: making it a channeled ability interrupted by CC. But of course, that would be a HUGE nerf, and a loss of specificity (Garen is a good counter against anyone with a stun/blind), and I don't think it would be a good idea at all. But on a higher level, does this ability really need counterplay specifically? Unless you are the Villain, Garen damage is not so overbearing, and this is an ability dealing damage over a relatively long duration, it's not as if it was an easy way to burst a squishy or whatever.","replies":[{"poster":"pigsqueaks","date":"2016-05-12T21:48:37.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot if you read this top comment at the moment PLEASE don't tune Garen for Silver Elo, ask Challenger players what they think of Garen you'll see....","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-05-12T22:01:23.164+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I do know that balancing is rarely done for lower ELOs, and I'm actually in favor of such a system.\n\nI'm also very interested in what Challengers have to say, I'm sure I still have plenty to learn, even on a simple champ like Garen.\n\nAll that being said, no Challenger actually came and said what he thought, so I think Riot is still better with my Silver feedback than no feedback at all.\n\nFinally, I didn't suggest any specific tuning, I only reacted to what Riot said and gave general feedback on the current state, not on where they should move it in the future.\n\nAll in all, I find your suggestion that my whole comment should be dismissed just because I'm Silver rather... irritating.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SkyblazeHydraX3","date":"2016-05-11T21:31:55.233+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Tactical counterplay (especially for melee opponents), is still quite poor against Garen.\n\nPRAISE THE LORD FOR RIOT HAS SPOKEN\n\nSeriously, playing against Garen as melee anything is a goddamn pain in the ass, because he can freely silence you then just butcher you.

He spends all his time auto-attacking and the Q is a reset that allows him to apply the on-hit even more often. I'd argue that Titanic on-hit is as good as Spellblade.

The key problem behind Juggernaut is that they became essentially binary: either they get in range and kill you or you kite the juggernaut and they lose half their health bar before they even get to fight back. Juggernauts only really have two options: either they itemize for mobility (through items like {{item:3742}} ) to get in range before they get kited to death or they itemize for slows (through items like {{item:3143}} or {{item:3025}} which help them stay on their target ) and rely on flashing to get in auto attack range. As a general rule, juggernauts don't have to itemize for these kinds of items immediately, but when it comes time for teamfights they either build them or die.  You say that \"Deadman's Plate (comprimises) the intended strength/weakness profile of Juggernauts\" -  I say that that Deadman's Plate and other such items are the only thing that kept them interesting to play and viable. You don't solve the issue by simply removing Deadman's Plate and making it next to impossible for Juggernauts to get in range; you do it by making Juggernauts less binary when they get in range and make them less reliant on buying mobility items to even stay playable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BetweenSkill","date":"2016-05-12T03:06:21.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you feel juggernaut items have affected the game as a whole?\n\nWhile the \"damage for/while being tanky\" work for juggernauts, many champions (melee carries and assassins mostly) have been able to abuse these items to great success. \n\nThe \"juggernaut items\" like {{item:3071}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3742}}  etc are great for juggernauts, but they aren't in a vacuum.
