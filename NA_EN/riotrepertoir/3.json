{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-04-17T19:31:06.673+0000","title":"Ryze work on PBE","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThis PBE cycle you&#039;ll notice some pretty significant Ryze changes coming to the PBE. They&#039;re a bit of reshaping to the existing mechanics on his kit aiming to bridge some of the gap between solo queue and pro performance. While there are no new spells coming to the kit, there are some big enough mechanics changes that it probably merits an explanation of what&#039;s going on. A few weeks ago, Meddler mentioned in one of his Gameplay thoughts that we may do a last big mechanics pass on both Ryze and Azir before accepting balancing them strictly for pro long term, so you&#039;ll be seeing those changes coming to the PBE now, starting with Ryze. With that out of the way, here&#039;s some goals stuff, followed by the current (subject to change) list of changes going to the PBE for Ryze.\r\n\r\n**Ryze Goals**\r\n\r\n* Ryze is more vulnerable in the early lane especially. Adding a mechanic that necessitates him regularly casting Rune Prison in lane aims to create more moments where you can catch him with it on cooldown.\r\n* Ryze&#039;s dps and dueling power is pushed to later parts of the game.\r\n* Slower wave push across the board, especially in the laning phase. Looking to achieve this through a change to how E-&gt;Q deals its damage, as well as reduced Mana ratios (early/mid game damage) and increased AP ratios (mid/late game damage).\r\n* Reduced reliable lockdown. Base W is a slow instead of a root - upgraded version is still a root, but duration is down a bit.\r\n * This means that if Ryze wants to Flash root you, he has to throw an E at you first, giving you an extra .25 seconds to react (with your own flash or dash, for instance). It also aims to reduce the power of his gank assist in a coordinated setting slightly.\r\n* More baseline reliable dps added to later game Spell Flux (E).\r\n * E cd is reduced a bit later on, and E and Q bounce rules favor bouncing between champions by using edge checks.\r\n * E-&gt;Q&#039;s damage bonus is changed to true damage at half the current magic damage values, in addition to scaling with Ryze&#039;s level rather than any of his spell ranks so that there&#039;s no way to get it fully online before end game.\r\n* Realm Warp (R) has a longer range to make it easier to use per cast, but its cooldown is waaaaaaay up. More accessible baseline, but fewer opportunities to cast.\r\n * Yes, this does make Realm Warp a more powerful spell per cast, which may seem unintuitive. However, the intention is that the extremely long cooldown means it&#039;s something that solo queue players have to think about less as a portion of their total success, but also something that pros are able to utilize less as a portion of their total success on the champion. If this ult cooldown gating is successful, it&#039;s something we could potentially consider applying to other champions with pro-warping spells.\r\n * I&#039;m sure some will ask &quot;why not just replace Realm Warp?&quot; The answer is that Realm Warp does exciting things for the champion that we like, but that the primary satisfaction driver of the champion is his core combat loop, so we&#039;d like to keep that intact and just adjust R to be less important overall.\r\n* Bonus Improvement - all spells benefit from spell queueing.\r\n * This is actually tentatively being applied globally across all champions in 8.9, but it&#039;s worth calling out for Ryze especially, because it will tend to benefit characters that cast rapidly the most. We put some tech in with Irelia to make the game process your spell casts a bit better, so if you&#039;ve noticed how smooth she feels, this is likely a large contributor.\r\n\r\n**Ryze Tentative Changes**\r\n\r\n* **General**\r\n * Improved spell queueing for Overload, Rune Prison, and Spell Flux\r\n* **Overload (Q)**\r\n * Spell Ranks :: 6 (1/3/5/7/9/11) &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 (1/3/5/7/9)\r\n * Damage :: 60/85/110/135/160/185 (+45%AP) (+3%BonusMana) &gt;&gt;&gt; 60/90/120/150/180 (+50%AP) (+2%BonusMana)\r\n * NEW :: Deals (14+2perLevel)% additional damage as true damage to enemies with Flux (replaces E bonus damage mechanic)\r\n * Cost :: 40 &gt;&gt;&gt; 40/50/60/70/80\r\n * Shielding :: (60+5/lvl) &gt;&gt;&gt; 50/75/100/125/150\r\n * Movement Speed :: 25/28/31/34/37/40% &gt;&gt;&gt; 20/25/30/35/40%\r\n * Rune Duration :: 4 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5, renewing on taking or dealing damage\r\n* **Rune Prison (W)**\r\n * Cooldown :: 13/12/11/10/9 &gt;&gt;&gt; 15/13/11/9/7\r\n * Damage :: 80/100/120/140/160 (+60%AP) (+1%BonusMana) &gt;&gt;&gt; 80/100/120/140/160 (+60%AP) (+4%BonusMana)\r\n * CC type :: roots for 0.75 seconds &gt;&gt;&gt; applies a 50% slow that decays over 1.5 seconds\r\n * REMOVED :: Mana Cost\r\n * NEW :: Casting Rune Prison restores 6/7/8/9/10% of Ryze&#039;s maximum Mana\r\n* **Spell Flux (E)**\r\n * Cooldown :: 3.25/3.00/2.75/2.50/2.25 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3.5/3.0/2.5/2.0/1.5\r\n * Ability Power Ratio :: 30% &gt;&gt;&gt; 40%\r\n * Bonus Mana Ratio :: 2% &gt;&gt;&gt; 1%\r\n * REMOVED :: Overload Damage Bonus (replaced by Q true damage mechanic)\r\n * W Bonus :: Increased Root Duration &gt;&gt;&gt; Roots instead of slowing\r\n * Spread Damage :: 50% &gt;&gt;&gt; 100%\r\n * Bounce Radius (also applies to Q) :: 350 &gt;&gt;&gt; 275\r\n * Bounce Rules (also applies to Q) :: Center to center &gt;&gt;&gt; edge to edge\r\n  * Effectively makes bouncing between minions the same, and bouncing to champions a bit easier\r\n* **Realm Warp (R)**\r\n * Ranks :: 2 (6/11) &gt;&gt;&gt; 3 (6/11/16)\r\n * Range :: 1750/3000 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4000 all ranks\r\n * Cooldown :: 180 &gt;&gt;&gt; 300/240/180\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s the current plan for Ryze. I&#039;ll check back in to answer questions where appropriate, and as always, I expect only your highest effort memes.\r\n\r\n**Azir**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, Azir is also expected to see some work this patch. For Azir, I think the approach is much simpler, but will be like ripping a band aid off. The tentative plan for him is to make his soldier attacks fully single target (only dealing damage to the target the attack was order was issued on), and with the power budget that provides us, be able to buff him back up to where he was when his recent rework was shipped. The goal here would be to reduce his wave control significantly while retaining his core satisfaction as a high dps, medium/high ranged mage. More on that coming soon,; hopefully something to the PBE later this week if it seems like a reasonable path.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2018-04-17T19:51:22.708+0000","up_votes":86,"down_votes":2,"body":"Now you might wonder why Repertoir said ''Work'' instead of ''Rework''.\nYou see, Repertoir was 10 steps ahead of you, being well aware the community would provide the ''reee''","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-04-17T20:04:22.182+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Alright that's pretty clever","replies":[{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2018-04-17T21:24:49.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks fam :^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"alexionte","date":"2018-04-18T20:03:30.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i made the effort of logging myself in for the sole purpose of giving you an upvote","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2018-04-17T19:35:41.151+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just hit us up with his next rework already xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camille Ferrøs","date":"2018-04-17T19:59:29.564+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"and another one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2018-04-17T19:54:08.724+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how before pushing changes to PBE RiotRepertoir asked for feedback on the Ryze mains subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/RyzeMains/comments/8c31do/request_for_thoughtsfeedback/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=RyzeMains  Interacting with the community before a big change to a champion like this is awesome and something that I hope Riot does more of in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"WindLord7070","date":"2018-04-17T19:57:01.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is awesome.

He rarely has mana issues currently and his main build of tear-rod of ages-archangels doesn't seem likely to change so unless he gets a massive mana cost increase on his Q and or E i just don't see how he's going to have a hard time deciding when to W for ONLY mana. And with the other potential changes coming in for mages in general that will hurt the others ability to wave clear or trade over time just concerned that this mechanic seems easily overbearing and counter to the overall direction riot seems to want for mages(not that they should all be identical). I like the idea for his normal W to be a slow and the empowered to be a root , the point click cc into the rest of his combo has always been frustrating to play against. And the Ult change is nice too with being able to reward good aggressive ults early instead of it being clunky and awkward at lvl 1 except for running away mostly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mastęr Yi","date":"2018-04-17T20:42:14.456+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"A suggestion for Azir:\n\nI think one of the biggest reason which makes Azir so different in pro game and ranked game is his EQ combo.\n\n\nPro players can always use a max distance EQ combo with that low ping environment, however ranked players like me can't, because if I want to try a max distance EQ combo, I will very likely fail due to the high ping, which will be a disaster.

Maintaining the self-shielding on his E just gives him too many generic windows to initiate and go in, instead of focusing on when a good opportunity to go all-in might be.\n\nThe shield could also go back to only working when Azir collides with champions, it's still a far better situation than him simply getting a free shield with a high AP ratio just for dashing. It would also remove the frustrating aspect of him getting a free shield as he dashes away from ganks and bad situations as well.

The empowered Q will be slightly worse vs squishies but slightly better at tankbusting (the breakeven point for +80% magic damage vs. +50% true damage is at 60MR... 78MR with sorc boots... 130MR with void staff + sorc boots).  Since most targets typically have less MR than this the empowered Q seems to be a slight nerf (arguably).\n2. The W change is very interesting.  It's a bummer not having an instant point and click instant W root anymore... but I suppose that's the point :P.  Champs with point and click CC that let the rest of the kit hit guaranteed aren't exactly good designs ({{champion:13}}  {{champion:1}} ).  However the change seems to open up interesting options.  Max damage is QEQWQ...EQ...EQ, quick root is EWQ (instead of WEQ on live)... will be significantly less damage because Q isn't empowered, max burst w/ speedup is QWEQ.  \n3. Curious as to why the damage from mana was shifted from Q and E into the W.  (Not complaining... just curious as to what the decision was).\n4. The 1.5s E cooldown (0.825s with 45% CDR) is gonna be machine gun fun if you can stand and spam spells.  This is the largest buff I see in these changes.\n5. With the reduced cooldown on W and E looks like increased sustained damage (The E change from 2.25s -->1.5s is huge).\n6. I never used Ryze ult anyhow (I always leveled up his damage spells first and never trained ult until Lv17 anhow).  But 4000 range will make some interesting plays if you like his ult.\n7. Refreshing E on damage is interesting.  So you can auto attack a minion in lane to refresh E (without being forced to spam your spells or else \"waste\" the empower).  I like this change.\n8. 100% splash on E instead of 50% is great.  (On live you splash an E at level 1 and it hits tanks for 20... who then regen for 20 due to Dorans shield... effectively doing 0 damage!)  This will make enemy missteps (going near a minion you can splash from) much more punishing.  Very nice for lane.\n9. The W returning mana is nice, and give opportunity for enemies to punish when CC is on cooldown (15s cooldown at rank 1).  Makes an interesting choice.\n10. The combination of the removal of root on unempowered W and the true damage on empowered Q will make it very difficult to blow up squishes.  On live at full build a flash + WEQ instantly kills a squishy.  This will no longer be possibly which is a significant nerf (they can flash away, and empowered Q won't hurt squishies nearly as bad).  If the intent is so that Ryze can't instantly kill a squishy within a 0.75s window of a point&click root (which is likely the intent of the changes ) then power needs to be added in elsewhere... but I'm not seeing it.\n11. W will no longer work with Aftershock unless empowered.\n12. Overall it appears to me these changes are slightly power negative.  I don't think the E buff outweighs the Q nerf and W nerf.  I could be wrong though.  Currently Ryze has the lowest win rate in the game (44%) so I think power will need to be added in somewhere to bring him in line.  However I think these changes are healthy in the sense they remove the point and click instant W root and also give a 15s counterplay window where W is on cooldown if used for mana regen in lane (kind of like Zed's shadow).\n\nAnyhow glad to see an attempt at balance instead of more nerfs :P\n\nWould Riot consider a variable number of lockout/bans for pro play? For example in a pro best-of series in the 1st game they get 10 bans but by the 5th game they get 50 bans (40 previous bans + 10 new). Or lockout champs that were previosly played in the best-of series. This would force champion diversity on the pro’s. Then you would be free to balance for us regular players without much consideration for the pro’s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daunt","date":"2018-04-17T20:08:35.518+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like some of these changes, especially the ones that are pushing Ryze to be better late game rather than mid game.

To add the range you said you'd likely have to remove the AoE on his Soldier AAs, however the soldier piercing AA is one of his main wave clear tools, removing it would give him wave clear worse than {{champion:142}} or {{champion:38}}  since only his Q will be able to deal AoE and technically his E dash but its CD is very long and damage so low it doesn't really merit it. \n\nAs kinda a middle ground, I think it would be worth testing something like Xayah passive on his Soldiers in that they deal full damage to targeted and reduced to all others in the line increasing with rank to 50%, or add an effect onto his Q that makes it so the first 3 soldier AAs after casting Q pierce all targets in a line for full damage, this would limit his wave clear early on since Q has a very long CD without ranks or his W usually isn't ranked first but it would still allow him to maintain some ability to clear waves, heck even changing the 3 soldiers = AS steroid into 3 Soldiers = piercing autos plus less AS would be a good compromise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cron0s","date":"2018-04-18T13:30:57.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played a ton of Ryze and my only concern is: \n> Realm Warp (R) has a longer range to make it easier to use per cast, but its cooldown is waaaaaaay up.

However, the intention is that the extremely long cooldown means it's something that solo queue players have to think about less as a portion of their total success, but also something that pros are able to utilize less as a portion of their total success on the champion.\n\n> I'm sure some will ask \"why not just replace Realm Warp?\" The answer is that Realm Warp does exciting things for the champion that we like, but that the primary satisfaction driver of the champion is his core combat loop, so we'd like to keep that intact and just adjust R to be less important overall.\n\nYou are right, this isn't intuitive.\n\nThese changes are not addressing the real issues with Ryze, if anything they are exacerbating them and the infatuation with the current ultimate isn't helping either. Yes it's cool, fun and adds dimension to his game play but his real issue (which you are also addressing) was always his instant point-and-click hard CC and more recently his oppressive waveclear + roam pattern.\n\nAdditionally, what I am afraid of happening is that he's going to be so weak early that he won't really ever get a chance to get his feet off the ground. His hard CC was the only thing making him a threat and keeping him safe, taking that away and pulling power from his early laning phase is going to hurt... a lot. \n\nThere are so many gates to his power already (most of which are remnants from previous iterations of Ryze) that - combined with his skill expression which is no longer just 'point-and-click CC -> punish' anymore, Ryze just won't be a viable choice when it comes to Solo Q which I presume is a large portion of your player-base.\n\nMy thoughts?\n\nGive up on this ultimate already, go back to the drawing board and figure out something that resonates with the cool things we love from Ryze, notably his core combat loop. \n\nPlease stop settling with something that's just nice to have in the game vs. something that resonates with the champion. Besides, this means you can still use 'Realmwarp' -style skill for a future champion whose kit could resonate with it more than Ryze has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enjutsu","date":"2018-04-18T05:03:44.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think meddler mentioned that there will be no more work done on these pro-scene problematic champions and you intend to relocate those resources to other champions that need them more.\n\nSo what is this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viator","date":"2018-04-18T01:32:32.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy playing a lot of champions but I do play Azir the most.

Mianly the mana refund on W, cooldown increase on the ult and making the Q bonus damage base damage instead of scaling feel like good changes.\n\nHowever, I also have the following suggestions for his kit: \n1. Make his ult cooldown depend on the amount of people he teleported --> effectively nerfing him in coordinated play. (However still keep his ult up very high, like 120s + 120s per champion). His ult should be very high cooldown since it's probably one of the main reasons why he is so unbalanced, decreasing the power budget will lower this impact while keeping the unique and cool aspect of the ult.\n2. Letting E be the main mana cost/gate would be a good way to tune him, since his base Q & W are weak and don't need to be mana gated! This could also solve his waveclear problems of having too much of it.\n3. Change his base W to a mini camille ult for 1,5s: Allowing people to dodge, while still keeping the \"prison\" theme and being much more interesting than another slow. (Also, prevent movement abilities in this zone, otherwise it would gain to much hidden power). Sadly this is probably much work. \n\nI also have my concerns with some of the other changes:\n4. The ult range increase at low levels will probably make him even harder to play (hello TF)!! arly ganking bot will be another thing to master. I'm still more of a fan of range increase per level (e.g. 2000 - 3000 - 4000).\n5. I have found the e scaling cooldown to be very disruptive for my combos early game, It is still something that frustrates me, maybe a set 2 seconds cd, unaffected by cooldown reduction. Nerf it by using another way like increasing the mana cost!!

I understand that's a pattern with other abilities in the game (like rengar's E for instance), and that part of the point if to require ryze players to use W more aggressively/often so that there's more opportunity to attack them, but I at points use W to snap answer mobility spells (this may actually be the incorrect play, as I have stated I'm not an exceptional player) and then get away from danger safely.

One of my favorite things about him is one of his unique strengths that he brings to the table, his AOE DPS.  No other viable mid laner can match that strength of his.  Flat out removing it is just going to be a tough pill to swallow, tougher than perhaps any other design-level change that has been discussed or implemented.  If the goal is to cut down on his wave clear, is there a possibility that his AOE does not affect Minions, but still affects Champions?\n\nTurning him into a single target damage dealer leaves him competing with the likes of Cassiopeia and Ryze, as well as the entire Marksman class of champions.  Unless Riot is trying to turn him into an alternative to traditional Marksman in the bot lane, I do not see a future in which he has reason to be played or a future in which I personally find him enjoyable.  I'd rather a second rework far down the line (after season 8 ends at the minimum) in which Azir's dash is flat-out removed and replaced by a different tool, than for him become a single target damage dealer.\n\nHaving such a drastic change be suggested is very worrying to me.  In these past 3 years I've played him, Azir's been a weak champion at times, but never an unenjoyable champion to play.  Not yet anyway.
