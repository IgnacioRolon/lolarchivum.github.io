I think that some version of that is good primarily because it means you&#039;ll have to spend more time in your lane actively managing the wave, resulting in increased time for you and your opponent to interact with each other. The more opportunities you have to interact with your opponent, the more you can demonstrate your own skill over them, and League could use a more opportunities to demonstrate skill over your opponent that don&#039;t necessarily manifest as &quot;push and roam&quot; strategies or other map-influencing strategies. This aims to improve the ability for players to beat their opponent in lane. There will certainly be balance outliers created on the top end as a result of this work, and they will need to be addressed if we move forward.\r\n\r\nThere are additional changes to minion gold value that concentrate it into cannons without meaningfully altering the amount of gold gained from minions (especially pre 20 minutes). This is another tactic to create regular conflict between lane opponents. \r\n\r\n_Straight up, I do NOT expect these changes to be immediately popular._ Still, I could see doing them if I thought they increased the quality of the game over the long term especially. Both those things said, I&#039;m not necessarily convinced this is the perfect list to get the best results. It&#039;s on the PBE regardless so that there can be conversation around it before things are finalized.\r\n\r\n**Here are the changes:**\r\n_&quot;Upgrades&quot;_ occur every 3 waves, so using the melee minion example below, they go from gaining 18 Health (plus 0.3 per upgrade) every 3 waves to ganing 21 Health every 3 waves.\r\n\r\n* **Melee Minions**\r\n * Base HP :: 473 &gt;&gt;&gt; 480\r\n * HP Growth :: 18 +0.3/upgrade &gt;&gt;&gt; 21\r\n * Gold Value :: 20 &gt;&gt;&gt; 21\r\n * Gold Value Growth :: 0.125 &gt;&gt;&gt; 0\r\n* **Caster Minions**\r\n * Base HP :: 296 &gt;&gt;&gt; 320\r\n * HP Growth :: 6 &gt;&gt;&gt; 14\r\n * Gold Value :: 17 &gt;&gt;&gt; 14\r\n * Gold Value Growth :: 0.125 &gt;&gt;&gt; 0\r\n* **Cannon Minions**\r\n * Base HP :: 828 &gt;&gt;&gt; 900\r\n * HP Growth :: 23 +0.3/upgrade &gt;&gt;&gt; 50\r\n * Gold Value :: 45 &gt;&gt;&gt; 60\r\n * Gold Value Growth :: 0.35 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any input.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-03-08T01:58:04.475+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what I'm getting from this is that the goal here is to make it harder to clear waves early on in the game so that champs will have a harder time pushing a wave and then leaving to roam and will have to stay in lane longer.  I think one potential problem this could have would be that if someone is in an unfavorable matchup and their opponent is able to push the waves to your turret faster than you can push back, then this will leave them with a larger opportunity to be able to roam freely than at present because you'll take longer to clear the wave or have to leave and miss all that cs.  I'm not exactly sure to what degree this would be because it doesn't seem like the minions are getting too much beefier than they are now, but it might still be noticeable.\n\nAlso, if you did this you would probably have to adjust how much damage turrets do to minions again.  Even though turrets do a percentage of the minions health they will still be leftover with more health than at present which would make csing a lot harder to do again under turret like last time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-03-08T01:37:56.128+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo Mr. Repertoir, I have a few worries (or at least subjects) that I'm hoping you guys will consider when making these changes:\n\n- I'm hoping that farming under turret isn't shaken up by this. You know, the whole 2 autos + turret for melee and 1 auto + turret for caster (I think that's what it is anyways). I know they are relatively minor changes to the minion health, but it'd still feel bad if a minion was left with 1 health after this combo.\n\n\n- Are you guys considering the effect this'll have with the recent baron-buff changes? Not worried about the banner+cannon minion situation, more the \"50% reduced damage on caster minions\" aspect. Just hoping that these 2 changes doesn't make it down-right impossible to slow a baron push.\n\n\n-  Do you think these changes will have any meaningful effect on split-pushing or nah? This isn't really a worry but more looking for your take on how this could effect split-pushers.\n\n- Is this your guy's way of trying to get away from mid-lanes meta of \"push the wave and don't interact with your laner\" strategy. I know Azir, Ryze, and Galio got recent nerfs because of this, but I suspect the meta will still persist with Anivia/Malz/etc\n\n- On a related note to the last, will some champions get compensation buffs? How do you plan on handling {{champion:3}} Q, {{champion:99}} E, and other such pushing abilities if they can't do the job anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T03:44:48.063+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"> I'm hoping that farming under turret isn't shaken up by this.

It's possible I may need to adjust minion damage to counteract wave stacking getting out of hand.\n\n> Is this your guy's way of trying to get away from mid-lanes meta of \"push the wave and don't interact with your laner\" strategy.\n\nYes. And we'll likely need to do follow-up on individual champions if they're still out of line following these changes.\n\n> On a related note to the last, will some champions get compensation buffs?\n\nIn the immediate, it's unlikely. It would be incredibly hard to know when to stop on those things, and it would be very easy to confuse \"this champion is weak\" with \"this champion feels worse.\" I'd expect a lot of champions to feel worse following changes like these, but it aims to improve the feel of interactivity in the game over the longer term.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2018-03-08T03:56:30.134+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the response!

Buffing minion health values does seem like one way to lower the waveclear power-curve, but also it feels power-creepy to me - like numbers are getting bigger and bigger over time.\n\nAnother thing to consider, adding additional minion health may just give champs bigger health pools to leech off of. Also, with the addition of runes like bone-plating and second wind, trading in-lane feels less-effective than it was in the past. If lane interaction doesn't work then it makes sense to just push and roam. There's a reason we really aren't seeing assassins played anywhere except the jungle (because free gold lets a champ compete even if their trading patterns aren't in a healthy spot).\n\nSorry this has been a bit of a rant.

Players in Bronze/Silver already see this as a PVP focused game, so tuning the early game more into PVP, instead of objective (csing, vision, dragon/rift) would cause these players to focus even more on PVP instead of objectives. Unless you are hoping that is the response and you want to get away from objective type tasks in the early game. However, if you are expecting these changes to provide an ALTERNATIVE avenue to winning, and hope that objective focus will another option to victory paired with it. I am not sure how that would effect the quality of games. I could see it being beneficial, as I am constantly playing with people who don't understand objectives > kills, and this constantly has cost me games as people look for a death matches instead of victory, and allowing these players to do so would allow them to win more often than currently. But wouldn't that shake up the ELO of all ranks as lower tier players who don't necessarily understand the mechanics of the game outside of a deathmatch (Macro Play), are given opportunities to win off Micro play more?\n\nBut the way I have always viewed it is that PVP is a part of the game, but not the objective or the focus. Getting kills is fun, entertaining, and yes why people love to play the game. But when you are playing in a competitive ranked environment, you shouldn't just be playing for the \"Fun\", you should be playing to win; and PVP should be a side effect of having better mechanics, decision making, and setting your opponent up for mistakes. Not a way for people to circumvent playing the game as a way to win it, unless that is the intention here?\n\nedit: to add, I am a bot lane main, so push and roam hasn't really been in my lanes as much.

Your intentions are fine, except you failed to realize several things. \n\n1. **The only way for a midlaner to have a major impact on the game is through roaming during the midgame. **\n\nThis meta is dominated by ADCs and Supports. Whichever team has the better botlane will prevail in the end. If your botlane feeds early on and the enemy ADC can just take down bot turret, dragon, and then rotate mid to siege, there is nothing you can do as a Midlaner. If your botlane wins, then congrats for the free win as long you played decent in your own lane. \n\nHowever, midlaners spike during the midgame and they have a chance to help their ADC get fed and carry the late game. That is done through roaming. By limiting the number of opportunities to roam, you are taking away even more leverage that midlaners have over the game. You are essentially forcing midlaners to play the 1v1 while they have no realistic way to control what the botlane will become. And guess what? It doesn't matter how fed you are as a midlaner (unless you're playing hypercarries like Vladimir, Cassiopeia, or Azir); your botlane is the one deciding the game. And you need to help your botlane overcome the enemy botlane. By taking away roam power, you are actually REDUCING the macro knowledge required for midlaners to thrive in the current state of the game.\n\nIf you want to fix this problem, then fix the absurdity with how ADCs are scaling so fast. Fix the insane number of ways that supports can peel for their ADCs while providing them with steroids. Playing ADC is just too forgiving with the number of protection items existing in the game, while midlaners are forced to either act as secondary supports for their ADCs or engage in an assassination where one tiny mistake will screw everything up while perfect play won't necessarily yield any rewards. \n\nIf extended 1v1s favor any particular midlaners, it's going to favor those who can potentially 1v9. Look at the competitive meta right now: Azir, Cassiopeia, Ryze, Corki. All of them are hypercarries. You are only strengthening those who are already strong and nerfing the weak ones even further. \n\n2. **This change will heavily favor midlaners who have insane waveclear and can still easily clear the wave despite these changes (eg. Taliyah). **\n\nYou are pushing through a change without considering what the current meta is like, who has the greatest leverage in deciding the game's outcome, and what midlaners need to do in order to make an impact on the game. Increasing minion HP growth won't change the fact that midlaners need to roam in order to have an impact. \n\nThis will favor champions whose waveclear is already above average and can probably still clear the wave with ease despite the change. Taliyah is a notable example, since she can already one shot the entire wave with one single rotation. She's going to be fine with these changes. But other midlaners won't. This makes Lux, who is practically the only midlaner who cannot one shot caster minions even if she keeps up with her items, is going to become even worse. This also punishes champions whose waveclear is just strong enough to kill caster minions with one rotation. \n\nThat makes the midlane meta even less diverse. You want to promote diversity by encouraging interaction and mechanical skill, but in the end it leaves fewer midlaners as viable choices. If the enemy picks Taliyah and clears the wave with ease, who am I going to pick in response? The champions who used to clear waves with ease are no longer an option. And if I pick a weak waveclear champion, Taliyah is just going to outroam me, have a greater impact on botlane, and make their ADC extremely fed while my ADC is left to dry after being dived over and over while I cannot do anything because I'm farming under tower! \n\nSo if you want to encourage more interaction in mid, then reduce the leverage that botlane has on the game.

I'm not sure of the end outcome, since the cannon does have more HP than before, but I'd be leery of this.\n\n-As others have mentioned, it makes it harder to stop pushes.\n\n-It makes you feel weaker as a player, because you aren't oneshotting waves.\n\n-It makes lanes more interactive, sure, but it makes the game as a whole less aggressive because if you can't shove as well early, you're in a worse place to help your jungler invade, discouraging aggressive jungling.\n\n-Last-hitting is going to feel wonky for a good while.\n\n-Strongly increases the desirability and powerlevel of dematerializer, if it lets you break thresholds again.

I can't speak for actually good players, but I'd assume that they also try similar tactics. I don't remember it perfectly, but I think Korean toplaner Khan (who made it into playoffs with his team LongZhu last Worlds) is known for doing similar aggression tactics, except he for some reason does it on _every single minion_ and is known for being ~~a real pain~~ very punishing in lane.\n\nMore on topic, I think one of the smaller changes to the gold minions give (that I personally dislike but I can understand why) is that they're making caster minions less valuable- a lot of mages and tanks (and other classes) have inherent \"waveclear\", where with little to no ad or ap you can soften a pack of caster minions to die in one auto (example, lux E sets up casters to die to one auto, galio Q sets up casters to die in one colossus smash, sion e>q will knock out caster minions). Which makes waveclearing/last hitting them really easy even when behind. Which is something the gold reduction change is nerfing (since doing that won't be as rewarding. Again, I personally am against it because I'm not a very aggressive/snowbally player so I typically depend on having that inherent waveclear to work. But I can see the angle they are coming at making it harder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2018-03-08T11:56:13.876+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agrea on this change on only one condition:\n\n#Buff {{item:3302}} line minion execution","replies":[]},{"poster":"LilBadWitch","date":"2018-03-08T06:18:07.372+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan of changing minions or the habits we have for farming this drastically.

The damage of the minions aren't increasing or at the very least they don't do more damage to each other and with higher HP values they are going to be easier to freeze in my opinion with more HP on Cannons.

At least to my view on it.\n\nI love skirmishing don't get me wrong, just feel like if I get behind then it becomes less about skill and more about the item relevancy that the enemy laner has.

Sivir and any hurricane user probably also will become alot more valuable\n - Cannon minons might become to though for casters or other champs without meanignfull singletarget dps. This will put even more power to marksmen that then are not only the supreme objective dps, siegemasters and reliably teamfight hyperdps but on top of that mandatory wavecontroll to take down siege minions.\n - not only cannon minions, but all minions might be to though for chamipons that reliy on clearing waves with one spell or rotation that has a high cd, like Lux E. this will shift the meta even more towards dps mages mid like azir, ryze and cassio.\n - putting so much of the gold from minions into the siege minion can be problematic. It'll be quite hard to take down for many champs like mages and tanks with those significant buffs, and it creates a scenario where you can fail CS on 3 ranged minions and still loose less gold than failing that one cannon minion by 1 hp which feels rather odd.\nIt also means that cordinated jungler/laner duos can time ganks to simply deny cannon minons and easily strave the opposing laner.\n - freezing waves will get easier and more punishing\n - if you can outpush opponents and get a big wave to their tower, you get a even bigger window for roams, so it might backfire for solveing the situation with uninteractive lanes and roams.\n\nI think both, shifting so much gold into siege minions and makeing them so tanky is going to cause issues that need to be adressed when doing such a change, **in the very same patch and not a few patches later.**\nChamps that currently lack meaningfull singletarget need ways to deal with those big minions or they won't be aböe to sololane given how much gold you loose if you can't get the cannons while also beeing nailed down under your tower as you can't push the wave.\nIt might also be usefull to give some mana/hp restore effect to killing them so you can commit a bit more mana onto the cannons while also eating some harras to take them out.\nBut all in all, i don't think it's a good idea to shift so much of a waves reward into a single minion.
