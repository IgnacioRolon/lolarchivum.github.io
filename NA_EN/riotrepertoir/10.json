This post will mostly be a collection of common concerns I&#039;ve seen, and what I think the path forward is on them. That said, this is in no particular order, and by the time I&#039;ve finished typing this up, I&#039;ll probably have left some things out, so do feel free to ask in the comments. Here we go:\r\n\r\n**Banshee&#039;s Veil harming mid lane**\r\nMany players are expressing concern over the mechanical changes to Banshee&#039;s Veil, primarily worried it will become a must-buy in mid lane and ruin opportunities for lane aggression there. The cooldown of the spell shield on PBE is tuned pretty aggressively at the moment, so I definitely think this concern is valid. I&#039;ll be looking at making some small tweaks so that it is much more clearly _not_ a frequent lane purchase, whether that means adjusting the cooldown model or the statline or the cost.\r\n\r\n**Why is Guardian Angel an AD only item?**\r\nSimply put, we tested an AP version alongside the AD version, and the AP version just wasn&#039;t all that appealing since those characters can mostly just resort to building Zhonya&#039;s anyway. Consequently, giving many AP champions access to several moments of stasis didn&#039;t seem like the right call for the overall fun of the game. Shortly after the time we decided to remove the AP version from testing, we made the Abyssal/Banshee swap, with one of the intentions being to round out a feeling of fairness in defensive itemization options between AP and AD; AP should now have situational, visibly powerful defensive effects against both physical and magic damage, as should AD.\r\n\r\n**Why didn&#039;t we work on Thornmail/Ohmwrecker/Banner/Zz&#039;Rot/etc.?**\r\nWhile working on all these items, one of the top goals was to lay a good foundation for defensive itemization that could be built upon. There are definitely some items in the shop that are hardly earning their place, but we think those items can hopefully be tackled one at a time in individual patches down the road. For what it&#039;s worth, we even had some iterations of Ohmwrecker where it was positioned to have a statline more like Sunfire/DMP/Randuin&#039;s, but playtests showed that without significant work on the item active, it still would never be attractive unless just grossly overtuned. And thus we focused on getting the frameworks in a good spot, and coming back to individual items like these later.\r\n\r\n**Randuin&#039;s sucks**\r\nThis could very well be true. The idea behind Randuin&#039;s was to position it as both the most defensive and the cheapest option of the primary Health/Armor items, but it seems like players would prefer it had ~300g worth of power put into it so that the reason to pick it over Sunfire/DMP is much clearer and more satisfying\r\n\r\n**Why would we remove Randuin&#039;s Crit Damage Reduction?**\r\nChampions investing in crit tend to have very delayed power curves, where they feel like they need a bunch of their items to come online before they can really impact the game. The number of ways specifically designed to reduce auto attack damage results in those attacks needing to be pretty absurd when defenders don&#039;t take every single measure available to mitigate them. Between generally high Armor/lvl, multi-Armor items being in end game builds, Ninja Tabi reduction, Warden&#039;s/Randuin&#039;s/FH AS reduction, and Randuin&#039;s Crit reduction, basic attacks just end up needing to be crazy in order to function in the late game, and you can observe this in the game today. Randuin&#039;s Crit reduction being removed is a step in the other direction, but we are also looking at reducing the total amount of Percent Pen on items like Last Whisper on the other end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\n**Banshee&#039;s/Abyssal swap is confusing**\r\nYes. Agree, and we&#039;ll be trying to come to the solution that makes the most sense.\r\n\r\n**Gargoyle Stoneplate looks pretty cool**\r\nSeems like players are generally pretty excited about this item, with some concern about outlier abuse cases and the general efficiency of the item. Might see some light iteration over the course of the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n**Adaptive Helm is too good against X champion**\r\nAdaptive Helm&#039;s purpose is to be the Health/MR item that feels especially good to pick up against powerful sustained magic damage threats, so in that way, we want to make sure it is effective at that. That said, it could probably use some small tweaks to make it not just the best pickup against all mages, which I think is a valid concern to have. Possibly reducing the duration of the effect to 4 or 3 seconds so that it&#039;s not picking up unintended spellcasts? Alternatively, reducing its MR by ~10 and increasing its DR to 20% so that it&#039;s less generally good and more targeted? We&#039;re aiming for this item to be somewhat akin to &quot;Randuin&#039;s/FH, but for magic damage.&quot;\r\n\r\n**Magic Damage dealers are getting the short end of the stick**\r\nBetween the new items, and some adjustments to existing ones, I see where this sentiment comes from, and I&#039;ll be giving some thought to whether a course of action is appropriate here or not. One thing that I do think goes unconsidered (or at least underconsidered?) is that champions looking to get tanky tend to buy a lot more Armor items than MR items (if only to deal with the large number of physical threats in the game), and the amount of HP on most of the popular tank Armor items is being reduced, which is a buff to mage early/mid games especially. That said, I understand that this is somewhat offset by the addition of things like small amounts of MR/lvl being added to the game, as well as targeted direct counters being introduced for tanks.\r\n\r\nThat wraps up my thoughts before I go grab lunch and sit through some afternoon meetings. Hope this helps to let everyone know where it seems we&#039;re at with these things, and like I said, I probably left some stuff out, but feel free to ask about any individual questions you have.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the thoughts thus far,\r\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Adalvar","date":"2017-04-07T20:04:09.831+0000","up_votes":73,"down_votes":4,"body":"The issue with regards to magic damage dealers is a compound one where these new items are the last straw that may simply phase them out of midlane. \n\nLet's look at the list ever since season 5:\n\n- End game versions of {{item:1058}} either lost AP ({{item:3285}}), got reworked out of the tree ({{item:3116}}{{item:3157}}) or had their build-paths and costs massively increased ({{item:3089}}).\n- Scaling items also lost a significant portion of their stats either directly ({{item:3027}}) or indirectly ({{item:3003}}), while retaining their slow power curves.\n- Most new/reworked items have low amounts of AP ({{item:3001}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3030}}) and outside of Protobelt, their utility effects aren't up to snuff to match the low end offensive statline.\n- {{item:3802}} is a decent lane item, but it's lack of end-game options outside of {{item:3165}} is as painful to deal with as the lack of endgame {{item:1058}} is. \n- DPS/AP \"marksmen\" lack a proper item for their class, since {{item:3115}} is only good on {{champion:268}} and only at 70% due to the fact that his soldiers don't benefit from the Nashor's passive.\n- Then you had the rise of AD/MR items such as {{item:3139}} {{item:3814}} and the worst offender {{item:3156}}, which already takes a steaming dump on most AP champions. \n- Then there's issue that the AP armory is broken down, with items that have no identity {{item:3285}}, items that overlap in function {{item:3116}} {{item:3030}} , with the latter still getting the short end of the stick compared to either {{item:3027}} or {{item:3116}}. And there is no item for DPS mages outside of {{item:3115}}.\n\nAnd now we add the _new_ issues to this:\n\n- All champions are getting a X amount of MR naturally, which is a natural kick in the pants and will enforce {{item:3135}} rushing.\n- Adaptive Helm is another kick in nuts to the above mentioned \"AP marksmen\" aswell as most combo based magic damage dealers.\n- New {{item:3102}}  is pretty much old {{item:3001}}: the first who rushes it wins lane/gets a massive lead, then the other side gets it and the gameplay value becomes null and void. Not to mention this completely takes away the value of aggressive plays.\n- We also have Gargoyle Stoneplate, which granted is pretty telegraphed, but magic damage dealers struggle with high health targets and this _doubles_ that struggle.\n- {{item:3026}} is now an ADC item. So no more assassinations/all ins since the bloody ADC will have 2 lives.\n\nSo right now _something_ has to give. Either tone down _heavily_ on these new item effects, or infuse more AP into certain items (scaling ones in particular are in dire need of this), and/or create more distinction between their effects.\n\nEDIT: Small formating issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-04-07T20:56:09.256+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"I cannot possible agree more.

AP items have consistently lost power over the course of the past few years. {{item:3027}} -20 AP {{item:3285}} -20 AP {{item:3157}} -45 AP {{item:3116}} -25 AP. Also the introduction of low AP items ie {{item:3152}} {{item:3030}} has caused AP builds to go from ~800 AP late game to ~600 AP late game. With these item changes a tanks will probably see an increase of about 50-100 more MR in their kit leading to AP champions losing a lot of their late game power. While the item changes may have marginal benefits in the mid game, ie 100 less health to tear through, the loss late game will be to great.\n\n I'd recommend making {{item:3151}} 100 AP {{item:3027}} 120 AP{{item:3030}} 100 AP{{item:3157}} 100 AP.

You have to wait 10 mins to scale to the same AP as morello. The only situation you should buy this item over morello is when you need to get tanky in lane, even then the {{item:3030}}  has more AP on buy, same catalyst passive, a damage active, and same health on buy. And as for {{item:3157}} , it just hurts when you have to buy the item, you loose so much AP compared to what it used to be and you are buying an item only for an active, if you need just armor and AP, not the active, the {{item:3191}}  has the same armor fully stacked than zhonya's.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-04-09T15:08:53.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> With these item changes a tanks will probably see an increase of about 50-100 more MR in their kit \n\nHum, what?

It would make more sense if it offered health instead, or a combination of armor and MR.\n\nIf, for example, it offered health, you would be free to add a new AP-armor item without worrying about players stacking both of them. But that item couldn't be an AP guardian angel, though, as having access to both stasis effects would be really annoying.\n\nHexdrinker is also one of the strongest counter items in this game. It's extremely effective. Ap casters have nothing that gets close to its efficiency.\n\nIn contrast, seeker's armguard needs stacking, offers nothing beside stats, and if you don't need burst protection, there's not much incentive to upgrade a armguard to a zhonya, as you won't get any armor bonus for that. This means that, in many games, I buy a ninja tabi + armguard to defend against a strong AD team, but usually delay my Zhonya's purchase because I'd rather spend my 1700 gold in something else besides a few extra AP points and an active that might not be useful, depending on the context.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-04-08T01:08:28.305+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zhonya's is almost as effective against a mage as it is against an AD champ, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Warper","date":"2017-04-08T04:50:30.417+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellioning,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=KxKRgHqP,comment-id=000300030003,timestamp=2017-04-08T01:08:28.305+0000)\n>\n> Zhonya&#x27;s is almost as effective against a mage as it is against an AD champ, though.\n\nbecause the active doesn't scream \"anti ad\".

There's no option for a Mage to do the same against a heavy AD comp.\n\nThe other issue with Banshee's Veil as I see it is that it's disproportionately effective against some champions. Against someone like Xerath, it's basically useless because it will be stripped off instantly. Against someone like Fizz, it completely nullifies any chance of an all-in and probably forces a Hextech item buy just to be able to pop the shield.
