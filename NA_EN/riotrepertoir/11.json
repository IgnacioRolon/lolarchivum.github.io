Keep in mind this is all tentative and subject to change, but I&#039;m trying out using threads like this to make some upcoming change and our iterative process more visible. For those unaware, here are the current Duskblade changes:\n\n* Melee Damage :: 60 / x / 320 &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 / x / 200\n* Ranged Damage :: 45 / x / 300 &gt;&gt;&gt; 30 / x / 200\n* NEW :: Melee basic attacks instantly kill traps and wards disabled by Black Out\n* NEW :: Black Out won&#039;t be triggered if the owner is using a Red Sweeper (so you can&#039;t waste it)\n\nThe above changes are a large damage nerf to the item. We think the other additions are powerful and good additions to the item, but several champions have been crutching on the high powered damage tuning of Duskblade, and we&#039;re looking to inject that power lost back in. I _think_ these changes are pretty generous, but that&#039;s pretty subjective, so let me hear it if that&#039;s way off. The champions we&#039;ve chosen are who we identify as the most core users; if we thought they could easily swap to a different build and be just as effective on 8.6 as they currently are on 8.5, they probably aren&#039;t on the list. If you don&#039;t see a certain champion, that&#039;s probably why. Feel free to ask either way. It&#039;s possible I&#039;ve forgotten an important user. Below is the list of champions and changes we&#039;re looking at helping out:\n\n**Kayn**\nKayn&#039;s adjustments are pretty straightforward damage buffs. They may not fill the damage void left by Duskblade entirely, but W&#039;s damage especially is more broadly applicable than Duskblade&#039;s was. Also, Zenon (Kayn&#039;s creator) has some passive tweaks going on that may also make it into the patch. Those are aimed at flattening his passive&#039;s charging experience and helping out lane Kayn, but he&#039;d have better context on that than I do.\n\n* W Bonus AD Ratio :: 120% &gt;&gt;&gt; 130%\n* R Bonus AD Ratio :: 150% &gt;&gt;&gt; 175%\n\n**Kha&#039;Zix**\nKha&#039;Zix is looking at a significant Bonus AD ratio bump to his Q. We&#039;ve chosen this to help fill the damage void left by Duskblade in a way that is also in line with effective isolation play (rather than passive damage, for example). The damage bump to Q is so significant because we&#039;ve also removed his W&#039;s bonus damage to monsters. Mechanics like these enforce that he could basically only jungle, and we may as well bridge the gap between jungle and solo lane play a bit where possible; for what it&#039;s worth, I don&#039;t expect this to make him a primary laner by any means.\n\n * Q Bonus AD Ratio :: 120% &gt;&gt;&gt; 150%\n * REMOVED :: W 20% bonus damage to monsters\n\n**Miss Fortune**\nMiss Fortune&#039;s buff is a very straightforward AD growth buff, which is also probably the smallest on the list. The reason for that is that of the list here, she seems closest to being able to effectively transition to other builds without significant cost to performance.\n\n* Attack Damage Growth :: 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2\n\n**Shaco**\nOf the stuff here, I&#039;d say Shaco&#039;s is most experimental. These changes reflect my understanding (which, admittedly, could be off) that Shaco players feel pretty crappy about their early game because they feel forced into putting points in a Q that yields them literally no damage on rankup. These changes hope to be power neutral alongside the Duskblade changes, but an increase in satisfaction. By flattening Q&#039;s invis duration to 3 seconds and removing the CD return mechanic, he should be able to put early points in his E while feeling like Q is still fulfilling its purpose. If he gets to max E, he gets more early game damage and has more control over the outcome of the early game. You&#039;ll notice that Shaco has the most significant changes, and that although his damage numbers are not being outright increased like others, his kit&#039;s damage should come online sooner and give him needed agency over the outcome over the game rather than relying on Duskblade 1-shots in the later parts. The E slow nerf is to offset some of the increased power of his very early ganks provided by a meaningfully longer invis duration. 3 seems like a reasonable maximum duration for his invis given that it used to be 3.5 pre-rework, and that was at a time when dropping a pink ward when he was around was much more effective than options against his current invis.\n\n* REMOVED :: Reduced cooldown on basic attacking after casting Q\n* Q CD :: 16/15.5/15/14.5/14 &gt;&gt;&gt; 16/14.5/13/11.5/10\n* Q Duration :: 1.5/2.25/3/3.75/4.5 &gt;&gt;&gt; 3\n* E Slow :: 20/22.5/25/27.5/30% &gt;&gt;&gt; 10/15/20/25/30%\n\n**Talon**\nTalon&#039;s a pretty simple case of filling in some of his lost damage in a way that we believe will be functional and satisfying to players that enjoy him. His passive damage will continue to scale past level 11 up through level 18, and his R Bonus AD ratio is increased.\n\n* Passive Damage :: 75 / x / 175 (levels 1-11) &gt;&gt;&gt; 75 / x / 245 (levels 1-18)\n* R Bonus AD Ratio :: 80% &gt;&gt;&gt; 100%\n\n**Wukong**\nWukong is similarly getting some damage buffs, most notably to his Q, which tentatively now increases its AD ratio with rank.\n\n* Attack Damage Growth :: 3.2 &gt;&gt;&gt; 4\n* Q Bonus AD Ratio :: 10% &gt;&gt;&gt; 10/20/30/40/50%\n\n**Zed**\nMore damage bumps. Giving Zed some Base AS to make his attacks come out a bit more quickly and increase his dueling threat, as well as some ratio bumps on his base kit.\n\n* Base Attack Speed :: 0.651 &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.658\n* Q Bonus AD Ratio :: 0.9 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1.1\n* E Bonus AD Ratio :: 0.8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.9\n\nEditing this in since I forgot: Quinn also has some stuff coming from Xenogenic, and August has some stuff for Rengar, so that's why they're not mentioned here.\n\nThat&#039;s it for now! This stuff should appear on PBE tomorrow.

I'm liking the changes so far to Shaco. It looks like you guys put a little bit of thought into how you were going to approach this and I seriously appreciate that, because you're right. Shaco is so reliant on Duskblade (as he has almost no good base ratios and scales entirely off of items) that if he doesn't get it fast, he's incredibly weak. He's a feast-or-famine champion with no easy way to feast, as it were, which was really frustrating to play as. \n\nThe 3 second flat stealth is a buff early-game, but a clear nerf late-game, which is fine, because Shaco still gets what he needs to reach his target, but the enemy team can see the poofs of smoke happening closer to them. Shaco already builds lots of movespeed items as is. It's just too bad that it doesn't out-time certain shields anymore. \n\nMy primary concern is that Q is going to feel very bad to level up now, since you can dump one point into it for the 3 second stealth and then if you're playing AD Shaco, neither boxes nor Q is a good choice for the secondary skill to level up. Do you have anything in the works if Shaco feels too weak after the Duskblade changes? Perhaps adding a base damage ratio to his Q, or changing his spells around a bit so that he has a little more base damage and a little less scaling damage so that he becomes a little less item reliant, like other assassins? Perhaps allowing level-ups in W to reduce the time it takes to arm the trap so that they're useful to drop in team fights?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T08:20:43.144+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Do you have anything in the works if Shaco feels too weak after the Duskblade changes?\n\nWe'll have to have a careful watch on ALL of these champs if we go forward with lists like these because they seem pretty aggressive to me, but we want to give a real shot at them being equally viable next patch as they are now rather than just \"good enough.\"\n\nDefinitely agree with weak rankup sentiment for Shaco, and it's something to consider if he needs that follow-up for sure.

I'm not saying, y'know, do _all_ of those things, I was just wondering if there was anything you had on the table along those lines that would look or feel meaningful without pushing him over the edge. We want to see Shaco be good, not ridiculous and overbearing. It's weird with a champion whose only engage is tied to invisibility, which is incredibly strong, but doesn't let him keep up to ADC's after they use their own mobility spell to get away from Shaco after he shows up. The problem is that if he doesn't kill the enemy champions outright, he's not going to kill them at all if he builds for the assassin playstyle.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T09:02:14.996+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing on the table currently, but as we approach locking 8.6 and the patch becomes more complete, we will start thinking about follow up.","replies":[{"poster":"ChickenWrap","date":"2018-03-08T09:18:52.223+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever hit a rut with it, you know the group to call!

Let me try to explain like 3rd time(none of my posts here recieved a riots feedback so i almost  gave up). You said: \"his kit's damage should come online sooner and give him needed agency over the outcome over the game rather than relying on Duskblade 1-shots in the later parts.\" I dont get it...... What's an assasins job in your opinion? For me its exactly trying to oneshot\\assasinate the primary dps target which is really hard nowadays when people have ninja tabis, zhonia and stopwatch, when oracle still reveals Shaco and you can use shield\\aoe cc, when an adc can be shieded like 10 times for almost 2x their health(it means that assasins got counterplay, when alot of braindead champions just dont, and it looks like you think they are fine and balanced). Why do you talk that you dont want him to rely on oneshots? What do u want an assasin without an escape or any speed\\tenacity buff to do rather than assasinate?????\n\nAfter Dusk nerf info and Meddler's \"best subjective responce ever\" everyone was asking for a damage compensation for same numbers as damage lose. U have no idea how this champion works at all(not a blame, just a fact). And you think what this is a positive change when its totally stupid nerf for another abilty. You cant balance him, so the only one thing you need to do is just keep his damage like on live.\n\nFor example you can get back some damage this ways: \n1st option: Take 0.25s q duration from rank 5q and add it to 1st, then cause shaco loses 200 true damage from double dusk proc lategame (which is the only chance to assasinate tabi+ga adc lategame) add this damage to his next attack after q like 50\\55\\70\\90\\120 bonus ad (gonna be almost same cause its reduced by armor(hello ninja tabi), but can crit,) for the duration of decieve and 1.5s after it ends( but reduced by 25% after, so putting 2-3 points into q early will be MORE REWARDING than now, + early game will become slightly better) The clone must save this buff if u press R under Q buff duration, so it gonna repeat the double dusk proc with the same damage.\n2nd option: Reverting E to % of missed hp is another good possible change(not magic but physical, can work with slow nerfs), because its actually not an execute, you cant finish an adc with tabi from 25% hp till super lategame, because you cant go lethality build when you see tabi's and staticc shiv\\triforce doesnt affect you e damage.\\\n3rd option: at least start with correct double shiv proc on clone, anyway u need to nerf shiv in future\n\nIve created this thread a week ago, you can find some explanation here: \nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/R37kWJGQ-question-about-upcoming-locket-changes-shaco-last-season-game-statement-and-current-meta \n\nIts sad, but you better dont touch Shaco at all, when your \"compensation\" is exactly another nerf, and not what champion needs. You need to stop ignore a champion playerbase and start listening. Just get damage back and get you hands out of this champion untill you will have some understanding and better ideas please.\n\nI thought this thread was not for info only, Riot can get some stuff out if here, or maybe we can get at least bigger discuss with developers about things they are not confident enough with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-03-08T07:29:22.727+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":17,"body":"Assassins are early game champions. How is increasing Talon's damage after level 11 supposed to offset the loss of damage from his first item? That seems a bit ridiculous, don't you think?\n\nI think Shaco needs way more work than this. Yes, Volibear needed it more, but Shaco deserves the amount of attention that was given to Volibear and a real update to his kit. The change to Hallucinate to completely remove its damage in favor of unreliable crowd control is...stupid. Shaco is an assassin, if his crowd control is effective he's going to be built tank. Same as Rengar when his Bola Strike was point and click, same as Ekko when his stun was a longer duration, same as Elise constantly in the past. I honestly do not understand why you keep pushing for assassins to have crowd control. It isn't something that belongs with them. \n\nAre assassins unfun to play against? Yes. That shouldn't matter. Without the burst that assassins enjoy, the game suffers. We need assassins to kill mages and marksmen, hell knows that divers aren't going to do it these days (especially with a nerfed Duskblade). Shaco deserves to have some of his burst back. The \"skirmisher\" playstyle isn't fun. Dancing around a fight and waiting to potentially go in and just 1v1 for a bit isn't fun. If it was, people would play Nocturne. They'd play Irelia. They'd play Jax. Taking away an assassin's burst, backloading the whole thing and requiring them to mix in so many auto attacks has completely blurred the line between the diver and assassin roles, and Meddler's description of the differences between divers and assasssins was basically \"assassins have more mobility\" ({{champion:28}} {{champion:84}} Hah) and divers have more CC ({{champion:35}} {{champion:107}} )\n\nI mean, Riot has ended up reclassing tons of assassins as divers without really changing their kits in any meaningful way! The two classes are just too similar. Now it's like {{champion:60}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:131}} are divers. Well, Diana hasn't lost her burst. Nocturne hasn't lost his mobility. Elise has untargetability and a point and click long range gap closer. \n\nOh, assassins are supposed to be the best at \"target access\", whatever that means. Right. {{champion:254}}  <- Pretty sure Vi has the most \"target access\" in the entire game. She clicks on someone and she arrives next to them. They can't run away. They can't stop her. There are tons of videos showing that Vi's ult has no range limit because she lands on someone as they base and she travels all the way to the enemy fountain without stopping her ultimate. Am I really supposed to believe that Ekko or Zed has \"better\" target access than Vi? And if Vi has better target access than any assassin, why is she not an assassin?\n\nPlease answer, Repetoir. I know you're busy and I know you've been talking up a storm all day. Good on you, I appreciate it. But I am not satisfied with the state of the diver class after the class reworks were canceled. They don't have their own itemization. You can't tune the entire class by changing around {{item:3147}} or{{item:3031}} like you can do with other classes, and the divers themselves do not have a predictable baseline pattern of play.\n\nMore importantly, divers lost a ton of survivability with the tank update, which I totally agreed with. Items like Sunfire Cape and Dead Man's Plate were too effective as single target pickups. But without an update to follow that up, divers are just squishier as a class with no compensation. How is that fair? Why has Riot remained silent on this topic? Does Riot have any plan for divers as a class? They (and AP assassins) are the only two classes to not have items specifically designated for them. They have very little to differentiate themselves from assassins ESPECIALLY after the assassin update, so its no wonder they poach asssassin items and use them better. They still have front-loaded burst.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T08:27:15.852+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Assassins are early game champions.

Level 11 seems like a pretty good time to make up that damage. Plus, Talon has ult ratio buffs in there as well.\n\n> I think Shaco needs way more work than this.\n\nHe does, but I won't begin to pretend I can rework him in a week.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shíny","date":"2018-03-08T07:21:48.608+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nocturne?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2018-03-08T08:27:40.472+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I need to follow up on him, but I believe the sentiment is to see how his 8.5 buffs have affected him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2018-03-08T07:53:15.739+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm just curious, why is Wukong getting buffs because of Duskblade nerfs?

I kind of like them in that he gets access to his invisibility sooner, but I also kind of don't, because there's barely any reason to level this ability at all anymore(You have no escape anyways after going in, so there's almost no reason to want earlier CD, and even if the earlier CD WAS attractive, it's literally only reducing the CD by 1.5 seconds late game. Feels like it'll be a pretty big nerf to late game Shaco not having that extra invisibility time(it can be hard to reach opponents even with the current fully maxed Q on occasion). I mean I get that this is to make his early game better but I think overall this will not be power neutral and will sort of be a nerf. I could be wrong, but just from looking at the changes that's what it's looking like to me. His E slow is already not that great(he definitely can't catch up to a target without like 2-3 of them unless they're immobile.

Like, say, bonus health converts to armor, bonus mana converts to MR, and CDR converts to movespeed? He'd have incentives to build things like Triforce and Righteous Glory in that case, to make him tougher and harder to bring down, as an alternative to stacking all the AD and armor pen items--which he could still do if you wanted the assassin route.

The E slow nerf is to offset some of the increased power of his very early ganks provided by a meaningfully longer invis duration. 3 seems like a reasonable maximum duration for his invis given that it used to be 3.5 pre-rework, and that was at a time when dropping a pink ward when he was around was much more effective than options against his current invis.\n> \n> * REMOVED :: Reduced cooldown on basic attacking after casting Q\n> * Q CD :: 16/15.5/15/14.5/14 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 16/14.5/13/11.5/10\n> * Q Duration :: 1.5/2.25/3/3.75/4.5 &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 3\n> * E Slow :: 20/22.5/25/27.5/30% &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 10/15/20/25/30%\n\nBuffs:\n1.
