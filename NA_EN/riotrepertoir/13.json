The change to these items is that they now only remove crowd control effects rather than all negative debuffs. Functionally, what this means is that it will continue to remove Enchanted Crystal Arrow (Ashe) and Nether Grasp (Malzahar), but it will not remove Death Mark (Zed) and Grand Challenge (Fiora).\n\nThe reasoning for the change is pretty much that the cleanse offered by these items was able to functionally negate certain champions&#039; ability to fight the owner of the item. As I&#039;m sure many of you will be quick to point out, the game is balanced around the existence of this effect, and you&#039;re not wrong. That said, we think we can get the outliers here to a spot where they are healthy in the game where QSS/MS do not remove all debuffs, and instead only crowd control effects.\n\nBy outliers, I do mean the Zeds, Fioras, Trundles, and other problem children there are in light of this change. However, what this change allows us to do is create debuff-focused champions that don&#039;t have their kits completely negated with an item purchase and press of a button. With this change, _there likely WILL be outliers, and if so, they WILL need to be addressed_. The idea here is that we&#039;d like to get to a point where the damage Zed deals with Death Mark (or any other champion with their debuff spell) is fair in the absence of strictly a hard counter item.\n\nSince we&#039;re at the mid season point and the next few patches will be in flux, this feels like the best time to try out such a change unless we wanted to wait until the new season.\n\nCurrently, you don&#039;t see changes to champions on the PBE to offset this item change because we want to start small and react with a million changes here and there without seeing the effect of the change. We could certainly try to preemptively make such changes, but our approach currently is to see how it tests before overreacting. This is, of course, subject to change, so we&#039;ll be monitoring the change as it&#039;s on PBE and once it&#039;s Live if we decide to keep it.\n\nFeel free to leave comments below, even if it&#039;s just to reiterate that Zed will be broken.\n\nCheers,\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Rickon Stark","date":"2016-04-20T01:03:35.868+0000","up_votes":119,"down_votes":17,"body":"A fed Zed can kill a squishy with only his QWE  and ignite without a single AA (even though he's an AD champion) ...

We were in a decent space to make some of these mages fair in a world where QSS isn't as effective as it used to be, so I got some buy in and tested some stuff out, and here's where that landed.","replies":[{"poster":"Elisai","date":"2016-04-20T04:24:36.378+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":2,"body":"To make up for it why not allow people to take Cleanse and add a new effect to cleanse ALL debuffs basically like QSS does in live at this very moment.

A change this massive is going to ripple through league the likes of which I havn't seen since maybe feral flare's initial state and even then I don't think it compares. This is going to be a balance nightmare that will affect not just the key subjects like Zed but I feel as its going to pop up in case by case moments with different champions and debuffs being unable to be removed. \n\nNot only that but I feel as though doing something this massive, with worlds only a few months away and the fact that the balance team is already making tons of changes to mages, mage items, dragon, objectives etc this will put the game even more in a chaotic state and possibly lead to another worlds fiasco where we saw Morde/GP banned every game. I fully support the change but I feel as if doing something THIS massive right now is not a good idea and we will see the ripples of this for the rest of the year all the way to season 7.

It strikes a fuck ton of times doing a fuck ton of damage. He is allowed to do a lot of damage and strike a lot of times because in the items you can get a lot of things to stop him. Invisibility from Lothars, Eul(like Zhonia), Ghost Scepter makes you immune to physical damage, Force Staff might push your outside his vision, etc etc. \n\nYou have actual ways to deal with it, and that's why it's allowed to be strong on it's own when the enemies do not have those ways at the moment.\n\nQss isn't only for Zed Trundle and Fioras. It also allows to outplay other people like QSS Lee Sin's Q, Or Nidalee's mark. You can deny A Darius the execute by QSSing his bleed stacks. There are a LOT of ways to use the item, which brings depth to the game. Please reconsider this change. Right now ADCs do not have that many ways to deal with Assassins as is. Steraks is weak, Maw is borderline bad for an ADC. Dissalowing them to deal with other threats, as mentioned above, will only make them less skill based.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xMancio","date":"2016-04-20T07:25:55.402+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"As always: an item is perfectly fine on adcs, ppl in other roles start using it(tans vs trundle or fiora, everyone vs liss, and the list goes on ) and it got nerfed... Can I understand how am I supposed to survive zed or fizz eg? Praying the good lord to save my soul? And don't tell me to build armor, 30 armor won't change anything(look at perkz 1v2 og botlane with only 2 kills) and, u know, adc deal 0 damage if they retards core items for a complete defensive one. But yes plz, keep on shitting on adcs and buff assassins, so u'll have more \"mlg outplay video\" on the net for ur community. I'm quite done hearing about \"champs are countered with just a click\" cause half of the champs that u're indirect buffing was already forcing u into building an mres item while BEING AD; and u need it even if the enemy team is full ad! Now: u give to add base armor/mres and hp to all adc or u give them an ad zonya... Oh, w8, there's another possibility: finish what u have done with morde so ppl will nomore need to play adcs.","replies":[]}]}
