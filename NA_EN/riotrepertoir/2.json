Now that we&#039;ve done a few of these, you probably know what to expect from this, but in case you&#039;ve missed those ones, I&#039;ll reiterate. This will not be an exhaustive list of the exact mechanics changes or numerical changes you can expect to see in the update, as that is all still pending. Instead, I hope this informs interested parties in the _kinds_ of things they can expect to see.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to deciding which mages we wanted to update with this group, we knew we wanted to get to Cassiopeia, but we actually had a pretty hard time trying to determine what exactly we wanted to accomplish on her. As I&#039;ve mentioned previously, there isn&#039;t a prescriptive formula we can apply to all these various mages to ultimately achieve the best results for each of them, but here&#039;s what we&#039;re thinking for Cass.\r\n\r\nA lot of players have asked for &quot;Poison Mage&quot; when talking about Cassiopeia. This update _does not_ intend to make Cassiopeia a &quot;Poison Mage,&quot; at least not in a way that some players seem to desire (or fear, depending on your stance). To truly make her a &quot;Poison Mage&quot; would require large alterations to the champion that may achieve that feeling, but that we ultimately thought would no longer be Cassiopeia. That said, Cassiopeia is a mage that utilizes poisons, and it currently feels like there is not enough power allocated to these parts of her kit, so we&#039;d like to redistribute some power in the kit off of Twin Fang and Aspect of the Serpent, and into other areas. If you don&#039;t like Cassiopeia because you expected a &quot;Poison Mage&quot; out of her and didn&#039;t get one, then you may not still like her following these changes. If you don&#039;t like Cassiopeia because the way Twin Fang works makes her feel one-dimensional, then hopefully this will appeal to you. At the end of the day, we do think Twin Fang is important to the identity of Cassiopeia, but the power budget that has been allocated to it is a bit out of whack.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s get into some expectations. Feel free to drop some questions/comments below if anything is unclear. This isn&#039;t a heavily wordsmithed post, so there&#039;s likely some stuff I don&#039;t say correctly the first time.\r\n\r\n* **Here&#039;s some stuff we&#039;re happy with about Cassiopeia and are unlikely to change:**\r\n * Despite facing gameplay not being perfect, Petrifying Gaze provides some really cool high moments.\r\n * Twin Fang as a high cadence spell.\r\n * Twin Fang&#039;s power being unlocked by Poisons.\r\n * Cassiopeia feels swift and deadly.\r\n* **Here&#039;s some stuff we&#039;re less happy with and are actively trying to resolve:**\r\n * Aspect of the Serpent forces a carry curve in an unnatural, somewhat feel-bad way.\r\n * Poisoning should be more about harming/disabling enemies than empowering Cassiopeia.\r\n * The amount of power allocated to Twin Fang makes Cassiopeia feel one dimensional.\r\n * Noxious Blast and Miasma&#039;s targeting types can result in lame &quot;place your circles here&quot; gameplay.\r\n * Miasma&#039;s output (damage/slow) isn&#039;t very interesting and doesn&#039;t feel particularly &quot;poison-y.&quot;\r\n* **Here&#039;s what I hope (these designs are still in progress) will be true of Cassiopeia following her changes:**\r\n * Cassiopeia will still feel like Cassiopeia and not &quot;brand new LoL Poison Mage.&quot; Tweaks here and there, but still Cassiopeia.\r\n * Cassiopeia&#039;s poison spells will feel like they stand alone rather than feeling like slaves to Twin Fang.\r\n * Cassiopeia will still be pretty heavy on the inputs side of things, namely frequency.\r\n * Avoiding getting poisoned will still feel like one of the main things you&#039;re thinking about when playing against Cassiopeia.\r\n * Poisons will feel less like generic DoTs.\r\n * Cassiopeia still feels like a medium-short range mage.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s about all I&#039;ve got for now. Again, if anything is unclear, or if you have further questions, ask it below.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRepertoir","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-03-01T04:08:30.526+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":116,"body":"I keep trying to type words and those words keep coming out as aggressive and incredibly salty. \n\nIn an attempt to keep things civil, I'm just going to boil them down to a couple of sentences.\n\nI'm still not sure what you guys seem to have against Cass.

However, this is all contingent upon your expectation that Cassiopeia be more like a Medusa. I agree that Medusa and Twin Fang spam don't necessarily go hand-in-hand, and that if we were to create Cassiopeia from scratch today, Twin Fang might not be part of the equation. That said, we're trying to refine a character that utilizes her existing sources of power, one of which is Twin Fang, into something that is more balanced (thematically speaking, not power). Twin Fang has undeniably always been one of Cassiopeia's threats, so we don't want to get rid of that. We want to balance things out so that it's not playing such a disproportionately high role in that power distribution.\n\n> Kinda funny how you want to talk about \"alienating players\" when reworks and updates in the past had no qualms about completely changing a character.\n\nNot sure there's a point to a comment like this, as I'm sure the desired outcome isn't that we should just change characters without regard to identity.","replies":[{"poster":"Ren Ex","date":"2016-03-01T05:32:45.552+0000","up_votes":153,"down_votes":33,"body":">That's totally understandable.

Even without her appearance, she's still a champion that is utilizing poisons in half her kit, a third AoE spell designed for lockdown, and a single high-damaging spell tied to a mechanic involving Poisons.\n\nIf you were really trying to balance Cassiopeia *thematically*, then Poisons and her snake motif should be what's catching your eye, not Twin Fang. \n\nAnd, you know what? I **can** deny that Twin Fang has always been on of Cassiopeia's threats, because her pre-rework incarnation, the version that I loved to play, had it as a filler-spell. Her main threat was how much damage she could do in an area, over time, witht he proper team to lockdown and slow the enemies. She wasn't about tagging someone then bursting them down with her E. The E was there just to give her something to do while she waited for her Q to come back, give her some semblance of 1v1 potential, and to maintain her old Deadly Cadence passive.\n\nHer original state had her kit spread into her Q and W doing most of her damage, with E tacked on. Her rework, which was very poorly recieved by the people that actually played her, turned her into a 1v1/single-target champion first and foremost, when the rest of her kit still screams AoE/teamfight mage.\n\n>Not sure there's a point to a comment like this, as I'm sure the desired outcome isn't that we should just change characters without regard to identity.\n\nThe point of this comment is that, while you're claiming that you don't want to \"alienate the players that already enjoy the champion\", any time there's big backlash towards a dramatic shift in a champion, it's ignored. Cass was reworked away from a thematic that suited her, and still suits her, which alienated a LOT of players from her. Trundle lost his entire identity years ago. Sion retains a SINGLE TRAIT from his original kit, and nothing of his original playstyle.\n\nI'm seriously not trying to be rude, I just feel it has to be said. Anytime there's a huge change for a champion, that players react negatively to, it's simply pushed aside. Anytime input is asked for, it's brushed aside, and ignored, in favor of the ideas that are already in the reworking Rioters head.\n\nThis happened with Cass' original rework, and, frankly, I'm still salty about that. I, and a lot of other Cassiopeia players, lost a champion that we loved to play, in favor of Ryze 1.5, and it feels terrible.","replies":[{"poster":"Kojiro Sasaki","date":"2016-03-01T11:31:59.751+0000","up_votes":97,"down_votes":23,"body":"I have no idea why people are downvoting this guy, He's completely right. Is it his tone? I was a big time Cass player before the rework, and I've never really liked the idea of spamming Twin-fang, but I dealt with it. Once that became core and central to her kit, I stopped enjoying playing her.\n\nYou also forgot about them moving Morde from mid-lane to some kind of wierd bot-lane mage carry, but then now they're trying to change that too but it seems to just be making it worse? I just don't even know. Oh also, I was a Karma player before her rework, also. Not anymore. \n\nDon't feed us lies about not alienating players. You've done it before. you've done it with THIS CHAMPION. What most people who played Cass wanted was a poison mage first and foremost. When you pick her up, that's the first thing that strikes you. \"She's a snake lady who casts poison, cool\" Twin-fang has nothing to do with it. I'd prefer her twin fang be something like \"When used on a poisoned enemy, Increases the poisons duration and power a small amount\" as an a example Though I'd prefer for it to be removed entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Morty","date":"2016-03-01T16:32:47.972+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":16,"body":"It's a combination of his tone, and the fact that he's just wrong. I've played cassio extensively both pre and post rework, and E has always been pretty staple to her gameplay. Yes, pre-rework had more damage in her Q, but you were still sure as hell mashing that E key when you hit that poison. Most of the changes they did to cassio was to move her damage from a level 2 power spike monster that snowballed like mad, to a more consistent champion with a late game hyper carry mentality. He also keeps talking about how they seem to be neglecting the poison thematic, when they've clearly stated multiple times they want to put more power into her poisons, but don't want that to be her only thing. DoT's are boring as shit to play with, and quite frankly are pretty anti-fun for the enemy too. \n\nAlso, you guys keep whining about \"alienating players\" because of the champions reworks. You were a Karma player but aren't anymore? Congrats bro, I'm real sorry for your loss. She went from a champion with a really weird and unintuitive playstyle to one that makes sense and feels rewarding. Complaining about Sion? That champion had **NO** cohesiveness whatsoever, he was half AD and half AP, half assassin and half tank; it literally made no sense with the evolution of the game. Poppy was just overall stupid as shit and low-key broken. That's coming from someone who played multiple games as poppy with a decently high win-rate, including a smurf that was poppy only. **nothing* about her said Poppy, made sense, or gave her an identity. People react negatively at first, until they actually learn the champion again; and guess what, a **majority** of people enjoy the reworks more. So far, every champion that I've played that has been reworked, I've been sad at first, but then I grow to love them far more than I did prior. \nSorry for this long-winded aggressive rant, but you guys are just too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Tarogan","date":"2016-03-02T02:27:29.040+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I will say that I liked Cassiopeias play style way more before.

In case you haven't noticed it yet, she needs a full rework and not a semi one like you're suggesting if you intend to fix all of her issues. Otherwise you'll simply nerf her into the ground again just for her to remain irrelevant for a couple more years. That's not how you make anyone happy around here.\n\n>Changes like that run the risk of completely alienating players that already enjoy the champion.\n\nYou already alienated her original playerbase during the initial rework and those who sticked around for some time abandoned the ship shortly after she became completely unbearable to play as. Her pickrate has reached an all-time record low with 1%, that's close to 2/3 of her playerbase gone. You seriously need to consider those who played her in the first place, the poison-mage direction is the only way to go.\n________________\nIf I understand you right, you're intending to keep her current passive in place. Aspect of the Serpent really doesn't belong in her kit, you need to get rid of it - we've been telling you this since 2014 and even after all this time you still don't want to do it. We don't want to collect stacks for 40 minutes just to stay handicapped throughout the game, that absolutely needs to change.\n\nSpeaking of games and their common duration, this meta leaves zero room for lategame-hypercarries which is why Cassio's current winrate is pretty much in the gutter (when are you finally going to buff her?). You need to restore her ratios, that's the only way to make her powerful again. I'd be more than willing to get rid of this awful hypercarry-fantasy, old Cass already did a far better job at that without being handicapped throughout the game.\n\nI also don't understand why you refuse to improve her ultimate, it's far too unreliable due to its delay, short range and lack of follow-up. It's also extremely hard to hit if anyone decides to randomly click behind them which makes the gamecode think they're looking the other direction which is enough to evade the stun, then there's the majority of champions who have access to some form of mobility which makes any attempt at hitting them pretty much pointless. It's simply one of the worst ultimates in the entire game right now.\n\nShe desperately needs a poison-effect on her R if you want her to make proper use of that ability, otherwise she's pretty much screwed due to her Q and W being on cooldown most of the time which makes it impossible to follow up with any Twin Fangs. She has far too many restrictions in her gameplay and receives too little reward for the insane risks she has to take. Also what use is an aoe-slow/stun if she can only target a single person afterwards? She needs her aoe-damage back, period.\n\nI'm still extremely disappointed that you don't intend to replace any of her moves, I don't see how this is going to improve her current situation if she's still stuck with the same moveset without actually returning to her original state which you're trying to avoid at all costs for some strange reason. \n\nTo be honest, I don't see a bright future ahead of her after hearing what you had to say. I fear this is just going to be another half-hearted rework like back in 4.16 where Cass only receives some slight changes without actually being looked at, otherwise you'd finally consider a fullblown rework on her which she desperately needs.\n________________\nAlso on a sidenote, when is she finally going to receive a proper VU? Literally all of her assets (with the sole exception of  the textures) are from 2010 - she still has the same animations (and lack of recall), same basemodel and same ability-icons. She also hasn't seen a skin in over 3 years, are you going to address any of those things during the update?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2016-03-01T14:54:16.062+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=n7lt68uM,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2016-03-01T04:29:51.194+0000)\n>\n> Nowhere did I say that Twin Fang is fun and interesting.

Getting to 250 or 500 stacks is such a sudden power spike, but not in a way that feels good. Suddenly gaining 25% permanent CDR at a seemingly arbitrary time in the game is just strange, and in an instant makes her far more forgiving (lower CD on E if you hit a non-poisoned target, lower CD on poisons if you miss them). No other champion power spikes in such erratic and instant ways other than certain ult ranks (e.g. Kennens rank 3 ult suddenly allowing him to stun the entire enemy team with his ult alone, as opposed to 3.5 people). \n\nI will compare Cassiopeia to another \"late game carry\" mage, Veigar. When facing Veigar you think \"if we let this game go late he will gradually become a major threat\", but when facing Cassiopeia it is more like \"she is 25 stacks off a massive AP bonus, we need to engage now or she will be far stronger\". And then after 25 stacks are gained that window closes forever. It just feels contrived more than anything with such janky powerspikes happening at inconsistent times of the game due to some enemy teams being far more susceptible to poison poke than others.\n\nIf the current passive is going to stay, I would like to see it become a linear increase rather than sudden spikes. For example, instead of 5%/10%/30% AP at the breakpoints, make her passive cap at 600 stacks and each stack provides +(0.05% AP), totaling at +30%. This would work similarly for CDR, giving a small amount of CDR/stack until 300 stacks where it caps at 25%. The Twin Fangs heal is a bit harder to measure since it contains a flat heal amount that early on would be healing for amounts like 0.4 hp, but you get the idea. You might have noticed I increased the cap points slightly, that is simply to offset the fact that Cassiopeia would have partial benefits sooner, particularly the CDR.\n\nOther than that, I like that Cassiopeia currently has a reliable way to Rylais slow her target and still have her E available. Miasma is reasonably reliable, if you don't use it on a target that is about to dash it is fairly confirmed to hit. Once you have Rylais you can then slow them with Twin Fangs and hit a much easier Q, allowing the pain train to begin. I believe that some form of getting a reliable reduced CD E to apply Rylais single target slow on a target, either through Miasma or Petrifying Gaze followed by Noxious Blast is necessary with the amount of mobility in the game, otherwise targets with dashes can just hamstring Cassiopeias damage output by avoiding poisons and never having to deal with rapidfire Twin Fangs.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-03-01T09:29:35.976+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"> If the current passive is going to stay, I would like to see it become a linear increase rather than sudden spikes.\n\nWe're not thrilled with how the passive has played out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArthurRambo","date":"2016-03-01T04:24:58.361+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":29,"body":"I love twin fangs!

We're probably looking at pulling things closer to 50/50. I think a good sweet spot would be if felt like it was still going in for to really amp up the damage, but that you weren't completely zoned from effectiveness if you couldn't.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2016-03-01T04:39:48.125+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":5,"body":"What about making her Twin Fangs not deal a lot of damage, but make her poisons infinitely stack-able (maybe cap vs monsters) like Kalista's rend. Just make it so Twin Fangs grants a Q stack and resets the timer on her poison debuff to the full duration. You still have the same play pattern she has currently but the damage comes from her poisons. She lands Q, lands a bunch of Es, and the target melts from DoTs.\n\nHappy middle ground?\n\nEdit: Also let me clarify my proposal. Her E damage goes way down. Her Q poison duration goes up and it stacks. Her E refreshes the duration and applies another stack. Her W can, idk, spread her poisons to nearby enemies like Brand E or something. instead of what it does now. The key thing to remember is that she can spam E to up her damage, but she doesn't have to be spamming it to actively be doing damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2016-03-01T05:10:02.498+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":7,"body":">Here's some stuff we're happy with about Cassiopeia and are unlikely to change:\n\n>* Twin Fang as a high cadence spell.\n\n---\n\n>*cadence: A modulation or inflection of the voice.*\n>OR: *A sequence of notes or chords comprising the close of a musical phrase.*\n\nI'm so confused","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-03-01T05:25:14.818+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":3,"body":"Maybe I should have said spammable. \"Twin Fang as a spammable spell.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Dove Like You","date":"2016-03-01T05:46:00.558+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-03-01T07:42:05.539+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's one thing if a lot of people are just ignorant of the meaning, but \"cadence\" is a totally legit word to use in that context, tbh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Karma Deified","date":"2016-03-01T04:52:36.097+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":11,"body":"> \"brand new LoL Poison Mage.\" \n\nFirst rework converted Cass from poison Mage to \"brand new AP Marksman with no auto attack damage.\"\n\nIn all honesty, it'd make more sense to revert Cass and work from there.
