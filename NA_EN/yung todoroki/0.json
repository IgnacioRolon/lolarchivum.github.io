Connection didn't waver, internet didn't go down. I play another ranked game; \"Unable to connect to server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect.\" Tried opening it in admin, same message; tried running w integrated graphics, same message, tried w High Performance NVIDIA Processor, same message.
