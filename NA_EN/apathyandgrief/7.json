Dude, if you lose to Nasus as Olaf..you are olafing wrong.\n\nNo matter how much I land my Qs, no matter how many corrupting pots I use to sustain my mana and biscuit delivery, I can never bully him out of the lane. He just waits till the minions shove a huge wave since he refuses to clear it no matter what until they come under his turret. And by the time he mans the fuck up and tries to fight me, he's packing 200-250 stacks by 10 mins and just one shots me when I R to avoid his W, since I lost all my bonus armor and mr. And it's not like Conqueror is going to save me. It does hardly any early game damage against him, and the healing so niche and weak. \n\nDarius just can't win vs him anymore, no matter how much you harass him out of the laning phase. You do damage to him at first, but you can't seem to quite kill him. By the time he has a decent amount of stacks, he's untouchable vs Darius. He just ws him to slow down his hemorrhage stacking and it's so stupid. And if he starts losing, he just withers and runs. You can't stop whither, it's point and click. Even if I went PR Darius, I would scale so badly and do EVEN LESS damage.\n\nWhat made Darius so good vs Nasus back then was the ability to have armor pen Runes and the fact Nasus's lifesteal was significantly weaker and his stacking power was slower.\n\nI don't want to play Garen every time I see some stat-checking a-hole pick him. He's so boring and I hate playing him at all.\n\nNasus isn't a low-reward champion, in fact as long as you banned Illaoi or Garen, you have a high reward waiting in the shape of minions. He didn't need his stacking EARLY GAME where he's SUPPOSED TO BE WEAK get buffed.\n\nI don't think Nasus should have the concept of being \"Bad early game\" but he still wins simply because he farmed. What the hell kind of meaningful macro or decisions did he do that was SO much better than me? Riot pretends they hate \"Stat-check Champions\" {{champion:266}}  (Wow, he's such a statcheck champion, totally not reliant on his kit rather than his itemization) then they proceed to push their obvious bias and agenda towards them by buffing the absolute crap out of them.\n\nNasus did not need buffs, and it's not healthy how this \"Late game champion with a bad early game\" can get 800 stacks in jg by TWENTY MINUTES.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"speedameen","date":"2019-03-27T08:12:10.242+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nasus early game is fucking garbage (which is hwy they buffed his stacks)\nand late game he is perma CC'd.
