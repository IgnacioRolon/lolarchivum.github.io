It just means that they either took or were given near absolute power over the government. This actually happens occasionally usually after a period of unrest. Where one person does win control and then uses their authority to establish a more legalistic government. \n\nAnd also technically a military position can be a political one. The most obvious is historical shogun. Which was really just supposed to be the position that handles the emperors armies. Only it became more politically powerful than the emperor for awhile. \n\nBut anyway, if we consider Noxus a kingdom and there is no planned exit (like a term limit) for Swain’s political life, then Swain is a triarch. It’s like a monarch but there are three of them. I do not know of any triarchs historically. Though there is a few diarchs I’m aware of (rule of 2). \n\nIf we don’t consider Noxus a kingdom, more an empire. Then dictator would be the root we’d have to use. Now dict means to say which implies the absolute power where whatever the dictator says is law. This is different, the three leaders need to agree to enact policy. Triumvirate seems close but that was technically never a political position, it was just an alliance between three people who held various different government offices. \n\nI’d go with something like concordator or concordor. Where concordare is the Latin “to agree” then slap an ator at the end to make it a noun. Of course, concordator sounds a bit silly. So if you don’t like it then Trifarix or whatever term Riot game has just as much legitimacy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myren Quiddle","date":"2019-04-08T15:13:45.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his old title still suits him 'Master Tactician'.\nAlso, I like your comparison to Bismarck, nice one :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2019-04-08T20:35:00.839+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the Stalin jokes are based on his winter themed skin, because it had a very Russian officer vibe pre-rework.\n\nMore to the point, I think Noxus is best called a Triumvirate.  It's a council of three major leaders who make decisions, presumably by discussions or votes between them, although we don't know that for sure.  It's not quite a dictatorship or an autocracy, because there's not one leader with supreme power, but I wouldn't call it quite a Parliament or Senate either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-04-08T15:21:12.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain is a military leader, and Noxus seems to be a sort of stratocracy, which is a form of government headed by military officials. This type of society is a meritocracy, and can be autocratic (one leader) or oligarchical (few leaders), though most of the governing positions are held by military or ex-military officials. \nIt would seem this is the case since Boram Darwill was also a military general, and also since most of the focus of Noxus' affairs home and abroad are very focused around military matters. Even Swain's triumvirate is partially, if not fully, composed of military officials like Darius as the pillar of Might, and if the Vision pillar is held by a military strategist. Guile is most likely held by LeBlanc in some form or fashion, but she could be acting as a spymaster, which can also be a military branch. \n\nOverall, Swain leads a stratocracy, as an autocrat who is kept in check by an oligarchy. Hope that makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"ApathyAndGrief","date":"2019-04-08T17:43:31.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get that {{champion:7}} is supposed \"Guile\" but that wouldn't make a lot of sense given Swain knows exactly who she is and what the Black Rose is trying to do.\n\nNo doubt, if she disguised herself, the demon within Swain seems to be a creature of insight.

Keep your enemies closer.\"\n\nThe general understanding with this expression if that if you keep your enemies close to you, can easily track their every movement and thwart their attempts to undermine you before they can actually do anything detrimental. Especially in the case of someone like LeBlanc, if Swain can keep her in plain sight all the time, he can easily keep track of her machinations, and know when something is afoot. It makes 100% sense why Swain would deliberately choose LeBlanc, or someone she's clearly posing as, to be part of his council.","replies":[{"poster":"ANearMiss","date":"2019-04-13T02:57:38.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guile is Draven, ffs!","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-04-13T17:52:42.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ANearMiss,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=6qE36kZv,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-04-13T02:57:38.069+0000)\n>\n> Guile is Draven, ffs!\n\nNot if Might is Darius.
