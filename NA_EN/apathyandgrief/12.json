If you first time in ranked, you're not only risking your OWN Lp, but having complete disregard for how your own TEAM feels.  How...in what way is that some form of an EGO? \n\nRant boards are for when people go to let off steam, and I do admit saying \"You deserve to be banned\" was extreme. That WILL NOT, however, change my opinion. YOU SHOULDN'T disregard the fact THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE TRYING TO WIN. \n\nSecondly, about your builds\n\nThe fact you call people who follow meta \"sheep\" shows you're the egotistical one, not me. I'm not good at the game, but I'll be damned if I let my own dignity be lost entirely. \n\nMeta is caused entirely by the people who ARE GOOD at the game, and everyone else wants to do as well as them to climb.\n\nThat has been the nature of this game for a VERY long time.\n\nI apologize for assuming you were new, but honestly it's real freaking hard to tell the difference. \n\nYou've admitted you've had multiple accounts before. That shows a sign you're probably-- PROBABLY toxic and get banned often. Stop that. If you get banned that often, you're being a hypocrite when calling someone out for being a \"Kid\" or \"toxic\". \n\nBut let's say that you weren't banned and you've just \"forgotten\" your accounts. \n\nYou're still the egotistical one.\n\n\"I know my champs well enough\" \n\nNo, you really don't.\n\nIf you KNEW your champs, you wouldn't think your unconditional builds are actually going to work. \n\nI would honestly not be surprised if you're Bronze. \n\nNow, I'm not ENTIRELY going to dismiss your opinions based on that fact. (I LOATHE saying \"lol ur bronze xd\")\n\nI'm just saying, being at the bottom of the barrel, and being infamous for not seeing past your mistakes and the inability to climb from the least skilled elo, kind of loses any credibility of you \"Being good at your champs\".\n\nI don't want to come off as rude, but if you come onto the category which is going to have ANGRY and IRRATIONAL people and encourage upfront like an arrogant dick that they're wrong and that you're \"Glad\" they get mad, you shouldn't expect not to get any form of flame back.\n\nPlease, understand how tilting it is for first timers in ranked to go 0/9 vs a mastery 7. Ranked is NO PLACE for you to hone your skills with characters you obviously don't know how to play. It's selfish and stupid to disregard the 4 other people with you. We're not robots.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ApathyAndGrief","date":"2019-03-26T14:48:54.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention, this has absolutely nothing to do with an \"Ego\", it has to do you're deliberately putting all your teams at a disadvantage by being that one guy who for some reason plays a champion they have no idea works in R A N K E D.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nevurwin","date":"2019-03-27T17:02:12.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery hasnt been around long enough imo.
