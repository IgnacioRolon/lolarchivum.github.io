But until they actually fix their game, I can guarantee NO ONE's gonna come back just because you made a rare golden chroma for a new skin. \n\nI get it, skins are what spice up the game and add cosmetics into the game to make it more entertaining, but THIS IS NOT the solution to your playerbase decreasing by the hundreds and therefore losing money. We're quitting not because you're not making more gold chromas, we're quitting because your game has become less and less fun over the years for people and we don't have a reason to stay. GIVE US A REASON TO STAY AND ACTUALLY INVEST MONEY INTO YOUR GAME. TAKE FEEDBACK FROM YOUR PLAYERBASE-- NOT THE LCS.","replies":[]}
