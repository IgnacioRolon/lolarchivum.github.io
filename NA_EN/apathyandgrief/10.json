Does Riot not know how to keep a 4th game mode or something? I hear they put so much money out on this gamemode, and a lot of effort trying to make it a thing.\n\nHow can they say Nb wasn't successful but SOMEHOW atrocities like ARAM and TTL exist (Please, PLEASE tell me how either of those crap gamemodes are fun. )\n\nWhat's fun about ARAM? It's whoever has melee champs lose. Poke always wins.\n\nTTL is dead. There's no reason to keep this Gamemode over NB, it's just mini summoner's rift with no substance. Why does it even have ranked? \n\nIf Riot kept taking time with NB, actually trying to improve based on the feedback, and made sure to keep it fresh and interesting, it could've been a good replacement for TTL or ARAM. \n\nLast time when they put effort into a game mode was Dominion. They even included builds and strategies for that mode in Champion Spotlights as a way to push it forward to us.","replies":[]}
