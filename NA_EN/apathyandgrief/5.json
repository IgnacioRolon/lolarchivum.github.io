My issue with the Akali rework was the fact they took her old kit, which was overall unhealthy and kind of dumb, and morphed it to be 'different' but still remain the same concept but even better. \n\nHer Old passive gave her ridiculous lane sustainability as an Assassin. Yes, her new passive doesn't do this anymore but rather gives her an empowered attack. But her Q is the ability that gives her the lane sustainability now. Not to mention her q was annoying poke, and still is, annoying poke (Thankfully, not point and click)\n\nHer shroud rework was an overall buff for the previous shroud. She still had the concept of peaking in and out of it and repeatedly sneaking in and poking and taking out carries. \n\nHere en lies the issue; No one liked Akali's ability to do this to begin with. And the fact they practically made her shroud even BETTER than before. She could even harass you under turret. \n\nNow her ult; it's pretty much the same as before, but instead of holding two charges, it's just two dashes with a micro stun. However, people HATED this ability. And the fact they gave it EXECUTION damage is what angered people the most. \n\nAkali's rework was less of a redesign and more of \"How can we take this kit and make it modernized for today's standards.\"\n\nA rework is supposed to redesign a champion's kit and keep their playstyle and identity, not keep the same problems from before and buff them.\nThat's why she has been absolutely gutted. Granted, her previous problems are gone forever, but now we have a mess of a character that hardly works without those problems.\n\n\nBut this post is about Irelia, not poor Akali","replies":[{"poster":"VolatileAkali","date":"2019-03-19T17:00:46.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'll make it easy to understand why her design is fundamentally broken for an **assassin**. Also her kit is completely different, nothing is the same. I have played 1.5k games on Akali before the rework so I can say that this kit is **completely different without any similarities** (even her W is different than her old W)\n\n**Passive is counter intuitive for an assassin** as it back loads all the burst on a circle that is difficult to use in team fights. As an example, It is similar in concept of Fiora passive. it gives MS and does damage if proc'd, but without heal.\n\nHeal was her identity and should be kept no matter what people say. Her heal and triple dash were her identity and by triple dash I mean: Triple dash, charge system and point and click. Those two were the **core** of Akali not her damn shitty ass broken ass Shroud.\n\nHer old kit isn't peaking out and in unless your behind. Her kit was all about burst the fuck out of them and either Zhonyas to wait rotation or dodge/run away. \n\nI agree with you on this. Practically all Akali mains hate that they removed her old ultimate and put a stun and an executon which is bull shit to play as and to play against, because you removed her most core identity of Akali and you have introduced something that a lot of people will hate and is actually a toxic mechanic to add, just make her passive instantaneous with no circle and bring back triple dash.\n\nIt wasn't modernized or redisgned, her kit was removed and replaced with a completely new one. Nunu kept things and his other things either been removed or updated to modern standard. That rework is a modernization rework. Irelia rework was fantastic, the problem is that she was strong as shit, but Irelia mains seem to be happy with her now.\n\nYo, I'm posting this shit, I didn't spend my time writing this for nothing.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TengenToppaGnar","date":"2019-03-19T18:40:39.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":". . .

Once she starts having multiple dashes and gets that bullshit corrupting potion there's just no way to trade with her. She either needs her mobility gutted, her stun gutted, or her damage gutted, because it's just disgusting.

So they don't only just have less dmg then they would otherwise but that less damage is less effective against their opponent. \n\nA squishy however stays squishy and so a champion that is innately damage focused it only going to be minorly set back vs that opponent. \n\nEX. A high dmg champion with two items deals 1500 damage in a short period of time, however they are behind and deal physical dmg facing an opponent that ahead with 2000 hp and 150 armor that after mitigation can exceed the rate of damage they take with their own. HOWEVER! The squishy may only have 1200 hp or so by this point, so they are still very susceptible. Its takes a lot more of a difference in relative levels and items for a squishy to survive dmg cause they don't do nearly as much  to deal with it. \nWhen we are talking champions like irelia they have better base stats, better early game scaling, mobility and built in dmg reduction that if they play it right they effectively have a leg up back line champions on top of the fore mentioned, meaning need to be extremely behind to not be a significant threat to something that can die getting sneezed on.\n\n\nThe advantage these ranged squishies have is they can scale to a point they kill everything else before they can even engage, irelia is one case where and initial cc is optimal cause her engage is fast and strong.
