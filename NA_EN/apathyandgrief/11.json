Previous account was in mid-high silver. Why the hell is suddenly impossible to win THREE OUT OF FIVE PROMOS TO JUST GET SILVER 4?! First promotional match, did fantastic. Second one, I was dogshit. Third one, I did alright but my efforts had no relevance and we still lost. Fourth one, this asshole draven decided to smurf and completely dominate botlane, so I practically didn't exist in the game(Not to mention I misplayed the crap out of my lane). Now I lost my promos 1 to 3. On top of that, Riot somehow thinks giving me a \"Free win next promotional series\" is somehow going to make me FEEL better? That's the biggest damn insult you could ever give out to someone. You're basically telling me \"Since you're too dogshit to complete your promos, have a free win since you're too stupid to win on your own.\" How is ANY of this suppose to be fun?! I thought this was a videogame, not an over-demanding piece of shit! The point of a game is supposed to entertain and to have fun. Yes, Ranked IS a competitive part of this game, but in the end, IT'S A GAME! If it's not going to be remotely fun, emotionally stress you out, and force you to do an all nighter then it's not even a game anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2019-02-25T13:19:48.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why Ranked is not a 'fun' game mode, but a competitive mode. It's just to see 'how far can you go on your own' and that's it. Now APEX has a fun game mode, just saying.","replies":[]}]}
