Conqueror was both of these champs best runes last season, and now they gut it because ADC/Mage players are bitching about {{champion:157}} and {{champion:39}} one-shotting them. (Apparently Mid lane and ADC get to dictate TOP LANE runes now.)\r\n\r\nThe healing from Conqueror is so insignificant and unnoticeable, not to mention the AD and true damage you get from early game isn't even good.  \r\n\r\nThe only time you get to be a champion when you're Darius is if you absolutely curb stomp your laner. If you're Darius and get behind after you STARTED building {{item:3078}} , your chances of getting back into the game are low since it's too late into the game for you to be rushing armor. Even when Darius builds armor, he's so easy just to kite and just kill him.\r\n\r\nThe most depressing part about this all, is people are still convinced Darius is \"Op\" and ban the absolute fuck out of them. Those people, often don't know how to just WALK TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE CHASING YOU WITH HIS Q CASTING. LIKE, IS THE CONCEPT OF KITING HIM AND REDUCING HIS HEMORRHAGE STACKS THAT DIFFICULT? Literally play {{champion:420}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:24}} and Darius doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nOh, but I forgot, in low Elo no one knows how to actually fight {{champion:58}} and {{champion:122}}  so they just assume auto attack fighting them levels 1-3 is a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Moody P","date":"2019-03-30T21:09:37.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius counters Illaoi.

Also if you do commit to her walk perpendicular motions and circle her; this lets you dodge more tentacles even in her ult\n\nPR makes this matchup ridiculously easy since you have a few seconds of having enough MS to just GTFO if she suddenly hits you with scary damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xDogMeatx","date":"2019-03-30T20:44:34.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick holds his ground well vs {{champion:58}} \nWell darius screw that true damage when I want damage reduction I want it to reduce true damage.

I played many games as him. I felt top was better due to \"combat flow trades\" are mainly in his favor since he's a sustain fighter that has a summoner heal every 9 secs. Basically all he does is trade mana for go while also damaging them in the process if he's under tower don't worry he will heal back up while also claiming each minion due to on hit damage boost with q. He can also outlive a riven. His only weakness are those hardcore juggernaut types. But darius surpasses hardcore to unfun instant kill afk laning as warwick. The very fact his ult is the biggest screw you he can do to your damage reduction is pretty frustrating. Fun fact also you can actually lane vs irelia also. It won't be a OMG TRYHARD ANTI FUN MODE. Yasuo I though is ewwww he's a juggernaut fighter that has too far reach you need your W to q latch him.\nPress the attack for burst\nConqueror for super tanks/sustained fights\nGrasp for those matchup where you need go absolute tank","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"heroikc","date":"2019-03-30T21:06:50.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Conqueror was also outright broken, completely invalidating tanks just by the sheer presence of it.
