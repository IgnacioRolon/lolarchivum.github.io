I don't believe changing the in-game resolution would give you more sight of the map, since that could give some players a bit of an edge. Even still, you could try changing your in-game res to see if you can get it to look similar to your friends. I'd ask them what res their League is running at and mirror theirs to see what happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Paleelo","date":"2017-12-29T17:42:40.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my game with the resolution 1920x1200 \nhttps://imgur.com/a/AdO3B\n\nand on 1920x1080 \nhttps://imgur.com/a/foJ4C","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T16:43:56.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can provide a screenshot of what you're seeing, that would help us determine whether or not what you're seeing is correct.","replies":[{"poster":"Paleelo","date":"2017-12-28T18:21:54.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how can i do that i have a screenshot but how do i send it","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T18:23:42.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upload the image to an image hosting site such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/?) and post the link here.","replies":[{"poster":"Paleelo","date":"2017-12-28T18:27:52.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/VtYHD","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-28T18:34:20.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The image looks taller on top/bottom, and thinner on the left/right sides on my 1920x1080 screen.
