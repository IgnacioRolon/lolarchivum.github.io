Your client not appearing after hitting launch may be due to a setting on your OS that's blocking it from loading.  Restart your pc and try it again in case it crashed in the background.  Otherwise, run through the steps in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that your settings are allowing league as an exception.  Let me know if that helps and dries those tears!","replies":[{"poster":"PiciorMare","date":"2017-03-26T09:40:41.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I restarted and still don't work, i updated windows and now it works!!! ty very much","replies":[]}]}]}
