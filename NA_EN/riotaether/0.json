What do you think?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nIf you pop over to [the most recent sales post](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/champion-and-skin-sale-118-1111) you may notice that it looks different than [our sales up to this point](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/champion-and-skin-sale-1105-1108).  Upgrading the layout of our sales posts is something my team has wanted to do for a while since we publish them twice a week, but it took a while to finish a sales redesign between evaluation of heavier content, where ineffective layouts present a higher risk.\n\nOur primary goal with the redesign was to make the posts **efficient** and **informative**.  Here are a few of the changes we've made:\n\n* Called out the 50% discount rate\n* Converted the names of champions into links to their information pages\n* Added lightboxing to all images\n* Reorganized the champion section to 1 row x 3 columns\n\n\n\nLet us know how the new look is working out for you!  I've attached a side-by-side of the old sales layout and the new one for easier comparison.\n\n*Warning: The fullsize image is 2160 x 2940 px (2.4 MB)*","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2013-11-07T22:12:03.627+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely cleaner, definitely more efficient. Mission accomplished there!\n\nFrom a general sales standpoint, I do wonder why you don't also show the original price to show the amount saved if they buy it now/then.

The standard expectation on LoL.com is that clickable images link to full-sized views (eg screenshots in new skin announcements) but that rule may be bendable in this case since the loading screen banners aren't the same as full splash images anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"arkhammer","date":"2013-11-08T15:18:51.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to echo that it's more intuitive to have the champion lightboxes link to the actual champion page.  Here's why: the purpose of the page is to advertise a sale, with all the pricing and related information shown.  We're not buying a picture of the champion; we're buying the champion himself, so having it link to \"what you're selling\" when a potential buyer is curious makes the most sense and feels right for the buyer.  Considering that no sales can be conducted outside the client, may as well link to the best \"marketing\" page you have so the buyer will salivate about the on-sale champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vakabiel","date":"2013-11-08T13:42:38.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally get that, but I'm thinking the champion page has that splash in the background AND all the champ information which is what you want to see when trying to figure out if you want to play a champion or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kira Onime","date":"2013-11-08T00:06:23.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why not simply putting a link the the comment area.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kedrona","date":"2013-11-09T05:48:20.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cleanup is awesome knowing the goals you had in mind. While I'm a lorehound and absolutely loved the fun stories, I understand that they can be obnoxious for other people who just want to get to the point.
