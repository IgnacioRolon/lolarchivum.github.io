As mentioned in the [Challenger Rewards intro post](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/2016-challenger-rewards), we’re checking each qualifying account for win trading, elo boosting, toxicity, scripting, and other behavior that violates the Summoner’s Code. This process will take a few weeks. Accounts that are ineligible for in-game rewards will also be ineligible for the Challenger physical rewards.\r\n\r\n**If an account is ineligible, both physical and in-game rewards will pass down to the next eligible individual or team on the list. **\r\n\r\nWhen the review wraps up in December, players who earned rewards will be notified via their account’s [verified email address](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751744-Email-Verification-FAQ). This will include instructions for how to claim rewards, and players will have roughly one month from the time of the email to confirm their details. We’ll have another update when the emails are ready to go out!","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-11-16T01:21:00.761+0000","up_votes":83,"down_votes":0,"body":"So are you going to ship imaqtpie's jackets separately or stitch them together into a monkey-shaped beanbag chair?\n\nHe probably has enough challenger accounts for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Joseraph","date":"2016-11-16T18:45:27.909+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely dying, you sir have won","replies":[]},{"poster":"James Windsor","date":"2016-12-25T02:54:49.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahahaha\n 10/10","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ubyi","date":"2016-11-16T00:43:50.318+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":39,"body":"what if youre challenger and played duo with a scripter to get there ? is that forbidden or allowed?","replies":[{"poster":"IISorrow","date":"2016-11-16T00:59:40.416+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":8,"body":"logged in at 2 am just to tell your dumbass its OBVIOUSLY not allowed","replies":[{"poster":"Ubyi","date":"2016-11-16T01:03:12.458+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":5,"body":"well its allowed to duo with a flamer, he will get perm banned and me not.\n\nif i play with a scripter he will get banned and im not.\n\nit doesnt stand anywhere that its forbidden to play on your own account duo with somebody, if he does something illegal the punishment is on his account not on mine","replies":[{"poster":"Ubyi","date":"2016-11-16T01:04:25.050+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"i always here in duoq people wanting to report somebody premade with the scripter but there was never a case where duoing with a scripter resolved in a ban","replies":[{"poster":"Corp","date":"2016-11-16T01:12:22.564+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":13,"body":"Way to talk out of your ass.
