Thoughts?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys have probably noticed that the [Patch 4.2 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-42-notes) look significantly different from our previous releases ([4.1 Notes](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-41-notes) for comparison). We've changed a lot, particularly in how we handle balance changes.\r\n\r\nThe team (myself, **RiotPwyff**, **MoltovCarrot** and **Azrael**) would love to get your thoughts on the revamp and where we still have room for improvement. Feel free to get super granular and super specific - we've been going through the changes with a fine-toothed comb, so you won't lose us in the details.\r\n\r\nAnd for those of you who can't quite put your finger on what about the change you like or dislike, I've added a basic poll so you can still let us know how you feel overall.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n**PS:** Readers who landed here from other sites, remember that those of you from EUW and EUNE can post here now!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Quickshot","date":"2014-02-10T21:24:15.919+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely love the new layout.

It makes the patch changes a lot easier to see and compare to their previous iterations. In particular, laying out the damage increase formula on Ziggs's passive gives a much clearer picture on how its damage evolves as he levels up.\n\nThis may not be a huge bit of criticism, but it would be nice if you gave more visual indications to some of your changes. It would be awesome to see Ashe and Soraka's new icons in the patch notes, and perhaps even get a visual on Xerath and Skarner's reworks as well as the new effects on the updated summoner spells.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2014-02-10T21:57:09.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a fan of the strikethrough format. It feels redundant and cluttered. Specifying that values were lowered at later ranks, for example, felt easier to read and showed your intent more clearly.\n\nAlso the ToC looks very scrambled (I know this hasn't changed). At a glance it's not obvious what the horizontal rules are separating. And having the larger headings share lines just looks awkward, especially when it means the headings with subsections get a single line while the ones without will share a line.\n\nOn a positive note the individual entries are very clear and look much better. The champion entries aren't cluttered anymore, nor are their abilities. Definitely an upgrade here IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"moltovcarrot","date":"2014-02-10T22:17:25.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you go into more detail regarding your issues with the strikethrough?

For example, this line from Skarner's rework:  \n\"Effect :: ~~No longer provides an Attack speed bonus~~\"  \nWhen scanning across that line, my first thought is: \"Wait, does that mean there is now an attack speed bonus or not?\" The previous context is not clear in the way it is for the numerical changes, where the old numbers are clearly marked. I'd much rather you just state the ultimate result of the changes and the fact that it changed, rather than striking through a previous notice of removal.","replies":[{"poster":"moltovcarrot","date":"2014-02-11T19:48:17.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, yes.

IMO something like this would be more appropriate for Kayle (nothing special about Kayle):  \n\n---  \n\n#{{champion:10}}  Kayle\n*We lowered Reckoning’s AP ratio while raising the AP ratio of Divine Blessing’s heal. We also added an AP ratio to Divine Blessing’s movement speed bonus and removed Intervention’s mana cost.*  \n\nOnce she gets ahead, Kayle's burst damage can be overwhelming to play against. While we're taking away some of Kayle's up-front burst, the utility scaling on Divine Blessing should help her and her team get INTO (and out of) THE FRAY.\n\n>####{{champion:10}} Q - Reckoning  \n---  \nReckoning's burst damage was too high so we reduced the AP ratio. \n#####Ability power ratio: \n* #####Old :: 1.0  \n* #####New :: 0.6\n\n>####{{champion:10}} W - Divine Blessing \n---  \nDivine Blessing's heal was too weak compared to other champions, and we wanted to extend the recent utility scaling changes to Kayle. \n#####Heal/Ability power ratio: \n* #####Old :: 0.35  \n* #####New :: 0.45\n\n>#####Movement speed bonus: \n* #####now scales with ability power (+7% per 100 ability power)\n\n>####{{champion:10}} R - Intervention  \n---  \nReason (I have no idea why she got this) \n#####Mana cost: \n* #####Old :: 100 / 75 / 50  \n* #####New :: 0 at all ranks\n   \n---\n\n\nYou're going to have to use your imagination here since I couldn't do everything I was trying with the formatting. Substitute the block quotes and list bullets for indents and decrease the vertical spacing between the header and the block quote(caused from the header format). Personally I think this is more readable and the reason for each specific change is available right next to the change.  \n\nAlso as I was making that I noticed that the color and size of \"Ability Power Ratio : :\" made it kind of annoying to read. I'd suggest increasing the font size by a point or 2 and/or darkening the color just a little bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sh00t3rman","date":"2014-02-12T01:51:05.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like the strikethrough. Makes it very easy at a glance to focus on the new values. I would say to keep including the old values though instead of only having strikethrough text, though maybe for effect removal or adding just a description would be ok.\n\nExample - I would prefer this to what is currently there for Skarner's W:\n\nEFFECT :: ~~Provides an Attack speed bonus~~ -> No attack speed bonus","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moltovcarrot","date":"2014-02-10T22:15:33.012+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

I do like the abilities being listed with the icons and everything to avoid confusion though. However, the reworks look a little sloppy; the two of them look completely different and there's no standardization.\n\nXerath's rework looks lean and mean, while Skarner's looks like you're trying to justify the changes to him by saying \"we moved this here and that there\" with the mess of tooltip changes and strikethroughs; it makes it look like you guys were confident in the Xerath rework and didn't feel the need to list the old abilities, while Skarner's rework will be more controversial and must be justified instead of just listing what his abilities do now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mattarias","date":"2014-02-10T21:25:49.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So much nicer!
