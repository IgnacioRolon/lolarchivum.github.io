I sent in a ticket and did not get a response so I then went to the website to check my email to see that the email address that is in my account has been changed to a different email that is not one that I recongnize at all. please give me some clarification as to what I can do to change this back and possibly get my account un-banned as i really really enjoy the game. any help from a long time player would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nthank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T05:59:01.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're ever worried about the status of your account or why it's banned, you should hit up the account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
