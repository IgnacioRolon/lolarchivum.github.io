I posted some ideas in another thread about how to make him unique.\n\nRight now he plays sort of like a melee adc because hes so weak and squishy you absolutely must hurry to get both lifesteal and tank items on him, and even then he just gets mowed down unless there&#039;s a solid threat on your team.\n\nSome places I would remove some power:\n\nPassive: I would just remove the self resurrect because outside of early turret dives its junk. I don&#039;t care that it&#039;s up more often. This just equates to the enemy team circle jerking around your body to finish killing you. This should really be reworked into another passive that benefits his other abilities when his bloodwell is filled and gives him some stats. Give him more means to also then fill the bloodwell and spend it.\n\nQ: This is some hidden BS potential power. They say it&#039;s like a mini malphite ult, except it has an ENORMOUS delay, terrible range, and you essentially CC yourself in place to eat a boatload of damage and CC. Aside from all that, it is absurdly easy to dodge. Get rid of this crummy knockup and give him some real mobility in place of it, or something else entirely.\n\nW: You can go ahead and remove the toggle from this and just make the lifesteal passive, because right now he can hardly afford to use the damage component. This should really have some sort of active defensive ability tied to it with just passive heal every third hit.\n\nE: This is actually a solid ability and fun to use, but its pretty darn generic.\n\nR: A stat stick ultimate with zero real interaction. Remove the damage, give it a team attack speed buff for duration and a very brief AE fear.\n\nI posted another thread on how to spice aatrox up. He really should be a juggernaut. If you have to get rid of Q, then do it. We all hate that ability.\n\nThis is your drain tank fantasy right here. And the way you need to play it out is with his blood well passive as a resource that you generate and spend. Most of his abilities should probably come at a cost of life, maybe heftier, but then he needs to have better base stats. This guy should really be spending and generating life as a resource that ties into his bloodwell passive. As such, he should have more ways to heal. You could easily remove some of his damage.\n\nAlso the knockup is silly, the guy thematically should have a fear tied to his ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T17:29:15.105+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"One of the things that we have generally thought is important for juggernauts is that their mobility profile is such that they don't really have abilities that grant them instant access to where they want to be, and Aatrox's Q is in pretty direct conflict with that.

If any other Aatrox players could chime in with their opinions, I'd certainly be interested in hearing them.\n\nI play Aatrox often and a lot, more lately with the release of Sated, so I'm just gonna throw my 2 cents in.\n\nPassive: Completely vulnerable after his revive stasis. Not to mention he has no chance at sustaining after the blood well absorbs all his bonus attack speed. Late into the game, his revive with a full blood well revives him for about 900~ health, which isn't the greatest if the opponents can set up a lock-down when he comes out of it.\n\nQ: It has a very long start up. I read recently that someone suggested reducing the cast time the shorter it is to him, much like Soraka's Starcall. That would really help for set ups and quick reactions. \nThe one thing I hated most when Q'ing, is dying when using it, while with anyone else with a dash would make it away in time. Possibly give it a short frame of invulnerability at the top of his flight path? Fizz is invulnerable at the top of his pole, whilst Aatrox can get bodied flying above everyone. \nMaybe slow them after his Q or add a small slow radius outside of his knockup range?\nAll in all, his Q isn't that strong, especially when its easily channeled with such a long cast time. \nBuff it one way or another, but at the moment it's in an unreliable spot. \n\nW: The heal is nice, but the active is a lil underwhelming, especially when you're playing him in lane or whatnot. You'd have to build Armor pen to get the full affect of the bonus damage, and I believe his active is the only bonus damage in the game that doesn't proc lifesteal. Maybe allow it to proc lifesteal? \nMaybe change the damage to Magic damage to increase his strength as a hybrid damage dealer? (E and Ult are Magic Damage)\n\nE: Love it, no problem at all here. Move along.\n\nR: It's a Yi ultimate that doesn't increase movement speed and is affected by slows. The damage is subpar, considering it scales with ap, which no one builds (At least after DFG was removed - Q-DFG-Ult-E-GG).\nNerf the damage and attack speed buff. Make the damage scale with HP, so it rewards tankier builds, allowing him more utility. \nOne idea I've had was this. His lore states that he turns battles around single handedly. Possibly he can heal allies near him based off of the amount he lifesteals? Maybe just base it off a percentage of damage he deals? Maybe even just a flat rate per auto attack. \nGive him something more than just a self buff, when his lore it says armies benefit from his presence.\n\nNo one's saying to rework him, not even do every suggestion people are asking, but make him more reliable.\n\n**Tl;dr, Passive Revive is unreliable, Q is unreliable as an escape and easily channeled, W damage is unreliable, Ult is linear and just a combination of other champions' ablities.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shénzhì","date":"2015-08-12T17:38:02.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=obthG7K3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-12T17:29:15.105+0000)\n>\n> _\"If you have to get rid of Q, then do it.

We probably just don't like how easily cancelled it can be. Because you stay in the same place until you land, if you are caught or stunned while you use it, you will be in the same place. Not like other jumps like Tristana's. \nBut I never heard an Aatrox player complaining abut the Q itself.\nI've been saying these weeks that Aatrox feels good with Sated Devourer. But that item is toxic in other Champions {{champion:11}} {{champion:5}} .\nIf there was an Aatrox rework in mind, I would recommend to get ideas from his Sated Devourer build. Like for example, making his W proc every two hits when maxed but every 4 when at 1 point. That way you improve his late game and teamfight potential and nerf a little his oppressive high sustain laning phase. \nOr as other users suggested, changing the ult so when you activate it, the W procs every two hits instead of 3. that could be another interesting thing.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticSirius","date":"2015-08-13T02:27:54.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that idea about his ult interacting with his W","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2015-08-12T18:40:19.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm curious as to whether the above statement is true of most Aatrox players, or if you were generalizing here.

I think the range should be buffed a bit, and the delay shortened, and he shouldn't get his Q interrupted by cc. That ruins him.\n\nI like his kit, but I think the AP scaling shouldn't be on so many abilities (other than maybe the ult). Like, you don't build AP on Aatrox. Can't we just get his E to scale on AD and have a better ratio? Then if the delay is shortened on his Q, I think he'll be used a lot more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-08-12T17:35:13.890+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's definitely wrong.

I would like to see the range slightly increased.  \n\nW: I also love it, though the cost seems to be a little too detrimental in fights.\n\nE: Could use a touch more range, and a slightly shorter cast animation.\n\nR: This ability feels wrong when I cast it.  It doesn't do a meaningful amount of damage.  It's counter intuitive because you will want to auto more but the cast time in the animation ensures you will die if you activate it inside of a team fight.  Maybe take the aoe damage off and increase the range on his abilities, keep the AS buff because that's what its mainly for but take off the aoe damage component because you should be wanting to use this earlier in an engage.\n\n\nOverall Aatrox: If I were to propose a new kit setup this is what I would propose. \n\nPassive: When Aatrox deals damage X% is stored in a bloodwell.  His abilities can tap into the blood to increase their effects.  Attack Damage is also increased based on how much blood is stored.\n\nQ: Aatrox rises then dives to the ground at a target location dealing X damage and knocking up opponents.  The damage is increased for how much blood he has stored. \n\nW: Toggle- \n'On' every third auto attack deals bonus damage increased for how much blood is stored.  Consumes x% of the blood stored\n'Off' every third auto attack heals Aatrox increased for how much blood is stored.  Consumes x% of the blood stored\n\nE: Fires two blade that intersect at a point dealing damage and slowing all enemies hit.

If you built too much damage you would be useless in the aspect that you'd have nothing coming out of your w and if you built too much speed you'd also have no blood well to use your w or other abilities with.  The R is more for a team fight changer and is more a result of his lore. With a setup similar to this he would be much more strategic in fights and would have obvious weaknesses and strengths.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WarWork","date":"2015-08-12T17:49:54.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah we like his Q, Hate the delay.

They don't have any real interaction with his kit beyond \"let this guy attack people\" (through bonus attack range, repositioning, and crowd control), so it's pretty hard to feel like any of them have a real cool impact on his kit. Compare to Darius's Q, which helps spread his Hemo stacks (*especially* with his new Innate) on multiple targets, allowing him to set up for an ult chain, or Olaf's Q, which gives him sticking power that forces him to keep moving forward (which is unique to his unstoppable Berserker playstyle), or Tahm's Q, which allows him to slowly slather his opponents up from afar (or speed up the rate at which he does it in melee) and makes him into the dangerous close-range CC machine he is. \n\nThe only mechanics that really feel like they belong on Aatrox are his Innate and W, which emphasize a more consistent/ramping power while in combat with a combination of offense and defense.

Well first, doesn't really play up the fantasy of \"inspires a bloodthirsty army\" that he gets in his lore. Biggest complaint I had when I saw him hit the PBE. I love the AS buff, range buff, and the model change is cool. Damage is a nice surprise to get a sudden kill if my E and auto can't do the job. Just walk in, and ult. But the scaling, why? Like sure HTGB is a cool niche item for him, but it doesn't feel worth replacing it over any other LS item just to boost your E and ult's damage in a small amount. If the scaling was more I might consider HTGB a mandatory, but for now it's just a surprise burst damage with a AS steroid that doesn't deliver the fantasy told in his lore.\n\nIdeas for the ult could be:\n1. Change the scaling on his ult to AD\n2. (Please don't do this one) Give him AP scaling elsewhere on his kit to maybe make him a hybrid?\n3. Do something like Fiora's. Every enemy he slays gives off a placement aura that inspires his allies in someway (like a small 500 unit AS, LS, dmg buff, etc.. whatever is the aura for his allies if they stand in it or stand in it for X seconds)\n4. Combine 1 and 3. This would of course lead to lower damage or scaling on his ult (like if you switched it to AD) and the kill-aura is noticeable but not outrangous.\n\nAs it stands, I live his ult but it just doesn't deliever the fantasy. It's more of \"I'm in love with the visuals\" than a \"In like with gameplay\".\n\n**TL;DR: Passive needs rethinking to be more reliable. Q feels unreilable. W feels one-sided. E is great. Ult doesn't deliver fantasy.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Izak Newton","date":"2015-08-12T22:38:52.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think that Aatrox's kit is just fine the way it is currently. Aatrox only really needs his numbers tuned up so that his early game isn't as bad and he can get to snowballing more easily. The problem I've ran into while playing Aatrox is that he has a weak early game that scales into a sub-par mid and late game. As it stands right now, I think that Aatrox can fit into either a tank role or a fighter role, though he doesn't excel at either one in particular. If Aatrox's numbers were tuned up I think he'd fit nicely into a fighter role; but if the balance team has no intention of buffing Aatrox with regards to damage, then add some more durability to his kit and buff his crowd control and label him as a tank. Also, in terms of simple quality of life changes, his Q could stand to have a faster wind up and/or have crowd control affect him at the end of the ability and not during it (similar to Jarvan's dash combo); this would alleviate some frustration about his Q being easy to dodge/easy to cancel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2015-08-12T22:19:47.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=obthG7K3,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-12T17:29:15.105+0000)\n>\n> One of the things that we have generally thought is important for juggernauts is that their mobility profile is such that they don't really have abilities that grant them instant access to where they want to be, and Aatrox's Q is in pretty direct conflict with that.

If any other Aatrox players could chime in with their opinions, I'd certainly be interested in hearing them.\n\nGenerally speaking, I'm okay with the Q, but I feel that it should be able to travel a bit farther. It's a rather short jump considering it has a \"wind-up\" time that gives enemies the opportunity to stop him, but at the same time I acknowledge that the landing it pretty nice for how fast it goes off when used offensively. Would it be possible to maybe increase the range on Q, but make it so the farther he jumps, the smaller the outer ring of damage gets, until at max range he does nothing unless he nails the knockup portion of the dash?\n\nI do feel that the AS steroid on his passive is lackluster though. It's annoying, because he is partially reliant on it for his AA-heavy kit to work, but at the same time, his revive drains his blood pool, which makes it all the harder to turn around a fight after revival, as you've just lost a pretty hefty chunk of your dueling power. Not really sure how you would shuffle all that around to handle it, though, it doesn't make much sense for his passive not to drain during his revival either. \n\nAlso it sucks a lot to pick Aatrox only for the enemy player to defeat me simply by picking Nasus.
