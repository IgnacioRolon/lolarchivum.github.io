Nothing works. And I had the same issue with the new client but instead of the Black screen i got the new logo and a loop just going around infinitely. \r\n\r\nNow that I have deleted everything and installed the launcher again I can only open the old client and it doesnt work. Help please.","replies":[{"poster":"afatboy2012","date":"2016-12-30T10:19:01.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, John\n\nI solved the problem. It may be related to the proxy.
