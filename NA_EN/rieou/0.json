I can tell this is not simply a slowdown on my end but rather really slow response issues(buttons still highlight and make there hover sound and do there click animations and I can usually interact with any view menu) when changing screens. Whenever I attempt to create or join a new game the client takes 20s-2min just to get me there. Whenever I lock in my intended roles it takes time just for the 'find game' button to enable itself. Just in general using the more core aspects of the client have become impossible. even when i do find a game it will trap me in the \"waiting for other players to accept\" screen but still actually put me in champ select when I restart the client. I have never made it to the ban phase... as soon as I get to select the champion I plan on playing it stops at zero and never continues. I would love to be able to play.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T04:17:41.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do me a favor and try turning on the option called \"low-spec mode\" in the client settings. It kind of sounds like the client might be acting a little slow due to some of the fancy animations it has, so that might be able to help. If it doesn't, try running a quick repair and then a clean boot to make sure the files are still working properly and nothing in the background is slowing down the client.","replies":[{"poster":"rieou","date":"2018-01-11T21:43:15.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am always in \"low spec\" mode and specifically said the client is unresponsive not slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T22:07:52.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, good to try all the troubleshooting steps available especially the quick and easy ones rather than skip something that could help. Were you able to try the repair and clean boot I suggested as well?","replies":[{"poster":"rieou","date":"2018-01-11T22:22:15.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry if my reply seemed a bit aggresive that was not my intention. I have tried repatching and full repair neither worked. I am now going through the full reinstall processing(I used the hextech repair tool), however this was the normal not the clean reinstall.\n\nThank you for replying.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T22:56:57.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah all good! Reinstalling might be able to clean up some damaged or missing game files if that's the main issue, I would still be sure to try a clean boot as well if that doesn't help! \n\nOverall, you may need to reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if worse comes to worst. They'll be able to deep dive into some of your game logs possibly to see any issues too.","replies":[{"poster":"rieou","date":"2018-01-12T20:57:09.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had this ticket submitted for 2 days and I have clicked request a human 3 times already and I havent even been given some automated response or any clarification that it is really being looked over. but I recieved an email asking me how my service was...
