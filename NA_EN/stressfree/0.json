It never goes below 120 anymore It was fine from morning to afternoon that day but in the night the problem occurred. I have tried everything on my end to solve the problem, resetting League, resetting my router and resetting my computer and using the repair tool in the launcher but to no avail. When I run speedtest.net everything shows to be normal and I only have this higher than normal ping in League of Legends and no other online game that I currently play so I don't think this is a problem on my end. Using the Hextech Repair Tool did not solve my problem. It is hard to play the game because of how laggy it is due to such high ping.\r\nAny help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"StressFree","date":"2016-11-27T07:09:25.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still couldn't get the problem fixed.
