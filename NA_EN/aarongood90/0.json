EX: (10 LP per win)\r\nI submitted a ticket to ask why this was and I got an email back...\r\n\r\nSince my MMR is low is 1 reason, which I don&#039;t know why my MMR is low to begin with.\r\nThe second reason is because I dominate each game by myself and have a strong win streak 9 game win streak right now to be exact, its making me have low LP gains per win.\r\n\r\nI figured since I&#039;m doing so good my LP gains would be higher, now that&#039;s not the case, it makes me have lower LP gains.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else think this is kinda BS?","replies":[]}
