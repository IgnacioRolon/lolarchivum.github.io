Like at home a have my desktop, and for breaks at school i have a laptop. I was wondering if it was possible to turn off automatic saving of controls between computers so i dont have to change them back and forth every day. (i use a mouse with buttons on the side for home, but not school, and its a pain to change my binds)","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-24T21:46:22.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, the short answer is no.  But there is a side-solution you can sometimes try.  Let me explain:\n\nThere is no way to stop the client from porting over your saved settings.  However, you can quickly and easily force your computer to use all default settings rather than the saved settings from your other computer.  To do this:\n\n1. Make sure you are signed into League and are on the Client\n2. Open your installation of League:  C:/Riot Games --> League of Legends --> Config\n3. Find the files input.ini and persistedsettings.json and delete them.\n\nOnce you start a new game, everything will be set to default.  However when you go back home, your settings there will mirror the settings at school until you complete the same step.  I'm not sure if this helps, but I wanted to provide the solution to you.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2016-05-24T23:22:52.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"somewhat related, to which god should we offer sacrifice to have custom key bindings for each different champion?
