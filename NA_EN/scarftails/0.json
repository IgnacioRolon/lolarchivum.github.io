Just a quick question concerning the item sets in the new update. I have been searching everywhere on the main screen after you login but can't seem to find a button that allows my to create item sets. I know they have not been removed though, since during game play, my previous item sets made before the updates were still there. I would really like to be able to create, delete, and edit item sets again, only if I could find them! Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T23:24:55.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ability to create and edit Item Sets is not in the Beta Client. It has not yet been decided if this functionality will be brought to the new client. For now, you can still edit/create them on the legacy client, launch into a custom match to ensure they load up in-game, then see them in-game while playing on the new client.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
