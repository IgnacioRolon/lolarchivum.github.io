For context, I&rsquo;m Camille&rsquo;s narrative writer. I&rsquo;m responsible for Camille&rsquo;s VO and I also wrote &ldquo;The Weakest Heart&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tea with the Gray Lady&rdquo;, and her bio.\r\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t usually post on the boards (we writers tend to be a little shy), but I do read. As the author of the above stories, I want to ease the fears of Viktor fans where I can. I understand it feels crappy to wait in the dark and wonder. My intention in &ldquo;The Weakest Heart&rdquo; was never to strip Viktor of his background. Two of Viktor&rsquo;s core narrative pillars for me are that he is a fervent believer in his cause and that he is a man of science. \r\n\r\nOn a recent devblog Ant in Oz mentioned the idea of a story hook. I thought &lsquo;evolving&rsquo; the Glorious Evolution could be a good hook to dig into with Viktor and challenge him as a character. (Part of building story hooks is also to make hooks we, as the writers who might be using them in the future, want to tell.) \r\n\r\nViktor wants to bring people to his cause. He wants those people who join him to understand his cause as he does. As some have speculated here, what if some of those people see more of the miracle and less of the science? What would a man of science do with that? For me as a writer, that&rsquo;s a juicy character question to build a story around. (Which is why I didn&rsquo;t give Camille an aside on Viktor in &quot;The Weakest Heart&quot;. I thought it would be a bit cheap to answer it that way versus a story that centered on Viktor as the protagonist.)\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies things a bit and helps Viktor fans sleep better tonight.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-11-30T07:15:19.262+0000","up_votes":74,"down_votes":6,"body":"Oh thank Nagakabouros you came in here ThermalKitten.

I would wager your hook was successful in that when the Glorious Evolved were revealed many, for better or worse, immediately turned to scrutinizing Viktor's possible connection and what it might imply. I think it has been made quite apparent that fans of Viktor are quite defensive of his character as remembered from the early days of League, a sensitivity that is not unfounded considering the uproar that occurred when Jayce's initial lore was introduced. We mean no disrespect, and I hope those who have something to say are more inclined towards critique rather than criticism.\n\nThat said, I would like to thank you for Weakest Heart; it is thus far my favorite piece written for League. The story is clear, delivers a plot that is wrapped up by the end while providing a wealth of detail and history that gives it greater depth. I have sympathy for Camille whereas before I doubted it would be possible with how callous her voice lines were. Well done, and best of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Viktorious Sayph","date":"2016-11-30T08:50:23.156+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you are going the \"people misunderstand him\" way, you are in a right way but if you are going the other way, just stop please.\n\n#It's not surprising that people could misunderstand his cause, since even the genuises couldn't figure out Viktor's augmentations because of how much complex it was.\n\nViktor was and should be left in a neutral state.

What you say is very much valid and i agree when you are writing an original story. However, this is about already established characters that already have an identity. People who love viktor, diana, leona, etc love the CHARACTER not the name. Changing someone competently like they did with leona, diana and pantheon is spitting in the face of everyone who loved/related to those characters, and shows a completely lack of respect for the character themselves. Just because she still has the name \"leona\" means nothing. In fact if they changed her name alone it wouldn't matter as long as she was still \"herself\". This why people get so tired of comics and why i personally don't like them. It sucks when someone takes someone you love and shit's on it while telling you \"it's the same character... he's just 100% different now...\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-11-30T07:23:31.838+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im glad someone at riot is commenting on this trying to ease the people.

This means a lot, really.\n\nI'm the person who created the first concern thread; a preemptive plea is better than a late one, and I guess we succeeded in getting a response.\n\nI'm sorry if the titles of the threads sounded scary, that's because we ourselves were scared and were trying to get the attention of people infinitely more powerful than us. I saw the hook, I noticed how Viktor's name wasn't mentioned in the Weakest Heart.\n\nWe just couldn't have been sure if he indeed wasn't leading these cults, or if it was the case of a preparation for the change of his original lore.\n\nThe possible version where he actually disapproves of these cults or even actively tries to disassemble them is very interesting. This builds on top of the established character who is rather reclusive by evolving the ways the world around him reacts to his inventions. These would be in a way consequences of his work which he didn't predict, and with which he has to deal now. This challenges him because in a sense, he's creating obstacles for himself. I very much like the way you created an introduction for a story element, the hook is good! Revealing everything in the same moment would have overwhelmed a story. The way you write** is** awesome.\n\nI would only add this: the third important thing about his character is that he was extremely naive up until recently. And he possibly still is. \"The scary Machine Herald is actually naive\". I haven't seen this possibility in any other League character, and I believe it does wonders for him. He got his inventions and blueprints stolen from him not once, but twice. He was thinking there would be justice in Zaun (arguably one of the most immoral places on the planet), and he believed Jayce would work with him, even after he became the Machine Herald.\n\n>He wants those people who join him to understand his cause as he does.\n\nThis is coherent with the way of thinking of a scientist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2016-11-30T08:20:41.254+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":12,"body":"Inb4 the kind of people that still won't be satisfied with Viktor's lore after it's released. \nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ThOG1kNyics/WBSLcnyT7tI/AAAAAAAAXDM/IGs4aIsr5qU0l02EuvvhlC1Gorr10m_WwCLcB/s1600/32.png\n","replies":[{"poster":"Viktorious Sayph","date":"2016-11-30T09:00:55.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The only problem viktor is clear af tbh.\n\n#He is neutral and he is scientist, doesnt just go evil but does science.

Yes he is a brilliant scientist, he did augment a majority of his own body himself, but he is in no way a morally grey character at this stage. Anger and Jealousy at having another man get praised from creating Blitzcrank and that same man stealing more data and using it to rebuild Urgot is what drove Viktor to the Evolved Scientist we see today.\nFrom his bio: \"His previous hope to better society was replaced by an obsession with what he called ''the glorious evolution.'' He saw himself as the patron and pioneer of Valoran's future - a future in which man would renounce his flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations.\"\nThis ^^^ does not sound like a sane, morally gray individual. GE doesn't sound like a mere calculation, that sounds like something from the mind of a man twisted by his own creation. Viktor augmented himself whil in the throws of depression and was a man with hopes and dreams dashed, and all these emotions and feelings got twisted into a single goal upon augmentation, Be Better Then The Rest. Prove to the fools in Zaun, the simpletons in Piltover, and mostly to Stanwick himself, that Viktor is the greatest scientist in Runeterra and he alone will lead the way to a better tomorrow.\nAnd to end this, even Riot has long listed Viktor under \"Villain\". They say he is a villain type character when they were talking about how the concept of Fullmachine Viktor came about and was made.","replies":[{"poster":"The Anagram King","date":"2016-12-02T10:37:02.117+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it wasn't anger and jealousy that they depicted.

He was somebody else. He did not call out Stanwick (as far as we know). He did not call for revolution. Indeed; he called for *evolution*, and bade people to see the future that he now envisioned. Whether or not he makes his augments available for charity purposes, they are on the market, he strives towards his obsession. Yes - Viktor is obsessed. He pursues his vision. Would he do it at any cost? Battlecast alternate universe says maybe. But in this universe, he is nothing but an innovator.\n\nAn innovator who chose not to pursue justice or revenge. An inventor who created a new step in the evolutionary chain that humanity COULD choose to take. And considering the augmented are 'volunteers', it is evident that he aims to persuade - not to victimise.\n\nRiot thought they were making a villain, maybe. But that's not what they made.

But if it is not *yet* complete, this could be a really fun idea. I remember back during the days that we were asking for VIktor's first rework, we put out LOTS of ideas about the direction we felt his kit should follow; along with the best ways to turn his shortcomings to strengths. My particular favourite was \"Make sure you auto after using Q, otherwise what's the point in even HAVING the shield?! Soak minion damage and win the trade through sheer persistence!!\"\n\nAnd Solcrushed in all his benevolence GAVE US AN EMPOWERED AUTO! That gesture alone made it all worthwhile! :P\n\nSo yeah; it might be worth making the effort! Particularly now that we know *precisely* which Rioter to address.  As an example, maybe...\n\n* We could play through what led him to be the man he is (the sudden epiphany and subsequent obsession with his own self-transformation. The realisation that it was something big. VERY big. With implications such that - should he succeed - humanity might never be the same again. That these \"upgrades\" could be applied to anybody); \n* We could talk about whether or not he seems to *actually* have removed his emotions, or is merely suppressing them due to his own personal ideals or own insecurities (after all - he sure enjoys lasering a whole bunch for somebody who doesn't feel emotion :P); \n* We could muse upon what lengths he would go to to achieve or reshape his own goals - ie: the Jayce incident. Maybe even a potential justification for what decisions may have been involved in the alternate reality that became the Battlecast universe (I particularly am of the opinion that Battlecast began as a response to the threat of the Void, though Skarner seems out of place. Admittedly, he IS an Alpha model));\n* We could even share our thoughts on what that intangible **it** is, that makes VIktor so damn relateable. So seemingly complex, where in actuality, there is very little for us to go on. There's so much *implication* in the things he has simply refrained from doing. The potential is there for him to be quite special.\n\nI think that's the scariest thing, about Viktor changes. The threat of squandered character potential.
