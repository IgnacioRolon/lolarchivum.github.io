Make him actually land his abilities properly.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tons of people have all kinds of reasons why they can&#039;t stand Yasuo, but I for one only have a problem with him for one simply reason that I don&#039;t see being discussed a whole lot:\r\n\r\nHis abilities are absurdly forgiving in allowing him to the land them. If this nonsense were fixed, it would go a long way. He&#039;s so infuriating because it feels extremely unfair he didn&#039;t use his abilities properly\\at the right time and it lets him use them anyway. I don&#039;t know another champion that is more egregious in this. Here&#039;s some examples:\r\n\r\n* ** His ULT**: It&#039;s almost unbelievable the window he has on his ult. I can&#039;t count the number of times me or other teammates have landed on the ground from a knock up and it allows his ult to go off anyway. It looks hilariously stupid to watch this happen and yet it can happen every game a Yasuo is in.\r\n\r\n* **His Windwall**: Again, same thing. His wall should not be blocking abilities before it is actually out on the playing field. Currently, a Yasuo can have my skillshot literally be .1 inches from his face, and he hits W and the animation barely starts and it blocks it with only his sword having moved in the animation. It&#039;s silly and feels ridiculous.\r\n\r\n* **His Dash with Windwall**: This is piggybacking off the point above but still valid. I can&#039;t count the number of times a Yasuo has put his wall up, he is on the same side of it as I am, and when I cast an ability and he tries to dash through a minion it lets him just block my ability even though his character has not crossed to other side of the wall.  It&#039;s like as long as he starts his E animation near the wall it doesn&#039;t matter it just grants him the wall blocking it.\r\n\r\n* **HIs Tornados**: Now this could be lag or hitcoding or whatever I&#039;m not sure, but I have been hit plenty of times and knocked up outside of the nado animation. \r\n\r\nAll of this combines to frustrating play and leaves nearly no room for counterplay since any attempt to outwit a Yasuo just results in Yasuo either landing abilities he shouldn&#039;t, or unintentionally blocking my abilities I casted not because I am an idiot and casted spells into a windwall, but because I thought it would land on him and the game just said yeah right not happening.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-06-03T20:27:13.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This doesn't even mention how he can forego having to land the tornado, by just E + Q, and it's impossible to dodge.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2017-06-03T20:30:13.806+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=deadlychuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Yl5xzVuI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-03T20:27:13.916+0000)\n>\n> This doesn&#x27;t even mention how he can forego having to land the tornado, by just E + Q, and it&#x27;s impossible to dodge.\n\n\nForget that.

Malz is ranged, so shouldn't be in tower range normally, and Warwick already has godly diving capabilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FeelsCampedMan","date":"2017-06-03T21:10:54.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"window on his ult too long\"\nYou do realize that's simply the duration of CC on you right?\nOnce the CC ends, he can no longer ult\n\nWhen a knockup is ending, you're about to land on the ground, and it visually looks like you're almost on the ground BUT, you're still CC'd. \nThere is nothing wrong with his window to ult, it only lasts as long as the knockup affecting you","replies":[{"poster":"Slogg","date":"2017-06-03T21:27:46.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have watched players on countless occasions hit the ground, Yasuo ults, and it rises them back up in the air.
