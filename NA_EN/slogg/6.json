Riot, are you going to continue this pattern of releasing the dumbest, most hilariously broken reworks over and over again? She has been permabanned since she was released. This game just showed why that will now continue to be the case.\n\nTSM is getting outplayed to the max, and here comes Akali with 2 kills and the game is now instantly over. What a great game that was to watch!!! You guys need to get it together, this is absolutely stupid to witness. At least the Twitch chat is funny to watch spams of \"Akali balance, wow gr8 balance m8, etc\"","replies":[]}
