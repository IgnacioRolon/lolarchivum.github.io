Fixing ASAP! haha!\"\r\n\r\nThis game is close to trashcan levels right now as a direct result of repeated design decisions over the last two years. You have lifelong streamers ragequitting games, Pros openly mocking Riot with memes and questioning your design decisions, LEC getting 1/4th of its viewership it did last year on opening day, so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nRiot is at a critical point right now where the majority of people playing are playing as a result of addiction, and not because they actually enjoy playing the game. Most only play because there isn't anything else to play right now. Once you guys lose those, there's no coming back. They are gone for good. Riot REALLY needs to start realizing this and start changing the way they are approaching League right now.\r\n\r\nTheir decisions are so awful that they released a champion with the intent to be played support {{champion:235}} , and is now being perma pick or ban as an ADC. Everyone at Riot should really be reflecting on how something like that is even possible.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to sound doomsday like, but I literally don't have a friends list anymore because they've all quit playing. I really think Riot needs to start listening to the playerbase and get back to making League about strategical based play where the highlights are a team that had smart, strategic gameplay with object management, and not that an Aphelios pressed R and deleted 3 players off the map and now the game is over.","replies":[]}
