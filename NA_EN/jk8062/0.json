But no champion is worth the asking price in RP (even just barely when on sale - Lulu, I'm only looking at you), and the first week it will be impossible to play due to insta-lockers anyway (tried it with Vel'Koz and Braum).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pheverr","date":"2014-08-01T07:25:26.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen a couple popular Youtubers with Gnar.","replies":[{"poster":"jk8062","date":"2014-08-01T07:40:44.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too it must be just pbe. ive been wondering how to play that","replies":[{"poster":"DualTwin","date":"2014-08-07T04:48:44.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta be lv 30 and go on league website","replies":[{"poster":"jk8062","date":"2014-08-07T09:33:41.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is that it?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2014-08-01T16:03:15.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when he is ready TM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverclaw","date":"2014-08-01T05:06:30.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next patch, most likely.","replies":[]}]}
