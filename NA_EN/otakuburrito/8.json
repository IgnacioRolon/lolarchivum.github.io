Some of us just aren't cut out for ranked at all. It was stupid of me to even think I could make it to gold. After 6 years on this game and the fact I'm still silver should be the only notice I need I'm garbage at this game. Iron 4 here I come...\n\nEDIT 2: So I played with ChickenWrap (thanks again) and my biggest issue seems to be wave manipulating that leads to lack of lane prescence. Also my former friend was trolling tf out me with his advice. You don't build Liandry's on Varus or essensce reaver :x. And it's okay to push lane/poke your opponent as long as you're winning. And the Jungler can gank through lane. You know I'm starting to think some of y'all high elo players troll low elos like me for LULs like that asshole did. Also I fixed my runes and I'm practicing a combo now. ;-; I'm not dogshit tier but even me starting off strong or with a good KDA gets blown because I just don't have a prescence despite being fed :(","replies":[]}
