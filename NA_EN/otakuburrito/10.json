Either way we get kills most of the time. I'm completely fine with suiciding to get the team ahead. \n\nOther problem is B. If I play a mage support I try to make a fancy play and fail really bad. \n\nI've gotten the most S's with leona, but i'm still learning so I only get them about 25% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Nami no Dewae","date":"2016-07-05T04:09:00.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, leona's an all in champ, its hard for her to escape once shes in deep.

Trick is to alwayz have wards up before fighting in lane. And always know when to go in and not to. After lane phase always be near where all the action and team fight is.

I don't like to sit back and shield a guy or provide a heal and that be my contribution to a fight. The only two i've had success with that fit that style are Karma and Taric, both of which have the ability to do something other than be passive. I've also had semi-success with bard but hes rather hit and miss for me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2016-07-05T03:49:54.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i Got lucky n got a S on nami, but its cuz of my team not me...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-07-05T09:23:59.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito: Should be fine now. you get xp for killing wards now and assists count 10 seconds after death :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-07-05T06:13:10.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami no Dewae","date":"2016-07-05T03:49:47.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yet no matter how good I do, I'm still reliant on my team.\" \nThis should be the last clue that makes it obvious. . .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami no Dewae","date":"2016-07-05T03:02:28.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support duh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaos689","date":"2016-07-05T02:51:21.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adc.\nExcept that's BS because everyone knows it's all me 100% legit im pro adc ill 2v1 skrubs come at me irl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eunbi Bias","date":"2016-07-05T02:46:06.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support. if not then adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wr√Üth","date":"2016-07-05T02:44:38.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support ?
