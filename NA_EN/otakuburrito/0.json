The guys working on servers and maintenance. The janitor too. And the data analysts. \n\nThe shoutcasters and the Rioters willing to apologize for mistakes. Even the Rioters that follow our Twitters and admit to laughing at out memes are the coolest.\n\nI'm sorry we forget that not all Rioters are Tencent lapdogs and most are people working a job.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry I forgot the recruiters too! Let me know if I miss anyone. ","replies":[]}
