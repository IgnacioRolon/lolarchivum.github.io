I personally have found myself drawing more each day rather than playing league because it just simply isn't enjoyable anymore. Now I'll admit I'll hop into game when I want to here the Darkin voice lines and just spend time with them (yeah I know turbo cringe stfu) but outside of that meh...what do you guys think?
