I was going to edit my post but the thread has been locked. I was pissed because I have seen numerous companies profit off the back of the LGBTQ wave and still discriminate against my community. \r\n\r\nI AM NOT HOMOPHOBIC! \r\n\r\nI am literally pansexual. I have dated a chick with a dick and a dude with a vagina. I volunteer at transition groups and at junior drag shows.\r\n\r\nI was upset because I was under the impression that Sony was profiting off the suffering of my fellow brothers and sisters with this so called \"gay station\".\r\n\r\nA lot of companies profit off of marginalized people and never lift a finger to help those groups. (I'm looking at you HotTopic and Hollister) \r\n\r\nI'm sorry if it seemed that I was trying to bait people. I wasn't. And at the time it seemed Sony was re-releasing the system as they social retweeted the device along with many confirmed custom devices but I should have fact checked more. That is all on me. \r\n\r\nLet the down voting commence.","replies":[]}
