I honestly can&#039;t. I&#039;m not having fun and me being so stressed out over reading patch notes, keeping up with changes, and having to relearn everything constantly makes league a job. And then my frustration with this game carries over in others to the point I&#039;d rather just go to sleep instead of put up with any game.\n\nLet&#039;s be honest. \n\n1. I don&#039;t have fun anymore. \n2. I don&#039;t have the drive required to even play casually. \n3. I don&#039;t feel connected to the game anymore. \n4. I&#039;m so disconnected with this game I don&#039;t even care for the lore. \n5. No champions, not even Vi, interests me. \n6. Playing games gives me a stomach ache they are so painful (I&#039;m not even joking). \n7. I got so upset once I literally puked out of frustration. \n8. The stress league puts on me isn&#039;t good for my depression or bipolar disorder. \n9. The community has gotten significantly worse and no punishment is issued for people who ruin games. \n10. Ghostcrawler killed yet another game. \n11. All of my favorite Riot employees are gone. \n12. Seeing anything league related makes me sad because I know the game is nowhere nearly as fun as it seems. \n13. League is really cringey.  \n14. There&#039;s nothing fun to do besides urf anymore. \n15. It gives me a headache. \n16. People give you shit for playing who you love if it&#039;s not meta even in normals now because fuck dynamic queue. \n17. Fuck dynamic queue.\n18. I'd rather watch Markiplier than subject myself to this cancer any longer. \n \n\nThe only reason I got into this game was because of the fan art but even now that&#039;s scarce because the game isn&#039;t enjoyable in any aspect anymore. I can&#039;t even have my favorite splash art as a background because all I can think about are stats, how the champion got reworked again, the champion&#039;s bugged, or the champion is so outclassed they aren&#039;t viable.  Like seriously. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz2Fz0OO8ag","replies":[]}
