Please read Riot this is heartbreaking.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay, so simply put making the Mystery Mini Characters (Mystery) is really aggravating, you guys have done amazing with RNG in the past like simple things like Dragon, but the cause of making these collectibles RnG effects Collectors to have to grind our butts off to get the one we need. For instance, I&#039;m a Soraka main, I have all of her collectibles down to Border, Skins, Icons, Wards and so on that specifically relate to her. If there is a cute skin of her I&#039;m going to grab that don&#039;t you worry, but if I have to grind through days of RnG wasting Blue Essence for it I&#039;m going to miss out on life, other games, and burnout while like a natural human being resenting the fact I spent hours of my life because of RnG simply to keep my pride and love Mains Collection effectively secure, someone who I have loved playing and love character wise due to being a Nurse (LPN). You can see why I and Soraka share a bond and the hilarity of a Medical Professional playing a Healer Character. \n\n\nPlease don&#039;t make me spend hours to grind my champion I love whos my favorites through hope. We have effectively 100+ characters, to be fair each one would have to be a .76% at best. Please don&#039;t do this to us? Think of all yours, and our beloved champions you made and then think of the disappointment of repeatedly getting something else over and over again. I want a Soraka Mini but I would rather it not exist than have to get it through .76% and then possibly never get it because of the chance on it is so low. I have waited 8 years for a Soraka Plushie because hugging my Savior to sleep is comforting no matter the cost of it, .76% is not worth the cost of a Mini anything regardless how adorable and well done it is.\n\nMy constructive feedback, just make the purchasable exclusively in the market for some heavy blue Essence, I would dump 1500 blue essence for Soraka, my main alone. {{sticker:sg-soraka}}\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6ZG8UZl.png\n (To those who arn't up to date and comment request, here and a link to the page)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-update?utm_source=LeagueClient&utm_medium=OverviewTier1#leveling","replies":[{"poster":"Friendly Ram","date":"2017-09-28T02:52:39.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"UseLubePlease","date":"2017-09-28T06:08:31.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're my credit to why I added SG Soraka picture.. it embodies all our feelings.

But I too dislike the rng aspect shown in the BE shop previews. I dislike riot hiding the few things they make of my loves, Morgana and Kayle like this. All I want is stuff of my angel loves, there is relatively next to nothing for them anywhere. \n\nA poster of Morgana about to delete ahri but I don't care for posters. A rare ghost bride figure from the south/Latin American servers opening, which good luck getting and it is not default Morgana the true her. All I have now is one of those mini box rng characters of her and nothing of Kayle at the moment. Sad times that in client stuff will be rng based, very displeasing.","replies":[{"poster":"UseLubePlease","date":"2017-09-28T06:15:34.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is harsh, I missed the first release of Reaper Soraka due to a party and Hiatus at the time, later in 2015 I paid 60 dollars for other characters very old outdated skins at the time for a bundle just to get her exclusive. I dished out the cash because I love the character and her heart and mentality.\n\nIt was my decision, I accept that, I just don't like it was my last chance was requiring 60 dollars worth of skins and only one really being up to date and worth it.\n\n\nP.S.
