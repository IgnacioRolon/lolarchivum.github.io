I decided to pick the game back up, only to come back and find it somehow hacked. I opened a ticket, was able to get my account back, and have been playing fine ever since. \r\n\r\nHowever, I was recently banned for account boosting, which I know to literally have been impossible, as since coming back and regaining control of my account, I have not played a single ranked game. The fact that my account was somehow stolen was proven, I provided a ton of evidence to the mod, and I also don't see any reason for me to have wanted to suddenly boost the account after not having played for 7 months. I also rarely if ever played ranked matches before this season, as I generally just play normal games for fun with my friends. \r\n\r\nI opened a ticket with a mod to try and resolve this, and was given a copy/paste response about an hour later about why boosting is bad. I replied again, and have not gotten a response since. At this rate I'm afraid my ban will simply expire before I get a response and this gets resolved, as there are only 6 days left. If anyone has any advice on how to prove that I was not boosting, any evidence I can give, I would be happy to hear it. Looking at my match history, it's very clear that I was not playing for a large amount of time, then suddenly came back, changed my summoner name, and started playing wildly different champions than I ever had before; in addition to a large amount of other more private evidence, someone clearly had stolen my account. \r\n\r\nIf a mod is to see this, any help in expediting the process or information on what I can do is greatly appreciated. I would also say that any rewards that were stripped due to this ban are honestly fine with me, I never cared for ranked anyway, but it would be nice to get them back, with the exception of the season 7 rewards as those were not won by me, but by whoever stole my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T23:41:58.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries fam we gotchu.

I understand, these things happen, you have to do your best to prevent boosting and other behaviors like it. Just glad to not have a black mark on my account. \n\nThanks again.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-13T15:43:07.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m also glad to see that things are resolved like this - I always say that Riot does what’s right for the players and I’m glad that you were able to experience that. :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sonic Adventure","date":"2017-12-13T16:40:24.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nI wanted to know, did you just get the league account hacked? Because in that case you can simply change the password since only you have access to the e-mail right? Just curious. Ty!","replies":[]}]}
