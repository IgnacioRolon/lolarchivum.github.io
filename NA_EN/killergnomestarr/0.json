McCree was always my favorite character from Overwatch (Not just because he&#039;s a cowboy lol,) but because I was always intrigued by his story, his morals, and his character design. I understand that people think that in games like League and Overwatch, cowboys are cliche and very niche, and I gotta say it, they are. But they always hold near and dear to people&#039;s hearts, and also how most portrayals of cowboys are one of the most 3-dimensional archetypes in fiction. I never cared for Graves so much, because I felt that the idea of him was out of place in League, but not because of him as a cowboy, but because his connections to the lore of league as a whole doesn&#039;t feel like it&#039;s on the same plane. I may just be rambling, but I hope Riot does more with Graves to develop him in the game more, because yippy caye yay, are cowboys awesome. \r\n\r\nSo now I leave you with one of my favorite quotes of all time,\r\n\r\nSee you, Space Cowboy :)  {{champion:104}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-11-03T03:10:56.825+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you read Burning Tides?

(Still irks me Reinhardt isn't very German, and the uncanny fact he didnt speak it in his CG)\n\nTheres also Overwatch's aesthetic, which is a heck of a lot more kid friendly than League tries to be. Or even the heroes kit's are fairly linear in design, say what you want about League's most frustratingly design champs at least new characters like Ornn, Pyke, Zoe etc keep things fresh. \n\nIk saying that in a forum for League is like a gun restriction advacite protesting in pro gun restriction cities, in other words 'a safe space'. I also don't play Overwatch, so that's an obvious bias but I dont play it because from its small roster of optional heroes none actually engage me in the slightest. Well it's more of a what could I get out of Overwatch that I can't get to some capacity in a free game like League.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerGnomestarr","date":"2018-11-03T14:08:02.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you voicing your opinion, and I actually agree with you for the most part, and just like you, I appreciate the new champs that come out, they're truly works of art lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2018-11-03T04:31:10.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reinhardt is totally German dude.

I love Darin De Paul, Im confident he could've done a more authentic tribute but the way he was instructed Blizzard clearly preferred whimsical ham over quality. \n\nBlizzard's approach to all the characters is like a child's idea of how people from different nationalities would look, sound and act. Like Overwatch has this real attitude for being progressive and representative of real life cultures, but squander that a bit with their fatuous gloss over everything. Star Trek still the best at matching these factors into an authentic, respectable, progressive, as well as kid friendly IP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
