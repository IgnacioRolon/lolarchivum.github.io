The two skins that are &quot;available&quot; are Prestigous and Wicked Leblanc. Basically in one she has a different outfit, and the other she put on more clothes. I saw the Ravenborn Leblanc skin and I was like, WOAH THIS LOOKS BOSS. But it wasn&#039;t available. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m tryna say is Leblanc is a cool champion and a skin that changed her ability fx would be great. I really don&#039;t understand why Ravenborn Leblanc is legacy, it&#039;s the best one!    \r\n\r\n-waits for Halloween-","replies":[{"poster":"UncIe Zed","date":"2015-09-27T18:20:40.358+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think leblanc is gonna get a new skin anytime soon ( ravenborn op ), but dont worry, ravenborn leblanc will be available during the harrowing coming soon :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2015-09-27T17:04:24.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has 2 awesome skins but they are limited, as you said. \n\nAnd her ravenclaw skin has a very ugly E animation, imho.","replies":[{"poster":"SpiritGear","date":"2015-09-27T21:30:21.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=computo2000,realm=EUNE,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=W3txfp8f,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-09-27T17:04:24.045+0000)\n>\n> She has 2 awesome skins but they are limited, as you said. \n> \n> And her ravenclaw skin has a very ugly E animation, imho.\n\nand sounds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quort","date":"2015-09-27T21:59:36.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who owns Ravenborn LeBlanc... it is indeed very boss! :3\n\nI wish bossness upon you as well! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silver3MMC","date":"2015-09-28T15:49:28.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting on project Yorick {{champion:83}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Simple Moon","date":"2015-09-28T14:48:37.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
