It's not that he's underrated, it's that they rarely acknowledge his feats when he does them. Unless he feeds like crazy or single handedly carries the whole team, he's lucky to get 2 seconds of discussion about him after matches. I'm sure if doublelift had played the exact same match, the whole analyst session would have been about him.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒæµ","date":"2014-12-07T08:21:29.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sneaky is just consistently solid but not very flashy.

I think it's more because they don't talk about him so people are just not focused on him which is why it seems like he's not being flashy. He seems to get triples and quadras like every match. He's also the one that brought corki out of retirement waaaay before everybody else did, usually the first one to bring out new adcs that become meta shortly after, has the biggest adc champ pool and is probably the only one that can play a decent kog in NA.\n\nAs for Hai, his champion pool looks really shakey but he still played pretty well. He played corki mid twice in a row. He's still getting caught out of position a decent amount but it ended up baiting a lot of favorable fights this time around. I don't think these matches will be as representative as tomorrows though. To his credit though, balls and lemon were getting picked off way more often.\n\nEdit: He had 2 quadras, an average kda of over 11 in the set and not one word about him in either post games.

Lemon is flashier than Sneaky is lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smart Kitty","date":"2014-12-08T04:10:51.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is a major difference between flashy and consistent.\n> \n> Flashy is that ADC that will try to aggressively initiate fights and use his abilities in almost reckless ways that are exciting to watch but are risky as hell.\n> \n> Sneaky just does his job with none of the flair... that's ok in my book.\n\nI agree, that's why Sneaky isn't noticed. He's sneaky, he does his job without being noticed until the end. He's the most consistent ADC in NA in my opinion. He does deserve more recognition though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"skyfall619","date":"2014-12-08T04:32:35.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"sneaky is a god. best adc na imo. he wins games nothing else matters. if winning games doesnt get you attention then its the viewers fault for not recognizing a god in action.\n\nlike seriously he got a penta last game and people didnt even notice he was reking face.\n\ncould it have something to do with his name.....sneaky....sneaky is a ninja confirmed","replies":[]}]}
