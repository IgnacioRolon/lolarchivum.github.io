I've tried unlocked some, but I never really enjoyed it as much as locked screen. Thus, I've always used locked (though i will unlock with y for teleporting and global skill shots).\n\nWith locked you can't really lose your position when it's centered. You also have less things that need controlled, so you are less likely to make an error with controlling, and more likely to complete actions faster (in my opinion). Skillshot paths are also a bit easier to predict because they always come from the same starting point at the center of your screen.\n\nBoth methods have pros and cons, but they can both be used effectively.

The biggest issue with locked with locked screen used to be that if you ended up on red side you couldn't see far enough downscreen for many skillshots, especially in the outer lanes. The per-side offset option largely fixed this.\n\nThe primary advantage of unlocked is supposedly greater map awareness, but even in locked screen I've never really had issues with it. The only other thing that unlocked clearly wins out on, in my opinion, is long range skillshots. If it is a global or near-global skill, I tend unlock just for these skillshots. However, Kog's ult is the only example I can think of that you truly need to be always unlocked to use to its full potential.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PoisonedPeace","date":"2015-06-22T20:01:30.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Doesn't Doublelift play with locked camera?","replies":[{"poster":"Zirzon","date":"2015-06-22T20:21:55.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think so.

Now, I understand why people would say that a centered camera is better but it's honestly not. It is easier to last hit and land many skill shots when your camera isn't swinging around all the time. Also, you can drag it around on the minimap to check out how other lanes are doing (this is really helpful to land global ults like Jinx's ult, Ashe's or Draven's.) It gives you good map awareness and allows for you to focus on where your enemies are in terms of distance. The downside to this is sometimes you'll want to have the camera on yourself AND the enemy laner but it doesn't fit so clicking on where to go or auto is difficult. The hardest thing about playing on a moveable camera was that during teamfights it might fly all the way off the map or I lose where I am. That is easily solved by just holding the space bar, as it will temporarily stay on you. Sometimes I do get carried away with watching a fight on the other side of the map and completely ignore my surroundings (I walked right past a fed Fizz who insta-gibbed me and I didn't react until the last minute -_-.
