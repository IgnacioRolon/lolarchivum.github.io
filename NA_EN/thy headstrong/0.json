Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nI'm happy to hear that your behavior has improved, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have demonstrated in the past.\n\nThe only chat messages included in your chat log are your own for a single, extremely good reason: they are the only ones taken into account for your punishment, because they're the only ones in your control. The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the matches that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several matches. You might see three matches, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.","replies":[{"poster":"Thy Headstrong","date":"2019-12-22T22:12:55.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"See what i see as sad is i wasnt flaming my team.

They didn't (at least no recent feedback). They shamed my plays + said I bought account. They started the flame. Like wtf rito ? I have ban bcs I used one restriction word and they don't ? Kappa. Tell me one reason why Vel'Koz who never cooperated all time was saying that I am boosted and that I sck shouldn't have. And I got when I just said to him that he is r%%%%%ed.","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-22T11:47:00.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you know they didnt got banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Dakeudharma","date":"2019-12-22T12:33:45.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"No recent feedback ?","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-22T12:47:29.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not everytime you get a feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Dakeudharma","date":"2019-12-22T13:00:11.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well since I am playing tanks or utility champions this is happening every lost game. I don't deal dmg so I am boosted and bought account. I really don't think that all this players got restricted i report them every game nothing always happens. But why would this harass should not be reportable ? It's behavior of r%%%%%s to accuse somebody who has diamond for over 3  seasons only because he don't like to play dmg dealing champions. Not to mention that there has to be one game ofc where your nerves don't keep cool. I can't keep cool every-time they blame me. It's absolutely annoying. Not even pro players keep cool every game. Jankos raging over scuttle crab steal every time for example. We are not perfect human beings and when somebody flames us we don't always have what it takes to stay cool.","replies":[{"poster":"NF Remilia","date":"2019-12-22T13:35:17.818+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"then i have to be some sort of an alien since im playing from season 1 and i havent been punished or lost my cool once lol  it's kinda furstrating tbh but chatting wont help us at all.

I have that Kayle btw, do you ? Just somehow i don't trust you. Mainly because you missed the point of my whole post.

He is clearly a good player and good man showing lot of good deeds in real life. But on Facebook everybody blames him for his accident from . So he was passive aggressive and got red card again. Do you understand it now ? I am not bad. He is not bad. We are just totally exhausted from bad people. They are leading us to act not like we would want. And FIFA and RITO thinks it's fun to just blame us. When there are clearly players who provoke and abuse this system to get us banned. I know that I am not so great as Son, but that's not the point.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Inductive Soul","date":"2019-12-22T21:50:54.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what was the full game chat log? ... where is it so we can actually judge the conduct... this so far is very one sided, and that is not how judgement is supposed to work... show the whole log, or this is by default unfair.
