Passive is way too much overpowered, along with his obnoxious kit.\r\n2) {{champion:3}}: this already, but I think he&#039;s kind of new so you&#039;re going to nerf him somehow.\r\n3) {{champion:63}}: can easily bring you to 1% health at level 3. This cannot happen, also because his kit is kind of point and click.\r\n4) {{champion:114}}: oppressive champion, doesn&#039;t forgive any mistake. Her W is too much, her passive has wrong mechanics I think.\r\n5) {{champion:105}}: just.\r\n6) {{champion:64}}: once he Qs you, you know you have no chance, expecially mid-late game.\r\n7) {{champion:58}}: suffers early but then it&#039;s unstoppable.\r\n8) {{champion:161}}: passive, again.\r\n9) {{champion:19}}: just press Q and you never die.\r\n10) {{champion:115}}: is there anything you can do when laning vs him?\r\n\r\nI mean, just to mention a few. But it would be awesome to see them balanced just to shift the meta somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-04T13:36:29.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius: honestly not sure what you'd do to make him more fair to melee without making him even more dumpstered by range. \n\nGalio: has changes on the PBE. \n\nBrand: Only two abilities are point and click. His stun combo is annoying but if you can't dodge his AoE then it's kinda on you. \n\nFiora: don't really have much to say about her honestly. W was already nerfed hard with the CD increase. Maybe just make it so she's not exactly immune to everything when doing it and block one ability?  CD would have to be adjusted then. \n\nFizz: bruiser Fizz?\n\nLee: yeah I don't think Riot is going to nerf lee. \n\nRenekton: Suffers early?  What?\n\nVel'koz: no comment (can't remember his passive). \n\nWarwick: Grievous Wounds hurts his healing a lot.  \n\nZiggs: literally everything in his kit is avoidable. Dodge his Q, try to avoid walking over his mines, and you'll basically avoid his damage.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-04-04T13:47:56.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) No\n2) Maybe a little over or undertuned, tbh he hasn't been out long enough to tell\n3) As much as I hate him, No\n4) I hate this champion with a passion and think her w is complete bullshit however there is counterplay to her, her teamfighting is terrible.\n5) frustration doesn't equal op, seeing a trend here\n6) No\n7) You have no idea what you are talking about lol.  Renek is an early game monster who likes to snowball and end the game in midgame.  He certainly is not good late.\n8) True dmg isn't inherently op.  He is balanced, like xerath all you got to do is get on him and he dies as he has no self peel.\n9) He might be a little overtuned and need some nerfs but tbh its hard to tell as he can easily pubstomp low elo but it gets harder carry the higher you go.\n10) Pick an assasin or someone to match his wave clear.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-04T14:22:08.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you telling me?

Doing 1k true damage as nearly full tank is a bit obnoxious.\n\nFiora - I'd like to see her passive scaling or Q cooldown refund on attack nerfed.  Being able to Q every 3.2 seconds at max rank with zero cdr is overtuned.  It's more the passive true damage scaling that bothers me though.  When a champion is given that much percent true damage there is no outplay to that.\n\nBrand - I do see him as a bit overtuned as well.  He really only needs to land one spell, his Q, and he can 100-0 you.  His W is point and click, which then if he lands his Q stuns you, making his E guaranteed to hit, do more damage, and also proc his ult.  Having said that, I'd be ok with all that if his ult wasn't so damn strong.  As long as he gets it off before dying in a teamfight he's already done a ton of damage, which for a point and click that then bounces around the rest of the team is pretty obnoxious.  I'd like to see his ult be more like Varus' ult, a skillshot that if it hits an enemy champion with then bounce to others.  I think that would be an easy, and fair adjustment to his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-04-04T14:22:45.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius can only do that much true damage if he has all five stacks on a target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"just OK jungler","date":"2017-04-04T15:49:43.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}}  is completely balanced, his early game is strong, to make this balanced his late game is absolutely terrible.
