Don&#039;t get me wrong, I loved the mechanic as a concept and what&#039;s more Karma can&#039;t heal allies so it does make a bit more sense on her then someone who can heal allies, but I swear I heard a Rioter say the mechanic was bad for the game and it wouldn&#039;t be implemented again. Is it the fact that she has to empower her W with her ult that makes it healthier? Again, not trying to make any statement on the change one way or the other, just generally curious what the thinking behind this change was.","replies":[{"poster":"AXayahAccount","date":"2018-10-25T03:50:52.504+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mana battery WITH healing was the problem I think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2018-10-24T19:26:10.424+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"It was. I remember when they removed it.\n\nThat's not the problem though. Karma players wanted a lot of things to come back, most notably shield bomb or another damage option. Like always, the actual problematic kit wasnt worked on. The numbers change is a common theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainMÃ¥rvelous","date":"2018-10-25T11:42:20.074+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few people already brought it up here but:\n\n#Soraka's Mana was a basic ability, Karma's is an empowered ability.\n\nSoraka could spam this spell with impunity and really didn't have to suffer or lose out. Basically the only drawback to using it was \"Oh I can't silence an enemy\". Plus Soraka could cast it on herself. Karma can only give mana with an RW combo on an ally, a much higher resource cost as Karma can't mana herself back up in lane and misses out on Q poke/mass shield.\n\n#Soraka had a heal, Karma does not.\n\nExcluding RW on an enemy (which doesn't count), Karma can't heal her ally indefinitely or really keep herself in the fight, so she's susceptible to being bullied out of lane. Old Soraka could heal herself, then mana back up, and just repeat an endless cycle of keeping herself alive and her ally alive that could only be halted by the hardest of engages.\n\nI don't blame you for asking though. This is a really good example case of how a mechanic once deemed unhealthy _can_ return to the game in some capacity, barring an appropriate power budget and a much more heavily restricted design.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2018-10-25T13:24:54.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, honestly I'm happy to see it that happen with abilities where they were once thought to be unhealthy to end up coming back cause they thought of a way to do it healthier. There are a few mechanics that were good in the past that are gone and gives me hope that we will see them again in that light.\nAs for the Soraka has a heal and Karma does not, I assume it was something like that and the empowered ability, just was hoping to hear straight from a Rioter how that went down. Honestly Karma thematically even makes sense as a \"mana battery\" champ seeing as she has strong ties to the magic of Ionia, just was wondering how that  conversation went when they brought the concept up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Awoof","date":"2018-10-25T12:33:24.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as a *little* correction, while initially Soraka's E could be cast on herself, that was removed a while ago before the ability was reworked entirely, and it had a mana cost as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-10-24T20:27:34.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry maybe its because ive been at work for 14hours but who/what/where does it say she is getting such a change?","replies":[{"poster":"DoodMitHut","date":"2018-10-24T21:11:35.841+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TkiBEVYV-karma-gameplay-change-preview","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2018-10-24T22:20:33.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that's a slap in the face-","replies":[{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2018-10-25T12:10:33.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In what context?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lunnipls","date":"2018-10-25T18:55:55.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"betting she's gonna be the next hated champ w/ her cd refresh mech empowered or not","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2018-10-24T21:16:51.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it serves a slightly different purpose here than on old Raka.
