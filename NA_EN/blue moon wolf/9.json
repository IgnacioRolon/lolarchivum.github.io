It doesn&#039;t matter what champ it is, they are getting a Rework. Even if they just got a rework  or getting one soon (yes, that means {{champion:13}} would be getting a re-re-re-rework)\n2. Try to stick with Rioters who work on champs and currently work for Riot. (_ recommended, not required. Pick a splash Artist if you feel particularly rebellious :p_) \n3. It can be anything from a {{champion:14}} level Rework to a {{champion:86}} level one, but something in their kit is going to change.\n5. Keep it friendly. \n**bonus**: How would you rework your main if they had to get a rework?\n\nMain: {{champion:62}} \nRioter: Riot Gypsylord\n {{champion:202}} was a champ that I was sceptical about during his teaser, but after seeing his kit and using him in game, he has become my favorite ADC. He also worked partially on my secondary main {{champion:150}} and looking at {{champion:254}} as a reference for a champ more like {{champion:62}} that he&#039;s worked on, I think he would be able to do Wukong justice.\n\nbonus: {{champion:62}} (light rework)\nW: Decoy\n(**new**) passive: Wukongs staff extends, increasing his range by 5/10/15 at levels 6/13/18\n\n**active**: Wukong becomes invisible for a short duration, leaving behind a decoy that will deal Magic Damage to enemies near it when Wukong&#039;s stealth expires.\nWukong becomes invisible for 1.5 seconds, leaving behind a decoy that will deal 70/115/160/205/250 (+60% Ability Power) Magic Damage to enemies near it after 1.5 seconds. \n(**new**) Monkey see, Monkey do: if Wukong uses his Q or E while his decoy is active, it will copy Wukong\n\n**Q**: If the enemy is hit is within range of the decoy, the decoy will also strike the enemy, dealing light damage and reducing their armor further by 5/6/8/9/10%.\n\n**E**: the decoy will dash to the same target as Wukong, dealing light bonus damage and increasing the duration of his attack speed bonus to 6 seconds instead of 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona x Rubick","date":"2016-07-31T10:33:02.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"CertainlyT, my man\n\nplease rework Rubick.\n\ni would love to see him not knowing what to do with such beautiful kit.\n\nlet me try this:\nR now has a passive: every 2 seconds, rubick casts a spell cast around him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpaghettiTime","date":"2016-07-31T16:22:03.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/ca/ca47580b0e4c03cdf6952e80366c17064eb5b5ecd4255859c778585a022ded0f.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-08-01T19:20:46.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:34}} I don't really know that many rioters, so I'm just gonna say what I would like to happen:\nshe gets turned into an icey version of brand.
