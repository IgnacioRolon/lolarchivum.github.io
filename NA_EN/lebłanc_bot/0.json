So I was playing late at night and I played this game where the opponets did not mean to fed me but I was pretty fed I then started getting kills and now I was like 5 levels over everyone else. So this continued and I ended up with a score of 25/0/15. But the thing is it was with {{champion:25}} . Now Im not complaining but Ive heard that she is not very tanky and dose not have great kill power but if thats true how did i get so many kills and no deaths! I want to see if anybody else got a high score with a champion that is not very good, or a high score with morgana","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-09-16T05:25:39.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something to remember about League of Legends is that when playing in pubs or any elo below, I dunno, maybe masters, you don't win games by having a team that's better then the enemies'.

She's also a consistent support. However, depending on how fed she gets, and how you build her, yes she can be a force to reckon with. \n\nGlancing at your match, it also helped that they didn't stack much MR against your team, which ultimately was their downfall considering 4/5 of your team was AP.\n\nAdditionally, you need to work on your warding.

You won't need to buy wards. Yellow trinket refills at a constant rate throughout the game, though putting down a pink on the map is always a great idea.\n\nIt's best to start habits early, so getting you used to warding constantly throughout the game will only benefit you and your team. You want that map as lit up as possible. It's a team effort, and at the very least you can do your part.\n\nJust remember, a well placed ward will help prevent your death or one of your teammates. It also can help secure a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Lebłanc Bot","date":"2016-09-17T00:43:31.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks again, I just need to know which wards to buy and were to put them before i hit level 30 and start ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AdeBug","date":"2016-09-17T00:09:56.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u can see no mr at higher levels than 22, as well :P and it's just ggez after that.
