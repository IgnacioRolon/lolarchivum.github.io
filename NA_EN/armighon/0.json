They dodge pretty decently. Also you get a moving target.\n\nGeneral rule for skill shots is aim for where you believe your target to be moving. Never aim for your target unless they're unable to move or you believe that they wont.\n\nAgainst real players it's a trial and error thing. Just focus on the player's movements. Just look at how they dodge and exploit that. An example would be if you notice someone who always dodges by back-stepping always aim slightly lower against that person. More than likely they'll end up walking into your skill shot.\n\nOnce you get better you can start to play mind games with people by exploiting their dodging.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-03-02T02:59:27.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of it comes with experience, as you get used to everyones move speeds and the cast times/projectile speeds and so on.\n\nI believe it was krepo who said at low elo you aim directly at your target, mid-high elo you aim expecting them to juke/flash it, and then at the highest elo you go back to aiming directly at your target (since they expect you to expect them to juke).\n\nA lot of my thinking tends to be imagining myself in my opponents shoes. If I don't think I'd have time to react, I'll aim right at them, otherwise it's thinking about where I'd try to dodge if I was in their position.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-02T02:53:50.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> LV13\n\nTry playing the game more.\n\nGo into settings and set your abilities to quickcast, though. Having to press and click instead of casting on release can slow you down a lot.","replies":[]}]}
