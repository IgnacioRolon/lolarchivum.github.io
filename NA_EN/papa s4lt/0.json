My team attacked me after I said stop to my support for taking cs than pinging yorick once to gank my lane because I was being ganked constantly. I said he would be banned because he called me multiple derogatory names as well as insults. I legitimately was curious how helping a lagging top lane which had already lost tower was a good plan. and even after saying open bot I did not just feed or leave the game I just wanted the enemy team to push bot and end because I wanted game to be over since I knew with my past luck my team would not surrender and I would be forced to suffer through more abuse and a game I was not having fun in anymore, Can anyone explain how this results in a ban. I can give a little background as to why I believe but I feel it is false. I recently came off a 14 day suspension which I honestly changed from. The lack of league was awful I had nothing to do between homework and work. I looked up other peoples bans on here and videos and understand that flaming is not gonna change the outcome or make me feel better. I honestly was making an attempt to not be toxic and it was going well but then this game happened this morning and now I am perma banned and just want some help understanding why an automated system deamed this as a perma ban offense when I attacked no one, only defended myself, and said no cuss words or hate speech, nor fed.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-08-13T00:34:19.440+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":">I recently came off a 14 day suspension which I honestly changed from.\n\nNo you didn't.

Cluttering it up with negativity is against the rules.\n\nYou insulted your teammates on their poor performance. They know they're 1/7. You don't have to throw it in their face. Harassing people like that is against the rules.\n\nYou announced that you were giving up and decided to help the enemy team win (\"open bot im done\"). For some reason, you think that just because you didn't run up to them and die to give them gold and help them win a little bit harder it means you didn't assist the enemy team, but that's incorrect, and you did. Assisting the enemy team is against the rules.\n\nThe only chat messages included in your chat log are your own for a single, extremely good reason: they are the only ones taken into account for your punishment, because they're the only ones in your control. The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.\n\nI'm sorry you've seen worse, but the system wants your behavior to be _acceptable_, not just _less unacceptable_ than what you have seen in others.

Polluting the chat with a nonsense argument and then helping the enemy team win the game is inappropriate behavior. Do you understand that?\n\nI already explained above why it's 100% fair for your punishment to be based only on your actions.\n\nRegretting your mistakes only makes a difference if it leads you to change your behavior, and you didn't.\n\nYour opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like yours).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be. We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.","replies":[{"poster":"The 13th","date":"2019-08-13T17:45:37.089+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Im just gonna leave this here.

I explained it to you in your own thread, so I'll drop the permalink [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/50zH1Y3v-unfair-permaban-refund-possible?comment=0000000000000000000000000000), but multiple reports do not influence the likelihood that you get punished.\n\n> You have a bad reputation (bad honor level) (absolutely a factor)\n\nFalse. Honor Level does not influence your likelihood to get punished - the only point where Honor and punishments coincide is that your Honor Level drops when you get punished, and that your Honor Level for a given match is nixed if you're validly reported.\n\nIf you're getting punished more frequently at lower Honor levels, it's because you're continuing to misbehave despite being punished before, not because the lower Honor level has some invisible effect on report validity.\n\n> The frequency of how often people report you (absolutely a factor)\n\nFalse. Being reported frequently means nothing if all of the reports are false. There's a _very_ low probability that getting a dramatic number of reports which turn up with no evidence to punish you _could_ be forwarded for manual review/audit, but even in those cases, no misbehavior = no punishment.\n\n> You've had punishment before (absolutely a factor)\n\nHaving a previous punishment history in and of itself doesn't influence the likelihood that you'll be punished again. There is a certain period shortly _following_ a punishment in which you're placed more-or-less under greater scrutiny, but having a punishment history doesn't affect whether or not you'll get punished again. So, no - not a factor.\n\n> The bot detects you flaming (sometimes a factor)\n\nStrange how the four previous things, which are _not_ factors, you call \"absolutely a factor\" in being punished, but one of the things that _legitimately **is** a factor_ in whether or not a player gets punished, you say is \"sometimes a factor\".\n\nIf the IFS detects you flaming, you will get punished for it. There's plenty enough evidence on the _Player Behavior_ board to show that yes, flaming will get you punished.\n\n> The people who reported you have good reputations (aka honor level) (possibly a factor)\n\nFalse. Honor Level has zero impact on report validity. Reports from Honor Level 5 players have the exact same weight as those from Honor Level 0 players.\n\n> The people who reported you have spent more money on the game than you (possibly a factor)\n\nFalse. Honestly, you're going to have to explain how you could even humor this one.\n\n> The people who reported you have a higher win rate than you (possibly a factor)\n\nOnce again: **_No, there are no external factors which influence whether or not a report is deemed valid. It doesn't matter if someone has a higher Honor Level, a higher win rate, or spent more money than you, their reports have the same weight as everyone else._**\n\n**_The only thing that determines whether or not a report is valid is your own behavior. 87.5% of your list is false, with the only actual factor being passed off as \"sometimes a factor\"._**","replies":[{"poster":"SanZero","date":"2019-08-15T18:20:15.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"about what we see on posts here it is hard to believe who and who","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talonyte","date":"2019-08-13T01:08:54.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Yeah he did nothing wrong. stop warping in your minds that he did do something wrong. you guys are all biased cause nothing like this ever happened to you. how would you feel like if you were banned for an error and we just started to do this to you? papa salt did nothing wrong goodness you people have never had something like this happene to you so that's why you don't know.","replies":[{"poster":"The 13th","date":"2019-08-13T17:46:39.042+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"100% agree.
