The &quot;skip waiting for stats&quot; button rarely pops up for me because I&#039;m on a beastie computer with decent internet. I&#039;d much rather it be a setting so I can just access the honor screen and then go straight to the Home screen, skipping the post -game lobby entirely if I so desire.   (This would also help with remade games to have it skip the pointless end game lobby and make joining a new one that much faster.)\n\nIf it can&#039;t be made a persisted setting, could it please be made to appear for longer amounts of time so I can click it in time if I have good specs?  Is there something in my settings files that already exists that I can tweak to skip end game lobby by myself?","replies":[{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2019-01-09T11:53:09.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if there can also be a toggle for skipping the honor screen, it's so annoying having to go through the lobby AND the honor screen","replies":[]},{"poster":"y0r1ck","date":"2019-01-09T07:42:01.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good idea.","replies":[]}]}
