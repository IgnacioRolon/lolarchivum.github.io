You know exactly what her E will do, your opponents also know exactly what her E will do. It's an ability that defines her disruptor playstyle while also punishing players who do not respect her.

I was suggesting into walls if you were previously too far away to get the stun.  The ability would still stop at walls, stun the target and send you over the wall if you flashed there while leaving them behind (albeit stunned) or it could cause you to waste your flash entirely by stopping your flash at the wall with the stunned person instead of sending you over regardless of where you tried to flash to.
