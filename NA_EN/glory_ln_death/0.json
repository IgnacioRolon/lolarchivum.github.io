There is another one who's ult does 1000 true damage to a target no matter what, and you can upgrade it to do more damage, and apply that damage to everyone in a small radius.

Where they are additional effects outside of the game with these that need to be taken into account and this tips balance out of proportion as these effects can have negative impacts by making a character strong but another useless.
