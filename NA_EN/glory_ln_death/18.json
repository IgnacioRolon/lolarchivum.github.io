I thought I looked at our teams champions, saw that no one was picking Hecarim, and then banned him, but the jungler must have chosen him at the last second or I'm extremely oblivious or he didn't choose him, because after I banned Hecarim I saw my jungler's summoner spells were Ghost and Smite. I asked him in chat if he wanted to pick it, and he said \"wtf yeah\" and then I felt really badly and behaved apologetically. He asked me to dodge, which I didn't do, but I did offer him mid. He accepted the trade, but once the opponent locked in Yasuo, he declined and told me to go mid. He then went Ryze jungle.\nI thought he might be trolling because of me and I felt even worse. Looking back on it, I feel like he was trying to make someone dodge. In game, he got executed at Wolves, and when he came to the Red Brambleback, the enemy Elise invaded him and tried to kill him. I instantly thought, \"This is my chance to prove to Ryze that I'm really sorry!\" and I came over to help him, killing the Elise and helping him get away.\nHe didn't behave angrily during the game and he did pretty well, getting a S for doing decently on a champion in an unorthodox position.\n\nThat's my story about banning pick intents.","replies":[{"poster":"Mad King Hades","date":"2016-07-07T11:13:21.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have to be Ryze jungle to get an S?","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-07-07T19:19:00.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HadesThomas,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=1ydRGyOR,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2016-07-07T11:13:21.008+0000)\n>\n> So I have to be Ryze jungle to get an S?\n\nNo, we also had an amazing Morgana support get a S+ in that game, going 6/1/30/69 in a 42:09 minute game with 36k damage dealt to champions, 43 wards placed, and 4 wards destroyed.\n\nI've gotten a few S's with Ryze top lane, but none mid lane since I don't play him mid lane as much. You do have to carry though. Ryze is a hypercarry champion, so the top percentage of players _will_ have really good scores, so you'll need to match that if you want a S on Ryze. High CS, high kills, high assists, low deaths, lots of champion damage, a decent amount of wards placed, and a low game time are all things you can work towards so that you can get your S rank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Aqualious","date":"2016-07-06T16:13:08.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only happened once to me, that being said I banned fizz and our midlaner apparently had it for his POT...
