He's got his passive that can reduce Zed's damage by 15% by hitting him, he's got his suppression-into-30/40/50% damage reduction ultimate, and he's got his Terror Capacitor shield.

She's part of the ten initial champions for a reason.\n\nEDIT: Her skills aren't that complex. She's got a boatload of damage with crowd control in relatively easy skillshots, along with a point and click ultimate. She can self-cast her ult when she's in danger, and her E gives her an engage and a disengage. She builds tanky and can punish melee champions extremely effectively. Her passive is probably the hardest part of her kit to play around, since as a beginner, one normally wants to spam abilities, which forces Lissandra to run out of mana very quickly. I'm saying this as someone who played Lissandra as his first champion and who still plays her to this day as my second favorite mage...","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-06-27T08:32:30.101+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is kha'zix...","replies":[{"poster":"RoodToob","date":"2016-06-27T15:24:24.711+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kha main, and to be fair, Kha has simple mechanics at a base, and not too many complicated ones (but they exist) \n\nSo maybe thats why he's there. \n\nThe harder part about kha is knowing when to jump in and out. _\"But thats on every assassin dude\"_ Well, yes it is on most, but kha has to deal with isolation.
