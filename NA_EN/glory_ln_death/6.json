I'm not even that big of a fan of laughing fish but i can see why they would make him a warden.

I once even made a post where he was included as one of my favorite Boards users.\n\nThat was before i saw what kind of a \"person\" he is.\n\nHe only cares about himself. The \"jokes\" he makes are just for more popularity which he enjoys. It's pretty clear now he doesn't do this for others' entertainment just from the quality of them. I mean he can do the lamest, most outdated joke and there will be people that will jumpstart it with 20 - 30 upvotes to get it to the front page, just because it's \"Laughing Fish\".\n\nI only saw 1 good post from him in the last year or so which i did upvote. Nothing else.\n\nHe also represses anybody who speaks up on his crap and is pardoned because the mods are also fans of him. Not to mention how his brainwashed minions come to stand up for him. It's complete mob mentality.\n\nFor example, i remember calling him out on it and he just hided behind memes and whatever his party of assholes said about me in response which were insults out of nowhere. He even called me a bitch using a gif. If it was up to me, i'd have him perma banned right there and i reported them like 4 times seeing as their comments weren't deleted.\n\nBut i got perma banned on EUW instead for a much smaller insult that the mod picked out.\n\nThis title is undeserved and he's just gonna abuse the power most likely whenever someone with a brain talks back.\n\nAlso, i've given my try at Memes&Games and did better than most of his copy-paste meme posts. I'm not even interested in such a pointless title.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-06-22T06:08:56.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"someone sounds very salty.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2017-06-22T11:22:01.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A prime example of one of his minions i see.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2017-06-21T13:48:01.419+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://media.tenor.com/images/47e333bbc36fe6ce1db1b6b016d7b46f/tenor.gif","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2017-06-21T16:07:22.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"well i guess thats as good as any im more shocked that it didnt happen sooner","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2017-06-21T06:00:47.208+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some guy did the calculations with her full build( don't know which items), and I didn't check this, but by the end, {{champion:113}} would have negative armor, ~-20","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-06-21T11:27:56.093+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":2,"body":"So bascally he strips her naked.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-06-21T13:31:21.009+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"And gives Bristle a clean fade as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Techfusion7","date":"2017-06-22T17:43:17.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinky.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2017-06-21T16:52:40.192+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:113}} :  help!  help!
