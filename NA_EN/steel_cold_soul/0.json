ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIOT???","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":11,"body":"They nerfed his ult where now if you cancel it it goes on 30 second cooldown. doesn&#039;t refund mana, and his e does less damage, and his damage ratio went down by a total 0.6 points. ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIOT? PANTHEON FALLS OFF SO HARD LATE GAME AND YOU LISTEN TO SOME FKING CHILDREN COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM WINNING TOP LANE THE LAST TWO WEEKS? WOW HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF SOMETHING CALLED SELECTIVE FEEDBACK? MAYBE CONSIDER WHOS COMPLAINING AND WHY? BUT REALLY? REALLY?  he falls off late game already. \n\nHE FALLS OFF SO HARD LATE GAME !   FINE HE FALLS OFF. BUT NO JUST MAKE HIM SUPER BAD LIKE SWAIN AND URGOT, BUT AT LEAST YOUrre SOMEWHAT BUFFING THOSE TWO. \n\n if anything buff him or leave him the way it is. i hope you take less than an entire month to revise.  &quot;OH HE WAS WINNING SO MUCH THE LAST TWO WEEKS&quot;. and what, this patch will be for a month or two? MAYBE IF PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING FOR IDK, 6 MONTHS STRAIGHT and all the poles say he is top tier then fine. but no one is saying that. every tier list we&#039;ve seen says A to C tier. \n\ntook them an entire season+ to fix urgot. lets hope they are more competent about this one. \n\nHopefully they do remove my post for it not sounding like a 5th grader wrote it. Hold on let me get banned for two weeks for saying &quot;worth&quot; . Hold on, let me ban people from a game they pay for for it because we are the most popular MOBA, we don&#039;t care about the fans, and we&#039;ll just ban you anyway and not care. k.  Hopefully the right people see this and make the change fix in this PSUEDO SJW COMMUNIST COMPANY. \n\n- -sincerely - more than two dozen Pantheon players complains in one message collectively. We all hate this change.","replies":[{"poster":"Envy Sin","date":"2016-03-10T09:03:52.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice way to put the post.\n\nNot making any clear arguments, showing numbers or otherwise SHOWING why it was a unneeded nerf.

Due to the the new items, he got heavily buffed this season, but was flying under the radar for a while. Because games tend to be more snowball-y, he was in a position where he often *didn't* fall off, because the game ended before it got to that point. His skills are point an click, so there was no way of counterplaying getting jump stunned, and then 100-0'ed due to crits with the armor pen he built.\n\nAnd even then, sometimes lane bullies need to be toned down -- Renekton is a famous example of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Steel Cold Soul","date":"2016-03-10T09:37:19.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did pantheon receive any buffs?","replies":[{"poster":"Faie","date":"2016-03-10T10:29:19.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes he did.
