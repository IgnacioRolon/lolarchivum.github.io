I've tried CCleaner, Uninstalling programs, and reinstalling the game. This has reduced it some but not all. Any tips for what else could be wrong?\r\n\r\nMy Laptop is a ASUS ROG GL752VW-DH74 Intel i7","replies":[{"poster":"Relic Fades","date":"2016-10-28T19:50:36.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem right now, it started for me 10/10/2016 and now it's 10/28/2016... I don't know what else to do. I even reinstalled the program. All other games work for me except this one lags/freezes then unfreezes/lags CONSTANTLY in game. Just randomly happened. Before I had a smooth 40ms ping with no fps spikes. And yes, I have tested ping to their servers and yea it seems to be a problem with the route. What do I do? ;( Literally ruining my experience right now and I am depending on it to be fixed season 7 or I am done with this crap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoppyPleb","date":"2016-10-25T23:20:29.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I used to have massive ping spikes up to like 500, I know it wasn't my internet because other games worked fine. After the latest patches it has become less common for me, usually when I get a problem in this game (Which happens annoyingly often) I just wait for next patch and it usually somewhat resolves my Issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-25T21:26:58.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is likely caused by high *packet buffering* or bursts of *packet loss*. Most of the time, this is caused by problematic nodes along your route to the server, but can also be caused or at least exacerbated by inefficient network settings local to your home network. I suggest checking our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for steps that can help you get your network 100% compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if that guide had any noticeable change in your issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ioku","date":"2016-10-25T20:11:06.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed this as well, on top of the fact that the last few days my ping has gone from a constant 58-60 to 86+ every game.
