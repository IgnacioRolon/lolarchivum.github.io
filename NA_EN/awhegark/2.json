That's enough time for most current meta junglers to either reach and contest the blue while he's there, and his escape is delayed enough that if he's caught out like that it's entirely possible he's killed, because now he's moving slower.

Every champion uses the same system to evaluate their winrate, thus in almost all cases one winrate is perfect tool to compare champions, no matter their role, items, classes etc. Obviously, it shouldn't be used as only source of comparison, as for example number of games is important statistic that go together with winrate.\n\nWhich boils to just one thing: Marcus used winrate to compare champions properly. You on the other hand twisted meaning of his posts and started arguing with your version of what he said (strawmans argument at its finest).\n\nJust to make sure there's no place to twist champion-comparing logic any further.\n\nIf Marcus would have compared Ahris AP to Volibears dance animation, or her HP to Volibears HP, then I'd be with you on this one.

High Skill Champions have lower average, but higher Main winrates. Low Skill champions have higher base, but lower main winrates. Champs who scale have a higher winrate later in the game, than champs who have good bases. \n\nYou can not look at stats alone, without looking at the Champions being compared.
