When I login and try to enter queue or click play and then on the draft pick, it'll sometimes kick me back to the main screen like I just logged in and then it will sometimes say im disconnected from chat and wont reconnect at all. I know its not my connection because I can use chrome just fine and my xbox works 100% fine in online matches.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T21:44:48.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There currently aren't any issues connecting to the server.  It sounds like your issue may be due to third party programs.  Are you using any apps like play.tv, overwolf, or lolrecorder?  Remove anything that interacts with League to fix this up.  If that doesn't help, any additional information like error messages or what you're seeing exactly can help.
