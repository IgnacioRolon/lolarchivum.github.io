While trying to farm I noticed that if I target a minion but it dies right before my stun (Q) goes off then the stun goes on cooldown and no damage or stun was dealt.\n\nI see this quite often when one of my caster minions has already shot and I am trying to grab the kill before the bolt lands. However, if unsuccessful I lose the mana and the ability goes on cooldown with no effect.\n\nThis becomes really frustrating when I cannot choose a new target and become mana-screwed in lane because I tried to farm without success. \n\nIs anyone else seeing this?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MSLimJY9Bo\n\nCheers,\nChabala","replies":[{"poster":"FredFredderson","date":"2015-03-04T22:39:01.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens sometimes with Nasus's q, if a minion dies right around when the q would hit it the q will do no damage and you won't get a stack but q will still go on cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-03-04T17:12:13.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if your AA animation starts, you lose the skills that are trigging off of it.

I've missed last hits on almost every champ I've used and still burned the skills.  It's not just tied to minions.  For instance, last night I played an ARAM as Master Yi.  I Q'd an enemy near death.  Master Yi vanished, then landed at the enemy's location.  I received no kill or assist credit, but still burned my skill.  If he was dead, Q shouldn't have triggered.  If he was alive, I should've gotten participation credit.  I've fired Gangplank's Q at minions, only to have them die before getting hit. Q goes on cooldown.  Blitzcrank's E?  Yep, cooldown without knockup.","replies":[{"poster":"Chabala","date":"2015-03-05T08:27:16.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, for Yi that is a bit more confusing since it can still launch and hit the other near by enemies.
