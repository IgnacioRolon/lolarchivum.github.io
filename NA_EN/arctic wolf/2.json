My one big complaint though, is that since I've been playing League (starting around early season 2 with the Ziggs patch) all the contests I've seen have been for the visual arts. Whether it's comic books, sculpture, digital art, or even brush and paints, it all requires a fairly decent amount of skill to make quality entries, which leaves a fairly small subset of summoners who are able to take advantage of these contests. I enjoy art, and I don't mean to take anything away from the phenomenal creations of those who enter this contest, like contests past. However, I would love to see Riot offer contests centering around more than just one's abilities to create fantastic visuals. \n\nWhat about the writer, creative and spontaneous, able to explore the lore of the Freljord or open our eyes to the culture of Mount Targon? Or perhaps tell us how League members interact on their off days; I for one would love to hear about how Diana and Leona get along off the rift, or if Wukong still is under the tutelage of Master Yi. What about the musician? From the beginning players who dabble amongst various instruments to the serious amateur who practices several hours a day, to the girl who just likes singing and messing around in programs like Finale, Sibelius, and Garage Band in her free time? Why can't we have a contest of composition, where entries can be anything from a simple melody sung similar to Diana's theme (or even an A Capella version) to something like the metal from the Pentakill album, or a full-blown symphony if someone is ambitious enough? \n\nRiot, I love that you choose to engage your community with contests like this art one you currently have going on, and I don't want that to stop. I want you to expand it so that ALL summoners feel like they can participate, not just those who can create visual masterpieces. I personally would love to enter a creative writing or music composition contest, but I cannot hope to compete with the likes of the visual artists and always feel slightly discouraged when these contests roll around. I can't even animate the stick figures I create to have them do interesting things. While some of my friends have argued that Riot already has departments which handle music and lore, I must say that Riot also has a pretty fantastic art department as well. I'm sure they must gain some form of inspiration from seeing the entries, and perhaps expanded contests could also help other departments build on the fantastic stories and music they already have created!\n\nP.S. If any Rioters actually read this, I'd like to ask one more question: Why do the login screens no longer return to the main League of Legends theme \"Summoner's Call\" after a week or two of the released champion? When I first started playing this theme (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0cia14N9no) was featured as the main login theme, developing further off of the season 1 login theme. Around Lulu I think, Riot started adding music for each Champion added. However, it would return to the Riot theme after a short time. This epic music is echoed throughout the game, and expanded upon during parts of the all-star themes and the Season 2 Championship. Season 3 saw a brand new theme (also featured in the youtube link), however after the brief time of its login screen it was never heard again. After the Season 3 Championships theme, there wasn't even a Season 4 theme. I really like hearing the individual themes of champions, but I'm curious why Riot doesn't go back to putting their main theme music on the login, especially when we have the same login screen for many weeks now since champion releasing has slowed down.\n\nAdditional comment of Awesome contest idea: Pick any champion released without its own login theme and create one!\n\n*EDIT: Season 4 totally had login music, I just had a brain fart. Still, it's not something we've heard any elaboration or expansion of since.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-04T01:31:24.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm terrible at art and music, but I feel I can write fairly decently. I'd love to have a chance to expand the lore of the game, since it's something I can't get enough of (though I don't really write that much, since I feel the community doesn't much care for it). It'd be a neat thing to revitalise interest in the written aspect of the League, I feel.","replies":[]}]}
