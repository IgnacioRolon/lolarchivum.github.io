Sucks to hear about this hiccup and hope it hasn't taken too much out of your day!  I've seen this issue before, and it can be a combination of bad game files and security settings preventing game files from being accessed.  I suggest going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix this up.  You can also use the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to perform the clean reinstall!
