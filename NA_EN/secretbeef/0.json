You can easily bait it out. Plus if Riven decides to go all in, the only way to cancel the animation of her ult is with her e.. so if she DOES go in, she blows her only defense.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Danyoja","date":"2014-11-08T05:46:40.342+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying she's Garen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"jinxedchef","date":"2014-11-08T07:13:02.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Riven may be easy to play, I admit that but she was nerfed over and over.

Though I don't own or play Riven the same applies to every champion, in my case Fiora as you can see from Ranked Stats.

Diamond here and I've never thought any champ was really \"op\" except her. The mobility is insane so unless you stack snares/stuns on her, there's a very small chance you can catch her. In addition to her mobility, her scaling is quite ridiculous especially with that AD scaling shield. \n        My suggestion is: lower her base stats and increase the scaling. So this way, if she loses lane (if she does, she's out of the game), she'll still be able to bounce back. This will also give all the other top laners a fair chance at early game which is her forte. I've played many normals, never dared with rank, games with her and she is honestly one of the harder champs to get down. But frankly, the skill involved is neglected in lane due to the absurd early game strength.
