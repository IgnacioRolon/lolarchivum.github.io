My suggestion for Riot would be to make it so pre30 and people at level 30 are actually in separate queues so they couldn't get matched together. It isn't so much that level 30s are more skilled (many would be due to greater experience/game knowledge) but more that pre30s aren't on a level playing field in terms of runes so they are at a disadvantage automatically and can be a detriment to their team mates as a result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chide da jungler","date":"2015-12-02T04:31:14.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lvl 30 accounts are like 10 bucks and the entire game is balanced around ranked\n\nthats' the reality you should be working in","replies":[{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2015-12-02T15:06:32.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chide da jungler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2FVeLslE,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-12-02T04:31:14.297+0000)\n>\n> lvl 30 accounts are like 10 bucks and the entire game is balanced around ranked\n> \n> thats' the reality you should be working in\n\nThey are mostly botted accounts which will be eventually banned.
