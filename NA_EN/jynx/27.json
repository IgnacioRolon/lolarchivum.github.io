I do a lot of concept for anime and am going to school for graphic design so that i may make concepts for games :) If you use a program what is your preference and what hardware do you reccomend?","replies":[{"poster":"RinTheYordle","date":"2015-04-16T20:01:44.770+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there! I am completely digital right now, but I do some doodles on paper. Whatever you are comfortable with, DO IT. Traditional is JUST AS GOOD by itself and a GREAT medium to mix with digital. Play with it and have fun!\n\nI would recommend learning photoshop. They have an awesome pay by month program now that makes it a lot cheaper to own the product, or, if you want a cheaper route, go with Paint Tool SAI. It is STRICTLY for painting though. It doesn't have a text feature in it (yet? at least on my old version it doesn't). I wouldn't recommend SAI for making graphic design stuff. It can do it, but photoshop has an easier time of making these things. :)\n\nGood luck with your endeavors and in school!
