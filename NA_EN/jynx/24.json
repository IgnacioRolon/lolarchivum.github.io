I have read the q&a answers where they said the chose one that could be universally good enough for gameplay since obviously using a different animation for each death would be impossible and use a lot of data, but I had a decent idea to counter that. I think, as shown in the video, it could be just as visually beautiful to, instead of the same flower that spawns on death, include different death animations depending on their primary roles (tank, mage, support, etc...). I think this would crate even more of a translation of his meticulously planned \"art\" by death to his lore/teaser. \n\nAnyways, just a thought that I would have pushed for in designing the champ. I know its a lot to ask for.
