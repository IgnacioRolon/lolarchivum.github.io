I feel grateful for this. I am in your debt.\n\n{{champion:236}} No, Braum. We are in your debt. You have saved me too many times to count. Not only have you saved me, but you have also saved the hope that goes along with bringing back my Senna.\n\n{{champion:32}} I once thought I didn't have any friends. But when you jumped in when I was hurt, keeping the baddies away... I don't think anyone else would have done what you did... Thank you.\n\n{{champion:201}} No problem, little guy. Say, have you made friend with the short lady with the teddy bear yet? \n\n{{champion:32}} ... ...\n\n{{champion:201}} I'll... we can talk about that later, little guy.\n\n{{champion:24}} I suppose it's my turn. I have gone in those Fields of Justice, and many times, I came out on top of the rest, even with my... \"nerf\" of having to use this lamp post. That's not to say I haven't lost before. Even the best have lost something to make them stive to become better. \n\n{{champion:201}} That is sadly true. While along a voyage through the lands of Frelijord, I came across a mountain peak. The wind was great, and I could see my pasture from the view. My goats likely knew I was watching, making loud goat noises, calling me to pet thier small beards. But... Lissandra did not approve of me and how I saved the troll boy from the locked room in the mountain: where I gained my shield. She made the snow at the top of the mountain where my pasture and village were begin to crumple down... I ran as fast as I could to my pasture and village... Not everyone was saved... Some were fatally wounded with nothing that could be done for them. Others were acrried down the mountain, never to be seen again... Those were the worst of the losses... Both of us have failed at one point, friend. But it is what we do now that matters. \n\n{{champion:236}} I'm sorry for your loss, Braum. \n\n{{champion:201}} That's alright, old pal. We cannot stay in the past. Or time will hit you like goat. Haha!\n\n{{champion:24}} Kat, you'r turn. \n\n{{champion:201}} If the lady does not wish to speak, we are in no position to make her speak.\n\n{{champion:55}} No no, I'll go. I remember being in the front lines, and I jumped in to kill all of the enemy team. They saw me coming. I balcked out, but when I regained my thoughts, you were there on top of me. I could have still killed them all, but you... probably saved me from having... to... Okay, maybe you saved my life- maybe- but that's not the point. \n\n{{champion:24}} You can't be serious.\n\n{{champion:236}} Where are all the poros that usually crowd you?\n\n{{champion:201}} I made sure the little balls of energy were placed soundly to sleep with their king. I cannot possibly keep an eye on them and have fun with my friends. I worry to much about them. Haha!\n\n{{champion:22}} Am I too late?\n\n{{champion:201}} N-never, my queen! You came so suddenly!\n\n{{champion:24}} No one else just thought what I just thought of, right?\n\n{{champion:22}} Rise, Braum. And I thought you were an expert at dealing with surprises.\n\n{{champion:201}} I did not think you would come all this way to join me and my friends!\n\n{{champion:22}} How can I not celebrate with my best bodyguard? I also brought our people along.\n\n{{champion:79}} Hey hey hey! Guess who brought the beverages!\n\n{{champion:23}} Someone's enthusiastic...\n\n{{champion:20}} So is Willump. He's been hungry ever since I've been telling him about all the food that was gonna be here. \n\n{{champion:34}} Why here, Braum? Couldn't we have gone somewhere higher? Where it's colder?\n\n{{champion:201}} Um... No. Sorry.\n\n{{champion:236}} I suppose this is the whole gang, then?\n\n{{champion:201}} More like my family, yes.\n\n{{champion:32}} I wish I had a family...\n\n{{champion:55}} Trust me: they're only useful for a small while. But after that, they'll only hold you down.\n\n{{champion:20}} Can Willump have a drink? He hasn't drinked anything along the way.\n\n{{champion:79}} Sure. Just be sure only Willump drinks from it. This... isn't meant for kids.\n\n{{champion:20}} Sure. Alright. Will do.\n\n{{champion:34}} Why bring it if you knew Nunu and Willump were coming?\n\n{{champion:23}} I guess Ill have a drink while I'm here. Toss me a barrel?\n\n{{champion:55}} I'll take one too, I guess.\n\n{{champion:79}} Sure.\n\n{{champion:22}} Are these your friends, Braum?\n\n{{champion:201}} Yes, my queen. They are all allies, and they have come to celebrate with me. \n\n{{champion:23}} They seem cool to me. Except for the tout. Why's he here.\n\n{{champion:32}} I have no where else to go...\n\n{{champion:23}} ... ...\n\n{{champion:22}} No need to be rude. What do you mean you have no where else to go?\n\n{{champion:32}} I have no friends... I woke up in the middle of no where... Everywhere I went, I was ignored... No one wanted me...\n\n{{champion:22}} I'm sorry... If you want, you can come with us.\n\n{{champion:24}} Your highness, he's from the desert. He wouldn't last a day in the Frelijord.\n\n{{champion:34}} And where would he live if he did come? Make room?\n\n{{champion:22}} Don't you have room in your nest?\n\n {{champion:32}} I don't like the cold...\n\n{{champion:23}} Guess he's not coming then. Oh well.\n\n{{champion:79}} No, I'm not giving Willump another barrel!\n\n{{champion:20}} But he just wants another barrel. \n\n{{champion:79}} He ate FOUR barrels already! I only carry around so many barrels. What, you think I have enought barrels to just toss around and explode?\n\n{{champion:201}} Actually...\n\n{{champion:79}} Don't answer.\n\n{{champion:432}} Cling clang.\n\n{{champion:32}} Hi, bard.\n\n{{champion:432}} ... ...\n\n{{champion:236}}  He's just passing through, right.\n\n{{champion:432}} Cling cling.\n\n{{champion:24}} Yep. And there he goes. Wandering forever.\n\n{{champion:201}} I am happy that I could have you all be today. \n\n{{champion:22}} No, Braum. We are honored to know you, and to call you a companion of ours. Happy birth day, brave knight. I deem you the Heart of the Frelijord for your heoric actions in protecting the weak.\n\n{{champion:79}} To Braum!\n\n{{champion:236}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:201}} HOORAH!!\n\n{{item:3165}} From there, Braum and his friends had a great birthday.
