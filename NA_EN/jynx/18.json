The room wont have a coat check system, but security will be posted there while the venue is open. =) There's always a potential risk when leaving belongings alone, though I've never encountered such issues in past cosplay rooms.\n\nLooking forward to seeing your Ahri cosplay!","replies":[{"poster":"peppermintlemon","date":"2015-08-20T01:35:53.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thank you! :D Do you also have an approximate time estimate to when the event is about to end for Sunday?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"StrongBadEmail","date":"2015-08-15T02:39:25.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend wants to cosplay as gragas, but many of the skins have him with no shirt.
