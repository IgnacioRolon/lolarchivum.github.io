That is an epic idea. Maybe start with one poro for one minigame, and have five minigames. As you play them, the poros get better, then throw them into a battle arena where they fight to the death! Except, they don't die. That'd ruin the point of taking days to train them. :/ (btw, I had a max'd out Chao.
