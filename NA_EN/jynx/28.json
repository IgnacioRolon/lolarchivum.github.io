The fans and new players would love if we had control over the category of side games that come out or not. The community is the key to your success and being so you owe us some of the pleasure. All we ask is that monthly you would let us vote to see the side games that would come out or not, example...

I never honestly considered this idea but I do think that giving the community that option will definitely improve the LoL gamer's experience.

Think about this, a hexakill URF mirror match against the doom bots of doom lvl 5 on the ascension map.  Or any of the combinations in between.  I think it would take a lot of programing for the doom bots, so forget that idea if you must.  But I think that otherwise, our custom games should be able to be customized in this way.  Maybe also add an option for a starting level or starting gold or gold/exp bonuses from things like minions or jungle camps.
