I live in california, somewhere im sure bro and dude are very popular. So no frankly bro isnt companion or good friend. Bro is brother.

Not everything that happens is a social justice problem. Just because someone says \"bro\" to you in a video game or uses a random pronoun to describe you doesnt mean you need to cry about it.

Let me let you in the light. \n\nYou simply CANNOT compare how you are treated irl to how you are treated virtually. I think in a sense, in the virtual world you are treated without gender discrimination because no one knows what gender anyone is. That is, until you bring it up (which is not needed). The reason (up there) why he called you bro is because it shows affection. He doesn't know your gender, and he doesn't have to. He's just responding with bro because that shows affection as a friend. He's just trying to say: good friend, if you lose a silver game, then that is on you. You can't change common definitions, especially when you don't know what they mean. \n\nThe thing about the forums here: most of us are just responding to your texts, not if you are a girl or boy. Now I do get you in the sense that there are players worse in silver elo than diamond (which may not be true due to the amount of boosted/bought accounts). But flaming people in the boards instead of asking why or how you can get better at carrying low elo games. \n\nDiamond doesn't really mean much. It's just an indication that you have gotten to that rank. Anyone can be just carried along the wave, actually carrying themselves, getting boosted, buying an account. Playing in diamond is different than playing in silver. Maybe you should rely on yourself in low elo, because playing in those 2 elos is different.\n\nTry reforming yourself. I personally was a bad player stuck in gold and silver. I kept on demoting to silver 1 then promoting to gold 4 for at least 10 times before I was able to climb to plat. It's a process. I suggest having an alternative account so you can reclimb those ranks that you climbed on your main, so you can just autopilot and carry those games.","replies":[{"poster":"chicken doodle","date":"2019-06-01T22:13:37.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lunar ArcS,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=skBFsGbv,comment-id=00170000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-05-29T18:17:08.871+0000)\n>\n> Already starting off with condescending comments, how fun.\n> \n> Literally none of this post was asking how to carry better Considering im almost where you are, in about 500 games less..\n> \n> I like that you insinuate i got carried to diamond meanwhile you've literally never been diamond.

You have to play differently. I also pointed out that diamond, to me, isn't worth much. You could drop the passive aggressive (also insecure) remarks about my profile. I'm not comparing myself and you. I don't plan on doing it either. I started out bronze last season, so I've improved plenty considering the time frame.

This account is currently D3 (and likely will remain such until top actually gets some help, I had to climb from d4 0 lp to 100 lp by playing adc mediocre. Pretty much spammed late game ADs like Cait.). I have two other accounts, the one with less games is P1 right now pretty sure, the other got d4 in half the games my main took, but demoted and is currently stuck in limbo. I don't smurf to be a dick to lower rank players, I smurf because the higher level of play is so heavily imbalanced I tilt faster right now than I have in previous seasons (It practically takes one game to full tilt me, unjoyable as hell atm). \n\nAs much as people would like to disagree, this meta for soloqueue is harmful to toplane and heavily benefits mid and adc.
