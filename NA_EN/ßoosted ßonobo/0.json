I pressed the link and it took a while to load for me to get a \"Error: 500\" with a blitzcrank above it. I tried mutiple times on mobile and  different browsers, but it seems to not work. I then tried to go on the league website and clicked \"PBE become a tester\" and it still showed the Error:500. Is there anything to fix this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T22:50:02.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're aware of an issue that some players are having on the PBE signup page. Some people have been able to get around that error 500 by using a VPN like [**CyberGhost**](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us), and others have been able to use [**this url**](https://pbesignup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/pbe-signup) to get in.\n\nLet me know if either of those help!","replies":[{"poster":"ßoosted ßonobo","date":"2017-04-03T07:08:04.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using CyberGhost seems to pass by the error 500.

At this point you haven't been invited onto the PBE servers quite yet (so I'm not sure what happened with that e-mail =\\ ), but keep an eye out for when you do get accepted!","replies":[{"poster":"Best Jinx EU","date":"2017-04-10T05:33:30.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same problems that lead to this. i tried the cyberghost that you suggested him to do and it worked for me but same thing happens to what happened to him :(((","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MarleeAnne","date":"2017-04-02T23:16:34.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had the same problem happen to me.
