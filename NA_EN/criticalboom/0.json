I'm not sure if this is because of League and its new content or what. I have been trying to figure out the problem ever since and still experiencing this ungodly ping spikes. I hope you can help me figure out the source of the problem so I can get back on the rift. And yes I know you aren't the tech support, but I just want to make sure just in case.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-09T18:43:10.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like your network might experiencing packet loss here.
