We've made some changes on our end to help mitigate the effects of the maintenance, but there could still be some ripple effects from other carriers being affected by the maintenance.\n\nFrom what we can see so far, our changes seem to have resolved the disconnections for the most part, but if anyone is still experiencing consistent disconnections, let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"LuskFusk","date":"2016-05-24T00:43:17.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about Portugal tho? : (","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-24T01:08:39.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like there was a secondary outage as well.

For context, this type of service issue can be particularly tricky for things like loss prevention since it is only affecting certain players in certain regions.  Since our game servers don't restrict by country and only by server, it means we don't really have a way to target only the affected players in these circumstances.\n\nInstead, we try to do preventative routing changes to minimize the impact.  Unfortunately in this case, that didn't happen soon enough and we're going to be having additional conversations internally to figure out why it didn't so that it doesn't happen again.","replies":[{"poster":"TigeroftheWind","date":"2016-05-25T04:51:12.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my girlfriend and I are in the same game.
