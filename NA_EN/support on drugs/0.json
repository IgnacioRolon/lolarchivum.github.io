(In season8, have played him few times before in other seasons)  And I didn't have a Border in Flex. Apparently not having played Flex in s7  nullifies the fact I'm Plat 3 in SoloQ and they can spam ''Bronze Kha'' ''Noob kha bronze report'' ''First time kha report bronze'' \n\nSo I was just replying casually ''Bronze Nasus'' to the 20+ chats of ''Bronze Kha'' that the Top, mid and support were spamming. \n\n''F**k losers, focus on winners'' Wasn't directed at them. It's a quote from literally any Jungle coach & guide I've come across. \n''F**k losers, focus on winners. Someone who already lost isn't going to win you the game, at best he'll surive until late and then It's 50/50 while snowballing the player/s who are already fed will allow them to carry'' \n\nThen I just stated that the 3 of them calling me Useless, was quite stupid. Considering I had snowballed our botlane into a hyper fed J!nx and Janna. \nAllowing us to win the teamfights, + I had taken 3 turrets by myself. Aswell as I then took the inhibs in a backdoor. And I got all 4 drakes that spawned in that game. (Quite gr8 drakes too, 3 Mountain, 1 infernal) \n\nJanna had been tilting entire team since start.  \nSince 2 minutes into the game, she kept being toxic, afk'ing, spamming surrender votes, and more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2018-03-08T00:22:11.758+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You aren't a jungle coach.

I'm G3 in flex. \n(Never played Flex until S8 so I placed low there due to no previous mmr there + I don't play my Mains in Flex. Prefer climbing Flex with my off picks) \nAnd  Plat 3 in soloQ. And, the Nasus that had been Intentionally feeding and trolling since 2:00 of game. Is Silver 3 and has been bronze/silver his entire league career.  So no, we're not at the same level. Only reason he was in that elo, is because his 2 teammates were gold 4 & 3 in Flex. \n\n\nAlso, why would I effectively waste my time, going top lane. Where Nasus already went ahead and gave Urgot a huge amount of kills in under 15 minutes INTENTIONALLY. Simply because I pinged him 2 times and asked him to go defend my blue buff while I started Red buff.  \nTo which he responded to with toxicity from him & his friends, and him going straight to feeding for no reason.\n\nWhile I would be top side, Lee would've had free reign to clear out my botside jungle, kill my mid laner, roam with his mid laner to bot.

So I'm quite sure she could ''Trust'' that I was helping her.\n\nAnd not once in that Chat log do I flame any1. \nI'm not telling anyone to K themselves, Not being homophobic, (which wouldn't make sense since a lot my family & friends are bi/gay) Not telling anyone to F themselves or F off.  Even though Nasus & Janna were acting & playing like it, not once did I call them worthless garbage. \n\nWorst thing I did? I QUOTED. A QUOTE.  It's literally in quotation marks, so that even a Bot would understand that I'm not saying it to the player, but referring to a quote. When I said ''F losers, focus on the winners'' I was referring to what  an Ex-challenger Coach told me that when I asked him about his opinion on what to do in case one lane is losing insanely hard.

Each queue rank has to be earned separately.  If you are playing outside your comfort zone, *of course* you will play at a lower skill level than your main.  You  have to learn the new champion and/or position to earn the same skill level as your main.\n \n> Also, why would I effectively waste my time, going top lane.

Maybe he was doing that, but it's not your responsibility to point out everyone else's shortcomings as players.\n\n> Worst thing I did? I QUOTED. A QUOTE.

It doesn't mean the quote is acceptable in a game setting.  If throwing quotation marks around something made it exempt from a ban (BTW, you didn't even do that much), than anyone could put them around racial slurs, suicide calls, and blatant harassment with no repercussions.\n\n> Other than that one &#x27;&#x27;F losers&#x27;&#x27;  there isn&#x27;t any flame in there.\n\nTBH, you seem to have a superiority complex regarding players who don't match up to your expectations.  You flame them by pointing out their failings.\n\nI work with someone like that.  Never swears, never yells, but is constantly telling everyone else what their job is and how to do it.  It's not their responsibility and, not only does it make the job unpleasent, they are wasting time they could use to do *their* job and everyone else's time by putting them behind schedule.

I&#x27;ve never understood how flaming on a video game, yelling at pixels on a screen is in any way manly. In fact, one could say video games are created for those who can&#x27;t handle the societal pressures of the civilized world.\n\nWell said, from someone who's never played sports, or should I say never have been picked to play sports.","replies":[{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2018-03-08T09:38:59.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I don't play sports.
