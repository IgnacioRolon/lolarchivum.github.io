I'd say you did go over the line and deserve a punishment. If this is the first punishment you've ever gotten and the \"suspension\" you mention was an actual 14-day suspension, skipping both chat restrictions, it is possible that the system picked up on the mention of \"suicide\" and didn't get that you meant an in-game death, in which case Riot support might be willing to reduce the punishment (but not necessarily your \"punishment tier,\" meaning the next offense might still mean a permaban) to a chat restriction. If you got a chat restriction for this, or if it was a 14-day suspension after previous chat restrictions, then there's nothing wrong. Also note that the reform card shows 1-5 games that contributed to your punishment. If you think this match wasn't too bad, it's entirely possible there are other matches that were worse than you thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Like97Samurai","date":"2019-04-25T21:44:32.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reform card is one game.

Your argument is flawed.\n\n\n\n\nLet's have you understand the behavioral system a bit more. Think of it like a health bar (or tension meter) in music games. When you hit the note at an off beat,  your tension meter  increases. When you completely miss a note, the meter increases by alot. When you hit the note at good timings, it reduces the meter. \n\nRiot's behavior system works the same way, as in we all have a toxicity meter attached to our accounts. When players are mildly toxic, it goes up a tad. When people use hate speech, it pretty much fills up the meter. of course, clean games reduce the meter. \n\nIt is possible for playerA to get punished and playerB not to, even though playerB was waaayyyyy more toxic . Let's say playerA started the game with the toxicity meter at 95% and playerB's at 35%. Ingame, playerB said some pretty nasty shit and playerA responds with some shit as well. After the game, playerA gains 10% toxicity and playerB gains 50%. Now playerA is at 105% toxicity and gets punished, whereas playerB is at 85%, and not punished in that specific game, even though playerB was found to be 5x more toxic than playerA in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Like97Samurai","date":"2019-04-26T01:04:36.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am only going to respond to this one but I appreciate both of your comments.
