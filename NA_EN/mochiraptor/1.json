I was suspended, not knowing why and having to learn later that it was the person whom I had trusted a ton. I had to pay back $210.00 and I've gotten the money, in Rp cards as I had learned on this post made, and the link is included. I have saved small amounts of money, maybe 5 dollars a week, bothering my parents and feeling like a sack of poopy. I've gotten the help of my friends who still play league and here I am. 210 dollars in Rp. I submitted a ticket. Barely any help. Why would this post still be on here if I wouldn't be able to use Rp cards? I was so excited but once I saw the reply to my ticket, I was crushed. So please, any staff member out there, please please help me. It's been so long.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-15T23:54:41.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fret not buddy!!

I'm really confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T01:15:28.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's alright! Since you bought them online, make sure to send some screenshots of the code as well as any receipts for those codes if you can and we should still be able to help. \n\nSide note: If you don't get a reply very quickly, don't worry. Sometimes their queues can get a little backed up, but rest assured we'll get back to you as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
