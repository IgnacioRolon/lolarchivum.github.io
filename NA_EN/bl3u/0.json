Isn't there some way you guys could program the page so that you can switch between traditional and reddit style browsing? I mean, honestly it doesn't seem like it would be that hard. don't make comments cascade, and instead of arranging them in order of upvotes arrange them by what time they were posted.\r\n\r\nI really hope you consider this request especially if you plan to phase out the old forums.

For me the biggest two changes that I would love to see would be:\n1. Sort by Oldest (and not just recent)\n2.

I do go on the League subreddit, but I am not active for a number of reasons. Some of those reasons seem like they are carrying over to the forums if this style is what Riot settles with.\n\nI do like that you can get updates on discussions you have participated in. I also like the profile feature, because it might help you catch up with a friend or check on a thread/user you found interesting. Comment threading is nice and cleaner than traditional forums.\n\nThere are some definite \"cons\" to this forum style as well. I'm posting in a thread that's 15 hours old but it's on the front page. While I know the sorting button is there because I'm familiar with Reddit, newcomers and people who aren't familiar with that style might get really confused. \n\nSorting threads by upvotes can be a problem. People will post \"Hay guyz I played a game with dyrus and he said hi lolz here's my screenshot!\" and it's on the front page. While some good discussion threads will get to the front page, many get left buried in downvotes. Or, people post just because they get imaginary internet points. It can be a little intimidating to people who aren't used to Reddit.\n\nI agree with the sentiment that threads can be derailed even easier with this forum style. I've already seen \"here, have an upvote!\" which is usually the beginning of the end of a discussion.\n\nEdit: One small thing \n#1. When you click on a link to an embedded image, it's not scaling right. Parts of larger images are cut off and there's no way to scroll.

When you go to the community home page it shows you active and popular threads that are happening in all of the sub communities. This is a brilliant improvement to the old forum style where everybody in the smaller subforums goes unheard while the masses go rampant in GD.\n\n\\- The text editing features are neat (though some, like bullet points, don't work that well). Also adding icons is good clean fun :)\n\n\\- Tracking your posts and when people reply to you is really convenient on this platform. Really good job with this feature. Vast improvement considering you couldn't do this at all on the traditional forum\n\n**The Bad**  \nI still don't like the nested reddit style posts. I don't think I will ever prefer this over traditional forum layout. I get that this system has advantages. Its way easier to weed out the fruitless comments and its also way easier to find the comments that are useful/interesting/funny. Its easier to manage discussions, and its got to be way easier for rioters who want to start discussions but can't read through the hundreds of posts that flock in.\n\nBut through all of this, I just can't get behind it. It promotes hive-mind mentality by discouraging people from posting controversial/unpopular opinions. The system is particularly biased toward comments that express popular views. This alienates users in a classic same versus the \"other\" scenario. While one could argue that the forum's upvote/downvote system does the same, I'd disagree because each post at least has an equal oppurtunity to be viewed initially. The reddit style forum shuns these posts to the bottom of the page and hides them in the \"expand to see more comments\" section.\n\nAnd to return to something i said in my OP, I really prefer being able to follow threads sequentially. Its easier to figure out where you left off in larger threads. Also, in the reddit system I have trouble tracking down which post someone is replying to if they do so outside of a \"main branch\" of the conversation. Forum style quoting can be somewhat clunky at times, but at least its always straight foward.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThanks for reading all the way to the end! I'd like to finish this by thanking everyone who has worked hard to get this community system up and running! The good parts of the community definitely outweigh the bad, so I hope you guys keep supporting this platform!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kevnator","date":"2013-09-18T16:21:38.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that the more sequential forums format is the reason why the forum community isn't larger. I consider myself sorta a casual browser but I'm the most involved in the League community of ALL my friends. I don't use the forums prior to this because its hard to find anything that is worth reading and most of it is just unimportant to me. With this format it will helper newer people to get more interested as the better content will be right smack in front.\n\nEDIT: Also, the way that the reddit format works is that posts that are upvoted fast get pushed up pretty close to the front page. Often times posts with only 10 or less upvotes are found on the second page and enough people read that far into the posts in order to give it the necessary upvotes to get the front page if the post belongs there. Either way, with the voting system from Reddit, posts DO get noticed because there are always some people lurking in the \"new posts\" section to give it that initial exposure that a post needs.","replies":[{"poster":"Bl3u","date":"2013-09-18T16:59:03.545+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course its not impossible for new posts to get noticed, but the nature of the system causes it to unfairly limit the exposure of new posts. This works fine for meme threads and in particular works well with image threads so that the coolest/funniest/whatever images are shown first. This system breaks however when there is a serious discussion at hand. Discussions should go off on tangents and it is ESSENTIAL that NEW ideas be read and given their due attention. If someone comes into a long thread about a heimer rework and wants to offer a suggestion that is completely unrelated to the things that have the most upvotes, then they are sent straight to the bottom of the list with limited exposure.
