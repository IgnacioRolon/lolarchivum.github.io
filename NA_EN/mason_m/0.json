(Turns out I can't do math when buying and budgeting RP). I saw someone else had a very similar problem and was told to make a picture of a Poro enjoying the sun. I made my own version but am not seeing a way to upload. It is saved as a png. Is that possible to upload?\r\n\r\nThank you all for what you do and have a great day!\r\nMason M","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-17T18:38:21.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a poro drawing for me?  :D  Maybe I can help with this!

It really is nice to receive personalized drawings, the support team loves them and we enjoy giving back!  You might find that some poros added the RP to your account.  :D","replies":[{"poster":"Mason M","date":"2017-08-17T20:18:23.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you kindly!
