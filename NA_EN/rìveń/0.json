(Testing on PBE is better than testing in-house 'cause it's a cooked build, and more similar to what we would push to live) Based on that, we were fairly confident that this issue would be resolved. \n\nHowever, that doesn't appear to be the case.  (Obviously.)\n\nFrom what I understand, we will be making a post in Help & Support soon, looking for more information from you guys to help us figure out what the heck is going on.
