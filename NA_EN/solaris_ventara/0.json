I'm not sure if this was an over site by the devs, a bug, or what, but this makes me a bit concerned, both for myself and for those who want/need to mute toxic players from their games. Has anyone else had this issue or is it just my copy of the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T19:52:34.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I see it's possible to block someone on your friend's list, I don't see a method to do so on the post-game screen or view your block list.  Can you right click on that summoner's name, and get a list of options?  I recommend posting about this on the [client ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion)boards.  My guess is that it's not ready for testing just yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Solaris Ventara","date":"2016-11-18T20:08:13.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried every which way to find a block option. while in the old client you could right click the toxic summoners image to block, in the new one this isn't the case. right clicking does nothing and left clicking only brings up the options to add as a friend, honor, and of course the report option. as for viewing a block list, thats in the clients configure bar at the top right, however theres no way to add a name to the list from there either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Downeyjones","date":"2016-11-19T18:33:13.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I was noticing the same thing.
