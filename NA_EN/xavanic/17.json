steal AD, but not AP?!? like, his entire kit is AP but he cant steal any of it, but AD literally only scales on his AA's....even if it's just his Q, give him SOME AD or let him convert the stolen AD into AP\nBefore you say oh they need to nerf him first, sit down and take a look at his kit, compared to most juggernauts, morde is much weaker then any of the other ones we currently have, additionally ap bruiser itemization for manaless ap is actually garbage rn, bruiser items such as RoA or iceborn are extremely bad investments due to how many wasted stats you

limited, he cant get away with any sheen items due his options being so cost inefficient even though it feels like thats what they wanted with him, he can't build any of the good bruiser items since their all AD, he's forced into {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3157}} if he wants to be useful, meanwhile poppy has {{item:3078}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3161}} just for offensive options...hell morde can't even effectively use {{item:3001}} or {{item:3027}} 2 of the best ap brusier items simply because he doesn't have mana, ap itemization is fine, but not for manaless champs, morde feels very awkward to build rn and completely reliant on snowballing","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Luther King Jr

over in addition to main damage spells and passive.\ni don't know what world you live in but morde has probably the single strongest sustained magic damage of any ap/magic damage dealing champ in the

just 3 days, and i doubt its gonna stop dropping, morde BARELY aa's, and even then, 40% ap out of 200....thats 80 extra dmg....thats weak as shit, when darius literally does 200+ on a single AA, mordes passive doesn't even do as much dmg as it seems to say, im not asking for a 200% AD ratio on Q, just enough that it can justify going more then fucking rylais first item every game, morde is gonna drop to around a 48% win rate by next week guaranteed (hell his win rate has dropped by .2% in the past hour) it's just the fact people are still stupid enough to feed him early game, he's not in a good spot, he's just really snowbally and once the shock value wears off....well he won't even have that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-16T04:40:09.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luther King Jr
