That said, keep playing him. You will start losing. That is an extremely small sample size. Last season, I won 16 Maokai Top games in a row only to lose 10 in a row right after without altering my strategy at all. This season, I have a 100% win rate on Singed out of 13 games on another account. It doesn't mean anything. \n\nYour argument would feel a lot more impactful if you had a 60%+ win rate out of 100 or more games in Grandmaster/Challenger. Keep playing Amumu and come back with the results after you have played 100 games.\n\nKeep in mind there is a big fucking difference between \"Tank Junglers\" and Amumu no matter what your results are. There are only 2 Tanks in the top 10, 4 Tanks in the Top 20, and 5 Tanks in the Top 40. There are 5 Fighters in the Top 10 alone.................... 9 Fighters in the Top 20........... 13 Fighters in the Top 30................   20 in the Top 40\n\nThere are even more Mages in the Jungle right now than there are Tanks. If you wanted to point toward one role that is the strongest though, then that is objectively Fighters. They dominate multiple roles right now and have for wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too long at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2019-06-07T22:17:13.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pandemic Punch,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZmkhkY9G,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2019-06-07T21:55:42.316+0000)\n>\n> You aren't playing \"Tank Junglers\", you are playing Amumu in a low elo.

As predicted in my original post. You haven't won a single game on a Tank Jungler since making this thread.\n\nTrust me, our elo's are still low elo. If you want to prove your original point, you MUST have a much much larger sample size. At our elo's, anything below an 80% win rate is not impressive. 60% can be GOOD, but NOT impressive.
