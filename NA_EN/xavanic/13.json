We've had tank Yasuo, tank Ekko, tank Fizz and even tank Akali, to name but a few, and the issue has always been the same: squishy champions can negate a core weakness through tanky itemization, and make such good use of those items that they become seriously unhealthy. Soraka is no different, and the fact that the most powerful regen in the game is based off of raw health, rather than health regeneration, means she gets to sidestep her core weakness (low hp5) and get the most out of her healing by playing passively.\n\nI agree that Soraka is not in a great spot either, though, and I think some of her balance changes made her worse overall. Her Rejuvenation mechanic, especially, carries tremendously low-visibility power, and rewards Soraka mostly for playing passively, since using it in-combat \"wastes\" some of the regen. She's also a bit too good at just staying back and poking from a distance, which makes her more difficult to reach than is necessary. Here's my dream changelist for her:\n\n* **Remove Rejuvenation:** It's not a good mechanic, and the HoT on top of the W heal makes for healing with no downtime that isn't all that easy to gauge. Reverting back to Soraka's instant self-heal, but making it scale with **base** health, rather than flat values and AP (i.e. health **without** bonuses from itemization) would make it easier to recognize.\n* **Remove her basic ability damage, reduce her basic ability ranges, maybe give her more AD:** Soraka should not be able to poke. In general, she should not be able to do anything unless she puts herself at risk, so forcing her to put herself in basic attack range to lay down threat means she wouldn't be able to hang back in lane and be useful at the same time.\n* **Change her innate to make her healing increase with missing health, adjust her healing accordingly:** Soraka's current passive is at least fun to know about (she's an ambulance!), but in practice it often leads her to just use low health allies to zip away from fights. More than any other healer, Soraka also feels really irritating to play against when she gets to negate all of an opponent's damage all the time, and so her healing should be weak when engaging in poke wars, but should be stronger when she or her target is on the verge of death.\n* **Make her W healing scale with her target's max health, and not flat values:** One of the issues with her W healing is that it ramps up way too quickly in lane, allowing Soraka to heal for huge flat amounts and negate too much damage, but then stays at around those same values for the rest of the game. A target max health scaling would a) allow Soraka to heal tanks at lot better, and thereby encourage her to put herself closer to the front of combat, and b) allow her healing to scale naturally over time without ever ending up too low or too high at any given point.\n\nAfter all this, mayyybe she could even afford to be a manaless champion (she'd have so many other gates and restrictions to her power that mana wouldn't be necessary in holding her back), but the same could likely be said for many other supports, which would involve a class-wide rework. The **TL;DR** to all this is that Soraka should really be forced to stay within combat range of her opponents in order to be useful at all, and only then could she be allowed to have the powerful healing engine she was promised with her rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2016-12-28T04:11:11.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I have always thought she deserved is to have a similar system to taric heal, where it builds up as she leaves it, and spamming it makes it almost non exisitant","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-12-24T17:30:41.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why league (and castle seiges) have problems with healers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-12-24T14:40:24.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just going to reiterate some thoughts I had from two weeks ago about sustain.\n\nSpecifically in botlane. People usually consider Soraka toxic for the reasons I mentioned above.\n\nIf too strong she creates a passive environment where she controls aggro in the lane. If her ADC is aggro, they can run over their opponents with Soraka staying behind to keep them topped off. If she has a farm ADC then she can make sure that they essentially never die, especially if that ADC is slippery like Ezreal.\n\nHowever, not everybody wants a high octane botlane full of fighting. These people (and people who abuse the fact that her opponents want to go aggro regardless of Raka's presence) play Soraka for various reasons, however her dedicated mains simply love her playstyle, and I wouldn't want to deprive them of their favorite champion just because some people don't like her healing. I agree she should be balanced however, and she definitely isn't strong unless she's in the right hands. However a lot of her strength is played up simply because everybody seems to want to fight, and this is what she punishes the most.\n\nLeague is a objective focused game, not a kill focused one. Games can be won without a single drop of blood being shed.\n\nNote that I play and do enjoy Soraka as a champion and for art/story reasons.\n\nBut in many instances people are bloodthirsty. They want their kdas padded. Raka denies or at the least makes it difficult. This is one reason why many people call her toxic.\n\nBut remember that getting stomped in a game doesn't mean the offending champ is op. More likely you didn't have the tools to shut her down.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2016-12-24T16:12:03.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is she also allows her bot lane to be one of the most bloodthirsty fucks with little to no backlash as they will ALWAYS win the trade, meaning she has now pushed you under your tower will the enemy adc last hits in the middle of the lane, meaning now there is nearly a 15-30 cs difference that will continue to grow as soraka zones bot, and with decent warding most junglers cant even gank them, as it currently stands there is no healthy way for soraka to exist in this game with her current kit","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-12-24T16:57:30.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your concerns, and I honestly thought I put counter strategems in my post, but I guess not lol.
