Being sensitive to pings means that he's actually actively listening to his team and taking their feedback. When someone abuses that and you have no way of preventing that one person while allowing the other 3 members of your team to ping and communicate, it gets annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-18T21:19:09.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, i forget most of the league community are passive-aggressive brats.\n\nHow does a brat with no control, who tilts himself enough to cry on the forums make him \"more suitable\" for multiplayer?\nPing volume, it is a setting that can be used.

At no point does he do anything to indicate that he's a \"brat with no control\" as unlike you he's not name calling any of the other players.\n\nPing volume is indeed a setting that can be used; however the point of it is that you shouldn't have to lose on the communication benefit with the 3 other players using pings correctly just to cover for the one person that's messing up. It's for the same reason that you are able to mute one player vs. your entire team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ReadyxPlayerxOne","date":"2016-11-17T21:03:11.115+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WaYBkIrc,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-17T20:49:44.658+0000)\n>\n> Why on earth would this bother you.\n> \n> If this bothers you, you should not be playing multiplayer games, because you have way bigger issues to deal with than people spamming pings..\n\nYeah... it's something wrong with me that I'm bothered by someone spamming a really annoying sound in my ear for half the game.\n\nGOOD CALL BUDDY!!!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-11-17T22:02:36.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"people have been punished here for ping spamming  (as a griefing method) before.\n\nSeen red smites on them on this very boards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-11-17T20:46:53.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is, though I've only seen one case on the boards of a player being banned for it.
