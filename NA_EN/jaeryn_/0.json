I think being able to take the helm off in a situation like this is some sort of relief to the champion(player) because it's a way to know that they're winning and the hood is not necessary to be on. (just an overstretched thought)\n\nIt does make the legendary more unique in that aspect, but why wouldn't it? It'll be the first skin to have an automatic toggle of course it is unique.\n\nThen again, it is also a matter of opinion whether it is a good thing or bad thing, but it seems that majority of the community aren't really too fond of it.

(Not sure if there's a delay on Vi or Rengar 'cause they're hooked up to /taunt). If we did it how we did the most recent toggle (DJ Sona), it's likely we'd implement a delay, so you aren't toggling in the middle of a team fight. :P\n\n> But doesn't matter. For this skin in particular, with many people's concern, I think Riot should at least create a POLL on this to see what the community thinks whether it should be a manual toggle or automatic toggle?\n\nIt's a bit too late for this particular skin, as she's nearly about to unlock and become available. I do think this is an interesting conversation we can have, and something we could accommodate. I mean, we have done polls in the past for picking a champion who'd be either fire or ice themed based on All Star! \n\n> I just find the idea dumb like if I'm losing in this particular game, my hood will ALWAYS BE OFF because i'd most likely be in range of a allied structure vs. if I'm pushing constantly my hood will always be on because I'd be away.\n\nThat's fair feedback. That said, each game will be different, and there will be instances where you have it always on, always off, or a mix, depending on how your games go. \n\n> Then again, it is also a matter of opinion whether it is a good thing or bad thing, but it seems that majority of the community aren't really too fond of it. Some just don't care enough to complain because the skin it self looks good.\n\nTo play devil's advocate here, a lot of people who are content with something won't go out of their way to talk about it, resulting a lot of times in a loud minority. Don't get me wrong, I have seen a fair chunk of feedback about the toggle and how a manual toggle was preferred. \n\n> I just think since I am paying for this skin, along with everyone else we should be able to voice our opinion to Riot where they respectfully consider what we're addressing instead of saying \"We have no plans on making that happen\"\n\nYou're absolutely encouraged to voice your opinion! We do have discussions around the feedback given for every single skin. Myself and other QA folks actually compile feedback into emails and we have face to face discussions about the changes players have suggested. \n\nIn some cases, we do agree something is the right call - adding a jade dragon tattoo to Firecracker Jinx, for example.  I think a better case of listening to feedback would be taking back the SKT skins and making changes to all of them, making a new ADC skin, and adding Azir!  In other cases, we disagree and do not make a change. We do hear you guys out every patch, though. \n\n> I really do hope that the delay of the skins is revolving around this matter. But I also did hear that they're improving Kat's skin hence the delay. I don't know.\n\nThere wasn't a delay - the skins weren't scheduled to come out until later this patch. Content doesn't always unlock at the beginning of a patch. No additional changes were made to Ashe or Kat after the current patch went live. \n\nWe [did make changes to Kat](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/8EiikEyI-project-katarina-activate-pbe-testing?comment=0023), suggested by players, while she was still in development.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaeryn ","date":"2016-08-01T23:45:49.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10 Response.
