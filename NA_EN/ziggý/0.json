What I mean by that, is this team will have scheduled practices, scrimmages, and tournaments! We will not be going all out, but simply putting in time and effort to become a great team and hopefully climb the ladders and win some tournaments. This is a team mainly for the next season, but we will also be grinding until the end for those ward skins we all desperately want :D If you are interested in joining, please fill out the following and contact me via IGN: Italian Sauce and we can discuss scheduling and everything once we get a full roster. Please only fill out and reply if you are going to be committed and have teamwork. Here is the following information to fill out, and here is my information filled out as well.
