I guess some game modes will cater to people with different tastes. For example, someone who used to be a hardcore Dominion player will probably like Ascension more than URF. Just wait until next week, or better yet, pretend the mode isn't even there and play regular League like you normally do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tyrone Lannister","date":"2016-09-10T01:44:04.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cool","replies":[]}]}
