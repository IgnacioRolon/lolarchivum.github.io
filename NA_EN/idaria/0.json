For my SR placement matches  I lost 4 games due to rage quitters with 2 having double rage quitters. One had a afker and the rest were actually pretty good and yes I made some mistakes in all of them some were quite bad and hilarious. I've since lost several SR games due to ragers and rage quitters as well as bad team play including myself as well as the other team just flat outplaying us.\n\n\nFor TT ranked I've lost several games due to people either rage quitting or purposely throwing the game as well as a game recently where 1 person  quit then came back after almost 10 mins and said their parents wanted them to do homework and they got caught playing instead. They admitted they didn't think they'd get caught so they left again. Then to avoid Leaverbuster they kept joining and leaving and you have to wonder why isn't there a 1 week ban for crap like that, especially in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Crestwind","date":"2017-06-22T04:04:30.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they are ever gonna do anything more then they already are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-17T19:35:14.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Said this on a level 10 account because of possible backlash? lol","replies":[{"poster":"Idaria","date":"2017-06-17T19:38:17.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You never know. there are things that can be done that they seemingly wont do.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-17T19:38:48.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe so.","replies":[{"poster":"Crestwind","date":"2017-06-17T19:42:36.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be messed up for them to take action against a player who is fed up.

There are some legit cases but most are intentional. It just really hurts in ranked games. if you got a bad comp or connection you know already, and shouldn&#x27;t play ranked. if its ur first time playing a champ you prolly shouldn&#x27;t do it in ranked. Maybe making people have mastery lvl 5 or higher before u can use them in ranked would be good too. a lot of things can be avoided, what it really comes down to is respect and not many people have any.\n\nImagine that someone's kid is having an asthma attack, the kid's puffer ran out. The parent doesn't take the kid to the hospital because \"If she leaves the game, instant permaban.\" The kid either dies or suffers brain injuries due to lack of oxygen.\n\nSure, the parent would get into trouble.
