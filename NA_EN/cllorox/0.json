Would you mind providing me some more details about your situation?\n\nWhat mode do you experience this on? Are you playing solo or with others? If you select a different Bard skin (even just classic Bard) in Champ Select and then switch to a chroma, do you still experience this issue?\n\nHave you experienced this before? \n\nHave you tried patching your client already?\n\nThanks a bunch! Hopefully we can get this issue sorted out for you quickly. :]","replies":[{"poster":"Cllorox","date":"2015-11-29T15:23:58.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE!\n\nI just played a normal draft and successfully changed my chroma color to green. \n\nThe next game I played a team builder and selected gold, but when the game loaded up I was green instead of blue.\n\nSeems to have something to do with differences in normal selection and team builder. \n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cllorox","date":"2015-11-21T19:03:06.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LoveStrut, \n\nI've experienced this the most in team builder (gotta practice that Bard before the season starts!) and I can click on either green or gold, but when the game starts I'm always blue.
