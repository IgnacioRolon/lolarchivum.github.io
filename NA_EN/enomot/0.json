I tried logging on but couldnt for about half an hour. When I got on i found that my win is in my match history but my LP is still 11 on my profile. It was 11 before the win and having 11 LP after a win does not really make sense unless I had negative LP or absolutely garbage mmr. neither did i have.\r\n\r\ni got in touch with one of my teammates and they didn't gain LP either! also noticed that we didnt receive a letter grade after the game or xp.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T04:50:22.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might have happened from the small server issue we had earlier, but go ahead and reach out to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can see if there's anything we could do about that.","replies":[]}]}
