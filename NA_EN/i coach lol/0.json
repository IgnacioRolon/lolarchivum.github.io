So the first thing I did was relog so I could get back in without getting a leaver. But whenever I login and say reconnect all it keeps saying is: Network Failure Check network connection and try again. Even though I'm clearly on the internet and have access. Anyone ever run into this and how do I fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T23:55:57.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This typically happens if there are settings on your network that conflict with your client's ability to maintain a solid link to the servers. Usually, the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) are enough to resolve most of these issues, so I suggest starting there.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[]}]}
