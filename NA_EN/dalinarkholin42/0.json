Never done a board post before, but I figured it was worth a shot. So last night, I logged in for a game of ranked. Was back in series for Gold 5 and was feeling confident. I had, after all, almost hit gold 1 this season. I could do this right?\r\n\r\nWell, I lock in TF and we get into loading screen. I had some YouTube highlight vid playing in the background...I think it might’ve been the meme dream stream team in the TCS. Anyway. So I alt tab to turn it off as I don’t want to hear boosted bonobos when I’m trying to climb. And my computer completely freezes. Can’t use control alt delete. Can’t alt tab back in. I was stuck in the loading screen, with nobody’s load levels changing. So I waited for about 5 minutes until I was sure my team would’ve gotten a remake, then I restarted my computer. Then I repaired client, tried again. Same issue upon alt tabbing, but this time 4 minutes into game. I felt horrible having to leave my teammates, but I literally had no choice. This time after restarting I reinstalled. Same. Issue.\r\n\r\nI’m running league in full screen mode on an asus 8gb nvidia gforce 960 i7laptop. It’s not top of the line, but it has been able to handle league for forever.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this problem? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Victorious Nasus","date":"2017-11-20T00:26:31.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(I think) alt tab issues are caused by your window resolution, try doing it in window mode to test","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T03:31:23.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This. Running the game in fullscreen mode and alt+tabbing during the loading screen can interrupt the loading process causing the game to crash or just stop responding. The only reason we suggest just *not alt+tabbing on the loading screen* is to help prevent you from running into those crashes. It's best to take care of stuff like closing streams/youtube/etc before the match starts to load. Otherwise, try running the game in windowed mode where alt+tabs aren't as jarring for the program.","replies":[{"poster":"Foxtrot","date":"2017-11-20T20:04:12.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any way to fix this without going to windowed?
