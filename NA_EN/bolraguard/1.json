There are too many negatives, but we can discuss this if you want. Maybe you can find a better solution.\n\nA. Is a 9/0/12 toplaner good when you lose the game? \nAbsolutely not. He is the worst teammate. If he had 0 deaths and you were losing, it means he was not teamfighting at all. And yes he may have had pressure splitpushing potentially, but if your base is about to be taken you better believe he should be there fighting. \n\nB. Do you want teammates to just afk farm instead of trying to win?\nGrade largely comes down to cs. If you are losing a game in order to save your cs you just start farming waves and just stop fighting. Well guess what, now your team is almost guaranteed to lose. \n(There is farming waves in order to fight later, and then there is farming waves to just be afk).\n\nUltimately it means once you start losing the game, you stop trying to win and start trying to save your LP. Which is bad.\n\n---------\n\nI will say however. In low ELO, I think Riot can make a system where you never derank or lose LP.\nLp and rank are imaginary currency. They literally don't matter. It doesn't matter if there are 1000 S5 or 20 S5. So the system can be in place to help people climb, some faster than others but with less punishment for losing. Because losing is a normal thing. \n\nThis system would need a lot of tweking to be fair fun etc. But I think (other than I dislike participation prizes) it would just be a less stressful environment, which means more fun for more people. \nAnd higher ELO can continue to climb as current. \n\nIf anything the worst thing is people can't make fun of Bronze5 anymore if no one is bronze5. So it just turns into blanket low ELO. But people should just grow up.","replies":[{"poster":"Khâmul","date":"2017-09-30T05:35:32.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hé has  12 assists, he doesn't need to die if it's not his role","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-09-30T05:56:13.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are losing your base, it is pretty unlikely that you never die once.

Your carry over extends and if they die the game/ major objective is lost, so the tank/support dies to save whatever. thats already negative mark against said player.\n\nAnother example. A teammate is somewhat behind or whatever other reason and is splitpushing hard.  Said splitpusher draw multiple enemy members over to him but dies consistently, but his team get's something major for it every time, but his score is terrible, but in fact... he made everything possible. Your idea puts him in the dirt for actually carrying the game.\n\n\nIf you're going to make an idea to punish some players for some situations, actually look into every aspect not just a few chosen aspects.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cyrosi","date":"2017-09-30T13:40:14.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, grades are largely determined by CS. As someone who likes to play support, that means I don't get A rank or above unless I either never die as the ADC support, or our team comp is so bad that the ADC has to go help another lane that needs damage, not heals, and leaves me alone in bot. Or I'll get an S if I have to lane alone, play super safe, and get more kills than a support has a right to because the enemy in my lane is a moron that doesn't know when to recall, or underestimates turret range and feeds me. It's even worse if I had to start focusing on minions in the mid game, because even if I do everything else perfectly, that means I won't have lots of CS when the game is over, but didn't have the almost no CS that is required to be graded as a character that played a \"full support\" style to an ADC. \n\nBottom line, I'd rather play to win than have my gains be determined by subjective grading instead of weather or not I won that match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-09-30T04:38:09.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you learn what your end game score means and how it's calculated, then rethink about suggesting it be used like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Bolraguard","date":"2017-09-30T12:44:32.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And where do learn this?\nI put in a suggestion, weather you like it or not its my current thought so I put it out there.

So, for example, ***we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support**\". We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. ***It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position.*** The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\nSo if I want to make sure I gain LP with your suggestion, I should queue up as Tryndamere Support. Since so few players do it, and most who do are trolls looking to throw the game, I'll be in the top percentages. It doesn't matter than I'd be useless and probably costing us the game, I'd be climbing the ladder. Sorry that you played a standard ADC and tried to carry, you got a crappy score because I stole CS and didn't help you, so you lose more LP than me.\n\nIn short, champion mastery is **only** useful for comparing players on the same Champion in the same position. Trying to use it as a way to modify LP gains/losses will result in more trolls and a worse experience.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KVbqbFsC8e","date":"2017-09-30T05:39:13.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too logical.","replies":[]}]}
