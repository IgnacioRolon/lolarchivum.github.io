The blue essence refundal was great, however there went somethinng wrong with the runes and rune pages. Somewhere in season 6 i bought a rune page with rp and alot of runes, however i didnt got them refunded. I had 1600 BE before pre season that times 6,5 is 10.500 BE, the problem is now that i didn’t recieve any BE for my precious runes and rune pages, and there aren’t quests where i can recieve these things.\r\n\r\nFriendly regards,\r\n\r\nDarkHav0c","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T01:04:30.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune pages themselves weren't given a currency refund since you can still use all of the pages you bought in the new rune system. If you bought 2 pages for example, you'll still be able to create 2 new pages. You *did* however get some special skins based on how many pages you had bought. Double check your purchase history for those skins since they should be showing up there. If you still don't see them I should be able to check for ya.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkHav0c","date":"2017-11-13T20:19:41.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked at purchase history, (the place where you can refund etc.) but i didn’t find any skins i didn’t buy myself or unlocked with orange essence.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkHav0c","date":"2017-11-13T20:24:02.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkHav0c,realm=EUW,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=VBfshVsz,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-13T20:19:41.662+0000)\n>\n> I checked at purchase history, (the place where you can refund etc.) but i didn’t find any skins i didn’t buy myself or unlocked with orange essence.\n\nAnd i don’t have the same amount of rune pages i could create last season, i had 1 ap page 1ad page and 1 tank page, i don’t know if the prebuild rune pages make up for that or not though.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T21:13:32.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The prebuilt pages don't count towards your limit I'm pretty sure. I double checked to see when you bought those rune pages, because if they were bought after Sept 1st that would explain why they weren't refunded as a skin. I'm not actually seeing where you bought *any* rune pages, but it's obvious you have since you are able to create new pages. I'd suggest reaching out to the EU billing team in a ticket to have them see what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkHav0c","date":"2017-11-13T22:31:12.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can i reach out for them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-11-13T21:16:03.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can check his profile on Lolking.
