You'll find that all the new or updated stories do not mention the \"League\" or have champions being summoned.\n\nInstead, you'll find stories about people living their lives, facing their troubles, and not having a seemingly all powerful collection of mages adjudicating all disputes.\n\nIt was a _really_ rough transition though, and there were hard feelings that some players still harbor.

Massively increasing the amount of content and sustaining that over time would probably pull me back. But I just don't believe that is ever going to happen. We can ignore the merits of the old lore versus the new lore altogether - I just flat out don't think that Riot does a good job producing or is very interested in general in lore. Feel free to challenge me on this, but I don't believe it.\n\nThere are champs still, to this very day, only have the old lore that was retconned away, when the retcon was 3 full years ago. I can go into Jax's lore right now and read about him joining the League. Even champs that get lore rarely get updates - story lines are left hanging for years on end. \n\nWhen there is that rare update it can be in some format I have zero desire to read - I'm a Ziggs player but I don't want to read a comic. There goes my chance at Ziggs lore for a few years.\n\nEvents like the Harrowing are dropped in order to \"expand narrative possibilities\" or something but are just left dropped.\n\nIt is up to players to collect what lore there is since the client still apparently can't handle incorporating anything meaningful. The short one line blurbs remain a bad joke. The single paragraphs that replaced them aren't much better.\n\nAll of this is compounded by years of coy statements and excuses from leaders in Narrative/Lore/WorldBuilding/whatever that frustrate and frankly piss me off to no end. \n\nI'm not some deep believer that the format of the old lore tying the game into the story is strictly superior to untying it. I liked having a lore-based point to the game but I was open to be convinced if Riot would take the retcon and *do* something with it. Except they haven't. I don't care about lore any more because I don't believe Riot cares about lore. Why should I invest in lore that isn't regularly updated, isn't well supported technically, and the Rioters in charge of either treat issues like a joke or dodge taking any responsibility? I'd truly and honestly like to hear your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Robertsmash","date":"2017-11-10T00:19:45.169+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're spot on, guy. I sometimes check Jax lore myself, just to see if the League is still there. Isn't that embarrassing? I wasn't necessarily against the retcon and was looking forward to the new lore- but it drips out at such an irregular cadence (or limited to the cadence of champ releases) that it's painful. It's sad that it's going to take a Swain VGU years after the retcon to (hopefully) give us a Noxus lore dump. Same with Ionia- nothing, except that vastaya don't like them. We're lucky Camille came out to give us the Piltover/Zaun stuff. I remember Jaredan's comments trying to calm people down during the retcon years ago saying \"give it time, it's coming\". And it largely hasn't. \n\nDoes the lore not exist yet? Is Riot just keeping it to release it with champs/VGUs? Why can't we access the lore and stories on Universe through the client, which had a perfect opportunity to acquire this feature during the LCU? And why on Earth hasn't someone just gone and done a general pass over all of the short champ lores to remove references of the League? That especially seems like a step 1 kind of thing to me; it blows my mind that even that hasn't been done. I could have done it myself in no time at all.\n\nRegional lore updates shouldn't be restricted to champ releases/VGUs; in fact, every region should have had a general update long ago. One thing that really gets me is that Sharjo once said that Riot has categories of lore ranging from \"players have known about this for years\" to **\"players won't know about this for years\"**. Why does that category even exist? What sort of ridiculous timing are they going for? What an odd, strange, and bad feeling release schedule. Not player friendly at all. It doesn't matter if Riot has crafted an amazing updated world if they just keep it hidden away.\n\n I defended the retcon and I was patient like Jaredan said. I'm not specifically blaming him, but here we are 3 years later and the champion release-tied lore and even the recent comics are nowhere near enough. Some weird shit is happening at Riot's Narrative department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2017-11-09T23:37:45.198+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey - I want to thank you for your reply, and apologize for not responding yet.

I’ve heard people say in the past that Riot isn’t interested in general in lore, and to be honest I think that those people have been right _for the most part_.  There _are_ Rioters for whom lore wasn’t important - their hearts were full of gameplay balance and esports and other such things.  Very important things, but not the sort of thing that you and I personally have a passion for.  (Not all Rioters, but many.)\n\nThe good news, is that after years of being beaten around the head with feedback from players and Rioters who _do_ give a damn about the story side of things, even the people whose interests don’t trend that way are realizing that we are leaving vast numbers of players unsatisfied.\n\nNow at this point, I wouldn’t blame you for going “Blah blah Bioluminescence - we’ve heard it all before.”  No really - I won’t blame you.  You have heard this before - possibly even for me - and I could go blue in the face trying to convince you that things are really changing (slowly) but all I can do is tell you something that I read today.  Literally at 3:38pm today, when I posted your response as a wakeup call to some of my teammates.  The response was that _YOUR_ post is essentially exactly what we have been told by some of our partners, some of the people who represent huge amounts of players, and who speak for their wants and needs.  Your post echoed what we’re hearing all over the world - players want (and deserve!) more.  More content, more core-IP stories and lore and other stuff.\n\nSo thank you, and thank all the other players who have spoken up over the years.  What I hear is that people are realizing that lore and stories don’t just magically happen without the whole studio understanding how important they are.  That the desire for ‘perfection’ (sorry Jhin) can become unhealthy and paralyzing, but that with the right support, we can all help spin up to a decent release rate.\n\nReady for the downer?  Yeah - so while teams are literally restructuring to make this happen, there’s always going to be a hang time.  Like, even if we decided tomorrow that we wanted to write a juicy novel and happened to have a writer with a pitch ready to go, it’d still be a few months before it was written.\n\nLastly, someone on my team responded asking if you’ve been checking the [Universe site for Jax’s lore](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/jax/)?  I know the League website is so [out of date](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/jax/) it’s shameful (there’s a small team who are putting their own time into trying to update it - I’ve volunteered to try to help however I can) the Universe site at least has the most up to date story content.  Ugh it feels so bad to have to apologize for our own official site being so out of date.\n\nOh, and I get how you feel about comics - I don’t read them in my spare time either (I forget to look at the pictures and get pissed that I read a whole ‘book’ with only a couple dozen words in it) but we were/are experimenting with new ways of getting story content to players via the channels that they prefer.  Some folks prefer comics - some short stories - some novels - some CG shorts - and lots of other things.\n\nIn the same way that you’re giving us feedback on what you want - give us feedback on how you want it.  For you - that’s ‘not comics’ - but if lots of people make clear the media _they_ want their stories via, then it helps take some of the guesswork out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Guardían","date":"2017-11-12T17:09:18.475+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think that the task that the narrative has at hand has grown beyond their capabilities, not in terms of skill but in terms of quantity. This is both a good and bad thing. Bad: because the few people working on lore at Riot right now can't supply us with the amount of lore we want Good: because there's SO much potential for future storytelling.\n\nHaving said that, I honestly think League of Legends as an intellectual property has the potential to be as big as Marvel is right now. In fact, I think the IP of League of Legends is more valuable than the game itself. You guys are sitting on top of a goldmine, but you don't have the resources to extract the gold yet. \n\nIt's somewhat of a shame but I don't really blame Riot since League of Legends grew WAY faster than anyone could've anticipated. \n\nThere's so much potential in for storytelling in LoL that I think the lore should be thought of as its own product rather than an accessory to the game. I think Riot needs to license their IP or create a subsidiary (or division) of Riot to **only** focus on stories. I can't see Riot fulfilling their potential otherwise, it's just to much for their current capacity. \n\nI do empathize with Riot though. They're in an unprecedented position. Very few intellectual properties in recent memory have grown so large in such a short amount of time. Moreover, no (or at most) very few video game IPs have expanded into film, TV or comics successfully. Furthermore, League is still updating and new characters are always being introduced.\n\nIn essence, it's frustrating for the fans, I'm sure it frustrating for Riot, but on the bright side there's SO much potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2017-11-10T06:07:44.595+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for getting back to me with such a detailed response, I very much appreciate it.\n\nI absolutely believe there are plenty of individual Rioters, yourself I think arguably foremost among them, that have a great passion and enthusiasm for lore. Lore just hasn’t received formal investment from Riot as an organization, as you said. Lore can’t just be an afterthought or this separate thing put to the side if it’s going to be done right - it needs to be tied into everything - from the creation of new champions and the reworks of old to planning out the technical capabilities of the client. Lore doesn’t have to be for everyone, but if it is going to be done well it requires full commitment. I do hope that Riot as an organization will make that commitment, because I do think there is so much great potential in Runeterra as a world and all of the champions that inhabit it. I’m personally just not willing to get invested in the lore again right now. If things do change and improve, then I’ll give it another go, but until that point I’ll stay on the sidelines.\n\nRegarding Jax’s stories and the Universe site, I can’t help but jump back to Riot as an organization not being committed to investing in lore. Riot could have fantastic writers, artists, etc building out the lore but I truly don’t think it matters unless it’s all in the client. Jumping off into a website has always felt really odd, like a big gulf between the lore as a weird little side project and the game. I fully believe more people would be interested in the lore if it were on the client in a large-scale way. The website is wildly out of date in so many areas, not just lore, but what really is the point of maintaining anything more than a bare bones website when the client exists? Its mostly duplicating work. The client will always be the priority because that’s where the game is played. So the client is where the lore needs to be. And if the client can’t handle the lore, that should be treated like a major problem, not an afterthought like was shown with getting even the current client updated to handle more than a sentence.\n\nI like to read a lot in general. For a world like League’s, I would say that a serial novel type format is what I would want the most, along with standalone short stories. Not looking for huge long form work, but stories big enough to be broken apart over time. More than one serialization going at a time would be good as well. I would rather get a chapter a month for 8 months than everything all at once after an 8 month wait, which to be topical mirrors the current problems with the change from IP gains after every match to a lump of BE all at once after a long grind. Regular, frequent, smaller installments of lore are a lot better than unpredictable, infrequent, large chunks of lore. That would also go a long way in my mind towards building Riot’s credibility on lore.\n\nHopefully some of this was helpful. Happy to share my thoughts and I do wish you the best in convincing others in Riot to fully invest in lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2017-11-10T08:50:14.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I could make a suggestion as to content that may help. There are plenty of questions that the old lore didn't answer and have yet to be answered in the current lore. \n\nI believe if stuff like that were to get explained in new lore content, it would drastically improve peoples opinions of the lore, even if you are currently unable to release as much content as you wish too. \nI believe in a lot of these cases, the new lore has provided enough new questions that you could start answering the older stuff without people feeling like there is nothing left to talk about. \n\nFor example, I liked Wukong's new lore, but it razed more questions about how much power he really has, can he/ will he end up being able to make actual clones at some point and how much has he actually learned from Yi so far, without answering any of the older questions like does he still have contact with his tribe after meeting Yi, how involved is he in Ionia and some questions about his relation to certain champs listed on his friends that has gone unexplained for years.\nThat combination of unanswered questions on top of new questions left me feeling a bit unsatisfied, rather then just plain wanting more cause of the good story.\n\nEven if these kinds of older questions were answered in a paragraph, I think people would be very content by just getting those questions answered.
