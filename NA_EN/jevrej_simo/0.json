Why can't you pass on an account (one person stops playing and the other one takes his place), yes it should exclude grinded lvl30 accounts for sale but how much money does riot make from a player going from lvl1-30 I mean that player is replaced (the one that got the account to lvl30 with the one buying it) either way you can put a fee that the seller has to pay riot on the accounts for sale but that's another topic. So if a person stops playing the game or just doesn't want to play on that account anymore, why can't he just pass it on to somebody else. I mean at least in Serbia account sharing is very present (if a friends account is banned or suspended, wants to try out a champion, etc.) and I don't see a problem with it. If somebody would clarify why accounts that are passed on are \"bad\", and why is account sharing \"bad\". Im talking about and only about gifted accounts not bought accounts, gifted ones.","replies":[]}
