This is not just an action based game, it's also strategical, and champion select is a part of the match. You can lose from champion select.\n\nYou take extra cc vs things that are high risk/reward or rule based. (examples - Kat/Yasuo)\nYou take less cc in situations where you need the damage to take non risk/reward or non rule based targets.(examples - Mundo/Sej/Renek, you would need heavier damage output while having just enough cc to get by from other picks)\n\nWhen a champion has cc in their kit vs one that does not. The one that doesn't most likely has more damage. Liss vs Kat. Liss has less damage but more cc while Kat has a risk/reward kit with a much higher damage output potential.\n\nSo yes \"just cc x champion\" is a valid argument. They outplayed you in champion selection if you didn't pick lock down for Zed or Kat. If they picked it last then you played poorly in champion select because you knowingly made a comp weak to that type of kit with it still being a possible pick up.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-03-11T18:49:36.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Just CC the target is ignorant.\" \"Just CC the target is a valid argument.\" \n\n\"Hai guyz, I'm a Politician.

Zed and Katarina have to jump into the middle of an enemy team to get their damage off. Getting CCed in the middle of the enemy team is much worse then being CCed in the back line where the enemy team has to be able to burst through the front line to follow up quickly.","replies":[]}]}
