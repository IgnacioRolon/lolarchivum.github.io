(Spear didn't kill? Ok I just jump to you hope you have 2 flashes... o wait...)\n**The fourth** one is allowed to build one ad item and do tons of damage(560% ad ratio hurr durr oh I think it needs an additional 8% missing health in the end too just to be fair) because he \"landed his one *skillshot*\". Brilliant. \n**The fifth** one I'm scared that my unburrow might bug on a cc and just become a sitting duck for next 5 seconds as for whatever reason I'm just not allowed to move or unburrow. But that doesn't matter because all you have to do is smash your dick on the keyboard and you pentakill anyways.\n\n*Meanwhile anything else I pick I'm playing hunger games in the dark with the enemy jungler praying to god they don't get me first. I totally enjoy doing 2-3 camps and a scuttle then being like \"Holy fuck I survived wolves\" or \"I'll think about doing raptors 15 minutes in the game\".\n*\n\nOh and if I'm not picking one of those 5 god forbid an ally wants my help and is behind(Inb4 report jungler for no ganks). I'd love to try and gank your lane as I'm level 4 and the guy I have to help kill is level 7. YAY.\n\nI just don't understand the point of these jungle changes IMO. But hey \"Muh Diversity\". Tbh these junglers aren't outclassing the other ones. The other ones have to play hunger games is the issue.(Raptors should start laning they can probably get to Challenger at how strong they are)\n\nTL:DR Fuck the jungle, probably going to quit it at this rate and go learn some lanes.\n\nEdit - Alright people seem to think that I mean \"no one else\" can jungle. Sure stuff like {{champion:9}}  and {{champion:113}}  can jungle perfectly fine but what you are missing is that they have EXTREMELY EASY to abuse weaknesses. You can't tell me that Sej is as viable as jarvan at every moment of the game. No, she is very weak at certain points and has a horrible first clear. Yes you \"can\" do well with others. I mean I do well with kha all the time. But the issue is that those top 5 have none of those weaknesses(Except maybe nid, she has some). Why play something with weaknesses when you can just pick J4 and do EVERYTHING perfectly easy. His only weakness is the player using him(hue).","replies":[{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-02-27T01:22:52.300+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":77,"body":"Fiddle, Nocturne, Jax, Yi, Panth, Rengar, Shaco, and Udyr work fine too, that's 13 good junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Poptart Evelynn","date":"2015-02-27T01:23:37.300+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsugaga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HaNP1Mci,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-27T01:22:52.300+0000)\n>\n> Fiddle, Nocturne, Jax, Yi, Panth, Rengar, Shaco, and Udyr work fine too, that's 13 good junglers.\n\nI can't tell if you're serious or just talking about bronze/normals.\n\n\"Checks history, ALL VI HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OMFG MY SIDES\"\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Tsugaga\n\n(Not intending this to be rude btw, just is funny)","replies":[{"poster":"Tsugaga","date":"2015-02-27T01:39:11.424+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":49,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rawr Poptart Cat,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HaNP1Mci,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-27T01:23:37.300+0000)\n>\n> I can't tell if you're serious or just talking about bronze/normals.\n> \n> \"Checks history, ALL VI HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OMFG MY SIDES\"\n> http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Tsugaga\n\nSo?

Have a look at this:  \n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/charts?region=all&type=jungle-matchup&range=monthly&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=ranked\n\nThe ONLY champ doing as well as Lee Sin is Pantheon.  He matches up favorably against both Jarvan and Vi... and for the same reason Lee Sin is dominating that chart:  early pressure.  They can't duel Panth because of his Aegis, and he has strong early ganks with a point and click stun.  However, he falls hard to Lee Sin because he is less useful late.  So why bother picking Pantheon if you can pick Lee Sin instead?  You might say, \"Oh, well he does well, so if the enemy picks Lee Sin, pick him.\"  Except he fails miserably against Lee Sin.\n\nFiddle does poorly against both Rek'sai and Lee Sin, so you better ban those out if you want to play him.  He also does poorly if the opponent has even the slightest amount of vision.  He is easy to shut down, which is why, if you limit the chart to the upper brackets, he does even worse.\n\nNocturne has a very poor clear, was largely screwed by the fear changes, and generally does what Vi does, but not nearly as well.  Jax needs farm, both gold and exp, and does not get that in the jungle, further delaying the late game that is his bread and butter.  Yi, like Fiddle, only shows up in the lower brackets, because he is too easy to CC and focus.  Rengar is a difficult early clear, Shaco has a poor late game, and Udyr is easily kited.\n\nGranted, not all of them have problems that are related to just the jungle being what it is this season, but the stats don't lie.  Lee Sin and Vi are absolutely crowding out other junglers who have similar strengths, but are simply not strong enough.  All of the top four are generalists that can contribute everywhere they go during the entire game.  A huge part of this is what Foxdrop and Stonewall alluded to:  the jungle is simply too difficult for some champs early on.  They fail to contribute early because they aren't healthy enough for ganks compared to the big four, they fail to farm effectively in the jungle and are punished for using Trailblazer to farm better, and they are unable to remain relevant in the late game, either because their kit isn't suited to it or because they were completely outclassed the rest of the game by one of the top four junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"St3AmR0lleR","date":"2015-02-27T17:08:33.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are reading the chart wrong, the bottom of the chart shows the champion and the left side is their opponent.

How many people are going to assume that the champs I feel like practicing and like have any relevance at all? I do NOT pay attention to meta, or win rates, or who's top tier, or who pro players use, I simply play champs that I think are cool and fun. I play 100% for my own enjoyment and love for League, nothing else. The fact the Vi is in a good spot right now and that I have only been playing her is 100% coincidence. I play champs to learn them, which is why I play the same champ for 250+ games in a row. I've done the same exact thing with all my other favorite champs. Understand?

While there are only those ones you can use, even in normals no one wants to play jungle in normals because if they're stuck with those they might as well just say \"fill\" in ranked.\n\nYou did bring up a good point (well, your lack of stating it was a good point).\nThat is, that it's not the ability to gank from their kit that the other junglers are missing. What they're being denied is the ability to clear the damned jungle to even have the EXP and HP to help ina  timely manner. \nEvery assassin has to recall after one side. Maybe even before the wolves/raptors. Some of the tanks, as well. They're overthinking all their balance changes. It's not that Evelynn, Elise, Kha'zix, Nocturne, Rengar, etc. need buffs for their ganks, they just need to be able to clear camps with enough health to not walk in and die when they're trying to help.\n\nThis could easily be accomplished by giving every weak jungler an extra passive to have more defense or healing from monsters.

(\n\nThis could be accomplished by returning back to S4 jungle. S4 jungle was perfect: it allowed every single champion in the game to jungle, clear and gank without dying in the progress. Yeah, maybe FF was overwhelming, but FF was less overwhelming than Vi/Jarvan/Lee are now. S4 jungle just needed some minor tweaks, but instead, RIOT destroyed the jungle and created a new one for apparently no reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeCKS Egai","date":"2015-02-27T11:12:16.458+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get why anyone would argue with the OP listed champs.  Now mind you, I've basically stuck to resetting first win of the day in co-op for at least a month now, but EVEN in co-op it's clear how dramatically the jungle has changed.\n\nBefore the jungle changes, I remember watching folks in co-op typically only get into trouble running jungle because they lacked a decent rune page and/or were underlevel - but even on a smurf you could run particular junglers and manage thanks to their inherent sustain.\n\nNow keep in mind, I'm talking just about co-op where there's no counter-jungle factor.  Not only is the jungle dramatically rougher than season 4, you get all of 2 pots with your machete now.  It be one thing if it was the s4 jungle losing two pots, but s5 jungle camps are notably harsher as is.\n\nI think a lot of my interest waned when the new jungle took hold.  I lost count of how many newer players I saw struggle with just basic camps before the changes.  While it was nice to see less pressure from the jungle initially, it was pretty clear to me it wasn't going to be long till a few key junglers took center stage once again.\n\nFor example, lee is the only champ that comes to mind that has never been truly 'gutted' despite his popularity after all this time.  I think a lot of us simply write that off as him getting a free pass because he can make some impressive looking plays for those major tourneys.  \n\nHowever, even ignoring pvp entirely it's pretty clear that very few can make it now.  I mean, when you consider in a co-op all a jungler has to deal with is really the jungle without outside interference, it's too common for even a co-op jungler to fall behind.  That alone should be pretty indicative that the new jungle has done more harm than good - God forbid he or she struggles to clear a few camps only to be invaded by enemy jungler in actual pvp.  \n\nI did find it odd how veigar somehow managed to rise to popularity enough to get some dramatic changes - while some of it was directly related to mid champ changes I'm pretty certain that the reduced pressure from jungle ganks finally allowed him to actually make it out of lane phase consistently well off.\n\nIn any case, for those of you willing to argue that wins can be had in jungle by other champs still, consider how consistent those wins are.  I mean olaf can still be in winning games...","replies":[]}]}
