Probably the 7th nerf I stopped playing him ( i can't count how many nerfs he got and I dont even want to know , i'll just get pissed) , when I saw the last one on PBE I just quitted playing with him as many others did. And then they release his new Skin because... riot's logic and greediness. Don't even get me started on the RP price increase, as if it's a fucking resource we buy anyway.\nHis last nerf, they increased  the W cooldown because people would evolve/max W first, because Q doesn't do anything anymore in a TF. I just ragequitted and after that nerf ( explaining how Kha is meant to be played because players started to play him in a different way , utility style) , and after that I learned something. Riot's balance team is TRASH.
