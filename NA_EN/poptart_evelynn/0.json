I'm not a buyer, but I am a bit confused why it's not included. I think the expectation was that buying the bundle meant getting all of the skins in that vein. \n\nAs far as I know we haven't seen many cases where there was a single new entry into an old series. We usually see two or three new entries into the series (Harrowing, Snowdown, Lunar Revel) and then have a year-by-year bundle rather than an exclusion of newer skins.\n\nI think it's just easier and more accessible as a consumer to be able to see a thematic bundle and assume all of the skins in that vein are included. Don't make me think about the purchase, because if you do there's a chance you'll lose the sale.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JaminBen","date":"2015-03-27T02:24:23.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Buyer here.

Although I don't mind having bought the other skins (yi was the only one I had left) I had the impression that Headhunter Akali was included.
