I'm not too sure if other people experience the same frustrating issue that I get punished for. My client will not crash during anything else and I'm just not sure if this is something I have to just suck up for the time being. If anything, I just want to know if I'm the only person who experiences this. I suppose i should avoid ranked for now..","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T21:07:46.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashes in champ select, especially in anything with a draft-pick mode, are generally caused by fluctuations in your connection that drop you from the game platform entirely. I recommend working through our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a first step in addressing this issue. \n\nLet me know if you noticed any changes after working through those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"lowfat yogurt","date":"2016-08-09T10:29:26.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying! It makes sense that it is a connection issue. I'm starting to think its my sister eating through our internet with the 6+ \"internet-eating\" programs she uses all at once, I'm going to get on her case about it (because who really needs that many open while playing Starbound). I haven't had a problem with her stuff up until now but I'm going to go through the guide first though, just to be sure. Thank you very much for your help!","replies":[]}]}]}
