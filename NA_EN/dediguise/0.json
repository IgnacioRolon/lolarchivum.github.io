With her mixed damage I can see the logic in offering some alternate build paths. It even opens up the option of using {{item:1402}} on her.

Is this an attempt to bring her back to being a potential laner, or are these ideas geared towards making her jungle more healthy?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-05-13T00:27:21.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not just kill the AP ratios altogether?

With Gunblade, all your on-hit damage (from Fervor, W and E) heals you for 15%, while incidential AoE damage (Sunfire Aura, W) heals you for 5%.\n\nI don't know if you already played back then, but in S2, after the rework of Twisted Treeline, Shyvana was one of the champions who broke the old Lord van Damm's Pillager - which gave just 15% Spellvamp. Gunblade now gives essentially 15% Lifesteal, 15% Spellvamp and 15% health back from on-hit effects.","replies":[]}]}
