Because of this, I cant pick bans nor pick a champ so I lose lp for that and have to wait. I waited the 5 minutes and it happened a second time so I had to quit out of the champ select screen. Now I have to wait 30 mins and ive gone from 84 to 71 lp because of this nonsense. Riot you really need to fix this bug.","replies":[{"poster":"broccoflauer","date":"2017-03-04T18:28:04.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seconded, although I simply get kicked out of queue over and over; whatever they were trying\nto accomplish by making a new client when this is what we get is beyond me. \nYes, I read all the flowery blubbergush, but fact is the\ngame hates the new client and the smallest tweak seems to have the potential to make it all unplayable!\nFrom day one, it's been inferior in any and all ways from what we had before.\n\nHate to rant but this really just came to a head for me.","replies":[]}]}
