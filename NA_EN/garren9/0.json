If I'm doing well with him I feel rewarded, if I'm getting stomped by one I feel outplayed or that I really fucked up. Vel'koz IMO IS THE most fair and balanced champ in this game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rusty Owl","date":"2017-03-28T01:04:10.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-03-28T02:44:15.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2017-03-28T02:42:45.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:4}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2017-03-28T01:11:31.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, I'll be the one to ask.\nDefine \"healthy?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":" Milla Jovovich","date":"2017-03-28T01:05:22.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:412}} \n\nLong cooldowns but strong effects.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-28T01:07:21.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"tbh most of the champions are in a healthy state most of the time.
