(5.15 was [TINY](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-515-notes#patch-champions) ))\nAKA burning tides. This patch was, imo, almost perfect. Black Market Brawlers, Butchers Bridge, Gangplank announcer. I loved Gangplank back then (dont play him like i used to anymore but i'll play him from time to time still) and his rework made me want to play him even more. Only real balance problem was Vayne and she was banned alot so it was possible to get around that.\n\nWe had almost none of the bullshit that ruins the game today. No Class updates that break the game for months at a time, no stupid game pacing changes that season 6 introduced and nearly made me quit, no tower 1st blood. Games weren't decided by 1 lane feeding. As long as 1 lane did well you still had chance to come back. It was just an overall better game back then.\n\n\nin 5.16 the juggernaut update came out. The game has sadly just gone downhill since then. As much as I love {{champion:420}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:163}} i would trade them for the chance to get back the game i once had so much passion for.","replies":[{"poster":"Diamond Key1","date":"2017-01-28T11:00:54.179+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the best choise.

[V1.0.0.150](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V1.0.0.150), October 25 2012. It was a solid patch in terms balance where there wasn't too much OP shit, it had a fair champion release with Elise, she was slightly weak but not incredibly so. There were a lot of good changes on 1.0.0.150 and very few bad and it was in the greatest season of League.\n\nHonourable mention to [V5.6](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/V5.6) for being the best patch outside of Season 2, It was an URF patch, which is a plus even if URF can get old quickly, more options are just better. It also had the funnest jungle meta I've ever played in. A lot of people don't agree with me on that one, but I personally enjoyed the Cinderhulk meta after the original outliers were toned down a touch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-01-28T09:38:42.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"3.14, back when this game was good.\n\nWe at least had Draft Pick back then.

No Camille or Tankko or Jhin (or Taliyah or Illaoi or Kindred or Aurelion or Kled or Ivern for that matter too). No keystones and no busted crit itemization.
