So when i opne the game up first, everything is ok. But than, when i click launch, it doesnt load up the log in screen! Thankfully, i kinda found the way around it.. I go to task menager, find LoLClient.exe, and end the process tree. Than i go again, and it works! I might have to do it 2, or 3 times. Can u pls fix this? Its rly bothering me..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T16:05:37.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might be having a security setting that's preventing the client from launching.
