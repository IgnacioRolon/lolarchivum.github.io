Ask they what you should do better next time, or apologize for you mistake. I do it all the time.  I lost lane last game, and admitted it. It was a relief for the team and it kept it in my mind to play smarter so I didn't throw the game.  If someone criticizes you, there is a problem, but if they are criticizing your play, don't take it personally. Nothing bad will come of admitting your mistakes and admitting them is how you overcome them.","replies":[]}
