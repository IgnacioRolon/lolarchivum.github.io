I open up the launcher and see tutorial, I click that, and it says servers are unavailable. Okay odd. Lets try battle training. Nope. Same. Lets try unranked. I get into queue. I click on 'Find game' and nothing happens. I wait. Exit, retry. On the fifth time It gets me into a game. I select my champion, game is starting in 3...2...1- Black screen. Client pops up and says \"Something broke\". I try to reconnect, Client crashes. I'm in a crash loop. I kill it and I try tutorial again. Nope. Nothing. And the game crashes me back to the Client.\r\n\r\nI did some snooping. My drivers are all up to date. I even tried the 'delete lockfile' bit. That didn't work. Any suggestions? I can't even get into a single game sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-03T20:56:36.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issues and black screen you're describing is usually caused by a connection problem that can't download assets or reach the game server.
