It may take a little back and forth, but that's only because they need to troubleshoot a little before they're able to figure out exactly what is causing this problem. \n\nAlso, our ticket system is set up to auto solve a ticket if there haven't been any responses in 3 days. What that means is, if you miss the response from them it could auto solve. With that being said, you can simply respond to the \"solved\" ticket and it will reopen it (I believe with the exact same agent). \n\nI know these kinds of things can be _**immensely**_ frustrating, especially if you feel like we aren't helping. But I really do appreciate you taking the time to give us another chance! Rest assured that, with enough time and effort, we will get you back in the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ChairmannMeoww","date":"2017-04-22T03:59:39.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this same thing happen in one of my series as well... only time... one word to describe this... suspicious.
