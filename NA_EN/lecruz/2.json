Though it can be very much a thing that can be contributed to my toaster, it could also be this simple fact: The client is just bad.\n\nWhat I am talking about is the unsually long patch time for patches that are 30MB or so big. Why does it take 10 to 15min. just to apply a patch of this small size? My buddies with quite up-to-date rigs also need alot of time for these tiny little updates. \nOther performance issues occur in champ select. I guess I am not the only one experiencing lags when pressing certain buttons, selecting champs and locking them in.\n\nIn game performance is on fleek, but the client needs real improvements. For a game that has such a big audience and has been out there for a decade, it is about time to give more love to the client, don't you think?\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2019-04-29T22:42:15.158+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree completely with you.

Bought myself a laptop with gtx 1050 + 7th gen core i7 Game was unplayable. Unreal framedrops - couldnt lock in a champ due to lag in client. So i had to buy a pc with gtx 1080 + i7 8086k just so league can run somewhat smoothly and i STILL get framedrops!!!!  When i first got it (2-3 months ago) game ran on 600 fps. Right now im happy if it can reach stable 300. Cause most of the time it CANT.  And the riot support said that it was an issue with my PC and not league itself xD","replies":[{"poster":"Pukkíe","date":"2019-04-30T14:18:51.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly that is what happened to me!
