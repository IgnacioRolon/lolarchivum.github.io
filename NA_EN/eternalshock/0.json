just to &quot;have fun&quot; in ranked solo queue\n\nhaving to work 3x as hard to carry someone that went 1-8 in laning phase but got carried and got to say &quot;gg easy&quot; at the end of the game as if he did anything whatsoever but be a dickhead towards his teammates.\n\n\nhaving to literally ask my team in champ select if they are playing new champs so i can ban the actual op champs instead of having to ban someone my jackass of a teammate wanted to ruin the game with.\n\n\nthank god i carried because if i lost this one i was most definitely going to join them and jst start trolling every game i play.\n\n\n\nenough of this shit riot.\n\n\nthe next champ select i get another 1st time xayah who i beg nto to play her and she says idgaf and picks eve adc\n\nhttp://prntscr.com/eyj36r\n\n\n\nthis is true solo queue.\n\nnot the bullshit silver \"positivity rules\" cancer that the mods spread around.","replies":[{"poster":"dakota
