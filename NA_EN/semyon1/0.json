It is not very convenient to go to the practice tool (or wikia) to find out from which writer the skills are being scaled. Now you can read only the description of abilities without numbers on the damage. Of course, the raw description of abilities in the client looks beautiful, but it does not give any information about the damage (and ratio).\nYou can also see detailed information on Wikia, but as for me, it is best to post this information immediately to the client.\n\nHere for example for client.\n\n>  Passive: Enemies explode when slain by Tristana&#039;s basic attacks, dealing 55/80/105/130/155 **_*~~(+25% AP)~~*_** Magic Damage to neardy enemies.\n>  \n>  Active: Place a bomb on an enemy or turret that explodes after 4 seconds, dealing 70/80/90/100/110 _***~~(+50/70/90/110/130% bonus AD)~~***_  **_*~~(+50% AP)~~*_** Physical Damage. Each attack and ability charges the bomb&#039;s damage by +30%.\n> \n>  At 4 charges, the bomb explodes immediately. The detonation radius is twice as large if used on a turret.\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/317922941205610531/537248833219067905/unknown.png\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/317922941205610531/537248448643334145/unknown.png\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/317922941205610531/537213370227490816/unknown.png","replies":[]}
