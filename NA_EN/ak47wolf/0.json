From what I&#039;ve heard, Riot&#039;s compensation is excellent. Do people not want employment at a game company to be the crowning achievement of their lives? I really am perplexed.\n\nI guess I&#039;m just amazed that some people have the means and the agency to just leave what might be the most secure/gainful employment in this industry in order to &quot;move on.&quot; Move on to what? Outside of like being offered an executive position at Blizzard I couldn&#039;t imagine what moving on would entail. Riot is the top of the tier - it seems more like a lateral move backwards (at best) and a descent otherwise.\n\nI admit. I&#039;m a minimum wage retail worker. I don&#039;t get it. I&#039;m jaded.","replies":[]}
