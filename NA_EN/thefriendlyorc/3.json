I like the rework but with so many dashes, jumps, blinks, leaps, etc. I feel like I should stop, why bother? Every time I use an ability, I'm dodged and danced around like a special needs kid by the likes of Kalista, Zed, Fizz, Lee, etc. etc. My question to the other Sion players out there, who play him with Noxus like dedication, why bother? Sell me on why I should keep playing my beloved top, or if I have to send another to the junk heap to join Singed, Mundo, or other top tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2015-02-19T04:40:10.311+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the new Sion. However, he is a hidden power and is extremely difficult to utilize well enough to be worth picking.  \n\nBy that, I mean his strengths lie in places that extend beyond his own skillset. Namely teamfights, especially in 5-man teams.  \nUnless your team makes proper use of Sion's new cherry-shattering CC onslaught, he won't be effective. His damage can be unsuspectingly high at times, but overall his burst is not all that great. His sustain damage is poor. His kit is not suited for dueling, cleaning up, and his split push is all too mediocre and risky.  \nHe can't even engage well against good opponents.  \n\nI suggest placing him in teams that rely on teamfighting to win, as I already said. Strong initiators like Amumu and Ashe work well with Sion. If your team's chemistry is particularly good, combining Sion with Nocturne creates a killer 1-2 ult combo.  \nSpoken another way, you can think of Sion as a CC amplifier. Like Yasuo, except much more difficult to use. Charge up your skills against champions who are already locked by CC to increase the landing chance and impact. Also, stay with teammates at all times, so that you don't get caught out (Sion is slow and can't duel!). To take that suggestion to the next level, I recommend going support so that you can be with your ADC even in the early game.  \n\nHere's a tutorial for Support Sion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isoV2Xdrqpk  \nAnd here's a good example of a Nocturne/Sion initiation combo: http://youtu.be/tveyldeuI_8?t=1m49s  \n\nSorry, I don't think he's all that great as a top laner. His E harass is a killer against 0-sustain tops like AD Fizz, but otherwise he's too easy to poke down. If you're fine with hugging tower and scraping by with just CS, then that's all good and dandy, I suppose.  \nThat said, I truly think Sion is currently best as a support (as wonky and unorthodox (and difficult) as his supporting is). I got to Plat V in solo queue with Support Sion during Season 4, if that means anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T04:44:44.044+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's fun, but in solo que with everyone playing Lee, Jarv, Fizz, LB, etc. It feels like a waste. I like that he is a CC amp but dear god do these constant mobility champs make it impossible without a full team coordination.","replies":[{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2015-02-19T04:50:18.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's hard. Sion is definitely not the best of solo-queue champs. I'm hoping some pro teams would use him, but then again he's too much of a risk to take in a high-stake game where full stability is preferred.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T04:59:14.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats pretty much my point. He's a high risk, moderate reward champion, who shines with aoe comps but gets absolutely devastated against the champions seen everywhere. Sure, I can kill a fizz top with my long range poke, but in the team fight phase I cant peel him off anyone because he's everywhere. A tank with full skill shot CC is a good idea on paper, but it falls flat against anyone with a blink.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OxBaker","date":"2015-02-21T19:03:00.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the rework and think they did a decent job overall in terms of functionality and balance but I just can't put my finger on why his performance is so team dependent. If the rest of your team does well then you'll do OK but if your team is behind there seems to be so little you can do to contribute to turning it around.\n\nI think that's why J4, Vi, Mao etc tend to be much more preferred. They have a real, consistent, reliable impact on the team and the matches outcome, where as Sion seems to just be more of a meatshield that gets carried to do well or poorly depending on how the rest of your team starts to snowball. I think that's what makes him always the second choice to other champs in solo queue. \n\nTL DR; What good is being supposedly \"unkillable\" if you can't have a noticeable affect on the games outcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-21T19:11:29.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets kited WAY too easily and has no ways to reliably lock people down so he can do his job.

Check my match histories, I ain't lying. To master a top lane Sion, you need to be precise about landing his E skillshot for slows & pokes. And also, land your Q after hitting an enemy with E to guarantee a successful Q hit, and also, place your Q a bit off of your enemy's escaping route to make it easier for your Q to hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T05:02:19.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm doing that, I'm talking more about the later phases of the game. Where people have cdr and are constantly moving around in every direction imaginable. In lane, I have no problems, he bullys like a beast, its when I get to team fights and objectives, when I have to save my carries that I feel useless. Assassins and other tanks and carries like Kalista dance circles around me and I feel as though there is nothing I can do at all.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-02-19T05:12:12.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no rush. Just take your time into landing a successful E when you landed one. Try insta-Q off to land a slow for your team to engage a little. It's best to land a full Q after you landed your ult on a couple of them, accompanied with E. It takes practice, but I'm sure you can make it.\n\nEven if your ult doesn't hit someone, cancel it early to make sure at least your halt slows surrounding enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-02-19T05:16:55.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the Ult is fun, I hated it at first but now I use it as quick charge in or on clumps of disorganized allies. I just feel that he lacks a lot of the tools, while having a much harder play style. I think they should give him a small MS buff to his W (when he starts charging it) or E (when he hits a champion) The cc he has is great, aoe oriented with fun mechanics, it just doesnt feel viable, ever.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WhereTheNamesAt","date":"2015-02-19T04:04:45.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one is gonna tell you actual reasons game wise why you should keep playing him.

Also, if you feel like people do really well against you while playing mobile champions, play stuff like TeamBuilder or regulars, people in Ranked sometimes only want champions that are going to win, and that can get boring.
