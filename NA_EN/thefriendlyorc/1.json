Why bother playing another mid when you could just press R.\n\nlooking at your recent match history you have only played Cassiopeia once recently, and you did go 2/7/1 while a Zed in the same match when 10/4/1.   I should note you are silver 4 and the Zed is Gold 2, so its likely he could have done about the same if the matchup was the other way around, especially as you don't appear to play Cassiopeia much.\n\nCassio's stun usually comes after she has at least 100 stacks, so if you stunned a Zed under  your turret you could have just QEEEWEEE before he could move again and healed while destroying him.  The fact that you claim he survived that and killed you makes me wonder if you know how to use Cassiopeia's abilities.\n\nI've faced worse situations on Cassiopeia and either survived, or taken someone with me.  (3v1 ganks when you know they are going to towerdive leaves you little opportunity to escape even when you hit your ult, especially when you want to save the turret if you can.)","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-03T20:44:47.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got my placements in silver literally yesterday.

I haven't had the misfortune of facing him as Cassiopeia.  I think the one time I ran into a Zed I was playing Diana, and I still had a hard time avoiding his seemingly constant spam of abilities.  (and I tend to try to stay behind minions at all times.)  I have taken Cassiopeia against Katarina and found that I could keep her away by using W to zone her from the minions and concentrating on last hitting while it was up.  It's inefficient and I don't get a great CS while doing it, but it kept Katarina from farming all that easily and kept her from trying to dive me.  It probably won't work quite as well on Zed because of his bloody shadow abilities, but that's all I can think of for the moment.\n\nthat and hope you have a jungler who can come gank early and often.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-04T03:15:02.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats honestly the biggest issue, when facing zed, the lane feels like its automatically 'out of my control' from the start, because you need to rely on your jungler to stop him in most cases, but as a jungler player, I know that mid ganks are sketchy at best, even without his 2 dash abilities to factor in.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mvargus","date":"2015-03-03T19:45:30.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Thefriendlyorc,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=K0LE8aZg,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-02T06:46:47.869+0000)\n>\n> Not hard.

No minions around to block tower shots, stunned for half the duration of his death mark.  Why bother playing another mid when you could just press R.\n\nI've faced Zed and I play Cass as my primary in mid.  Cass can take on Zed or Kat, but you have to be careful not to give him free opportunity to use his ult.\n\nMy best example would be a game where I took Cass against Katarina.  Its not exactly the same, but it was that short ranged burst caster relying on skillshots against a mobile cooldown only reliant assassin.  \n\nWe left the laning phase with neither of us having a clear advantage.  I kept her away and managed to hit enough poisons to force her to play careful and her mobility meant I couldn't pin her down to E her to death without putting myself into far too much danger of being ganked.\n\n----\nI'll be honest, I don't care for Zed as a champion.  He's exactly the type of flashy, overbearing creation that tends to reduce sportsmanship in a game because he's designed with a strong need to snowball which attracts the type of players who make natural bullies.  However, I have found that he's not impossible to defeat, just difficult.  I've even had a match recently where I ended up running into one in a teamfight and figured I was going to die, but threw all my abilities into the fight.  In the end I survived with a sliver of health left and was able to recall.  I even typed in all chat.  \"how did I survive?\" cause I had no clue why he didn't get me.  \n\nWas a nice feeling to walk away though.

I'm of the opinion that the reason Lissandra has come into her own popularity is she's effectively the most prominent 'anti zed' character around.\n\nI wasn't trying to say \"gg get gud\".  \n\nWhat I see a lot of in this forum is someone complaining.  \"I can't beat X champ\" and then demanding changes, but when you start asking questions you find that they either brought out a champ they don't know well, or were against someone who mains the champ they faced.  I've learned that experience on a champ matters.  And not just a little.  \n\nNow some champs can be picked up easy, but that doesn't mean you are an expert.  On champs I have played dozens of times I still find new tricks that can be played.  And that is significant.  If you don't play a champ often, especially one like Cassiopeia who is extremely reliant on good skillshots and then expert timing on use of her twin fang you end up at a huge disadvantage against someone who has a lot more experience and practice on the champ you face.  That's one thing so many people forget.  Zed is one of the easier champs to pickup, but if your opponent was tower diving you, he probably had quite a few game on the champ and knew the limits of what he could do.  That's why I wondered if he could have done well if the roles were reversed.  He clearly knew how powerful you were and knew he could take the hits.  That suggests he probably knew Cassiopeia as well as you did if not more.\n\nFunny thing is that is a huge part of why I come here.  I don't always face a champ, but reading the comments here gives me a good idea of what to expect when I do face a champ.  It gives me an opportunity to do some of the mental preparation before a match.  \n\nZed is a hard lane.  He's probably one of the worst to face mid-lane and it can be worse when you are elsewhere like jungle and your midlaner can't hold him off.   But my last experience like that was a teambuilder match where my group was helping break in a brand new player and he ended up taking his Garen to face Katarina midlane.  The funny thing was he held her off for over 10 minutes with only one death.  But he couldn't hold her in lane forever and eventually she started to feed.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-03T21:42:45.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plenty aware of Cass' strengths and weaknesses, the only thing I have issue with is the amount of tools a single character has.

Because I have to build mana items to actually lane against him, Zed had a brutalizer, giving him the sustained CDR to keep his W at a relatively low cd, it also gives him a TON more damage than a mana item as it gives none. So I'm already at a disadvantage despite gold advantage in my favor. Because I actually have a finite resource to mana beyond cds.

That said, if he's smart about ban phase he wont let you get a Lissandra on the map. The issue with Zed is that his weakness is 'you can just cc him' but it only matters if you do it within the 3 second window he gives you to counter him, and even THEN, as mentioned in this thread, it can sometimes not be enough. Other champs you can cc whenever you want, but Zed is like a single target Kat. 'You must interrupt me at this EXACT moment when I use my ult or I instagib you!' It just feels so one sided, even with characters designed to 'counter' his 'low range'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dyonas","date":"2015-03-02T07:39:35.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to hate Zed and still do to a degree because I could never do well against him. It felt like you've put it and that there was nowhere safe to go without being poked constantly then an ult and POP I'm dead. I'm not a great player, I have my moments but what I do know is that I started to fully understand him after playing him. His ult itself does very little damage and relies on damage done before the mark triggers. Since I found that out one of the first things I'll do if I don't have Zhonya's is get away from him when he appears after using ult. Champions with dashes can do it more easily but for others you may have to flash away. If you're playing an immobile champion mid you may want to consider always taking exhaust. You have less kill pressure in lane but the times you face Zed or Yasuo will make it worthwhile.\n\nOther ways to deal with him are pretty obvious. Cleanse summoner, QSS, Zhonya's or if you can stun him as he lands then the damage will be minimal. The really good Zed players will wait until you're already low on health, perhaps ","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-02T18:59:30.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just a frustrating lane unless you're Lissandra.
