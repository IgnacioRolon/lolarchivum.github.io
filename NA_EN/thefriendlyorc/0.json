With certain tanks, like Thresh, I understand the necessity, ranged attack, burst ability given the right parameters or builds. However, neither one of these champions are considered 'high burst' having mainly defensive kits focused around disruption and continuous damage. Is there a reason they have the old stat blocks of flat 30 MR?","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-22T22:54:19.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Along with Maokai, Shen and Singed historically worked very well with magic resistance and/or flat health items, which helped them a lot against casters. They also had pretty strong defensive abilities. This lowered their necessity for scaling magic resistance as compared to other tanks. Finally, Shen and Singed had more damage potential than most tanks (Maokai did not), even when building almost full tank, which necessitated lower stats. Those situations have changed slightly, so there isn't really any need for them to lack magic resistance per level. It's a valid option for buffing them if/when they need buffs. I'm not certain it's the best option, but it would be ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2014-12-23T15:54:10.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet characters like Mundo, known for doing great damage while still being near unkillable, have MR per level scaling? Singed doesnt do that much damage unless you build a lot of AP or a Rylandries combo, which lets you end up with a 30 MR at the 18th level. Shen and Singed only have two damaging abilities, while characters like Jarvan, Mundo, Zac, Amumu...etc. Have full sets of damaging kits while still being tanky AND having scaling MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-23T16:36:26.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo doesn't have any sort of pick potential. Singed and Shen could both start fights and/or CC opponents to secure easy kills. Mundo can't. 100% of his value lies in being tanky and doing damage. He does nothing else. Different kit requirement. Not completely comparable. Mundo also had high vulnerability to casters in the midgame because of how he lowered his own health, opening himself up to burst (he still has this weakness to a degree).\n\nSinged is also quite damaging. He may only have two damaging abilities, but they are both very strong, and he has a steroid. He won't instantly burst anyone, but he'll do significantly more damage over the course of a fight than a Jarvan or Zac will with similar damage items (Singed doesn't build full tank anyway). As for Shen, he has damage that increases as he fights, in his passive and its interaction with his shield. He is a pretty good dueling tank, and in the past before his nerfs and the removal of some of his strongest items, he used to be much better at it. Historically, people would never have picked an Amumu or J4 to do a Shen's job.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2014-12-23T19:53:34.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could easily refer to a Nautilus or a Vi. Both have pick potential, aoe damage and BOTH scale with MR. I can literally do this all day. Singed is hardly as tanky as a Rammus, Nautilus, Jarvan, Their pick potential is FAR greater than the two aforementioned champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2014-12-23T21:50:20.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi is recent, and was designed to be someone who built more damage (You'll note that there are no bruisers with non-scaling MR. Vi is a bruiser, through and through, not a tank). The recency is also an important point here. Non-scaling MR was a solution for a time when itemization was very different. You asked for a historical reason, not a reason for why the non-scaling MR exists right now. That's the only answer I'm currently attempting to provide. You do have to realize, all three of the tanks with non-scaling MR are very old. Non-standard MR scaling or values hasn't been used for a long time.\n\nAs for Nautilus and Rammus, they don't have anywhere near the damage potential of a Singed or Shen, and they are both very mediocre duelists/fighters. Again, different qualities. It's the specific combination that Shen and Singed had that made them a problem, not the individual qualities (Maokai was similar, but a bit different from the other two). In the past, I'd also put Singed as significantly tankier than Jarvan unless Jarvan builds pure tank, which was even more true back then because his anti-burst was pretty shit and he didn't really scale with the magic resistance items of the time. Jarvan was built as a metagolem (think off-tanky bruiser, particularly in Jarvan's case), not a pure tank, and his stats were based around that.\n\nIf you're trying to argue based on the current game, I'll repeat myself: giving them scaling MR would probably be fine if and when they need buffs. I'm not certain it's the best option for balance compared to other alternatives, but it wouldn't be bad. The reason they have those stats is because of the state of the game when they were designed, not because of the current state. It definitely isn't necessary nowadays.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2014-12-25T00:18:03.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I'm pretty much asking why they arent brought up to Par since 90% of the other tanks and even melee assassins have MR scaling. I'm a LONG time singed player and I love him to death but compared to some of the other tanks or even fighters, he cant really compare. So my small tweak to him would be to add his later game toughness against mages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
