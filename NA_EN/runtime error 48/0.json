I was really surprised since I most of the times never say a word, save for a \"GGWP\" after the game sometimes. So I stop saying even simple things like that most of the time. (Picture of email below) \r\nhttp://imgur.com/NVaQCWX\r\n\r\nThe 20th February I get another email saying that I get another chat restriction for 25 games. (Picture of email below) \r\nhttp://imgur.com/Zo2uR9f\r\n\r\nNow I was thinking, this is a joke. The amount of real \"toxic\" people I have played with who report me for no reason is actually getting ME punished?\r\n\r\nYesterday, I play 1 ranked game and after a game (we lost) I get the usual reports (I presume from them /all \"report nunu\" and the usual *losing the game rage, blame someone quick!*). \r\nThings that pissed them off: I built AP on support Nunu because our ADC was seriously lacking the ability to deal damage (started with attackspeed on Caitlyn, even though I was bloodboiling him 24/7) and the game was pretty much over anyway. Ended up dealing only ~300 damage less than him in the end...\r\nAnd here comes the best part, after the game I get this: http://imgur.com/1UKSJSc\r\n\r\nI got no new emails, but that is probably because they got NO WORDS at all to paste in the \"chat log\". Since I dont talk at all after my restrictions.\r\nThey say you should login to see the reform card that got you banned (after searching for clues on the internet), but all I get is a error and the above message when trying to play any games (i presume the error is because they have NO words at all to paste in this reform card = error).\r\n\r\nThoughts about this system?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** You actually can get banned from saying nothing and getting reported by raging kids enough times.\r\nI have never been banned before. And no I have not used hacks or anything like that. The ban is for being \"toxic\" by saying nothing.\r\n\r\n**My Profile:** http://tr.op.gg/summoner/userName=ll%20%20ll%20%20ll%20%20ll\r\n(I cant login on the TR boards for some reason so I try here on this other account)","replies":[{"poster":"Slumber Jack","date":"2016-03-03T21:37:51.397+0000","up_votes":135,"down_votes":10,"body":"What you're actually doing is consistently throwing games at the last minute or trolling by doing things like standing in base/towers and refusing to level up/use skills throughout the entire game (across multiple games).

Good idea. But I fear that the work is too much to be worth it for Riot. I mean, most of the times, people are actually getting banned for a reason.
