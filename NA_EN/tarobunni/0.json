I&#039;d love to see more interpretations of not only Champions, but also Items, Jungle monsters, Regions, Icons, etc. in the League Fan Art page. My specialties are landscapes, maps, and monsters. It&#039;s 100% related to League even if it&#039;s not focused on a specific Champion.\r\n\r\nI know you&#039;re all busy with other projects, so no rush.  But in the meantime, I&#039;m sorry that I&#039;m still labeling Mr. Dragon as &quot;Shyvana.&quot; I hope I don&#039;t make too much of a mess for your Discussion Board Mods.\r\n\r\nP.S. - I&#039;m sorry for submitting just a sketch, but I wanted to submit a progression of photos as my painting gets more detailed. As your rigging team probably knows, sometimes the framework gets lost in the skin texturing and external details. For me, I feel that it&#039;s just as important to see the progression as it is to see the final product.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-30T16:33:31.749+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey TaroBunni! \nI'll pass this along to the proper folks, thanks for the feedback! ^^\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"TaroBunni","date":"2018-05-01T08:44:05.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome! The Elder Dragon painting's still a WIP, but I'll keep sending in updates. I have a cool idea at the end that's going to add another $15-20 to my painting's production costs, but if I pull this off right, I think your team will get a kick out of it.\n\nIt's been a few months since I last painted, so I'm really stoked about this project.\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Soulstealer Nami","date":"2018-04-30T01:10:34.956+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Love this idea! Encouraging fanart of non-champion league content sound cool.
