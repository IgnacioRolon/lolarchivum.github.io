On the other hand, I see nothing wrong with showing your appreciation by making a post, even for old logins or other creations of riot. It often brings back good memories, introduces those who are new to the community of those great pieces, and shows riot examples of what we like and/or want more of. So by all means, post away.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2016-06-09T19:54:50.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite part is near 1:00 it gave me goosebumps it was so good","replies":[]}]}
