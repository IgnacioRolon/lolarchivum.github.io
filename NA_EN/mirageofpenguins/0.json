I know we&rsquo;re normally pretty silent about this type of thing (gotta keep our enemies in the dark), but seeing as how it&rsquo;s probably the 3rd largest salt mine I&rsquo;ve ever excavated, I figured we&rsquo;d give a little advanced notification.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;d also like to cunningly make use of everyone&rsquo;s eyeballs as a [reminder](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/articles/225266848) that we&rsquo;re definitely not into applications that provide measurable player advantage. The cheating we&rsquo;re targeting here is primarily comprised of modifications that take actions on your behalf (affectionately called scripting), and that&rsquo;s our least favorite type of mojo.  It&rsquo;s probably been said before, but this is meant to be a fair videogame and you shouldn&rsquo;t ever have to go digging for add-ons just to stay competitive.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve got a lot of work to do in preventing this behavior from occurring in the first place, but rest assured, the banhammer won&#039;t stop swinging until the message really sinks in.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - Bans for days.

Bugs are just unintended errors in programmed into the game, abusing something already in it isn't unlawful, or breaking any rules since you're literally just playing the game. Unlike scripting which is 3rd party and unnassociated with riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-09-17T04:11:22.867+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, Riot has punished players for intentionally exploiting bugs in the past. It's rare that they do it, but it has happened.\n\nNormally if there is a major bug that can give people a very major advantage, Riot disables whatever it is that involves the bug, whether it be a champion or an item. However, sometimes there is no way to do this without majorly affecting the game, such as if the bug involves multiple champions.\n\nThere are multiple examples of this, but the most notable example that pops into my mind is the case of the instant recall bug, something that allowed you to instantly recall. It was originally though that only Riven can do it, but very quickly it became known that pretty much every champion could execute it. Because Riot couldn't just disable every champion until it was fixed, they decided to just disable rank so no one's rank was affected by this while they were working on a solution. However, they warned us that anyone caught abusing the bug before it was fixed would be punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Viceroy Bolt","date":"2016-09-17T19:02:11.606+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"meanwhile in the land of double AA {{champion:157}} \n\nsometimes they fix it, sometimes it's two patch notes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jimmyyy","date":"2016-09-17T02:33:46.372+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a script though","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"horsa","date":"2016-09-17T00:36:14.256+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":1,"body":"The better your understanding of optimal micro positioning the easier it is to spot. The most common script I see in Korea is like dodge scripts. If you see a player instantly sidestep every single skillshot without fail even if it means moving them in a suboptimal direction that is probably scripting. If they're dodging things they don't need to or _shouldn't_ dodge it's probably cause they're scripting. Another key example of dodge script is if they sidestep even when they can't see you, and I think the sidestep should be instant. Another type of scripting that should be easy to spot is if they can auto cancel like a god i.e this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzW1oET3n-8 Scripters who have scripts to make their skillshots always hit are a little harder to spot.

We were a leblanc team and when we got into a fight with their team the one vel'koz had laid down his e and w exactly in the middle of the spot i was about to land on with my w, and i had only just pressed W. It was an incredibly quick and inhuman reaction time and it was perfectly positioned in the very center of where i was about to land. I had distorted back before the knockup hit me but i mentioned it to the team after the fight, a couple of them also thought the vel'koz was a bit fishy and as we kept playing the game i was noticing points where he would throw skillshots out like this as the game went on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darknessphantom","date":"2016-09-17T02:26:21.093+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":23,"body":"u cant take out cheaters when the huge problem is trollers and afks.
