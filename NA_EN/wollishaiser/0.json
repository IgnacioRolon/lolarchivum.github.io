BTW i am playing on a macbook pro retina.

I'm assuming this is regarding the 1/4 screen issue based on your details.  We're looking into this now, but we found that tapping Alt+Enter in-game can work as a workaround by taking you out of fullscreen mode.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SupaDutra30","date":"2017-05-03T20:48:52.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles, I need your help!!! I have the 1/4 screen problem and now i have a 20 min leave buster for 5 games for something i have no control over. I just want the leave buster off my account because i wasn't able to even play since i couldn't see pretty much the entire screen besides the top quarter of it.
