The best action to take right off the line is to update your system drivers off of the PC manufacturer's support site. If you can't find where to grab those drivers, please let me know the manufacturer of your PC and I'll link you the right place to grab drivers from.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"SSLinkzz","date":"2016-09-20T21:22:22.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are updated i did it like 2 days ago and i deleted the game and reinstall that many times","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T16:07:25.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll need to look at some logs and have you run some tests to look into this further.
