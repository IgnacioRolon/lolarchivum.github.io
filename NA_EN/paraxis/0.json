This issue occurs fairly rarely, but is essentially a situation in which the Game Server failed to communicate to the PvP.net Server that your match is officially over.  Typically, this issue resolves itself within a couple of hours.\n\nIf for whatever reason, you are still experiencing issues, please do not hesitate to let us know by creating a ticket to Player Support:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/tickets/new","replies":[{"poster":"Paraxis","date":"2013-09-27T02:27:41.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AH ok.
