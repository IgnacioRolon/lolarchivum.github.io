Before the update I could basically choose between Spellthief + Mana regen item for champs like Nami / Support item + 3 pots for things like Blitz / Support item + 1 potion + 1 control at start for zombie ward champs.\r\n\r\nNow all I can do is 2 pots at best, shunning down every other choice you had to start the game? My go to choice for Nami was Spellthief + mana regen item {{item:1004}} , since you had your sustain integrated to your kit, while you had better mana regen than the opposing supp, and needed less gold to get to Frostfang. You sacrifice some of the &quot;no mana heal&quot; the potion provides, but it was still a viable choice that kept my win rate as it was. Now you just can&#039;t do anything else than 2 pots. Well, except if I manage to buy supp item only, poke 3 times to get 30 gold and back to take the item to come back and help jg/bot. Which practically never happens.\r\n\r\nNow, I get that 3 pots is a little too much, but the same thing could have been done if the items were at 375 instead of 350, while still keeping other options viable for supps.\r\n\r\nOther supp mains or even other people, what do you think about these changes? Does it feel as restrictive as it is for me? Or are you not caring at all since you had only 1 build early on?","replies":[{"poster":"Salson","date":"2018-08-08T05:37:57.582+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well the main reason Supports are so oppressive is Ignite being too strong.\n\nThey nerfed pots, which were fine for ages, because they broke the meta they created by overbuffing Ignite.\nThat's a real wtf balance there.","replies":[{"poster":"BEK Makadur","date":"2018-08-08T09:50:53.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Not rly true...\nNot true at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Norglics","date":"2018-08-08T18:02:19.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is true , you as a supp better off with ignite than exhaust now","replies":[{"poster":"Tokogawaruf","date":"2018-08-08T19:19:30.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why use heal, shield or CC when you can Point-n-Click halflife the Enemy instead with True damage, setting up an easy kill.\n\nDeath is still a rather effective sort of CC","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TitanAnteus","date":"2018-08-07T23:41:57.838+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":16,"body":"3 pots is too much and makes early botlane trades worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Makimoke","date":"2018-08-08T00:26:37.024+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, if you read carefully, you'll see that I agree on this point. \n\nBut upping it by 50 instead of 25 is too much.
