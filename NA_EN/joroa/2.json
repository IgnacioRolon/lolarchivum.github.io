Any champion can support as long as you actually support\n\nNo thats exactly it. The problem is the average league player *does not learn to look at roles like that*, but thats due to the game not teaching its players to look at roles subjectively and versatile unlike say Dota for example where heroes are NOT restricted to any lane or particular role. \"Play what works on its own instead of making something work\". I remember i was flamed to HELL and back when i wanted to play Amumu support and i did well with it--a tanky initiator support such as nautilus or leona. People STILL didn't care because it wasn't the real leona or nautilus and their argument is always  \"Why not just pick [standard support]?\" And i wasn't messing around either; I was playing a serious support game.\n\nIve played games with an Ekko as my support and thought \"Wow holy shit ekko support is great, why dont people play it more?\" and Jhin support is AMAZING. In fact the amount of CC and initiation Jhin has im surprised he isnt already a standard support pick. The only difference is that hes a AD caster instead of an AP. (Brand, Annie)\n\nLeague of legends tells the average player to let the meta play the game for them rather than the other way around. Ive always said this since i started playing 4 years ago and its still as evident today. People that will suddenly start playing MF support from this ember will only prove that. Just like when riot used to do Dark Horse articles and turned Brand into a support, and urgot into a mid. Imagine trying to do that BEFORE then? Imagine trying to play MF support before this game that made everyone go \"Ohhhh ok it was in the LCS that means it ok right?\"\n\nBut conversely youll see the kind of people that will be playing Teemo support or Xerath support or anything off meta in general BECAUSE they want to fuck around and they don't actually know what theyre doing at all, which gives a bad outlook on the people that actually ARE legitimately trying with something \"off meta\" so i CAN understand why people would be apprehensive not seeing standard because too many people have given off meta a troll reputation.\n\n**This comment is brought to you by Acer.**","replies":[{"poster":"Mighty Mortein","date":"2016-10-22T01:09:17.228+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love playing off meta supports.
