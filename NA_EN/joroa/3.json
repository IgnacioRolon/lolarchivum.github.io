The fact he can 1v2, UNDER your inhib tower, get a kill and force your flash to escape, you go back to fountain, come back and he's full health because of his passive, is ridiculous at any stage of the game.

His kit is obnoxious as hell to play against and is emblematic of the \"fun for me but not for you\" kind of playstyle that certain notable annoying champs embody. I hate mobility, and this guy has mobility out the ass. He can basically sentence an entire grouped team to death with his ult. Not to mention the fact that his character is a giant douchenozzle that's supposed to be \"likeable\". Not fun at all.

Her synergy with Kog who is one of the least fun marksmen to play against is one of the best synergies in the game, like seriously, I've never seen him die in lane while he's had a Lulu support. She's got something for every situation, but polymorph has to be the most infuriating thing about her kit.
