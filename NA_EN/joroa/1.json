While C9 lost in the first round.  Immortals lost in the second round. \nCLG didn't win Summer Finals but unlike C9 the previous split they weren't eliminated in the first round in the Summer Playoffs.

CLG was the best team in NA on patch 6.6, on patch 6.15 they weren't even top 3.

Sure they didn't win the Summer Split but they at least got out of the first round something C9 couldn't do in the Spring Split, they also beat that same team that sent C9 home during that time. \n\nWinning over the full season is more of a accomplishment than say a team that only got hot during the second half of the year and still not being able to win.  \n\n\nThe LCS is similar to Football or Basketball where the patches are close to say injuries.  Say the meta changes from ADC's to TOP lane carries the team that has more focus on ADC are now \"injured\" because of the Meta. \n\nWhich team would you rather have to go to Worlds? \nCLG where they PROVED and have EARNED spots at MSI for NA  and have shown that they can win against the best teams in the world.  They might be in a slump right now but I have faith to believe that they will bounce back and show up again for NA. \n\nIMT where if Reignover doesn't camp for Huni, Huni will just fall off the face of the Earth and not do anything that makes sense.  A Mid and Support who don't do anything and a ADC that gets caught out 24/7.  It's 2015 TSM worlds all over again if you ask me.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-09-07T02:47:49.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First off Football and Basket ball don't have two splits, they have one continuous season. And injuries are closer to a roster swap then a meta change. Its not like the NBA nerfed GS by making 3's count for less. But when they took Dramond out for game 5 it was a lot like SK losing their starting jungler at worlds ins season 4. \n\nAre we really still pretending MSI results mean anything after last years worlds? Remember when SKT failed so the KR exodus hurt the region. Or how LGD and EDG were favorites to win the worlds becasue EDG won MSI. Or how EU was supposed to be close to KR because of that 5 game series at MSI, even though both EU teams in the bracket got stomped 3-0 in by the KR teams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MeilinII","date":"2016-09-07T02:08:41.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If playoffs for football is in January, why does October matter?

Then the 3rd seed is decided by the gauntlet/regional qualifiers.\n\nThere's no minimum points (whoever has the most points after summer split gets 2nd seed, period), but the winner of the Sprint Split (this year, CLG) gets 90 points as a base, so that's a huge advantage if they don't win Summer. There'd have to be some crazy bullshit where the top 6 from summer are COMPLETELY different from Spring for that to be the determining factor (in other words, for the 90 points to get you 2nd seed alone). I mean, you'd have to have teams come up from the relegation tourney in one split for that. Generally, a 1-2 seed in Spring and a showing in Summer, or a 1-2 in both splits, will net you the points, as shown by CLG's point breakdown.","replies":[{"poster":"JoroA","date":"2016-09-06T23:26:03.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK!\nThanks a bunch for the info.","replies":[{"poster":"Stillname","date":"2016-09-07T01:13:01.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also if a team gets eliminated from the league they are in, all of their points are taken away.
