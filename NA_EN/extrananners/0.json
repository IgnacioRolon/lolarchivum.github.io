So yesterday I decided to just reinstall it like it says to in the error dialogue. it worked, only, afterward, I got a different error which was easily fixed by running as admin. so that day I played my fill of league and shut the client down like normal. then today I go to start it up again thinking that the reinstall fixed it, but then I find I get the same error again?!? so I do some more scouring and see people telling me to delete certain files, so I look for the files and I don't even have them? so I look some more and see a RIOTER tell someone to try the hextech repair tool. which sounds like a great idea so I try that, I run a diagnostic and all it gives me are some logs, then I try the reinstall with the hextech repair tool and it seemed to be fine until that didn't work either, I tried running every possible solution as an admin too so it cant be that either. so I've reinstalled twice and tried every solution I've seen, pls rito, help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-18T01:05:08.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah man, it sounds like you've done quite a lot of troubleshooting on your own so far.
