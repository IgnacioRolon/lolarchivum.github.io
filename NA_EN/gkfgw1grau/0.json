(They will be late to lane which is a good thing because the enemy team will push the lane for when you gank) when grump dies, blue will be at 200-300 Hp. Go do wolves for level 3 and be at bot right when they hit level 2. I've done this so many times because the enemy support isn't going to use there first ward on the river bush. And even if you don't get a kill ,there's a good chance that the adc or support will need to recall ,which will give bot lane back the advantage for showing up to lane late.  \r\n\r\nCons: red is open for enemy jungle to take.\r\n\r\n If it fails it puts shaco behind pretty far and the bot lane even further\r\n\r\nPros: good chance of first blood and possibly a double kill. \r\n\r\nIf I get a kill. the person who died May even still be level 1. If that's the case I go to the bush that's in front of the 2nd teir tower at bot and wait for the level 3 vs level 1 gangbang, sending him/her back to the grave again.  Bot will be level 4 when that raging level 1 gets back to lane.\r\n\r\nOptional route: if bot pushed to much for you to gank take a look at mid and see if you can score a kill there.\r\n\r\nIf mid and bot can't be ganked. Recall and upgrade your smite ( you will have exactly enough to upgrade it and get 1 health pot. Then head to red and look to gank top or mid.\r\n\r\nShaCo = ChaoS","replies":[{"poster":"Angry Monster","date":"2015-01-26T22:20:58.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats new?  I mean litterally what new? In season 3 with a bit of AP runes shacco used to do solo red with boxes and do blu with the bot lane.\n\nThis pattern is nothing new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-26T22:18:01.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is supposed to be a ganking champion. This is as normal as normal gets and it only works if he happens to be on the side where he can get bot to help with blue. If he did this with red, he'd be oom before he even ganked! lol. Overall, this is normal Shaco stuff. It's his uniqueness. He's one of the only champions who CAN do it. You should've seen it back when he could get red AND blue at the SAME TIME.","replies":[]}]}
