None of what you said this game was helpful or constructive, and while she may not have been playing as you wanted her to that's still no excuse to constantly complain about it and harass her over it the entire game. I imagine your teammates were annoyed by it as well, as otherwise they wouldn't have reported you that game.\n\nNext time just try to work with what you have if possible, or at the very least if you must complain then keep it out of chat, as no one wants to listen to someone whine and complain non-stop all game long.
