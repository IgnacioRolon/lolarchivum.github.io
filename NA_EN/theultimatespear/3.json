Or for any Cass main, for that matter. I mean, after all, her playrate collapsed after Cassiopeia was nerfed out of freelo tier. Not to mention several other unwarranted nerfs later her winrate collapsed as well.\n\nI just gotta say Riot, you reaaaaallly ought to consider looking into Cass aside from mere number changes, because her ~~trashed~~ new kit did not fix any of her old problems, and adds new one. (Feast or famine passive, binary gameplay, toxic to play against, or should I say, MORE toxic to play against for the people who say Cass was toxic prerework, she&#039;s worse now)\n\nYou know, Riot, if people wanted to play a mana stacking DPS hyperscaling mage, they could play Ryze! (Although he&#039;s been through  the ringer his fair shair too.) \n\nAnd the funny thing is, Riot, you&#039;ve already admitted _Cass isn&#039;t in a good spot!_\n\nJust... for the love of God. If or when you touch Cass again, please  change her kit and not just her numbers: because her fanbase has said a 1,000 times over we do not like it. At this point I don&#039;t think anyone would be mad if you said it&#039;d be a while for you to work on Cassiopeia. For me it&#039;d be reassurance enough that you&#039;d eventually fix this mess... I;d be relieved to know you&#039;d work on her at all- especially considering how  _completely unprofessional_ Riot Stashu was with this \"rework.\" You know, trashing Cassiopeia and waltzing off with empty promises and just taking up Fiora. Oh, and not to mention, other Rioters have to explain this for him, because heaven forbid Riot Stashu actually have to acknowledge his mistakes!\n\nJust... come on.
