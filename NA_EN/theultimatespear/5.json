That's the same or a _little_ more than what it was.\n\nAnd the design on the rework is _objectively bad._ I don't want to be harsh, but look at her passive. It's snowbally, it's binary, and uninteractive.\n\nAs Ginga said earlier, people were for the most part only content with her kit when it was op, and when it wasn't her pickrate lowered to what it already was before the rework. \n\nAnd honestly, sure people don't post threads against Cass very often, but before the rework, people didn't complain about her at all. Seriously- being harassed with Q was annoying, but losing half your health after one false step is worse.\n\nLaning as Cassiopeia is landing a Q and E-ing all over the enemy laner until they lost about 2/3 their health and you're oom.

Stashu explicitly said at the time that Cass was far from done and there was more in the pipeline for her - not just to fix her balance situation but to actually improve on the design and fun of the rework, to make her poisons more important and so on. He said he would be back to use when they locked down on those changes.\n\nThen he never spoke to us again except for joking about how OP she is on Twitter.

But since we werent in the meetings we can only guess at what happened.  So maybe there was a need to not change the core abilities very much while making laning more interactive. In this made up example, its very hard to make achange that keeps poison damage as is while not changing them too much, but since no one outside of riot rework team knows, that means that any suggestion could be cast aside because it wouldnt work with the stipulations, so not knowing means we all just looking in from the outside.\n\nI can understand wanting a final \"we are done for now\" post, but i dont think riot has ever made one of those to my knowledge, but a good bet would be when we see balance like changes to a champ. \n\nNow looking at how it came out ill offer my own change.\nQ has reduced range to make the lane more interactive, give it a staking dot that wears off quick but does damage. (Kinda similar to karthus)\nW farther range\nSwitch e and r.\nE now does no dmg, cass channels in cast direction for x time that strikes at the end of the duration.

I really think that being a lane bully was an identity of Cassiopeia too, they nerfed it, but at least she had some sustain to actually fight back in some lanes, now the sustain is just not that enough (her E mana sustain got gutted by half).
