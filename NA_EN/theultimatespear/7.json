And I make him ragequit.\n\nI&#039;m sorry. This is terrible, and click baity, I know, but Dear God... that was one of the most cathartic games of League of Legends I&#039;ve ever played.  Yeah, Yasuo did lots of damage despite starting cull (A farming up item?) Yeah, he survived in lane by his bullshit shield, crit lifesteal sustain, and windwall blocking my spells (and not skill), and yeah I had to manage my mana while he got free sustain/shields/dashes/waveclear.\n\n But I still somehow managed to killed that busted ass champion three times! AND make him ragequit.\n\nOkay, but I have a serious point here. I&#039;ve played Zyra versus Yasuo several times before. This Yasuo was NOT good. He hit me with literally 2 or 3 tornadoes the entire game, while other Yasuos I've played against have hit me 2 or 3 times per every time we both come back to lane. And I STILL beat those Yasuos. But with the broken crit mastery... I don't even remember how it even works entirely. But he gained SO much free sustain after getting his first item. I'm not exaggerating but I brought him to like 50% health for him to have 90% after clearing the next wave.\n\nMy final point is this: the Yasuo I was up against was terrible but managed to survive because of just HOW busted Yasuo  is. Before preseason I beat Yasuo's who were _easily_ better.

Tbh outside of the laning phase it's easy to focus him as he's the squishiest melee in the game. Look at lolgraphs, the guy is averaging the most deaths out of every champion.

The reason why he has a high death rate is because you have to be a complete, utter, literally autistic AND downsyndrome'd person to not be able to carry with yasuo lategame. All those deaths come from yasuos who go 1/9 in laning phase but then still manage to carry the game because that champion is just retarded. I see this same pattern every single time there's a yasuo.

I realise that he has above average tools to turn the tide in dire situations, but also has the same possibilities of botching his own play. The example would be your previous post, about dashing through your minion in your turret range. His laning phase is extremely obnoxious only rivaled by {{champion:7}}  and {{champion:74}}. But he is counterable. Have you watched how your NA's own C9 Balls'  Darius roflstomped Fnatic Huni\"s Yasuo at worlds this year? I mean his free stats and being manaless is as bad as it is, but remember LoL is a team game and with some coordination {{champion:157}}  can be shut down.  I just think the guy is as nerfed as it is and the only thing that should be nerfed is the Warlords Bloodlust mastery which makes him extremely broken. With just a shiv and an aglity cloak the guy gets a soraka heal every auto attack. As a high skill cap champion having a 53% win rate just proves that the balance deparatment should look closely at this mess.","replies":[{"poster":"ReZisT Lust","date":"2015-11-16T01:30:23.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1- Cant do it on the same champ back to back\n2-Back off a few seconds to wait his wall out\n3-Just auto him right before its back up...\n4-Move and your good to go{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pawn of hearts","date":"2015-11-16T02:56:53.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Miss Fortune,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vdVtEQZZ,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-11-15T12:20:02.061+0000)\n>\n> Then there's those Yasuo players who think they're Incarnati0n and end up dashing under your tower and then they end up wind walling the opposite dirction while missing a point blank tornado.\n> \n> I mean to be fair there's a good 9/10 chance they'll end up carrying after finishing Shiv anyways.\n\nwell clearly I haven't met any yas who did that thus far.\n\nbut remember it always depend on skills.\n\nfull build yas vs full build yi  who would win?\nwell clearly there isn't any legit answer to that. because  {{champion:81}} \" its all skill\"","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2015-11-16T03:47:58.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm willing to give it to Yi.

Be it cost them health, or some gating mechanic which inhibits their power until a condition is met. \n{{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:55}} all have this weird spot where they don't have to have the skill set to manage resources or time their engagements to align with a condition like let's say {{champion:150}} or {{champion:68}}. As a result they are almost impossible to balance, because either they are to strong and demolish in lane, or they are to weak and can't make a meaningful impact outside of lane.\n\nI know Riven was on the chopping block for this terrible design, she was going to get \"edge\" as a limiter which was gain when shit landed a hit with her passive and consumed when she ulted. Although apparently they decided to delay or removed the change. -_-","replies":[]}]}
