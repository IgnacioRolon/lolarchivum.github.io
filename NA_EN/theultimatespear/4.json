Even if the rework is considered a success, Stashu still owes Cassiopeia's playerbase an explanation about why he went back on his word, and disclosure. Not even a matter of success or failure, but of respect and professionalism.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caustic Crusader","date":"2015-07-20T09:54:03.824+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I quit the game based on Stashu's bullshit. Played a few games recently just to keep my username reserved after not having played since URF this year, and Cassiopeia is STILL THE SAME. It was basically a perfect storm of bullshit that got me to quit. My favorite character's design was thrown out the window, made into an unfun kit, and buffed until it was functional, so there's some loyalty lost. Feedback was outright ignored, as there was endless commentary on how badly people hated the changes in testing stages, and how the buffs/nerfs that followed didn't help matters. That's outright disrespectful. The ability to refund characters following a rework was taken away a bit before, and I'm stuck having paid IP and RP for a character that I now despise, with skins that I didn't want to keep. That was the breaking point for me.\n\nGood to see nothing's changed back at Rito HQ! Ignore the problem long enough, and it'll go away. The most unfortunate thing is, it seems to be right. I can barely find any posts inquiring about Cass's status and how it'll be fixed, she's received only minor numbers changes since I last checked, and Stashu is still ducked the fuck out. Is he fired? I'm willing to wager that he's no longer with the company, since the most recent instance of him interacting with anybody that I can find is from December, in that very same post you've highlighted.\n\nI joined the game after the Karma rework, but now I understand how they've felt all of these years, and it's fucking horrible. Riot, it's obvious you don't care at all for the average player. After all, their desires interfere with eSports revenue. Just, please, for the next champ you rework and destroy, maybe keep the fans in the back of your mind and try to sympathize with them.\n\nI can already see it clear in the back of my mind; the Mordekaiser rework! Done by an intern who mains Master Yi, Mordekaiser is now a fast-moving Melee carry whose early game faults are made up for by a terrifying late game.\n\nIf you don't get the joke, it's because Cass was reworked by an intern, or at least someone with the expertise, know-how, and attitude of an unpaid intern, who mains Ryze and basically was changed to fulfill the AP hypercarry archetype that Ryze did.","replies":[{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2015-07-20T10:40:23.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They didn't destroy Cass per se... only changed her playstyle. \n\nOf course she might not be that fun to play anymore, however when it comes to her power-level, she's still just fine though.\n\nPersonally I disliked the rework and still do a bit ... however after that people like Faker and Easyhoon started to play her, so I don't mind anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-07-19T01:09:29.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-07-19T01:12:04.845+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xJLx MCHammer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KJdwWeN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-19T01:09:29.144+0000)\n>\n\n\nHe's not complaining that Cass is weak.

And when they arrive at a setback, people continue to cling to those promises, refusing to acknowledge much else. As we've seen before Cass is EXTREMELY hard to balance with her current kit. \n\nIt's either going to be Machine Gun or Unhealthy Poison Spam, because its hard to equally waver the power. She's either been horrible or horribly OP, mainly due to her kit. \"So just make her a new kit\" I hear some of you say. If only it was that easy, since there is a great deal of effort that goes into making a kit. Here's some questions that you'd might ponder trying to make a new kit for her\n\n* How do I make her a DPS Poison Mage without making her oppressive\n* How do I keep the assets of her kit while moving her away from the unhealthy parts\n\n*  How do I keep the TRY (I cannot stretch this word enough(I know you're there Karma mains)) to keep Current Cass players interested in her\n\nThose are just a few of the questions that might come through someone's mind while trying to rework a champ. Now what happens.... when you can't answer those questions? You stumble upon something that frustrates you because you just cant figure it out. You can't solve this problem so time passes and soon players start wondering what happen to the promise that they've been clinging too. They were promised something was being done, so they don't understand why it isn't.\n\nThis is my personal belief of what is going on (Which means mine, not yours, my belief) of why Stashu has been pretty quiet about the whole thing. Sometimes people run into problems, and imo, it was a mistake to have said to the community what he did. \n\nIt was a pretty big mistake that's left a lot of Cass mains clinging to an old promise (no offense OP), but what was a bigger mistake was to not say anything else about it, in terms of \"We've had to hold back on Cass for a while\" or something to that point. Lack of communication is what caused this clinginess to the promises we get out of Riot, and lack of communication is continueing to make this worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-07-19T12:22:35.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly suggest adding some eyecatching thumbnail to your thread, there are several cute and funny Cass images to choose from.
