Now, I&#039;m not really going to say much about her balance. (I thought she was fine, at least not at the top most powerful  champs that might need some nerfs, but meh) What am I going to say, once again, is that her rework design is. Not. good. \n\nHer passive- A ball of stats. It&#039;s boring- you raise it&#039;s power by waiting. And, the inflated AP is countered by low ratios. Not to mention, it&#039;s not dynamic like other evolution passives and it doesn&#039;t feel close to her character. Lot&#039;s of downsides. The plus sides are the free CDR (debatably, see ball of stats) and the healing- which, despite it&#039;s flaws, actually might serve Cassiopeia well. With her short range she doesn&#039;t get much chance to retaliate against longer range mages or bursty assassins. (Both of these vary somewhat, of course, but you get the idea.) And with her kit so centered around her Twin Fang to function, the healing&#039;s really beneficial for her to endure poke, which she might be forced to do through much of the laning phase. However, by gutting her Q and W damage you only exacerbated her short range, meaning it&#039;s mostly impossible for Cassiopeia to try to keep up with poke, which she could before. And because of that, the healing&#039;s really nice, perhaps even necessary for her to function.\n\nAnother thing you added was the mana restore on Twin Fang. With her Deadly Cadence passive gone, and her mana costs even more constraining than before, this was a reasonable inclusion, because with how she works now she needs some way to regain a steady amount of mana to sustain her spamming and mana costs.  I thought Deadly Cadence was a better, and much more dynamic mana sustain passive. Cassiopeia had to keep up with her spellcasts and be really focused to get the most out of it. With her new mana restore on E... not so much. But, hey, it&#039;s good enough, so I won&#039;t count it as a criticism.\n\n**The thing is, though, these 2 things, the mana restore and innate spellvamp, are the only good things/salvageable things in the Cassiopeia rework, and they are things getting hit with nerfs. Hell, even then, they have design problems, what with making Cassiopeia feel frustrating to play against as her health gain and mana restore _feel_ very forgiving for little effort when playing against Cassiopeia, regardless of if it&#039;s true.**\n\n**TL;DR- revert the Cassiopeia rework. Hell, or at least give some power back to her Q and W and R- so basically anything of her kit that&#039;s not her now overloaded E. With all of her power shoved into her E, she&#039;s very binary. I understand Cassiopeia was and is a duelist champion, but back when her kit had power spread across the board she wasn&#039;t so binary, and she didn&#039;t need so many stats and bonuses to function and be effective as a champion.**\n\n**And, if you, Riot, don&#039;t want to listen... Maybe it&#039;s all just as well. Her fans, even her new ones, are getting tired of these nerfs, and when they don&#039;t have reason to play Cassiopeia for power, they won&#039;t play her at all, and then no one will because she&#039;s NOT.

However, her mana costs being jacked up really hurt. I'd say it's decent, even if only because she gets stronger as time goes on.\n\nThe thing is though, Cassiopeia's laning phase was NOT made any more bearable, which is one of the excuses they gave for the rework- to make her laning less oppressive and frustrating. And they failed. Cassiopeia may have constantly harassed you before, but now she can chunk half your health at level 2 like you said. She punishes mistakes EXTREMELY hard, even harder than before. And, from what people on the boards have said, laning against her feels even worse than it did before. So what was the point then, you know?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-05-15T23:32:07.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":7,"body":"I mean, Cass can also get like 1400 AP and two shot people who have 90ish mr if she gets fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-05-16T00:42:40.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"That's absolutely false.
