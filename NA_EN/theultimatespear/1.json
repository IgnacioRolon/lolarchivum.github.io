If we do make adjustments to Cass in the short to medium term they're much more likely to be done by the Live Balance team than the Champion Update team (so would mainly involve power shifts, rather than significant changes to how her skills function). \n\nThat's the case because a number of months ago we took a look at the current state of Cass and concluded that it was more important to have the Champion Update team focus on other characters. That's not to say we think she's in a perfect spot. In particular, we realize there's some very valid frustration that she doesn't deliver as well as she could on the thematic expectations a number of her players have (poison mage). We do think there are other champions that need work done on them more however, so are focused on those at present, with Fiora being the most recent example. I realize that's likely pretty frustrating to hear if you're a Cass player that doesn't like her new kit, and my apologies for that.\n\nIn terms of making that priority call that was a decision Stashu contributed some thoughts to, but didn't make himself. Riot does have a culture that supports individual developers pitching work they think's valuable/arguing for what they believe in, but it's not a 'work on whatever you want regardless of team priorities' culture. Stashu's stance was that he was eager to do Cass followup work or take on Fiora, whichever we thought was more valuable. The conclusion Champion Update and Game Design leadership came to was that Fiora was the better call in this case, since she was a character with a lot of room for improvement/cool stuff and had some notable issues. We also believed Fiora had the potential to be a pretty successful gameplay rework, based off some early exploratory designs Guinsoo had been doing before he'd had to shift focus onto other stuff.\n\nThat decision to shift focus from Cass to other champs is something those of us making the call on what work to prioritize should have mentioned months ago, apologies for that lack of communication. If anyone's got any queries about how we make those sort of priority calls I'm more than happy to have a go at answering them here. I probably won't be able to answer specifics about Cass' current state of balance or what guided detailed decisions on her rework however (will give it a shot if I can offer an at least somewhat informed answer, there's a bunch of details there I wasn't involved with/aren't up to date on).","replies":[{"poster":"Scarborough Fair","date":"2015-07-22T09:48:41.333+0000","up_votes":85,"down_votes":8,"body":"Then WHY rework her to begin with?

Literally he's answering questions that have been on the boards for months. So, we're down voting him for responding at that point? Down voting him based on what he told us? It's not as though his job is easy people, he has to make decisions that he knows will be unpopular with a large chunk of the community. I imagine it's not like he relishes making decisions that he's fully aware he'll get negative flak for but does it anyway because it'll improve the game in Riot's eyes (may not always be right but no ones perfect). I imagine he probably looks forward with something akin to glee when he gets to make a decision that will be popular with the community though.","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-07-23T17:46:59.358+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not defending it, just explaining.

But as a player I _seriously_ appreciate the clarity given here. Hell, it's probably the biggest gripe I've had in dealing with **any company**. With the general lack of transparency it can be easy to assume someone like Stashu can work on whatever he wants whenever he wants.\n\nA personal question of mine is how much consideration is given to a Rioters opinion on something? Can 1 Rioter be for X and another be against, putting the X in a deadlock situation (outside of leadership intervention of coarse)? Does seniority get taken into account? Division priority?\n\nAnother one of mine is what determines who is a part of a certain devisions Leadership? Past and Current experience? How long they've worked for Riot or other places of work? Whoever got here first is the leader? Pull random names out of a hat?\n\nThank you for your post.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-07-23T04:45:22.883+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":9,"body":"Teams at Riot have goals they're built to accomplish and the people on those teams spend most of their time at work focused on those goals. Champion Team's there to make new champions, Live Balance to balance the game, the Events team is there to work on stuff like URF or Bilgewater etc. Individuals on those teams can (and often do) pitch ideas on how to accomplish those goals, or sometimes suggest alternative goals to the leads on those teams or Riot's overall leadership (who set high level priorities for the company). \n\nDebate's over the best way to accomplish something are pretty common, and healthy discussion's a really important part of how we work. Discussion over what the most appropriate ways to balance a new champion that's too weak for example can be a great way of finding ways to add power that also add as much satisfaction as possible, without creating game health problems. Deadlocks do happen at times though of course, and in those cases we've got a small leadership group on each team who are responsible for making the call on how to proceed. Validity of argument/how well aligned proposed approaches are to the team's/Riot's goals are what we're interested in when choosing between possible options, not length of time at the company or title of the people who've suggested them.\n\nIn terms of how we determine who the people responsible for leading each team are, that's part of the job application process or an internal transfer/promotion. Generally we're after people with significant experience, an interest in supporting others more than implementing directly themselves and a desire to help people work together when hiring for those sorts of roles. Communication skills, ability to help resolve conflicts, develop long term plans, co-ordinate work etc are also all really valuable.\n\nHope that gives you a bit more of an idea of how we work, let me know if there's more details you're interested in.","replies":[{"poster":"Scarborough Fair","date":"2015-07-23T04:53:03.457+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":7,"body":"Are you going to consider our feed back for once and work on Cass sooner rather than later or are you going to ignore us again and leave us with your unfinished mess of a rework?","replies":[{"poster":"Chaotic Sage","date":"2015-07-23T19:34:29.309+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"How about phrasing that like this instead.
