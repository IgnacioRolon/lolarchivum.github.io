Sorry about communicating, I&#039;ve been working on that :/.

And the last of these posts where... what was it? 7 months ago? Well. Isn&#039;t that funny.\n\nI&#039;m not sure if you know this, but if you say you&#039;re going to continuing working on Cassiopeia you should probably keep your word. You know how you said you&#039;d do that? Along with making her more focused on her poisons? Yet you haven&#039;t. All you&#039;ve done is tinker with her numbers.\n\nLook, I get it.  Getting work done takes time. I get it&#039;s hard to please everyone. But you gave your word, and then didn&#039;t follow through. You shouldn&#039;t have said anything if you knew that was going to be the case. And if you didn&#039;t know that was going to be the case, the least you could do is post on the boards and say you&#039;re done working on Cassiopeia, at least when it comes to changing her kit rather than her numbers. Yet you haven&#039;t done that either, and you probably won&#039;t.\n\n\nI&#039;m going to make this post on the boards until I get a red response. If you don&#039;t want to continue work on Cassiopeia, fine, but the least you could do is say you won&#039;t, so anyone who cares can stop having their hopes up.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a few grammar errors here and there","replies":[{"poster":"Heckin Support","date":"2015-07-13T00:40:57.188+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":6,"body":"Casseopia should 100% be a poison mage.

Kind of like Poppy.\n\nEh, old Karma is someone I really think could easily exist in League in 2015. Her passive isn't unusual given the number of \"I get much harder to kill the weaker I am\" bruiser effects we now have in the game, the burden of knowledge with her old W is no longer something Riot can complain about given they have released both Kalista and Tahm Kench and even the \"having 6 levels in her basic abilities was confusing\" thing is something they went back on with their recent Jayce changes.\n\nA lot of the stuff they listed as problems for Karma in the past are things they've introduced to the game on different champions since. I really feel like old Karma would be allowed to be powerful in 2015. She was just before her time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunal","date":"2015-07-13T18:15:18.376+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No. She really just couldn't be buffed. Didn't matter what gimmicks she had in her kit.\n\nKarma became more durable AND had more burst the lower her HP was. It pretty much meant that poking her down was not only meaningless but actually discouraged. \n\nThen her R+E patterns was just Old Sion but even sillier. It was the defining aspect of her kit that made her rather unbalanceable, in conjunction with her passive. What held her back with this was very high mana costs and cooldown on her mantra (to make it usable). Had Karma been buffed to levels beyond even just a reasonable winrate this ability alone would make her hell to play against. In fact, the only reason she was 'challenging' to play as was because she was undertuned, but still had annoying play patterns for her opponents. Imagine how that would have escalated with buffs? She had no real skillshots to speak of so her interactivity in lane would be very binary. Difficult to damage and had guaranteed burst against you.\n\nW was an ability with a lot of potential and the whole \"ally awareness\" thing isn't at all a factor in my point. It was just kinda bad. At least without mantra. 10% speed/slow until level 13?\n\nOn that note, all of Karma's abilities were just mediocre without mantra. Q was a worse Morde E. E was a worse Janna E, W was... just plain weak.\n\n\n\nShe had a lot of problems but also encouraged play patterns that prevented her from being buffed into overall viability. You know what the following champions have/had in common?\n\nMorde.\nDiana.\nOld Sion.\n\nAbilities that scale with durability and burst at the same time (with AP). If they're fed they become both harder to kill and deal more burst. All of which have been a terror to balance and are rather unfun to play against. Diana to a lesser extent I suppose.\n\n\nHad old Karma been given better mana costs, higher AA range (it was only 425) or higher numbers on abilities, or lower cooldowns her laning would just be unmoveable and possible have some of the least interesting or possible counterplay. She packed strong waveclear too.\n\nHer AoE heal isn't even a factor in all this since she would use RE 98% of the time. In order to 'buff' her would require a nerf to that ability in order to buff anything else. That was their best option but perhaps it just didn't work out. New Karma actually had a nerfed version of it to begin with so that was their compromise somewhat.\n\nBut like I said, her W was a unique ability that should have stayed but made much stronger. If hitting the enemy with the bond was like Wisp/Lo's then I'm sure allies would have learned to utilise it more. A minor slow meant nobody bothered to care for it.\n\n\n\nI suppose another option for Old Karma would have been to lower her burst damage drastically and buff her utility a lot. Then she may have been healthy as a dedicated support. But there would have been so much backlash with that too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShadowParker","date":"2015-07-13T18:14:25.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not denying that Karma is really balanced, and that she is really fun.

Before the rework, you could max her Q over E depending on the match up. (Maxing Q would be better against a Ziggs than E, since you'd never get close to him anyways. for example) But now that the Q ratio has been almost halfed that's not an option anymore; you have to max E because it's the only spell that makes sense to max. And Cassi's W got trashed. A liandry's tick on the W does more damage than the W itself now.\n\nBecause of this, Cassiopeia's waveclear is much weaker now, until she can mana sustain spamming e's on minions at least. She has to use her E's, which don't do much more damage than autos on the minions to clear. Before, a simple W-Q or Q-W could clean up the back line nicely. And now those spells do nothing on their own. The thing is, Cassiopeia's poisons losing their damage doesn't just weaken her waveclear; it ruins her teamfight phase too. Now, Cassiopeia's poisons are just zoning tools; even if someone does get hit by them it doesn't really matter, especially W. Cassiopeia can no longer offer her team any meaningful poke until the teamfight's initiated. Not to mention her Ult.

You get less base damage per point in E than before the rework and you get the same damage per point in Q. So maxing Q now instead of E is worth more than before.

There was a huge discussion together with the community in order to pin down his thematic aswell as his gameplay fantasy.\nRiot stated their initially though role of Xerath, **and then checked how it differs from the perception of the community and tried to find a middleground.**\nThe only small flaw on the rework is that really alot people complained about his ult **feeling** weak(note not beeing, but feeling weak), as the visuals and also the sound there a bit underwhelming compared to the raw power it should be and also compared to how mighty his old ult felt.\nYet, despite all those complaints back then, his ult still looks like he's throwing puny bubbles rather than raw arcane energie, and the sound still lacks some punch...\n\nRiot's plan for cassio probably always was twinfang focused hypercarry, but is soon turned out that going for the twinfangs was really risky thing with that squishy snake, so most players optd to focus on Q+W, which allowed for strong zone controll and good midranged aoe dps aswell as harres.\nIt felt also more fitting to a snake, beeing focused on poison and doting your enemies to the ground.\nTwinfang became more a oportunistical tool that allowed for massive singetarget dps if the situation was right, and not the center of her kit.\n\nI personaly don't care if she's a E focused hypercarry or a poisonfocused bully and controll mage, but i understand why alot people see her as a poisonmage, i followed the discussions with stashu's promises, and seeing that the majority off cassio mains wants her as a 'cunning poison mage', i support them in their call and can understand them perfectly well.\n\nI still have a grudge cause of old Karma. I loved her pre rework, and while new karma isn't bad either, she simply is a totally different champion.\nI also was against the scarner rework, together with many others, as it destroyed him for me, but we were ignored, so i know how the cassio players feel.\n\nAlso, another huge critique point was how bad cassios passive feels, it doesn't feel like a growth of power, it feels like shackels you need to remove.\nThe main problem is that it does not really argument her kit, it's just an aritfical scaleing that shapes her powercurve into a hyercarry. It feels forced upon her for the sake of hyperscaleing, rather than beeing a natural part of her kit.\nThat's mostly due to it simply giving a stat infusion besides the heal on E.\n\nIf we look on other 'unlock power' effeckts, they all feel grate as they directly argument their kit.\nVictors passive, Rengars trophys, Kah's evolutions, Syndras passive, all interact with their bas kit rather than giving a mere stat infusion...\nAnd stashu agreed on this problem and said he'd work on it...and nothing happend.\nAnd unlike the poison vs twinfang part, i'm kinda personally involved on fighting for a better passive...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-07-13T02:23:00.017+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I would love to know what Stashu actually does at Riot now, because it's certainly not fixing Cass and I've not seen his name attached to anything else since.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-07-13T03:07:47.328+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:43}} Give it a few years.

Riot has really been working hard on new content and revamping other champions. I am sure there are other priorities more pressing than a champ that was being played in the LCS Spring Split.\n\nOne thing I do know for sure. Creating discussions like these doesn't provide constructive feedback in anyway. 5 months ago Meddler responded to these kinds of posts, here are the two threads of convo concerning this kind of intention:\n--------\n - 5 months ago\nByrnes (NA) - 5 months ago\n\n\"Lastly, Rioters mention all the time \"priorities\" in getting things done and fixed. I think that wording needs to change, desperately. It definitely sends the wrong message when someone pours their heart out about something, it gets a lot of comments and upvotes, and then someone says \"yeah, this is super important! But it isn't currently on our radar.\" That hurts, deeply, I suspect (I've never made a post with said response, but I've certainly agreed with ones). This becomes especially true when it is something a player paid for. Whether it be missing particles, wrong skill effects, or something as simple as \"Sona's songs are a tad too quiet\" - we just gave you God knows how much of our paycheck to be told these things will be handled when the team can get to them. We love you guys, we just want to be loved too.\"\n\nMeddler:\n\n\"I wanted to respond to this bit because this can be really tough sometimes. For stuff that's outright bugged, absolutely, we should be getting on that quickly if it's a significant bug and, ideally, letting you guys know about it. For longer term work though it's a bit tougher situation. We can't work on every rework at once for example, and that leaves us with only two real options when it comes to reworks that won't be out for a while. We can either say nothing, or we can tell you it's work we agree needs to be done, but that we're doing other stuff first. My personal inclination is that saying something's better than silence, even if we're not able to say much, I'd love to hear people's thoughts on what they'd prefer though of course.\"\n-----\nAnd from Zwill (23 days ago) this is the best explanation I read from him regarding the issue of why you don't see rioters posting in alot of our forum discussions:\n\n\"But if Rioters posted in GD more it wouldn't be that way!\" I don't disagree with this. The current state of GD is one that many Rioters don't feel safe or welcomed in. We can, and do, encourage Rioters to engage in the Boards all the time, but it's counter to our culture to force anyone to engage somewhere, especially where they're already reluctant to do so. I'm not saying this is the right response, but it's human nature to want to avoid uncomfortable situations. Thus the cycle becomes self fulfilling; Players are angry at Rioters for Rioters not talking to them in their safe space, Rioters experience manifestation of that anger thus causing them to shy away. Not everyone is built like me, able to jump into the proverbial frying pan (and then straight into the fryer ;)).\"\n------\n\nI wish they could sticky posts like these for those posting in forums to have context of what kind of interactions are to be expected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2015-07-13T23:26:38.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, I'm gone all this time and she STILL isn't fixed yet?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"so chad","date":"2015-07-13T18:22:42.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am pretty sure the last we saw of him he was in a Diana discussion pretending to care what players like/wanted for the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-07-13T15:28:59.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista\n\nBasic Attacks deal less damage.
