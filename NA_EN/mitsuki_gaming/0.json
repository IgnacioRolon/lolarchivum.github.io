Good day to you. They took Thresh on Sunday, and since then i was asking anywhere and everywhere for an answer to my question. The questions are: 1. Why is there no ETA for the fix since the issue is not from 2 hours ago, or a day ago, its from Saturday ?\n                                 2. Why did Rito rush the release and did not test and fix that on PBE where it should be tested and fixed be4 it went live?\n                                 3. Why does it take so long?\n                                 4. Do you need help. Cause if it takes you 3 days ( or more ) to fix a model integration bug ill gladly lend a hand just so i can get what i wait since it was just a rumor in the dev's office?\n                                 5. Can we at last get some solid answers? We have a right to know.\n\nPlease do answer if you can. I am eager to know when will the skin come back live. Every door i knock i hear silence.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-20T21:52:37.326+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi hi! (I'm a chick, btw. :P)\n\n1. There is rarely an ETA on instances like this because we do not know how long something is going to take to resolve. In this case, it's not a ten minute fix. We had Rioters working over the weekend in order to get a fix as soon as possible. \n\n2. This issue was not caught on PBE, nor in testing. We did not receive a report from both the team testing internally, nor from PBE players. \n\n3. As mentioned in the first reply, the issue isn't a quick fix, and in addition to the fix itself, we also need to thoroughly test the fix to ensure what we're putting on live doesn't affect any other content, particularly Thresh as a champion.\n\n4. Nope, we have a team in full force resolving this issue. \n\n5. You do have a right to know, and I hope this reply explains a bit more in regards to this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Practyc","date":"2016-06-21T00:52:37.437+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you KateyKhaos for answering these questions.

This could be an issue in the script, an issue with code, or various other scenarios. It can take longer for some issues than others when tracking down a root cause. \n\n\n\n* We find the root cause. (Hooray!) Now, we begin the task of fixing the issue, which again, time can vary, depending on what's going on.\n\n\n* Developer has a fix. QA verifies the fix is working on an internal platform. QA also verifies that this fix won't break anything else - so for Thresh, we're checking that we aren't overwriting any files, we aren't breaking something else in the process, things like that.\n\n\n* If the fix works, we move it to an external environment, something like PBE where it's considered a full build (something players would play on - as live of an environment we can get without it actually going to live itself). We test in several locations to ensure the fix isn't failing once it's in a full build. (Issues can work on an internal platform, but goof up once built out. We do this with all bugs we fix, actually!)\n\n\n\n* If the fix fails, we're looking to repeat some of the previous steps, which is why getting a fix for something can take longer than most would expect.\n\nAgain, we do apologize for the inconvenience here - we know it sucks not being able to play the content you've been waiting for, or have already purchased. \n\nOn our side, we want to make sure the fix that we push to live (via small patch / hot fix, whatever you'd like to call it), works, so that we can turn him on and get everyone back on the Rift, supporting in style. \n\nI hope this post at least informs you a bit more about the process of how this has been going down, and to give a bit more clarity, rather than remaining silent on the issue. \n\nI realize this isn't the answer you're looking for 'cause I don't have an ETA for you (and again, I'm super sorry about that), but I'm happy to keep a healthy conversation going around this and posting any additional information I'm able to provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Sun Eater","date":"2016-06-21T17:19:53.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the beautifuliest answer i ever got <3 , i am pretty young, but i like IT-stuff, and just for that i can wait ;D can you maybe write me a message when Thresh gets activated? and also it means, you dont have a day where it comes out? and how far you with the points you listed on top?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T15:57:58.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya!
