For the past few days, I've been getting Dirext X errors when I've tried to play a game. Everything goes fine until the end of champ select.\r\nI've updated my video drivers, which fixed it for a day, I've done the \"delete config\" folder method, which did nothing.  \r\nIf this is actually because of a patch from Riot, like some people have been saying, and they decided to place me on lower priority queue for their own mistake, I'm going to be so pissed. I've already missed 3 or more games because of this error. \r\n(Fortunately remake is an option so nobody else is directly effected when I get the error.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T21:57:32.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear about the lpq, and I'd like to help figure out why you're having this error.  Are you using an AMD graphics card?","replies":[{"poster":"LAVA M0NSTER","date":"2017-05-25T05:59:00.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also having this same error. It comes and goes at random. Some days I may be able to play multiple games with no problems and the next day it says direct x error. It's so frustrating because I know that my account is getting marked with a lot of leaves and i'll probably get punished here for it. And don't tell me to test a custom game because I've done that for one game and it worked then the next game it didn't...","replies":[]}]}]}
