It's a lose lose situation. With 100% reliability. Any game I am in where people are intentionally feeding at a 1 death per minute ratio by the 20th minute in the game, or better. My last game involved 33 deaths in 19 minutes. You'll never get the game done until about the 35-4o minute mark because even if someone out of the group starts a surrender vote.  You WILL get two no votes. Also, in the vast majority of these games. The people in post game lobby always do the same thing. They brag about how reports do nothing and they are never going to get punished. Be really curious what automated response Riot would say if people started spamming support tickets with all the screenshots of people doing that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-05T01:54:00.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know why you start to spam with stupid questions but please stop","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-02-05T02:10:14.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if part of their frustration is from the inability to properly convey their thoughts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultra Combo Ryze","date":"2016-02-05T02:41:41.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im posting survery questions, its  a free country , with free post, and if theyr'e so stupid why did you bother to comment on my post braincancer (your post is also cancer and toxic) have a good day :)","replies":[{"poster":"FrankerX","date":"2016-02-05T02:45:17.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"make a option to vote then if you want answers...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-02-05T02:08:40.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this because of the new Common Core curriculum?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dwezel","date":"2016-02-05T02:48:28.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Welcome to the the game of life.","replies":[]}]}
