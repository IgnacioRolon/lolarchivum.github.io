What do I lose on my account and what do I keep? I am hesitant on transferring because I don't want to lose the skins I have and the champions I have. Would I lose those? Including my runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-21T20:48:39.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be some shit if we took away your skins every time you transferred eh? \n\nNo worries! You won't be losing any skins, champions or runes. You *might* have to set up those rune pages again, but that would be all. If your names are already being used on EUW, you'll get a need to change your names so that there aren't any duplicate names. \n\nThe only significant changes will be if you happen to play ranked. You will probably need to play a single placement match to see where you'll be placed among those new region players!","replies":[{"poster":"Svindler","date":"2017-05-21T21:16:39.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, can you help me in the thread?
