The problem was that when he ulted, no one on my team could see the ult.  We&#039;d take tons of damage and get stunned, but there were no visual indicators whatsoever.  Normally, I&#039;d repair my client and move on, but this was happening to every single person on my team.  No one could see the ult.  \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what else to say except that it was a Karate Kennen skin that was being used, though I&#039;m not sure if that really matters.  Hope the problem can be found out.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-01T23:08:23.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FatedTitan - \n\nThanks for the report!

That said, I have sent out a compatibility test internally to see if various PC configurations may be having this issue v. others - specifically graphics cards. We're actively working on trying to resolve this 'cause it's a really shitty situation.
