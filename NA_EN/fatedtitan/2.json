(Jinx PBE changes)","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":51,"down_votes":140,"body":"Yea, I know these probably won&#039;t go through, and rightfully so.  But it&#039;s disgustingly pitiful that they even made it onto the PBE in the first place.\r\n\r\nJinx is a very balanced ADC, supporting a feast or famine(until 45 minutes) playstyle.  This is good and showcases her weaknesses, while exemplifying her strengths.  She&#039;s a late game hyper-carry that can eat towers and enemy champions.  This is why I love her!  I have 124 Ranked games with Jinx this season alone, and while I know there are some with far more, she is far and away my preferred champion of choice as a Gold 2 ADC main.  \r\n\r\nShe&#039;s bogged down with her own problems already.  Her Zap doesn&#039;t do anywhere close to the damage it originally did, and while that&#039;s not that big of an issue, it sure does hurt her laning.  But far more than that, her chompers take so long to proc that most people run clean over them without getting hit at all.  And now you put these nerfs on the PBE?\r\n\r\nJinx\r\n\r\n! (R) minimum damage decreased to 25/35/45 from 125/175/225\r\n! (R) minimum AD ratio reduced to .1 AD from .5 AD \r\n\r\n\r\nAre you kidding me?  You&#039;re nerfing her ult&#039;s damage by 100/140/180 damage at the three ranks, then reducing the AD ratio to .1?  Is this a joke?  It&#039;s a SUPER MEGA DEATH ROCKET, not one of Heimer&#039;s toy wrenches.  What&#039;s the point of even shooting the ult now when my autos do more damage than this?  Who pushed these to PBE?  How did they get through internal testing?  I thought we learned from Olaf, Veigar, and others that gutting a champion isn&#039;t the way to go.  You&#039;re taking away all damage from her ultimate, HER ULTIMATE, with no compensation anywhere.  I mineaswell start practicing my Kog&#039;Maw because Jinx will have 3 abilities after this nerf.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that these probably won&#039;t ever hit Live.  I know that the PBE is used for testing.  But to know that these were even considered and that they made it all the way to PBE is just...it makes me question whoever thought it would be a good idea at Riot.  When Jinx was released, all I heard from Riot was how much they loved her and the amount of work they put into her, including the music video and website teasers.  Riot said there probably would never be a champion that stole the heart of so many Rioters ever again.  And yet here I am, looking at these nerfs and wondering what the heck happened.  Because someone obviously never wants her to be played again.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my rant.  Yes, I&#039;m frustrated.  Yes, I know it&#039;s PBE.  But when my main champion has a gutting nerf on PBE, I&#039;m going to complain at the only place I know I can and just hope that it changes someone&#039;s mind.  I don&#039;t have access to the PBE boards so this is the only place I can do that.  \r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-04-21T23:40:19.635+0000","up_votes":63,"down_votes":2,"body":"AFKAKDSFKJSDFA...I just spent an hour typing up a long detailed response to this and then my computer ate it.  whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I'm so sad right now...\n\nGive me some time to retype it.

Let's talk about them and Jinxy in general.\n\nFirst full info on the nerfs:\nThe **min** damage on the R is being cut.  The **max** damage is staying the same.  Additionally, the execute damage is not being touched.  **SMD rocket will ALWAYS deal 25/30/35% of the target's missing health regardless of range.**\n\nBelow are the rough damage estimates based on ranges Jinxs should be familiar with:\n\n*NUMBERS AND CHANGES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE (or not).  ALL THIS IS STILL IN TESTING*\n\nR damage @ Point blank:** 125/175/225(+.5) >>> 25/35/45 (+.1) **\n\nR damage @ Minigun range: **175/245/315 (+.7) >>> 110/155/200(+.45)**\n\nR damage @ Level 9 Rocket range: **185/260/335 (+.75) >>>  135/190/245(+.55)**\n\nR damage @ Shock Pistol range (max): **unchanged - 250/350/450(+1.0)**\n\n**TLDR summary of the below wall of text:\nWe like Jinx being strong for a variety of reasons but she may be TOO strong at the moment. Jinx's snowballing and hyper-carry potential is intended to be strong and we like it where it is so this change is targeted at amping up her main weakness (gets wrekt if jumped on).  IF THIS CHANGE GOES TOO FAR WE'LL FOLLOW UP ON IT.  THE GOAL HERE IS A SLIGHT TONING DOWN OF JINX'S POWER.\n**\n\nGenerally we like Jinx being a strong champ in League of Legends. Even when winning she has a lot of inbuilt counterplay which makes losing to her feel a lot less demoralizing.  Thanks to her general immobility combined with the delayed and conditional nature of her spells players tend to come out of games against Jinx with gameplans on how they're going to beat her next time.\n\nGoing off of this, it is likely that Jinx \"at balance\" sits at above a 50% winrate.  This partially stems from the nature of her power profile. Jinx is highly snowbally, especially in AoE focused teamfights, and is one of the best characters in the game at taking objectives after killing off the enemy team. This is going to contribute to a higher number of wins in solo queue where the \"group and push\" strategy is so prevalent (Jinx loves grouping and pushing!).  People group, teamfights happen, Jinx AoE's things, and 1 kill tends to lead to 1-4 more + towers and dragons.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth mentioning Jinx's dedicated player base. If you run into a Jinx player on live that person is going to have 31 games on her on average,  That's up there with other \"I main dis guy forever\" champs like Yasuo, Lee Sin, and Riven.  For comparison, Graves has a similar play rate to Jinx (they're neck and neck for most picked ADC), and yet the average Graves player only has 16 games on him.  This isn't meant to be a knock on Graves but more a highlight on the fact that many of the Jinx's you run into out there have played her A LOT and as such you'd expect a higher win rate out of her due to player experience.\n\nSo I've gone over why we're okay with Jinx being strong so in that case why are we nerfing her? Well the thing is there's strong and then there's I AM THE GOD OF SOLO QUEUE strong.  Jinx is trending towards the latter and has only been getting better each patch.  She's got one of the highest winrates in the game at 55% across all elos and that combined with her insane playrate is cause for alarm. We felt some light tuning would be appropriate to level the playing field vs. other ADC's so we looked across her kit and asked ourselves \"is there anything Jinx is doing right now that maybe she shouldn't be?\"\n\nSo as her designer I've always felt that Jinx is defined by the following strength and weakness\n**A) Jinx is a snowball:** If you let Jinx get ahead and can't figure out how to get to her SHE WILL TAKE EVERYTHING YOU LOVE AND BURN IT TO THE GROUND.\n**B) Jinx has a hard time with people who invade her personal space.**  If you manage to jump on her when she's unprepared you should be rewarded accordingly.\n\nThe strength is supported by things like Get Excited (the speed passive), the always-on AS/range+AoE steroids on Switcheroo (the Q), and Jinx's reach in general which progresses from 525 range - to 700 - to 1500 - to global.  This power combination ensures that if Jinx has enough gold and manages to get a foothold of safety/advantage in a fight she WILL GET TO YOU, BLOW YOU UP, AND THEN TAKE YOUR TOWERS.  This is good, it's character defining and it's what we'd like her to excel at.\n\nThe weakness is supported by the ramp up on minigun, the cast/arm times on all her spells/ and the damage w/distance mechanic on the R.  If you manage to close with an unprepared Jinx she's going to have a hard time dealing with you.  Her spells leave her vulnerable, her AS needs to ramp for full DPS, chompers take a while to arm, **and ideally she can't just Graves ult you for a burst of power unless you're incredibly low on health.  **\n^^^^^that last thing is where we found a possible problem. Jinx was winning a number of engagements off the sheer burst power of her ultimate, even at pointblank range.  This to me is out of line with her strength/weakness profile. \n\nIn summary:\n**Jinx is a hyper carry who can kill every single member of your team from extreme ranges if left alone but if you jump on her she should be at a severe disadvantage. ** Nerfing the pointblank ultimate makes the weakness more true and allows us to preserve her strengths in light of extreme power in solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-04-22T02:27:05.758+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":58,"body":"If I'm in a 1v1 engagement and people are jumping on me, but I get them low, I should be able to blow them up with  Super Mega DEATH Rocket.  I shouldn't be punished for them jumping on top of me.  I already have enough problems when they're there.  Yea, I have my execute still, but if there's no base damage to back it up, it seems like it won't matter.  It'll be a waste for me to even try to launch the spell.\n\nAnd you're also only looking at when she gets jumped on.  What about when she's in lane and gets a gank and there are two low players running away down their lane.  I'll no longer be able to snipe them because it's not going to ramp up in time.  In fact, it encourages players to run closer to the rocket so that it does the 25 damage instead of the med/max damage possibilities.  After 1 second, it's back to normal, but that 1 second is a long time, especially when trying to hit a champ that's nearby that may be low.  \n\nI understand your view, and you're obviously the designer so I can't argue with how you perceive Jinx and what she is.  In fact, I think you hit on a lot of things that are very true.  But you said it yourself.  Jinx has a very dedicated playerbase and we play her a lot.  There should be a higher than average win rate when those playing her almost always consider her their main.  So trying to take solo queue win rate into it is a poor choice.  If this was someone that didn't have as loyal a playerbase, that's one thing.  But when you even admit that they average Jinx player in Ranked has 31+ games on her, there's a reason she's winning.\n\nI don't know how many times I've been tower dove as Jinx and had three people on top of me.  I flash away and put out some Fishbones on them to see them get fairly low.  I'm then able to fire my SMDR from point blank and pick up a double or triple kill because of enemies' overagression.  That won't be possible with these nerfs.  They'll just laugh at my squeaky toy flying at them.\n\n\ngypsylord, I respect your work and your design for Jinx and other champs, so I'm going to ask you this and I hope for a response.  You've played (I sure hope you've played) this nerfed version of Jinx.  Do you believe it impacts her playstyle?  Will she lose those close trades that she might normally win because of this?\n\nAnd lastly, let's say we're in a normal laning situation.  I've got a B.F. Sword and Doran's Blade.  I get dove onto and the enemies get low, making me fire off my SMDR onto them.  Let's say we're level 7.  How much health is the enemy going to need to be at for me to land a kill?\n\n\nI understand your desire to make her a little less overbearing and crazy, but she's got a doctor's note man!  Cutting the minimum damage by 100/140/180 seems way over the top for any nerf.  My tier 3 isn't even as strong as my tier 1.  Jinx has only ever received nerfs since her release, whether it was her W, her E, or her Q.  This just seems a bit overboard.","replies":[{"poster":"Gixia","date":"2015-04-22T02:34:58.911+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FatedTitan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BiL98QHi,comment-id=000700050005,timestamp=2015-04-22T02:27:05.758+0000)\n>\n> If I'm in a 1v1 engagement and people are jumping on me, but I get them low, I should be able to blow them up with  Super Mega DEATH Rocket.  **I shouldn't be punished for them jumping on top of me. ** I already have enough problems when they're there. \n\nActually, yes, you should. That's the entire point that Gypsylord was making. Jinx has good range, and does insane damage at range. Somebody getting in her face is supposed to be her weakness, and thus if your positioning is off too much that you allow them to get on top of you, _you should be punished for it._","replies":[{"poster":"FatedTitan","date":"2015-04-22T02:40:32.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":29,"body":"Dives under tower don't mean you're out of position.

If you are in the middle of the lane and get jumped, you should die. \n\nAnd if a tank jumps you under tower, Jinx has OTHER ways to deal with it. Use chompers to cut of their escape route. Better yet, put chompers JUST behind them, so they have a choice: Run now and you can get out before they arm, and follow me and be committed to staying under tower. \n\nNot to mention, Jinx's \"power profile\" SHOULD NOT favor her on the defensive, she is a pushing/siege-ing powerhouse, and she should not excel at defending towers against tanks. LoL is no longer a game entirely dictated by the ADC's power as it used to be. Jinx will be dived by tanks and killed. Corkis will be forced to run away. Contrast this to Vayne, who is the optimal tank-shredder, and would not be likely to be dived and lose. But Vayne does not have the range to handle people like Jinx, nor does she have the burst that Graves has, or the mid-game power of Corki. ADC's are not longer the cure-all to the issue of the enemy team. Rather, they have inherent strengths and weaknesses as they should have for a long time. \n\nAs for the League of Tanks comment, tanks are a bit of the flavor of the month. They are strong because no one has had to deal with a truly strong tank in a while. Yes, cinderhulk might be a bit on the strong side, but even disregarding that, strong pushing ADCs such as Jinx and Sivir have high winrates. This indicates a main weakness of a tank: They do best when they are the ones initiating. In soloQ, half of the fights fought a lost or one by which side initiates first and with more confidence. Tanks are not good on defense.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AD Yuumi","date":"2015-04-22T04:25:54.949+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FatedTitan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BiL98QHi,comment-id=000700050005,timestamp=2015-04-22T02:27:05.758+0000)\n\n> gypsylord, I respect your work and your design for Jinx and other champs, so I'm going to ask you this and I hope for a response.

After changes, Riot always said \"we'll follow up if need be.\" but honestly, the followup time to absolute gutting of champions is awful. Look at the Cass rework as an example, or even Skarner. It takes months, after a drastic change, to bring champions back in line. No offense gypsylord, especially because you've done some pretty fine balancing, but the followup time is trash, and really only discourages me from having faith in the balancing of champions.\n\nEdit: Or Olaf, or Elise, or Veigar, the list goes on...

How do you have to change your play to make Jinx work just as well? You will probably have to play more safely in lane because ganks and dives will be more dangerous.

Not all changes need time to adjust to, most changes are immediately noticeable in ways that dedicated X-mains can tell you about, sometimes without even testing. As a Morgana main, I can tell you that any nerf to her puddle, even 5 damage per tick, would be enough to make her nigh-unplayable in midlane. I don't need to play her more than a game to tell you that result. Number changes are the easiest to tell if something is too-far in one direction, and this is one of those instances where the numbers have been pushed way too far in one direction.\n\nAt the end of the day this is about follow-up time, not whether or not these nerfs are too far or not far enough to bring Jinx back in line. Riot has had a LONG history of letting champions sit in obscurity after nerfs, or letting champions dominate for months after buffs. They aren't consistent with how quickly the follow-up on changes. With that being said, it is perfectly fair-game to point that out to gypsylord, because his definition of follow-up may be 3 months from now, or maybe its on the next PBE patch, or even the next patch to go live. And because there is no guarantee for it to be *any* of those, the point of follow-up times being trash still stands.","replies":[{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-22T12:51:23.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Starlighte,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BiL98QHi,comment-id=0007000500050003000000010000,timestamp=2015-04-22T10:22:37.023+0000)\n>\n> No sudden moves were made?

Virtually every nerf this season has been followed up if it affects a champion too much. Veigar got further work (perhaps he is not done yet), Kassadin got work, I think Leblanc got more work done, although that may have been at the end of last season. \nThis is always done after a few patches - the changes are allowed to settle first. This is also true for nerfing stronger champions. They are taking longer to nerf them, possibly to see if people find new ways around them. But they still get followed up!\n\nPossibly the reason there is no guarantee of follow up is that most nerfs and buffs do as is intended. They lower or increase the power of a champion without destroying them or sending them to a permaban status. These don't need follow up.\n\nIs there any nerf recently you think hasn't been followed up at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-22T16:44:38.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Is there any nerf recently you think hasn't been followed up at all?\n\nElise was nerfed a while ago and has been left in a miserable state. Zilean was reworked when he was already terrible, and he's not any closer to being balanced. Azir's been allowed to rot. Kassadin got nerfed hard and has gotten extremely cautious compensation that hasn't made a significant difference. Syndra is apparently still competing for lowest winrate, so I'd bring that up too. I'm still not even remotely impressed that it took them around 9 months after Skarner's second rework to finally get him into a balanced state.\n\nRiot hasn't done well on this.

Jinx's snowballing and hyper-carry potential is intended to be strong and we like it where it is so this change is targeted at amping up her main weakness (gets wrekt if jumped on).  IF THIS CHANGE GOES TOO FAR WE'LL FOLLOW UP ON IT.  THE GOAL HERE IS A SLIGHT TONING DOWN OF JINX'S POWER.\n\nShe's the best ADC in the game right now. I think she needs more than 'slightl'.\n\n> Generally we like Jinx being a strong champ in League of Legends. Even when winning she has a lot of inbuilt counterplay which makes losing to her feel a lot less demoralizing.  Thanks to her general immobility combined with the delayed and conditional nature of her spells players tend to come out of games against Jinx with gameplans on how they're going to beat her next time.\n\nNo, I generally feel more like 'fucking crit rocket destroyed us, if she wasn't so lucky we would have won that' and 'my tower was at full and that was a normal wave. How'd she kill that so fast?'\n\n> Going off of this, it is likely that Jinx \"at balance\" sits at above a 50% winrate.  This partially stems from the nature of her power profile. Jinx is highly snowbally, especially in AoE focused teamfights, and is one of the best characters in the game at taking objectives after killing off the enemy team. This is going to contribute to a higher number of wins in solo queue where the \"group and push\" strategy is so prevalent (Jinx loves grouping and pushing!).  People group, teamfights happen, Jinx AoE's things, and 1 kill tends to lead to 1-4 more + towers and dragons.\n\n...Honestly? This feels like favoritism. Your points make sense, but I really can't get past 'we will considered her balanced if she wins more games than she loses'. She might not be so great in pro games (but she still shows up all the time) but bleh. I hate Jinx's kit and I am not happy this is what you guys are going with her.\n\n> Additionally, it's worth mentioning Jinx's dedicated player base. If you run into a Jinx player on live that person is going to have 31 games on her on average,  That's up there with other \"I main dis guy forever\" champs like Yasuo, Lee Sin, and Riven.  For comparison, Graves has a similar play rate to Jinx (they're neck and neck for most picked ADC), and yet the average Graves player only has 16 games on him.  This isn't meant to be a knock on Graves but more a highlight on the fact that many of the Jinx's you run into out there have played her A LOT and as such you'd expect a higher win rate out of her due to player experience.\n\nI'm going to quote you on that for future discussions RE winrate and pickrate. I agree, personally, and I'm going to throw 'a rioter used this as an argument so riot is balancing with this in mind' in the face of people who think that means nothing.\n\n> So I've gone over why we're okay with Jinx being strong so in that case why are we nerfing her? Well the thing is there's strong and then there's I AM THE GOD OF SOLO QUEUE strong.  Jinx is trending towards the latter and has only been getting better each patch.  She's got one of the highest winrates in the game at 55% across all elos and that combined with her insane playrate is cause for alarm. We felt some light tuning would be appropriate to level the playing field vs. other ADC's so we looked across her kit and asked ourselves \"is there anything Jinx is doing right now that maybe she shouldn't be?\"\n\nWhy do some champs get 'light tuning' when they're the best in their category and some get, well, olafed?

I hate Jinx's kit and I am not happy this is what you guys are going with her.\n\nThis is less favoritism and more an acceptance of certain things that are powerful in LoL (especially in solo queue).  Players tend to overwhelmingly favor grouping and pushing as a strategy in solo queue so it stands to reason that champions with strong team fight capability (Amumu for example) are more favored to win in those situations.  Amumu may very well suffer in a split push meta.  Could be that he loses a lot more when against a good splitting Tryndamere.  That's not going to be reflected as much in his winrate however because splitpushing strategies are much rarer than teamfighting strategies (even though they may be equally or more viable against an Amumu).\n\n> \n> I'm going to quote you on that for future discussions RE winrate and pickrate.
