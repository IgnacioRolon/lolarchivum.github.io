My crew and I will be going through the semifinals, but won&#039;t be able to attend due to the OPness of Mother&#039;s Day.  \r\n\r\nYes, Mother&#039;s Day.  That time of the year where we celebrate our moms.  When I told my mom that I&#039;d be going to MSI and the dates, her exact words were &quot;Well you can choose which one you love most I suppose.&quot;  Needless to say, I can&#039;t go to the Finals.  Instead, I&#039;ll be driving home 7 hours through the night to make sure I get back in time.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to venture out there and say that I&#039;m not the only one in this predicament.  I&#039;m sure there are many that will be in attendance that need to head back to their homes to celebrate their Moms on Sunday.  So this is what I&#039;m asking of you, Riot.  If TSM reaches the semi-finals, could you please allow them to play the first one, as a courtesy to those like me who will have to drive through the night?  This way, we can sneak out after maybe Game 1 of the 2nd semi and hit the road, watching the rest on Twitch in the car.  Half the arena isn&#039;t going to empty out, but for people like me, this is the difference in getting home at 2 am and 5 am.  \r\n\r\nSo please, consider those of us who will be driving to get home for Mother&#039;s Day and schedule TSM to play the early semi-final if they reach that point.  It would help myself and others out a whole lot if you did.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-05-12T16:00:12.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am so glad my Mother isn't a bitch... she'd never pull that stuff.

It's an excuse for companies to sell you overpriced greeting cards. Of course Mothers are important, but if yours gauges how much you care entirely based off of this trumped up hallmark holiday.... then there's something wrong with her. If she wouldn't have let you celebrate it before you left or after you got back... then there's a problem there.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rhlax","date":"2015-05-05T12:16:33.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Well you can choose which one you love most I suppose.\" \n\nBring your mom to the game!

And it's not like Mother's Day is the only day of the year you can show appreciation for your mother. Go to MSI, have a great time, and the day after you get home take your mother out to dinner and a movie. Maybe even take her shopping. Call her from MSI and tell her you love her, and that she better start thinking of places she wants to eat when you get home. It may be a day or two late, but you get to have your cake and eat it too.","replies":[{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-05-07T17:44:43.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BastionKross,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=oeNBJczr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-05T12:27:31.155+0000)\n>\n> \"Well you can choose which one you love most I suppose.\"\n> \n> That's a guilt trip if I ever heard one.
