I mean look at champions like kassadin there were plenty of people in about every nerf saying that karthus had the lowest burst of every mid lane champion and despite being perma banned picked in all elo's apparentlly kassadin really sucked and if anything needed buffs. Now there are reasons kassadin was strong he had mobility. Now lets look at lissandra though she isn't as mobile as many champs and low burst they have to do this because of her kit and playstyle. If they give her to much burst she litterally just W E's Ults and gets the most free kills ever especially when fed. If they give her to m uch manna she can poke a tiny bit and do the same thing. Don't tell me this isn't true because lissandra was becoming top pick mid lane for a while before they nerfed her a while back and still saw some play top. For the same reasons they nerfed leblanc and talon. Get a little ahead and then all you do is use your huge ass gape closer with your point and click cc or silence and get free kills all over the place. Also to add to this lissandra is also aoe and has a gap closer so is safer in lane then say annie. Riot doesn't like champions that if they get any sort of lead they can carry the entire game with no counter play at all it's almost like if karthus got ahead he had the ability to one shot the entire enemy team with his ult and it could go through zhonya's and banshee's\n\nAlso this is late game. Late game lissandra doesn't spam enough spells to need much manna.
