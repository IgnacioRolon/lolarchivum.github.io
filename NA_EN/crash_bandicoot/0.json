When you toggle through the songs and come back to Kinetic she starts to speak with her voice from her default skin. This has happened in two different games now. Definitely not a gamebreaking bug by any means, but it kinda ruins the feel of the skin, and it&#039;d be great if you could look into this.

That said, it's still fairly new, and there are edge cases where something may not work as intended. \n\nThe bug reports have been extremely helpful in helping us iron out the odd cases that may exist.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EPiKDJ","date":"2016-01-09T01:12:08.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Earlier I noticed around mid game her taunts and default sound pack goes back to her original skins presets","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-13T17:19:00.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's currently an issue regarding Lulu's Polymorph and DJ Sona's default VO.
