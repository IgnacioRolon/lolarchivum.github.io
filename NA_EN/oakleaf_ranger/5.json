Back when this character was more druidic (early, early in the process) I was researching historical druids in the area and it rekindled my appreciation for the play. The team massaged the name to sound a little more in line with Freljordian influences and the name just stuck. Ivern was one of the few times naming was super-easy. Usually we make spreadsheets upon endless spreadsheets of names with different meanings.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-12-19T21:40:54.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you aware that the radical invern means winter in latin languages?

This post is not worthy of a downvote at all, what is wrong with people?\n\nI wasn't too familiar with Ivan's of Russia  but pretty much the first sentence of anything about it states Ivan was known as Ivan The Terrible or Ivan The Fearsome.\n\nSo we also know pre-tree Ivern was a fearsome man himself, like absolute monster of a man. (A pirate or raider I believe?) so I really wouldn't be too surprised if the name was slightly influenced.","replies":[{"poster":"Oakleaf Ranger","date":"2016-12-17T20:46:59.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There were multiple famous Ivan's but the thing that makes me wonder is because there was Ivan the terrible and multiple Ivan the greats (I think there were more than 1).
