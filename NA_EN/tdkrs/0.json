But I am not high level enough. I'm sorry._\n\nI  want to report a bug and I have suggestions  to the training mode and instant feedback system.\n\nI'm actually from Taiwan Server and I'm not sure if the terms I use below are correct. You tolerance is appreciated. I got banned for being toxic/shit talking recently and I am receiving a 10-game team chat restriction. In the old client, it shows how many game left I will be in team chat restriction every time I login, however, in the new client,  it keep showing 10 games left. That's the bug.\n\nI tried the training mode, I think it will be great if I can sommon the Baron instead of fastforwarding the game.\n\nFinally, in the instant feedback system, I think \"Intentional Feeding\" is not good enough to report some intentionally terribly played players. Some multi-queue players just keep feeding, ignoring teammates' alert and starting team fight blindly.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T03:36:00.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're intending to leave feedback on these features, I recommend reposting this to our [**Miscellaneous Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where this type of feedback goes.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"TDKRs","date":"2017-02-15T03:50:31.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It requires me to be Level 7 or higher to post.
