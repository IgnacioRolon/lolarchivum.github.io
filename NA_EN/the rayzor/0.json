I made a name where I just play her exclusively because she's just fun.  Versatile in her ability to go top, middle, adc and even jungle.  Sadly these roles only really happen in normal games and her play rate in ranked high level is abysmal.  I want to offer up some ideas on what might make her become just a little more playable in a competitive game.  Hopefully the tweaks recommended would give more knowledgeable champion balancing-type people ideas while enabling a devoted Quinn player to take advantage of high skill-gap maneuvers.  \r\n\r\n1.  Her E's mobility is kind of lackluster.  There are the cool plays where you flip back over a wall away from the bruiser and kill him over the wall - which is cool but so gimmicky.  The damage, without harrier at least, is also very poor.  I think it would make sense to drop the damage component of it while giving it better mobility - similar to Kallista - where right clicking during the attack animation makes you move in that direction.  Why does Quinn have to back flip back in the direction that she attacked?  It would make for some awesome plays - if she could flip in the direction of her right click from her enemy - 360 degrees of possibilities with, ideally, the same radius (her AA range).  \r\n\r\n2.  Make her E a separate cooldown with both Quinn and Valor or make Valor's basic attacks reduce E's cooldown.  Using E in Valor form right now is a recipe for disaster in a team fight and since its damage is not noticeable without Harrier you sacrifice a ton of damage by using it.  Since you lose Harrier in valor form your passive is useless, also.  It doesn't really make sense realistically anyway for Valor and Quinn to have E on the same cooldown - they're two different creatures doing two different things.  =p  \r\n\r\n3.  When exiting Valor in a hail of arrows the damage is basically non-existent - it doesn't scale well at all.  It can never reach its full damage potential either with the way the damage is calculated.  Consider making it more like Riven's ultimate where it does a percentage of missing health damage in an AoE.\r\n\r\nWhile I think #1 is really what she needs to get into competitive play, and allow for some real exciting displays of skill, I think a derivation of any of these enhancements would really help.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-09T15:58:44.190+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really, Quin just seems like she needs mechanical touch ups, not any sort of real changes.

But vault isn't only used for mobility, it can be used as and interrupt to stop channeled spells like {{champion:55}} ult, or {{champion:30}} and few others like Nune, Fiddle etc.\n\n\n\n\nLimiting some of {{champion:133}} mobility does feel really bad for the player, but I'm not sure giving her more mobility in this way is the answer.\n\n\nBut when speaking of mobility it's important to look at the entire package, using harriers mark gives a decent chunk of flat movement speed for 3 seconds\n(20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60), but since this is tied to Heightened Senses which is normally leveled last, you don't really get its benefit till late game. \n\n\nHer ult, Tag Team offers a lot of out of combat movement speed, starting at 80% and scaling to 100%, but the soft cap does ruin that quite a bit. It also provides decent in combat mobility, starting at 20% and ending at 40%, allowing you escape some bad situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber 2 is interesting, using your gap closer as Valor should put you in a bad spot, since you've effectively gone from being a ranged carry, to an assassin. Giving escape to assassins always leads to more problems see {{champion:238}}, and would give her more burst; but Quinn is a special case where you could potential allow it, since it's based on two different forms, and she loses her assassin potential.\n\n\n\n\nNumber 3 already sort of exists; the damage is increased by 1% for every 1% of the target's missing health, it's not as good as {{champion:92}}, but it does offer a larger aoe. But the cooldown on Quinns' ult is horrible (140/110/80)\n\n\n\n\nQuinn does have some other weird problems, Valor marking targets always feels wrong to me if you don't use vault (which is essentially you marking the target), the first auto attack after landing your blind will always hit you ({{champion:17}}  shares this problem), and cancelling her auto attack animation is just painful, especially with a harrier proc.\n\n\nFixing her bugs should be first priority, since realistically they limit her potential; from there you could do number 2, and see how that goes.","replies":[{"poster":"Black Star 1299","date":"2015-02-10T01:28:32.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number 2 is a little interesting too:\n\nValor and Quinn are really interesting pairs:\n\nQuinn can do ranged burst damage (With the double proc passive q)\nValor does melee continuous damage over time(Less burst with only Q and ult, but more continous with the attack speed boost)\n\nThey're sort of opposite against the current assassin and adc meta.

I really like her duelist niche as a marksman, which is a really unique role that no other marksman fills.

I really like your suggestions and think they would each help in some way.  Maybe not all of them together, but each one has merit.  Another idea I had been bouncing around personally, is to have consuming harrier procs reduce the cooldown on her ult slightly.  It could even make thematic sense.  Valor is pleased that Quinn is listening to his suggestions and is more willing to fight or whatever.  Like, half a second on minions and a full second on champions.  Or just champions.  I imagine that it would work similar to Karma's passive (her's is 2 seconds and 1s for AAs, on an ult with half as long a cooldown at Qinn's shortest).  This could give you more access to your ult and not make it feel like you always have to \"save\" it.

She's great. I have made my own thread on her issues (which I really should be bumping....) here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Ehqc93PA-in-a-month-quinn-will-be-2-years-old-time-to-fix-her-rito . Now, on to your suggestions.\n\nHer E is fairly ideal right now. Its mobility power is not in repositioning or gap-closing, but rather gap-extending. Its primary use is making distance between you and enemy divers. Not only does it move you, but it applies a hefty CC (mini-stun and 50% slow) to the target, as well as damaging them and allowing for increased follow-up damage with Harrier. I do not see any reason to change this ability drastically as it serves its purpose well.\n\nSeparate cooldowns are something Quinn and Valor can never have - primarily because Tag Team really isn't a form change akin to Jayce or Nidalee but rather a steroid reminiscent of Riven's ult, or even Olaf's. Giving Quinn and Valor separate cooldowns, even if it were just on E, would drastically increase her early-mid game burst damage and make her broken. You really shouldn't be using E to dive into teamfights. You should save your ult for assassinating out of place carries or for cleaning up teamfights.\n\nSkystrike's damage is fairly low, but really the main reason for this is because Skystrike isn't the main component of her ulti. Skystrike is a noticeable nuke, but the true power of Tag Team is in mobility and reliable assassinations. I wouldn't say Quinn needs more damage on Skystrike, but rather just have the damage cap at 75% missing health, rather than how it is now where it does the most damage when the enemy is dead.\n\nWhile I understand the concern for Quinn, most of her weakness is in various bugs with her Q and E, as well as how bad her AA animations are. She really can't get net buffs right now without nerfs to her melee bullying potential, but I believe that bugfixes/QoL changes can get her in a healthy, balanced, pickable spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Markus Vakarian","date":"2015-02-09T15:21:56.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2) alone would be enough for me\nE+AA (passive)+R+E (to go in melee range)+Q (blind)+AA....\nThat's the combo we want\nAnd don't tell me it would be op...as already said,the damage of Quinn's E is very very low. It applies passive?? yes sure but you have to hit again for it. And if you consider that Darius' Q attacks applies passive and it still does a lot of damage...\nLow damage would have sense if it applies passive \"on hit\" but not this way.\n\nLow damage on ultimate is true too,but i think that if Quinn gets all these things she would be too strong\nAs i said,not CD shared on E would be enough for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedWedding","date":"2015-02-09T15:00:43.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Glad to see my favorite scout is getting some attention.\n\nI think your E mobility suggestion is really cool, but I do not know if it is very feasible with the amount of damage it provides with both an AA reset and passive proc-- a lot of the power budget is devoted to that I do believe. And it slows. And it interrupts things like dashes, Kat ults, etc... even if we remove the damage component the ability is still very powerful. While it would be freakin' awesome to dictate where we vault, I would much rather keep the additional utility the ability has than lose it. \n\nI very much disagree about the skystrike, actually. It's an effective execute to round out the tag team assassination pattern, and the AoE on it  is massive. You *will* hit an entire team with it during a teamfight, a fact that should not be discounted. I would of course love to see the damage increase, but that would put her assassination potential in her ultimate form a bit over the top for such a versatile character imo. But, as one or two rioters are wont to say, I'm not a designer. I think her power budget is pretty well spent on her abilities, but I could be spectacularly wrong.\n\nAs for sharing cooldowns- I think it makes sense for them to share, but I also think it is annoying. I like the idea of having Valor's AA's reduce the dash cooldown, I think that adds some really interesting play patterns. However, I think it could add a potentially oppressive chase potential- the target gap opens, we e to close, then aa a few times and they flash, we e to close again. Not to mention the MS boost on top of that. I think to have the AA's reduce cd, we'd have to sacrifice some base cooldown, which is iffy. But I would love for something like that to show up. Hm. \nAlso, a comment on the e. If you feel like it is suicide to use it in some situations as Valor, remember you can pop  your R again halfway through the jump. So you dash to them as Valor, but bounce off as Quinn, dealing skystrike damage and proccing the passive and slow. So keep an eye on that- it's really useful in some situations like under tower executions.","replies":[{"poster":"RedWedding","date":"2015-02-09T15:01:29.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also that E change would be so freakin' badass.

Interesting proposition, but I can't say much to it as I haven't gotten a chance to play Kalista, so I wouldn't be able to understand the control of the ability very well.\n\n2. Separate cooldowns on E makes complete sense if you think about it realistically. I would suggest making Valor's E a fixed distance dash though, similar to Fizz's Urchin Strike. The cooldown reduction with basic attacks as Valor may be over the top, but it could be attempted.\n\n3. I have a solution for this: ** Harrier's reapplication timer is reduced with each basic attack (Increased time between markings to compensate). While in Tag Team, Valor can apply Harrier to enemies, but cannot trigger them. Basic attacks refresh the duration of Harrier on an enemy when attacking as Valor (or similar effect). Skystrike now triggers Harrier.**\n\nIn conjunction with the cooldown reduction on-hit with E that was proposed, Quinn would scale fairly well with attack speed now, her passive bonus from W may need to take a small hit, but I can be content with it if we get both of those effects.","replies":[{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2015-02-10T11:05:44.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes her one of the most powerful assassins lol.

It's a very versatile ultimate, but I don't think LoL is a game where an ADC has a 140 second cooldown on her ultimate anymore.  I mean it's almost a fun minute longer than Jinx has and how much better is it to finish a fight without having to get in the middle of it?  \n\nI thought that Valor should have a longer range on Vault and change the tooltip to \"Dive\".  As Quinn ranks up her ultimate, Valor gets an increase to the range on his Dive.  \n\nI think that some kind of reset mechanism on her Vault wouldn't be bad, like casting Skystrike refreshes her Vault cooldown, or if she gets a kill during Skystrike, her Vault is refreshed.  It's a low damage move on it's own, but it does carry the Harrier mark onto it's target, so that's a potential problem.\n\nThe biggest problem with Quinn is that Graves exists.  Two AoE burst attacks that you can frontload into a team fight, a defensive passive that's pure gold in the lane, and a blind that isn't blocked by minions/tanks is just plain more desirable than a champion who's biggest strength comes cleaning up at the end of the fight.  I mean, has anyone at Riot even compared the damage numbers/coefficients on Collateral Damage and Skystrike?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Markus Vakarian","date":"2015-02-10T11:55:55.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"another thing i noticed is that her blind doesn't really work well\nUsing Q on an enemy that is not attacking you yet,should blind him since his first attack (the projectile is not mid way) but no......the first attack of this enemy will do damage,but i don't really know if the 1.5s starts when you hit or later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-02-09T23:14:01.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me personally, I think her abilities are fine in power, besides maybe skystrike, but what I really want is a way for her to use her passive in bird form, because atm, her bird form normally does less damage than her ranged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pineconn","date":"2015-02-09T22:58:41.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having played Quinn quite a bit, I think she needs only a few things to be looked at. First, obviously, her AA lag. It's atrocious. Fix that foremost. \n\nPast that, her kit is pretty versatile. You can max Q for damage, W for utility, and E for mobility. I like to max W second for the AS/MS, and your ult is much stronger in the midgame to help her scale to her normally subpar late game. So how would I fix her late game?\n\nYeah, adding a health cap to Skystrike would be good. Maybe buffing her Skystrike level 3 damage would help, too. (Riot has been experimenting with nonlinear base damage, like Ahri's E.)\n\nBut the number one thing I'd like to see is a cooldown reset of Vault (her E) when Skystrike is cast. This would open windows of opportunity for Quinn to ult into a skirmish or team fight, do damage/assassinate, then Vault back out of the fight to proceed to kite. Currently her ult is suicidal in team fights, and I believe this will help. This will not buff top Quinn in lane, which I know Riot is weary of doing (except for the fringe case where you ult, E in, Skystrike, then E out just to get another Harrier proc). A slight nerf to Quinn's early game might be in order for this change, however... maybe making the blind last 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5s from a flat 1.5s. Or something, idk.\n\nJust my thoughts. I don't think Quinn needs an overhaul (new splash, though?) or something like separate Quinn/Valor cooldowns (as that would be way too bursty). Just some nudges and some added functionality to her E (which wouldn't be unprecedented... Singed recently got a root as a pure buff).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitten of Evil","date":"2015-02-09T20:33:42.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is way too buggy, like release Azir. Fix the bugs before giving her substantive changes, imo.\nHer passive doesn't always proc an enhanced AA right after it shows up, her E sometimes puts her out of range or vaults her in weird directions, her auto-attack speed is noticeably different when it's passive-enhanced than when it's not, her blind sometimes doesn't work right away, and she has really weird projectile mechanics that make it hard to orb-walk (sometimes it will cancel your attack if you move while the arrow is almost at the enemy)","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-02-09T16:27:17.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Didnt read past \"Quin\" downvoted based on that :P","replies":[]}]}
