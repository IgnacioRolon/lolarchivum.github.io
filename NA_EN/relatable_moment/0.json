She either has to land a spear or trap. We can argue about how easy/hard that is, but that's not really my point... the bummer about kassadin ult is that he can blink long distances whenever he wants with no proactive play (like nidalee) beforehand. Nidalee's gapcloser involves additional strategy/gameplay; kassadin's is a low-cd \"I-positioned-poorly-but-oh-well-who-cares-R\" ability.\n\nI don't think kass is misbalanced by much (if at all) but if they were to change something about him I think they should do something besides tweak the numbers on his ult. Maybe reduce the mana cost/mana scaling, increase the damage, but have **a significant cast time that *decreases *with ult stacks**. Something that bugs me about his kit is that he's nearly untouchable unless he wants to go in. I think there should be more risk/reward involved in his play style; with a change like that, Kass would have to proactively decided whether or not he wants to be mobile in the near future. The reward for choosing correctly is that he gains additional damage (and said mobility), the penalty is that he stacked his ult at an inopportune time and blew through a lot of resources.\n\nTLDR I don't like the change to Kass's ult either but for different reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Daedalus871","date":"2015-02-21T20:11:50.713+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This actually gave me an idea that I think could be fun:\n\nRift Walk base range is decreased to 400.\nFor each stack of Rift Walk, it gains 100 range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"relatable moment","date":"2015-02-21T18:38:09.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I'm going to have to do some more research on kassadin before I start discussing things but I'm confused on whether Riot is trying to define kassadin's role or if they are trying to balance him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2015-02-21T21:13:21.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have nothing against Kassadin, and I have respect for those who play an off-meta champion (seeing as I'm a Veigar main), but his passive is enormously powerful for midlane. Passively resisting 15% of all magic damage (the primary damage source in midlane) while also never getting creepblocked is something that a lot of people don't talk about, and it's a pretty powerful passive. Add onto that a damaging AoE slow, a point-and-click attack that grants him a shield, bonus magic damage and temporary range to his AA's, all topped with a 700 range instant teleport that he can use **multiple times** and that damages you in an AoE area makes for a pretty frustrating matchup for many champs.\n\nNow like I said I don't hate Kass, but I feel like the nerf to his teleport range isn't that devastating considering he can just use it multiple times anyway.
