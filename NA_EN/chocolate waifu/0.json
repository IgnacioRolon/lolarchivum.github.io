All I want to know is why Riot is leaving champions that are getting new animations, such as Maokai, MF, Fiora, without new default recall animations. I mean if they fixed up a couple animations on the champion, why not give it a recall animation? It is understandable to not give recalls to champions who just received TU&#039;s. But seeing these new, fresh animations, and models, just standing there when they recall is sorta sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Jofeyy","date":"2015-07-26T22:39:21.730+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every champ should have a unique recall animation.
