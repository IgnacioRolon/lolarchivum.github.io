Problem is, I literally can't go to that page without it instantly logging into my smurf lol. Even if I log out, it won't give me the option to log into my main, it just says, \"You can safely leave this page now\" and if I do, then go back to the pickem page, it instantly logs me back into my smurf.\n\nI know one \"solution\" would be to reset my browser cache, but that's a pain in the ass for other reasons, I don't want it to reset everything else, and it shouldn't be an issue to begin with is sort of what I'm getting at.\n\nWhat do?\n\nedit: Literally 10 seconds after making this post I did my pickem using a different browser, so yeah there's a simple \"work around\" solution. Regardless, I think the issue is still annoying, so consider this a suggestion post to look into that and try to make switching accounts more intuitive (or if it's entirely my fault, by all means tell me what I did wrong, because I'll gladly admit if I fked up here... lol)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T21:50:51.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea so, you already knew that your browser cache was saving your info. The only ways around that are to clear the cache for that website, clear the entire cache, or use an entirely different browser. \n\nIt's not an issue of how our website is setup, that's just how web browsers work in general and there aren't really other ways around it.","replies":[{"poster":"StealthyF0x","date":"2017-10-03T19:46:17.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an issue of the site though, because I logged out and it doesn't stay logged out. Every other site I use will \"save\" me being logged out if I choose to do so, but specifically the Pickem's page for whatever reason instantly logs into this account just by default, it's weird. For example I can log out of my gmail right now and log into a different gmail, or log out of my netflix and log into a new netflix etc. I can't log out of my pickems and log into a new pickems though, because when I revisit the page after logging out, it's logged right back in.\n\nI know it sounds kind of confusing, but I'm tellin ya man, it's an issue with the league page at least when compared to other websites.\n\nRegardless, it's not a massive issue, I just think it's weird that the pickem's page is an outlier here, and if you guys wanna do tests to try to reproduce what happens to me, you might see what I meant. If you don't want to do that, well I don't blame you either because I guess it's nowhere near a priority sort of problem. :p","replies":[]}]}]}
