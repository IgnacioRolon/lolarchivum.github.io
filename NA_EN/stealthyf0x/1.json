I only unlock ADCs and a small handful of other champs I enjoy in this game. This just totally ruins that by adding a permanent Warwick into the mix, it's not even a debatable champ for me, I have him unlocked on another account and hes fun jungling, but I don't like him in ARAM at all. \n\nI instantly went to the store purchase history page and checked but it isn't even refundable there. \n\nThis is lame, can I get Warwick locked again somehow? I never thought I'd have to worry about random unavoidable champ unlocks... this is cool for people that want warwick but there needs to be some sort of confirmation prompt for cases like mine...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-01T03:01:37.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awwwwww man.....you might be a little conflicted about wanting this removed here in a second.

Awesome.\n\nYeah I'd love to have that skin on my main account so that's unlucky... but most importantly is being able to play the champs I enjoy I think.\n\nThanks for this reply, puts me at ease haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
