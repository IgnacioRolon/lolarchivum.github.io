Part of that IS certainly to test the optimum build for said champion. \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, it is also for testing sub-optimal builds. \r\n\r\nEVERY SINGLE KAYN GAME IS THE SAME SET OF ITEMS.\r\n\r\nFull AD\r\n\r\nYeah, I get it. He is \"meant\" to be played full AD. \r\n\r\nBut what happens when he is built tank? \r\n\r\n\"He isn't as good\" \r\n\r\nWho knows this really??? I haven't seen anyone do it. I can agree that he wouldn't be \"as good\" in theory, .. but that doesn't mean he isn't still good. \r\n\r\nThere is a chance he might be better than Riot intended him to be. But how will they ever figure that out,. ... IF NOBODY TRIES IT???","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-30T21:19:30.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're totally correct that the PBE is meant to check out and playtest new content, regardless of what it is. Sure, there's a recommended list of items, so many players will select those, and may veer slightly off that path and try a couple new things.\n\nThe good news is, we have internal playtests, and a playtest team, who consistently test other builds as well for new champions. In the end, we've got all bases covered. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-06-30T22:57:28.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured as much, and I am definitely grateful for that. My issue is more that I don't actually get to see anything other than pretty damn close to the exact same build on 20 different YouTube videos. \n\nThis is certainly not a complaint that I have with Riot. I have honestly considered applying for a PBE account for this reason, however I've heard something about a waiting list, .. and I'm not all that good at PVP on Summoner's Rift.","replies":[]}]}]}
