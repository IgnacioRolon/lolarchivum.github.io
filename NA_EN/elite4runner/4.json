Instead, **AWE** diverts a percentage of post-mitigated damage received to the user's mana pool. This percentage increases based on the user's bonus mana. \n\nIf the user has no mana resource, or runs out of mana, they receive full damage instead.\n\nEdit:\n\nI did have an alternative in mind, and it actually occured to me that I didn't take into account there being an evolved form of this once tear reached +750. \n\nI wanted to avoid stacking resistances before adding what amounts to damage resistance on top of it because I felt that would be unfair. \n\nSomeone has already suggested making AWE stack health based on mana. The component items might be different in order to make this make sense, but it is possible. \n\nThen when the item evolves, it gains an active that diverts a portion of damage received to mana. Since this would be a temporary active effect with a cooldown, the percentage could be much larger. \n\nEdit 2: \nArchangle's Staff changes 'Mana Charge' so that it generates +8 mana instead of +4, upon mana expenditure.\n\nManamune changes 'Mana Charge' to +5 upon mana expenditure and basic attacks. \n\nI would make this item change 'Mana Charge\" generate +8 upon mana expenditure while in combat with enemy champions or from spells that heal/shield/buff allied units (other than yourself), but still only +4 otherwise.

The 15 extra armor would come from the awe passive. It's not really feasible for it not to give at least 15 armor, because even assuming you are using a champion with really low base mana (Kalista has the lowest at 232 at lvl 1) and farm directly to get the item as fast as possible (without buying tear first and generating extra mana stacks), you should be high enough level for your base mana+250 from base item mana to give you 750 mana total, which is the point at which the passive gives 15 armor.\n\nSo to answer your question, I thought about it, but I honestly am not sure it's actually even possible.

If it was technically possible I would anticipate adding a basic, undocumented check condition to make sure that it gave at least 45 armor. Good catch though!\n\nEdit: Thought I should mention, that the reason I did it this way instead of just adding the +15 onto the base of the item is because I would have to nerf the Awe Passive ratio to keep the same overall value on its own. This in turn would actually result in an overall nerf, because this item would be fantastic when stacked with other mana items (ROA+IBG yes please), and nerfing the Awe passive would hurt that interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"kile147","date":"2018-08-16T23:49:13.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually just looked into champion mana pools even more.\n\nKalista is not actually the worst case scenario here. Despite having the lowest base mana in the game, her respectable growth of +35 per level does her some favors.\n\nTwisted Fate has the lowest base mana in the game at level 18 (656), and has the lowest mana growth as well (+19/level). In this niche case of TF not having manaflow, building a Seeker's, then building it straight into my item I would say that it is actually possible to lose armor in the exchange, because his base mana combined with tear base mana would not equal 750 until he a reached level 9! Once again, this is a pretty remote possibility, but it would probably be worth adding a undocumented condition to cover it.\n\n Fun fact though, if Galio or Fidd cheated the item in at level 1, they would still get the proper combined base armor value. With a base mana of 500 (highest int he game!), they would immediately upon building this have 750 mana and thus get the full 45 armor.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ForFoxSakes","date":"2018-08-16T17:10:56.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What tank needs that kind of mana?
