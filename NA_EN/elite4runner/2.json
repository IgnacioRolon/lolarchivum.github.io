Basic things have been missing from day one because Boards was released in a totally unfinished state and then basically abandoned. I agree that it would be nice if this wasn't the case, but it is. How many regular users does this place even have left? 100? It's dead, Jim.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2020-02-14T04:45:20.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said I didn't accept the facts, .. accepting something as a fact doesn't mean you need to accept that it can't change.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-02-14T04:51:04.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elite4Runner,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=P4dPqUnI,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2020-02-14T04:45:20.271+0000)\n>\n> I never said I didn't accept the facts, .. accepting something as a fact doesn't mean you need to accept that it can't change.\n\nThat it can't change _is_ the fact, though...","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2020-02-14T04:59:36.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao, that's not a fact ... the boards literally changed within the last week. ..

Riot just pushed the new nav bar to every site, and neither noticed nor cared that it broke Boards. Boards has no developer and no investment from Riot. Frankly, I expect it to be taken down entirely soon, possibly even this year.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"l Ryden l","date":"2020-02-19T20:36:17.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rune icons are probably part of a Runes Database somewhere in Riot's LoL API. They have already attached their champs, items, summoner spells, and *stickers?* they'd just need to take it a step further by adding Runes. Though easy to speak of may not be as easy in execution so give the devs some slack.\n\nAs far as icons for (quick charge) effectslike Archangel's Staff, Rod of Ages, etc. Those have been in League since Dominion came out, to let summoners know that in Dominion, games tend to be about 15-20 mins long, therefore required certain items like Rod of Ages (which maxed out in 10 minutes) to max out faster. \n\nI would like to see updated icons though.
