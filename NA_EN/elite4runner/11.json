You can just sit back on the power you've already accumulated and the disparity between the tools you have access too.\n\nIt's ironic, i actually prefer to play at a disadvantage. Though the problem is the lack of strategy needed part to keep pushing the lead. They just snowball and overwhelm you with raw power. If they get ahead, they keep getting head while you're forced to wait on their misplay. The longer they don't misplay, the further behind you get, the bigger the misplay you need to turn it around.\n\nI'll be honest though, when i don't play off-meta picks, which don't require constant outplays to maintain a lead, i find it just as, if not more, less worth playing once i get ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-01-30T18:27:29.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Comebacks have ALWAYS been about capitalizing on the enemy team making mistakes.\nThat IS outplaying them.\n\nIf they play perfectly, then a comeback is impossible, this is and always has been the case.\nHowever, what you can improve upon by playing through games, is your understanding of how to capitalize on what mistakes.\n\nThe better you get at this, the easier it will be to turn small mistakes into comebacks.\n\n\"Oh but comebacks were easier in past seasons\"\nOk yeah, well most of us aren't still leveling accounts.\nOnce you hit a certain point, everyone is steadily improving be they bronze or challenger.\nThe fact of the matter is, you have to improve faster than the people around you.\nYou think you improved over a couple seasons? Good! So did most of the people in Queue with you.\n\nAs the overall skill + Macroplay understanding of the LoL playerbase goes up, the likelihood of these comebacks SHOULD stay the same, right?\nWRONG.\nBecause FF@20 is a thing, people will opt OUT of finishing a losing game, resulting in them not learning how to play from behind.\nThe community (largely low ELO, but also to an extent high elo) as a result of this is learning how to snowball earlygame better than they are learning how to close out winning games, or stage comebacks.\n\nThey are also doing something that contradicts this, though.\nThey are copying (largely) the meta they see at the highest available level of play.\nPros usually play very safe champions that don't lose lanes / earlygames hard. If they do lose hard, then they have a very specific plan, they accounted for it. Maokai is a great example of this. Doesn't matter of Maokai dies in lane and is down 30cs, he is STILL plenty tanky for teamfights, especially since his team is there to back him up and support him.\nThis even seeps into the AD Carry role, where the top tier is UTILITY carries. These champions don't give a damn if they don't win lane. Their utility (CC, vision) is not affected (largely) by gold income.\nThe other thing these champions (the ones pros like to pick) have in common, is they do not like to give up leads easily. EXAMPLES: {{champion:22}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:13}} \nThese champions all have tools to dissuade shutdown attempts, be they disengage, mobility, CC, or INCREDIBLE tankiness. The amount of resources / champions it would take to shut them down (in pro play) is often too high to be worth the risk of dying, or even just losing time invested if you don't succeed.\n\nThis is why people don't understand that the value of vision goes UP when you are behind.\nThis is why people think comebacks are impossible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2017-01-30T13:04:55.715+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in season 3 and 4, comebacks were fun and intense. If you were desperate and resourceful you had enough time to catch up as you scraped together as much cs as possible.\nPersonally, as a total noob back then I endlessly split pushed with pure bloodthirster kog maw. Eventually I had so much freakin AD (500 from bloodthirsters) that they'd need to dedicate 2-3 people to me as long as kassadin wasn't around ;)\nEven in defeat, you could still make things happen. A pick here and there, back to back dragon gold and the odd tower or 2. You felt like you'd accomplished something and put up a decent fight despite losing it all in the end.\nThe tension, the fact that you could see a potential victory and it was all down to YOU! and YOUR TEAM! to make that happen and the process of clawing your way to the top. That's what made it fun to lose for me and why I used to rarely FF (unless they had a fed af pre nerf kassadin XD)\n\nIn those seasons. I WOULD RATHER LOSE THAN WIN! BECAUSE THE TENSION MADE IT THAT DAM GEWD!\n\n\nNow, it just isn't fun to drag it out. Dragon RNG heavily favours the team that's ahead rather than the team that's behind (more items, more dmg/speed because of it and better siege) and due to the sheer snowballyness of the meta-game, a game can be out of your control before you have time to do anything about it. All those little things you could make happen just don't matter. \n1. One pick doesn't mean anything against a team picking you off one by one as you flee from that skirmish.\n2. Towers may be weak, but people can rush to defend them faster than ever.\n3. Sure having dragons would give you an awesome advantage late-game, but what are the chances of you securing enough and even making it there?\n4. The combination of absurd mobility and dmg creep makes any desperate farming attempts painful and frustrating, as the moment you pop up on the minimap, you're dead and that's that.\n5. There is no tension, it's not in your control at all. It's all on the enemy team fucking up extremely badly and you being in a position to capitalise on that fuck up.\n\n\nThis overall just makes it unfun for me compared to what I've experienced in the past. So in that situation, I simply can't be stuffed playing out a game that I won't enjoy so I try to FF to end my suffering. Don't get me wrong, if you say no to the FF I will play out the game as normal, but I will try to ff again if things don't improve.

Had a game where our mid Akali AFK'd like 5 minutes into the game, before she got her gunblade.  We had a Darius top, Malphite jungle, Brand support, and Kog'maw ADC (me).  Literally every team fight I was blown up instantly due to I think the Rengar jungle (old Rengar), so the rest of my team was left fighting 3v5 and normally they traded 3 for 3 or something like that cause Malph and Darius were just monsters this game.  50 minutes into the game, we had no mid inhib and no bot inhib.  I actually did the \"sell boots, buy, place, and sell zz'rot, buy boots again\" trick to help stave off all the super minions trying to threaten our towers.  One teamfight I wasn't instantly killed and we actually got all except the support Soraka and only lost Brand and Darius.

The worst that could happen that game is we lose.  Considering it was a 4v5 basically since the beginning, you just play differently.  You try your best but just accept that whatever happens will happen cause you are at a disadvantage.  If nothing else, take this time to try a different build or something.  Maybe Rageblade Bork Ashe is a good vs the enemy comp.  Maybe tank Ashe with Runaan's and Black Cleaver is better cause your top lane Fiora does more damage.

My team came alive and pushed them out of the base. \n\nBeing down a player we needed some lane pressure so we all built zzrot portals. 2 heading towards bottom and one for mid lane and we pushed top together. The zzrot held off the minions long enough for us to push and win the game.   \n\nTeamwork wins games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tails9016","date":"2017-01-30T14:22:56.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate when a team brings up the surrender vote because we're behind one turret, but have the ability to win team fights.

To assume that people are playing for the reason you are is odd. Most people play on the ladder to climb to a destination to prove their worth. Normal draft tends to be where people care about having a good game. Competitive in league has a slight distorted meaning cause of the ladder and how it changes the goal of the game.\n\n \n> So you are behind, a loss seems likely, if not inevitable, why does that mean you should just give up?\n \nFor rank there was a \"study\" (using term losely) it is more productive to ff at 20 and grind more games in order to climb. As league has matured it is hard and harder for the winning team to actually throw. Especially at the higher Elos. But putting in that kind of work is stressful and tiring, causing people to be able less games at top mentality. \n\n\n> You think a victory is only worth your effort if you are ahead from 5 minutes? \n\nX gold disadvantage verus time management. You are looking at this the wrong way. It is not that people are not a head, it is how far they are behind. Safty playing is again stressful and not very interesting. \n \n> Have you ever actually come back from a seemingly &amp;quot;In the bag&amp;quot; defeat?\n\ncovered \n\n> There are few things that feel better. \n\nlots of things feel better\n\n> Maybe a Pentakill. \n\nMost classes can not even achieve this.\n\n> Could you imagine if professional players had this same mentality? Pro League and other sports. \n\nactually in season 2 and 3 a forfeit used to be common. It actually speed the night up and was interesting to see what was a hopeless situation. Not every team in the world did CJ fire famously held out a few times at 3 inhibs down. The odds were so against the players but they believed in their comp and fought on. I pretty sure the reason ff do not happen anymore is cause Riot games has told the players not to. \n\nThough pro play has gotten pretty good to putting the game to a point where it is a flip of the coin anymore. Super late team fight with everyone having full items, just which side of the map it is happening on. \n\n> Just picture it, your team is down and at halftime they come out and say that the game is over because a popular vote was in favor of surrendering. \n\nThis is not IRL sport where you can push your body beyond its normal limits. There are a very small and limited amount of actions that effect a league game. IRL people get hurt, sick, actual ability to miss preform ect. If you point ashe's arrow in the right direction it is not going to fall short. In basket ball their are a lot of things that can go wrong like in shooting that is not even closely simulated by league. \n \n> I don&amp;#039;t know about you, but as a fan, I&amp;#039;d be pissed. \n\nno\n \n> Stop being a bunch of wussies and fight for the win that you think that you deserve, or at the very least make your enemies have to take it from you. \n\nhow childish\n \n> If you win all the time, you are not playing against enemies that are better than you, so you will never improve.\n\nnot even why everyone is playing. Also very little improvement can be gained from beyond a certain point. If you are down 10 k in game you are actually beyond any meaningful learning experience, cause you did so poorly. \n\nAlso when you are straight up stomped you can learn bad habits in order to lose less, instead of playing to win. Their is no coach at the end of a game helping you figure out what to do. There are reasons why 1v1s have rules of first blood, tower, or first to 100 CS. At a certain point games roll out of the control of one player. \n\nThe best way to learn is not be stuck in a overwhelming match and to experience as many different situations as possible. Grinding more games in a shorter period is healthier than being stuck behind for 50 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-01-30T12:04:29.449+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Look, I'm not saying that the option to surrender should be removed.
