Using E, E, Q, or W, E, Q would also give him the shield and movement speed to kite/shed the damage from these camps. \n\nSingle target; Q, E, Q, W, Q, AA, E, Q. \nPast the second clear, Gromp, Red, and Blue should be dead by the end of this combo, if not before.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-16T17:13:32.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he'd be too squishy, too mana hungry early game once his blue runs out, and ganks would be weird.\n\nI think I did see it in a Bjergsen video tho.
