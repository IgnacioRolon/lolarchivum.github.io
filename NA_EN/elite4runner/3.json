Instead, detonating 4 stacks of plasma now deals a flat amount of damage, regardless of the enemy&#039;s total health, that increases significantly based on the percentage of the target&#039;s missing health. \r\n\r\nSo it is weaker against tanks. \r\n\r\nI think this is a good nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Salron","date":"2018-10-15T21:39:22.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":34,"body":"There are better ADCs for killing tanks(with this change)\nThere are better ADCs for killing squishies\n\nWhat reason is there to pick her after this nerf over other ADCs?","replies":[{"poster":"Limrick","date":"2018-10-15T23:09:30.389+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"A mixed damage adc with semi-global presence.

The lesser tank busters are {{champion:202}} {{champion:110}} and {{champion:203}}. Other than those the only decent option for tank busting is an ADC who has good kiting that can slot in {{item:3153}} in their build like {{champion:22}} or {{champion:429}}. These last ones aren't as strong as {{champion:67}} or {{champion:96}}. Having {{champion:145}} as a tank buster isn't bad in premise, the main issue lies in how easy it is for her to stack up her passive on targets, yes it is a 5 stack passive vs Vayne's 3 but with {{item:3085}} she can stack it on 3 targets at once, and her teammates can also stack it with their CC, leading to high CC comps having massive amounts of damage through {{champion:145}} . \n\nI'd like to see them change {{champion:145}} passive so that it's closer to {{champion:201}} before they do something like this. Basically I think it might be a good idea to make it so that ally immobilizing effects will only stack plasma on targets if {{champion:145}} already put one on them, like how ally AAs only stack {{champion:201}} passive after he applies the first stack. This would hurt her damage in fights since wombo engages like a {{champion:54}} + {{champion:61}} or a good engage by {{champion:12}} or {{champion:497}} won't prime the enemy team with 3-4 stacks of plasma for {{champion:145}} to instantly pop. It would also hurt her mobility, another thing people complain about since she would need to use W to make picks with her R or use it defensively for the shield or on fleeing targets she's already had a chance to AA. That way she can still function as a high damage hybrid carry without being as oppressive due to ally's providing indirect damage buffs to her","replies":[]}]}
