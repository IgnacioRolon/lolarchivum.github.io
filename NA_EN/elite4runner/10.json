Please be sure to check out the bottom 'edit' sections before dismissing.*\n\nI&#039;m sure some, or most, won&#039;t like this idea because most never do like my ideas. If you&#039;re comment is simply that it couldn&#039;t become an item, don&#039;t bother. I honestly don&#039;t expect that it would make it into the game without heavy changes, if at all. \n\nThose changes are what I&#039;m after. What would need to be different to have, even a similar item that would fit in the game? \n\nThe idea is to have a tank item that encourages dueling to maintain resistances. It is not really meant to be a damage dealing item.\n* * *\n> Whittaker&#039;s Onslaught \n>\n> {{item:3191}} + {{item:3101}} + {{item:1028}} + 400 gold (3100 gold total)\n>\n> 250 health\n45 armor \n40 AP\n35% attack speed\n10% CDR\n>\n> ~~Passive: Onslaught - Basic attacks grant +3% attack speed, +30 health, and +7 armor for 5 seconds, stacking up to 5 times, granting a total of +15% attack speed, +150 health, and +35 armor.~~  (*See Edit #2 below*)\n\n\n * * * \n\nSo I obviously stole this passive from Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade, but I would really like to see at least one other item with stacking stats like that. I&#039;m also not set on the numbers. I&#039;m not really sure about the strength. I used to have it stack AP instead of armor, but I was worried that would make it too offensive. I figured compared to GR, it has more base (static) stats, costs less, has no on-hit damage, and no `fully stacked` effect.\n\nPlease feel free to give me your thoughts and ideas.\n* * *\n*P.S. Edit*\nI've noticed a big error in how I communicated the phrase *'tank duelist item'*. When I used this phrase I was intending it as a description of the item itself, not necessarily the champions or role for which it is designed. What I mean is that it is a defensive item that is intended to encourage dueling. This item could of course be built on tanks, but the attack speed ma not benefit them as much as other roles. It could be built on juggernauts to make them able to tank more while still bolstering their damage. It could be built on fighters to improve their damage output and give them able to survive some incoming damage. It could even be built on ADCs, mages, ... any champion or role that could find this beneficial. Keep in mind that this will need other items to fit any of these roles. \n\nI want to also make a point about attack speed items in general. Most of the attack speed items currently ino the game require other items in order to be effective. My intention was not to supply damage from this item for the same reason. \n\nI also agree that the temporary stacking health is awkward. I am interested in what other ideas people may have as an alternative. I really want there to be some sustainable health aspect to this still.\n\n~~It was also suggested to me that an alternative to the attack speed aspect, and stacking on-hit passive, the passive could instead stack based on time in combat. I do like this idea and I'm wondering what others think of it.~~  *See Edit #2 below*\n\n* * * \n*Edit #2*\n\nThinking about it a bit more, I decided that I don't really like the stacking mechanic of simply being in combat. It does encourage the player to continuously be involved in combat in order to maintain the resistances that this item can provide, but being passively in combat by simply receiving damage isn't what I'm wanting. \n\nI do have a solution however! \n\n> Onslaught - Dealing damage from any source to an enemy and/or neutral unit (does not include structures) grants +*<Stats to be assigned>* for five seconds, stacking up to 5 times. *Stacks can only be gained once per .5 seconds.*\n\nI'm also considering making this enemy champion only, or enemy champion and neutral monsters\n\nThis would allow the more passive champions to still accumulate stacks by combining this item with items like Sunfire Cape. This would also work well with champions like Singed, who doesn't often directly attack his target. Champions who build Thornmail could even benefit from this. The limit to stack accumulation will actually put a limit on players stacking with ungodly attack speed (Although it still allows for quite a bit, 2.0 attack speed at max.) as well as champions who burst all of their abilities in rapid succession. \n\nAs far as stacking stats go, I really like the idea keeping armor in there. I'm not so sure that attack speed really fits anymore (but I have a slight notion to keep it in there as well), and I still have no idea what I want to do about health. Maybe at full stacks it can return a small % of maximum or missing health 'on-damage', with the same frequency restriction. I'll want to try to keep the number of stacking stats at three if possible, but I may settle for two. I am kind of toying with the idea of throwing in stacking flat movement speed and and a small amount of CDR. Maybe +8 movement speed and +1% CDR, giving a maximum of +40 movement speed and +5% CDR at full stacks. The CDR might be strange as well, but I'm still thinking. Maybe by adjusting the base stats (and of course items. Finding items to fit this mutant item should be just as challenging) so that it gives 5% or 15% CDR, that fully stacked 5% will even it out to 10% or 20% respectively.

The list of champions who could make use out of all those bizarre stats is a short one, and what tank wants something that starts out that mediocre? Hell, what tank gets significant damage from their autoattacks that also wants AP? Off the top of my head, I can think of maybe Tahm Kench and Irelia.\n\nThe stats are way too much of a hodgepodge, and that's not even going into how ridiculous the stacking, temporary health thing sounds. This idea needs to go back all the way back to the conceptual stage.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-23T08:24:35.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay then, let's go back.

Moreover, most of them would prefer a Rageblade for offensively oriented passive instead of the defensive one, since they tend to build only one of two legit weapons before going full tank mode. Admittedly, trundle and volibear might like it, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe defensive ramping is a neat idea, but I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of relying on autoattacks, or hell, even spell rotations, try some other way of gating the extra hardiness. Why not add ramping damage resistance based on time spent in combat, for example? It fulfills your basic goal, I suppose, and doesn't have the awkwardness of the other idea.\n\nIn the end though, the concept itself is kind of strange, so I'm not entirely sure it works either way.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-23T14:25:46.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking about it a bit more, I decided that I don't really like the stacking mechanic of simply being in combat.

Personally, I'd give the \"time spent in combat\" stacks a bit more thought, since some champions have utility/cc focused kits and couldn't stack the new passive very well. That said, I'm honestly not super interested in **how** stacks are obtained, as much what the stacks do.\n\nStacking CDR is pretty awkward because it doesn't affect cooldown timers until abilities have already come off cooldown, so that limits its in-combat utility. I'll throw out another suggestion though, if only for the sake of being constructive. Why not eschew actual resistances for a %damage reduction like Alistar's ult? Nothing quite as pronounced as that 70%, mind you, but it might be interesting to give access to that sort of ability to other champions. Maybe. It could also be the \"fully stacked\" effect on top of actual MR and Armor.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-24T00:32:05.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I agree with the CDR being strange, I don't know what I was thinking haha. I'm going to blame that on the fact that I needed to get some sleep finally. I wasn't sure if giving both, armor and magic resistance would be a good plan here, and I'm worried that doing something like that and then throwing pure damage reduction, or even a sizable healing factor on top of it upon reaching full stacks would make this item too powerful. \n\n... sigh, .. this is a pain in the ass lol","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2016-06-24T02:03:10.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game design isn't easy, broseph, especially when you're trying to add to an existing, complex system.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-24T13:44:36.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too true.

Do you mean fighters or juggernauts? And even then, stacking attack speed for any tank is probably a bad stat, because tanks are usually more defined by their spells. And the stacking health is a ridiculous concept, I wouldn't recommend it for so many reasons, the same for armor too.

It'll have the same problem that Wit's End has now. if you're looking to build a tank/bruiser item that helps in dueling, think of items that just give lots of raw stats with a unique(ish) passive. Something like the newer Titanic Hydra do this perfectly.\nThe hardest part is that with this type of item, there is almost never any armor or mr on it because it's too unique. That's why Black Cleaver and Titanic Hydra both have health and no armor/mr; that would make the items too unique when they're supposed to be generalized. \nFor a dueling item, I don't recommend armor or mr.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-06-23T09:19:24.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, what do you at least think of the base stats of this item?
