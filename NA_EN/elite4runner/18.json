I am pretty sure that all of their stats are identical aside from their attack range. The way that the seeds spawn now, it is not often that they randomly spawn in a way that the melee form&#039;s attack range overlap as well as the range forms. The only situations in which they do is when you place seeds with your W. \r\n\r\nI could be wrong about this. Is there some interaction, situation, or build in which the melee plants are better?","replies":[{"poster":"       Mr Cleans","date":"2016-09-02T20:35:22.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are really skilled at hitting your skill shots... You can if you are running Zyra Support.  The benefit from the snare while your ADC hacks away can be more useful then the random shots from your Q that can \"inadvertently\" steal CS and then get your ADC flaming....","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-09-02T20:50:02.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it is just cc and minor damage? That's kinda lame. I would think they would at least deal additional damage, higher base damage, higher AP scaling, or AD scaling, or maybe a % current HP damage, or maybe empowered damage to rooted targets. Something to give it a benefit because right now it seems significantly weaker since it is a more difficult skill shot to land, has a lower range, and a longer cool down.","replies":[{"poster":"PopCorn Chick3n","date":"2016-09-03T05:08:16.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, her E is fine, if you make it a bit stronger, then I dont think any Zyra main will max Q anymore. E itself is just better than Q because not only it roots the targets longer as you lvl it up, but plants can attack the rooted person longer which = more damage. Zyra Q used to be superior for me pre-rework because it's a circle and higher damage for better harass but now not only it's harder to land, which really bother me, but also weaker in damage. It's only a tool to summon her range plant now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-09-02T20:56:17.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support zyra maxes E first for the longer root duration. \n\nright now her Q is pretty bad for everything other than raising plants so its up to you. but its typically Q for mid laners anyway because it has a shorter CD.","replies":[]}]}
