I really hope that skins are eventually going to make their way into TFT. \r\n\r\nBut how?\r\n\r\nMy rational would be to have a skins category under the TFT tab in the client that lists all of the champions available in TFT. Here, you can select from the skins THAT YOU OWN FOR THAT CHAMPION , and that skin will appear for that champion when you summon them on your board, or when you travel to an enemy's board. \r\n\r\nThe default skin will always appear on the champions in the carousel until you pick that champion up, or until it gets to your board. \r\n\r\nAgain, I understand that something like this may be in the works for well down the road, .. but if not, .. please put it on the list.","replies":[{"poster":"Porglit","date":"2019-07-11T00:50:10.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only issue I see is that it would be difficult for everyone to see what level your champions are.  Currently there's an easy bronze/silver/gold coloring that very recognizably shows the level, but unless you want three colorings of every single skin, I don't see that working.\n\nUnless, perhaps, the skin would only show up when you upgrade it to level 3?  The tier 4/5 champs would never get there, but that would make it visually recognizable at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2019-07-11T15:55:11.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a very good point. However, I think the indicator in the health bar should be the go-to indicator, not the color of the champion. I actually don't even like that they change the color of the champion / armor based on rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Plot In Y0U","date":"2019-07-10T09:23:55.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they already made up some bs excuse saying they can't use league skins for tft cuz performance yadayadayada","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ratpie","date":"2019-07-09T22:12:38.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that skins would be awesome in this.

We can still scan opponents one by one but we have only 30 sec between rounds so it would be cool. It would also let us use skins without confusing anyone so yeah - great ideas guys :)","replies":[]}]}
