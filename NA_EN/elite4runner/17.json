I&#039;m not a strong Hecarim player so I&#039;m probably overlooking something that is very important and it would be nice to know what that is.","replies":[{"poster":"Evewynn","date":"2016-08-10T11:25:06.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this were to be implemented, the damage would be loaded into the first hit of combat.

This would encourage him to remain mobile and be more of a dive/\"drive-by\" damager, like he kinda is now. \n\nI would have his damage continue to scale based on distance traveled over the previous 1-2 seconds, calculated every 0.25 seconds. This would allow for some time immediately after the engage where he maintains his bonus damage. \n\nAnd of course the ratio at which it scales would need adjustments as a result, but I'm actually not sure how would be the best way to go about it. Depending on how it is implemented the ratios could go down or up. \n\nI was however more concerned with how this would effect his damage while clearing jungle camps, since they tend to stay put. Would persistent ghosting be bad? This would help his ability to kite out and then kite *through* monsters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2016-08-10T11:04:46.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose I can see that another issue is that his ultimate does not actually increase his movement speed as I actually thought it did for some reason.
