I ultimately find this to be acceptable since they would need to have been in combat already within the previous 5 seconds, but I would personally prefer if it could be applied on a per enemy champion basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-09T12:24:49.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it's oppressive but right now it's garbage\n\ni think they might just remove the item, no one will care about it since bruisers are balanced without frozen mallet built on them","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-02-09T12:26:29.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it should be removed instead of improved upon?","replies":[{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-09T12:34:54.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't know, you tell me riot removed a lot of things instead of improving them it wouldn't surprise me that they remove frozen mallet\n\nif you want to improve it then sure i don't have any problems, i play darius without frozen mallet anywayso i'm fine with both","replies":[{"poster":"Elite4Runner","date":"2017-02-09T12:37:00.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that is fair.

Few champs build this into their kit -- used to just be gnar, then people started adding it to aa bruisers in top and jungle to stick to adc's and midlaners. While I agree (i've been on all sides of this item) that it can be oppressive if you are a squishy (or 0 damage tank) getting run down by a fed enemy bruiser 1v1, I believe this is not a flaw of the item at all. There are just as many times where you can be that bruiser needing to dive the enemy backline in a teamfight, but you get peeled either because you don't have frozen mallet or in spite of having it due to chained enemy cc. If the passive were stacking rather than 40% to start with, you would literally have about a 0% chance to run down the enemy adc or mid if their team peels decently and they have any intelligence about kiting. Also, I believe most scenarios apart from teamfights would not let the person slowed by frozen mallet escape even if the slow ramped up (rumble e actually stacks fyi - side note) rather than applying 40% slow to begin with. Yeah there are those 1 or 2 exceptions, but in 90% of cases I don't think a ramping slow would make a difference.","replies":[]}]}
