Not that she necessarily needs that, but for the sake of the discussion it's definitely a neat direction that keeps her still feeling like a \"prim and proper sheriff\". Also would allow for her to keep some of her sassier lines (\"Sorry boys, I left the fuzzy cuffs at home\") intact while still being dressed for police business. \n\nI do think that's kind of what the concern that was raised in the Ask Riot reply - they're all for characters being sexy, but they sort of want it to be because of who they are and not just for the sake of T&A. So she could totally still be coy, flirty, etc, even if her outfit is more professional or proper.\n\nAlso, for the record, I don't hate Caitlyn's current design (though a lot of that is probably because it's what I'm used to). JinxyLord's statement just got me thinking about how Riot might consider changing her if she really is in a spot where they think her design \"makes no sense\" for her character.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valaran Nara","date":"2017-04-28T03:39:35.491+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fallenreaper88,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=l4NUHbgg,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-28T00:47:05.736+0000)\n>\n> Why does caits look make sense she was born into a wealthy family that was murdered and then she decided to become a police officer.

Given her current line of work, a pair of pants would probably make more sense.  If they were to have made Caitlyn in 2017 as a new champion (and I don't mean rework, I mean as if she hadn't existed before), she probably would have been dressed in clothing that'd fit her needs.

How tasteless! That tramp! \n\nAlso, skirts can be worn with blouses. Typically, a skirt would match the material of the blouse, so you couldn't really tell they were two separate pieces just by looking at it. It's only in recent fashion that the two clothing pieces would be different colours, let alone fabrics. For all we know, she could be wearing a corset top and a skirt.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2017-04-28T05:29:55.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually it didnt during the Renaissance which piltover seems to take most of its ques from with a bit of popular ~~steampunk~~ er hextech influences.

Not to mention Vi, the other member of Piltover's finest, doesn't exactly look like your average constable in her base skin splash art (and I'm not even talking about the gauntlets - unless we're to take that frilly corsets are just standard issue female uniform for the Piltover PD).","replies":[{"poster":"ForgottenLuck","date":"2017-04-28T01:31:01.800+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Vayne is the \"Batman\" of Runeterra now with how dark she is, (killing her mentor/mother figure and doing things that people can find stupid and exciting is a big no-no to Batman), but I do find that role fits a lot better on Cati now. \nI think there was a role reverse at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Badger","date":"2017-04-28T02:33:11.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FearfullLuck,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=l4NUHbgg,comment-id=000100010001,timestamp=2017-04-28T01:31:01.800+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think Vayne is the &quot;Batman&quot; of Runeterra now with how dark she is, (killing her mentor/mother figure and doing things that people can find stupid and exciting is a big no-no to Batman), but I do find that role fits a lot better on Cati now. \n> I think there was a role reverse at some point.\n\nAdmittedly I'm not up to date on Vayne's lore either, at least beyond the \"purge with silver\" angle she's always on about.
