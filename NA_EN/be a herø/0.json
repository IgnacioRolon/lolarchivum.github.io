I got punished for it?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I submitted this as a bug aswell but it's incredibly frustrating to me. Over the last few weeks, every now and then the launcher will just, not start the game/loading screen so I can't load into the game, and so of course my team reports me and remakes despite me desperately trying to get into the game. Sometimes, it'll just \"close\", no message, nothing, but it won't let me restart league because it's still in my processes. \r\nIt just happened again and now I can't play a game, i'm \"ineligible for loot due to afk behaviors\", and It's not my fault and it's making me not want to play this game and stop spending money on it because apparently it doesn't go into fixing game breaking bugs. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-17T23:40:03.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're getting through the champion select and your game is closing when it goes to the loading screen. If this is the case, it sounds like an unstable connection is the culprit. When you transition from the lobby to the champion loading screen, your game client needs to make a new connection to our game servers. Check out of [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for ways you can build a more stable connection.\n\nLet me know how this works out for you!","replies":[]}]}
