This only happened after the latest windows update. Turning both on makes the game the smoothest. Help please why does frame cap not work if both are on? and IS IT BETTER to use compatibility mode for windows 8 or don't worry about it? I have windows 10.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T20:29:21.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to reach out to some of my tech buddies for this one, but since G-Sync and V-sync are essentially two different technologies they aren't going to work in the best way when both are on.
