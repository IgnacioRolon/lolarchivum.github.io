On top of my mind right now, I don't think there is actually another champ that requires you to spam an ability AS OFTEN AS Eve's q, don't think anything comes close to it when compared. When you are jgling with her, all you are doing most of the time is using her q. That's what you are doing none stop and basically without a break. So as a result, over time it becomes annoying and exhausting on the finger, wears down the q key a lot, and becomes even more so if you play her often.\n\nSo I believe Eve is a special case due to the EXTRA amount of spam required on her q. I like Evelynn a lot, but the ONLY REASON I'm NOT playing her much is literally because of how annoying it is to use her q all game. Can you guys be kind enough to give this a second look, maybe change her in the next patch and see how people react to the change?  That would be much appreciated.

For sure, Evelynn throws out a projectile, and then three follow-up spikes, but that does not mean that the model of four separate button presses is the only one that makes sense. One does not need to input an individual command for each autoattack, for example, and Ahri and Zoe's triple projectiles fly entirely on their own. It is not \"quite literally psychology\", it is you presuming your opinion is the only one that counts, while somehow still believing I am the one being arrogant in this exchange.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-14T04:12:19.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've done nothing to actually pick apart any of my actual arguments.

You press a button, something on screen happens. Xerath charges up his range, and the player, who holds down the button feels the very same thing. He's holding down his button, and Xerath will only fire when he lets go. It's Cause and Effect. It's more satisfying to see what happens, come from an action that correlates. Evelynn firing off 3 spikes from a single button hold, doesn't follow Xerath's example of what it means to hold a button. She's doing it independently of you, Xerath relies on you letting go. \n\nYour Ahri and Zoe example, makes zero sense. Take anyone who looks blindly at those abilities, and they'll tell you they pressed the button once (in Zoe's case, activated a Summoner Spell but same thing). Look at Pyke holding his trident, and it's clear it's being charged up. Why? Because they don't have any animations that accompany those projectiles. Evelynn does, her hand movements. Correlating action with animation with the button press. \n\nAnd yes, it's psychology. Games are built around psychology. What makes a game or a character feel good to play, is entirely psychology. In it's most primitive form of Blitzcrank: You land a hook, you feel good, you've accomplished an uncertain goal, and you've been rewarded by your brain. What makes a button/ability satisfying to press *Is all in your brain*.

You press a button, something on screen happens. Xerath charges up his range, and the player, who holds down the button feels the very same thing. He&#x27;s holding down his button, and Xerath will only fire when he lets go. It&#x27;s Cause and Effect. It&#x27;s more satisfying to see what happens, come from an action that correlates. Evelynn firing off 3 spikes from a single button hold, doesn&#x27;t follow Xerath&#x27;s example of what it means to hold a button. She&#x27;s doing it independently of you, Xerath relies on you letting go. \n\nBut then Warwick doesn't rely on you letting go, so your entire point here is moot. Again, you are arguing on what feels intuitive _to you_ as the entire basis for a suggestion many more people have found at least interesting, so clearly there are some people out there who feel such a mechanic could make sense on Eve's Q.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AVYRw0Yw,comment-id=000d00000001000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-14T04:12:19.698+0000)\n> \n> Your Ahri and Zoe example, makes zero sense. Take anyone who looks blindly at those abilities, and they&#x27;ll tell you they pressed the button once (in Zoe&#x27;s case, activated a Summoner Spell but same thing). Look at Pyke holding his trident, and it&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s being charged up. Why? Because they don&#x27;t have any animations that accompany those projectiles. Evelynn does, her hand movements. Correlating action with animation with the button press. \n\nOnce more, you are arguing on subjectivity, and I don't think anyone looking blindly at those abilities can automatically tell that they come from a single button press. Again, considering how it's three projectiles fired separately, unless one already had knowledge of those champions' kits (which you are implicitly relying upon), one could just as easily guess that each projectile corresponds to a button press, again because you are producing _three separate things_ that each fire individually. You are applying your own logic inconsistently to your arguments.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AVYRw0Yw,comment-id=000d00000001000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-14T04:12:19.698+0000)\n> \n> And yes, it&#x27;s psychology. Games are built around psychology. What makes a game or a character feel good to play, is entirely psychology. In it&#x27;s most primitive form of Blitzcrank: You land a hook, you feel good, you&#x27;ve accomplished an uncertain goal, and you&#x27;ve been rewarded by your brain. What makes a button/ability satisfying to press *Is all in your brain*. It&#x27;s psychology, in one form or another.\n\nBy that logic, anything is psychology. That does not mean throwing the term around makes you qualified in the slightest to talk about actual psychology, and the study of it that involves proper research, rather than just posturing on the internet. This, in particular, is a clear instance of trying to use fancy words to try to sound smart. If you want to talk psychology and how it relates to League, by all means, please produce any amount of research done on correlating specific button inputs to specific in-game outputs, but until then, all of what you're saying is just you talking out of your rear end.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-08-14T19:19:40.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" If we're talking about optimal satisification, I have given examples of abilities that feel satisfying as Hold-downs.

One, keep in mind, that people found clunky to use *for a reason*. \n\nWarwick's Q feels clunky to use because the press-and-hold does not actually map onto how he jumps and latches onto his enemy. There's an awkward pause where the game determines if you want to press and hold, when the expectation is that Warwick would just jump onto his target on press, and hold if the button was held. The reason why this is true, however, is because I am not the only one to say this, unlike your entire line of argumentation here, which goes against a larger consensus of people who consider a press-and-hold mechanic to be fine for Evelynn. Moreover, once again, pointing out examples of things that exist does not invalidate the potential existence of something else. You are simply not listening to what I am saying here, and thereby repeating yourself with every post.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AVYRw0Yw,comment-id=000d0000000100000000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2018-08-14T19:19:40.404+0000)\n> \n> No, it&#x27;s really easy to tell, and you ignore the point i made clarifying this.

Do you really think I'm the one grasping at straws when you're the one trying to use one small detail out of a particular animation to try to oppose a mechanical change?
