But i dont know how to show you this, cause i dont have proof, Is it possible to check the game system diary ? i mean, when i reached level 40  the system does not save the information i opened or i got the item? \r\nThanks if you have a time:)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T01:45:36.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange that you never saw the capsule or anything in your loot.

This is a bug that occurs when you receive Mastery Level Up (4,5, or a shard for 6 or 7) or receive a chest for someone getting an S in the same time that you are leveling up. The Drop never occurs due to the Mastery Stuff popping up. The same can be said for the quest loot that you are supposed to receive after you complete a match. If you get a mastery level up (4,5 etc) it causes the quest loot to NOT be given to the player. I would really like for this to be looked into further by Riot Staff to ensure that all players are getting the items that they earned throughout the new leveling system. Thanks for taking the time to look into bug report posts.\n*(Both of these scenarios have occurred to myself)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyka Blyt","date":"2017-12-16T06:55:50.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still have the same problem.
