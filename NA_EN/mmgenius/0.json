Would suggest in the future not messing with any of the files, but it's not something that can't be undone. If you dowload our [Hextech Repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) tool it won't just come in handy now, but the future as well. It would fix and repair any missing/corrupted files you may have!","replies":[]},{"poster":"U No Gank Me Pls","date":"2017-08-08T12:36:20.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried doing the repair lol?","replies":[]}]}
