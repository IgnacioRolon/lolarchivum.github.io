I die to the laner who now had doubles, jungle calls me bad, i call him bad, yadda yadda some more back and forth like that making quips at eachother nothing crazy. A minute later I hit the &quot;/mute all&quot; get my head in the game start coming back. (playing nasus just stacking hard). So I&#039;m making good rotations now helping my team were coming back it&#039;s all great when I go top to stack another fat wave I set up to stack up some more. The ADC decided those were her minions now, I was sitting there hitting them 1 at a time for max stacks and up rolls jinx, while Im furiously pinging her back, with hurricane sharks to steal the whole 5-6 waves from me. unmuted everyone. I tell her to &quot;Go F^^^ herself&quot; tell the team to stop fucking me over yadda yadda. Turns out she had me muted as well and just thought it was fine to not let me stack anymore. \n\nAt the end of the game I felt bad about how toxic that game was and I mentally told myself I needed to hit that &quot;/mute all&quot; earlier next game. \n\nNext game rolls up and I&#039;m chat banned. \n\nI&#039;m in no way saying that I wasn&#039;t toxic that game. But does Riot really expect every player to be 100% non-toxic every single game?
