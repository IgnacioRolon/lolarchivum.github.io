Also, I do believe Naut's q's hitbox actually extends *further* then the range indicator. Thresh's q cc's the target for longer then Blitz or Naut's, and Blitz's is the \"safest\" to use, both because of the mechanics of how Blitz's q work and the rest of his kit (knock up, silence)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kivolan","date":"2016-11-03T03:12:47.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blitz:\nRANGE: 925\nSPEED: 1750\n\nThresh:\nRANGE: 1100\nSPEED: 1900\n\nNaut:\nRANGE: 1100\nSPEED: 2000","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-11-03T03:07:30.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[its actually a combination of champs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE2E87mu1Ds)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2016-11-03T02:58:08.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta say Nautilus","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-11-03T02:36:37.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pudge.\n\nThe answer is always Pudge.","replies":[{"poster":"Verns","date":"2016-11-03T02:39:36.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"amen bro amen!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2016-11-03T02:38:14.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also say {{champion:111}}","replies":[]}]}
