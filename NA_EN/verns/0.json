Though falling from a Tier like Silver 5 to Bronze 1 takes a lot more loses (10 if you recently reached it) and then usually 3 if it's just a division (1/2/3, ect)","replies":[{"poster":"Verns","date":"2016-10-24T01:24:02.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how many losses might it take.. say if i was in bronze 1{{champion:115}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2016-10-24T02:18:04.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can vary really.  Recently I hit Silver I and went 4 loses got a win, 2 more loses, another win, then 3 more loses and it finally dropped back to Silver II.  All depends on how high your MMR is in comparison to the league you are in.  The lower the MMR the higher the chance to drop will be. Most of the time though it will be about 3-4 loses at 0LP to drop.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2016-10-24T01:14:01.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the mixed answers you were getting before might of been for Rank drops through Decay (Not playing ranked etc). In which case, you could lose ranks from not playing Ranked for a whole month (I believe?) and the rank decay only applies to the higher ranks (I think it was Plat but might of been Gold when Decay starts, I'm not to sure)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanctimonious","date":"2016-10-24T01:13:22.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, and you can drop full on leagues too.

Yes, you can loose ranks just as easily as gain ranks. It is based on MMR (overall performance rating), not LP.","replies":[]}]}
