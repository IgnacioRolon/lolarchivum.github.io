He has no mr or armor to start with, so unless you are letting him free poke you, he ain't doing it for free, let alone the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-06-18T14:25:18.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"lol you've obviously not seen good Thresh's I am not talking about free long range poke like Vel, Lux or Nida ( that is gated by mana ) I specifically am talking about the \"free\" hits he lands while you are farming. This is in general now, but the best time to poke an enemy is when they are trying to last hit. If the enemy adc tries to poke you, they risk losing farm or taking damage. So often the supports poke while the adc's farm or play it safe (unless you go harass on purpose). To this extent, Thresh can do it better than ANY other TANK. Because he does not need to ever take return damage, unless you ignore the farm to poke him, then you missed a farm and the two of you took one hit each. Repeat this and you'll quickly be behind. \nOf other ranged supports, they are squishier than even early game Thresh, hence if they go into AA poke range, they take a LOT more damage if the adc decides to ignore farm and poke back. They also risk aggro from the enemy support who is essentially trying to do the same thing, or counter you doing it. And if the adc goes all out, they might even get an early kill. In this sense, Thresh takes the best of both worlds. He has more damage and defence then most ranged supports, and more safety than other tanks. Of course ranged supports like Sona can blast down a thresh that tries this, but again, they put themselves at risk, especially if they get grabbed, and burn mana, which Thresh does not. \n\nFinally, if you think Naut pokes better then Thresh, then clearly you don't even know what Poke is. Walking up to melee range is not poking. As a ranged or melee support, I can intercept a Naut before he gets within melee range. The adc can land \"several\" hits and back off, not just ONE or max TWO hits as they would on thresh, AND still get hit themselves. \nRemember, this is not including skills, just pure auto's. What other support can poke like thresh without skills, and with skills, his combo landing is still more powerful than most (landing - others might have an easier time landing, but the point is assuming 100% accuracy or miss on both supports). \n\ntl;dr\nPoke is not melee AA's\nThresh has safety of a ranged support when he pokes adc when they try to last hit\nHe has the safety/durability of a tank if the adc swaps focus, denying the adc farm\nHe does more on hit damage than ranged supports, and doesn't use mana to land hits, just timing and skill.\n\nConclusion, if you POKE better with Naut than Thresh, you are just a horrendously bad Thresh player, who probably thinks Orianna adc is good or uses melee Ezreal against a volibear instead of actually utilising these champs abilities to attain an advantage","replies":[{"poster":"Father Cthulhu","date":"2015-06-18T15:55:17.945+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't capitalize on him going out of position just to AA you, or you can move just a bit to avoid LETTING him get free damage on you, then that's you and your supports fault.\nHave a Nami?

As I stated, no he doesn't for starters, and poking tank? Since when is Thresh a tank? He isn't. So basically:\n- He isn't a tank\n- He doesn't have the best poke of any other support.\n\nthe three examples your provided of \"long range poke\" aren't supports. No one has played Nid support since like 2-3 years ago? The 2 Lux supports I've seen in the past couple of years were pretty terrible. Vel support lasted about 3 months, to never be heard from again. Those examples aren't examples, but just something you pulled up as generic long range poke, which isn't relevant to your own point about \"supports with poke\".\n\nHe doesn't ever get free poke. There are so many reasons why this comment shows your lack of understanding of the game.\n\n- Firstly, if you hit a champion near minions, you take minion aggro, there goes your \"free\" right there. \n-  Thresh Auto range is 450 - An adc who is considered to have a short auto range is Lucian, who is 500. So even if you hit him as he is last hitting, he can still shoot you back out of your auto range. (or just use one of the abilities most adcs have to shoot through a minion and hit you).\n- You are likely having to walk past a minion to even auto an adc as Thresh since he has a lower auto attack range than every adc but one (Urgot). If you just walk up and auto like that...there are other issues.\n- There is still an enemy support, and since Thresh is squishy early, if you go in like that, without hooks or abilities, just walk in and auto, you are likely to be engaged on.\n\nAgain, I just want to clear up the fact that you have no idea what you are talking about, as this is the second time you have called Thresh a tank. He ISN'T. Tank supports:\n- Nautilus\n- Leona\n- Alistar\n- Thresh? No\n\nYou are wrong again stating that most supports are squishier than Thresh early, this is also false. Did you miss the part where he has no scaling MR or Armor at all? He has the 5th worst...5th WORST starting armor in the entire game, and his auto attacks are terrible early because he also has the lowest starting AD of any champion, that includes even the likes of Janna or Soraka. He only ever \"wins\" trades because he starts with a hook, if he misses a hook and the other person gets an attack first, he loses that trade 100%.\n\nAlso, your comment here confuses me about the enemy support burning mana and Thresh not. Um...do you think he is a manaless champ on top of being a \"tank\" as well? Cause he does use mana. Just tossing that out there.\n\nAs far as poke goes, I think maybe you don't know what poke is, because you assume it is only one singular thing, as you hear it a lot in reference to \"long range poke\" or someone getting \"poked out\" etc etc. The term \"poke\" in online games didn't originate with LoL, so maybe know what you are talking about before you try to argue a point. If I hit you with a Cait auto and \"poke\" it isn't any more poke than if you are farming top and I walk up and smack you as mundo with an auto and walk away. I'm still poking you, it just isn't ranged poke.\n\ntl;dr \nYou:\n- Have no idea what you are talking about\n- Seem to think Thresh is a tank\n- Don't know what poke actually is\n- Seem to not understand what \"Free\" means","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-06-19T11:59:15.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok, so i read the first few lines and thought this is pointless.
