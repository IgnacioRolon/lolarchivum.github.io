Ping spikes are anywhere from 30 to 200-350. I have googled some and found possible solutions. One requires me to log onto my router and change the channel I am on and unfortunately I can't do this until tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI also found a reddit thread suggesting I go to the cmd promt and type: netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface=\"Wireless Network Connection\" Unfortunately when I did this I received: There is no such wireless interface on the system, instead of: Auto configuration has been disabled on interface \"Wireless Network Connection\".\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I got this new computer so I could enjoy gaming more and this lag spike is just making me angry.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T05:23:02.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of issues regarding increased or inconsistent latency (ping) are usually caused by either problematic network settings or routing issues to our servers.
