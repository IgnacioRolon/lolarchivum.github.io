I think that there might be a chance for an item that can supply a moderate amount of ad (not sure about numbers) that also can supply some armor, but at the same time I feel that amount  armor wouldn&#039;t be able to do much for a carry when most ad assassins stack lethality  anyway, just a little idea though. or maybe something like hexdinker/maw but works against physical damage instead.","replies":[{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2016-12-22T15:17:56.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh fuck no.\nIf you died to an assassin in the complete garbage state they are now, you are horrible and deserved it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G0dot","date":"2016-12-22T15:02:05.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in my days , ADC bought Guardian angel and no one complained","replies":[]},{"poster":"Radiant Wukong","date":"2016-12-22T14:43:36.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"carries shouldn't be roaming alone and need to stick to the back line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-12-22T15:06:24.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We already have an AD+AR item in the form of Deadman's Plate and odds are good that we wont see anything like that for a Marksman.
