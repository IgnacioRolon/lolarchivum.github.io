It revived a lively, fun spirit that League has been missing for a while. Now, why would Riot remove it is beyond me. People are enjoying it, they are pouring time and spending money, and everybody is having a good time. The mode is sustainable, it is not buggy, and it does not affect anyone in any negative way. I want to understand why Riot would take away such a beautiful game mode while leaving Twisted Treeline, which nobody plays, online. Is it a marketing strat to push players back into SR, or ???? I genuinely do not understand why they took it down :/","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2019-01-23T03:41:06.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't even play it to do the missions. It has been a while since I played ARAM but I still prefer ARAM over Nexus Blitz. I might like Nexus Blitz more if it didn't have the random events. I am not a fan of URF, I am not a fan of random 2v2's on a Support champion vs two combat ready champions with a lot of mobility, I am not a fan of any of the battle royale games ever made, and I am not a fan of permanent nocturne ults during a battle royale. \n\nI would probably like the game mode a little bit more if they got rid of ALL of the random events. Only then will I might play it over ARAM since you can pick your own champion and the map is more dynamic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-01-22T16:40:10.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would be hard pressed to claim that it's loved by a majority of the community.

A lot of champs were shit useless in the mode, and actively set your team behind if you picked them, because a large deal of the events are geared towards burst and assassins. It felt unfair, and lots of people were starting to lock into a certain meta of \"play these or lose.\" So as long as the game mode is lopsided and favoring of certain champs over others, I'd rather not have it in permanent rotation. Dominion was more balanced than this, and I'd rather have it return than deal with URF Lite.","replies":[{"poster":"RekSai CoffeeCo","date":"2019-01-22T17:08:13.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iYcyHdIo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-01-22T16:40:10.680+0000)\n>\n> I would be hard pressed to claim that it&#x27;s loved by a majority of the community.

Need a tank? Need more CC? etc etc that is gone now.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2019-01-23T03:27:27.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Better than Summoner's Rift\" isn't exactly a high bar to clear.

I'd give it 1 month, but knowing Riot its probably gonna take more than that.","replies":[]}]}
