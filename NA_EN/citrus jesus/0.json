I recently have been toying around with {{champion:36}}  just for fun and realized that he is in need of a rework (Similar to the assassins rework, not a full blown one, but an ability rework).\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve compiled a basic kit to reflect where his biggest weaknesses are and to counter those weaknesses. My goal in making this is to still keep {{champion:36}} &#039;s identity as a tank who lacks CC, regens WAAAAY too much HP, and to deal a lot of damage.\r\n\r\nLet us talk about his new passive.\r\n(Since I do not care about renaming stuff, I&#039;m letting them keep their original names)\r\n\r\nAdrenaline rush:\r\n\r\n* (This is pretty bulky, but try to comprehend it and ask questions if you need further explaining)\r\nAs Dr. Mundo continues combat with champions, he gains new effects.\r\n Phase 0 (0s in combat, so it is always active): Dr. Mundo is immune Grievous Wounds and instead is slowed by 20% for the duration of Grievous Wounds\r\nPhase 1 (2.5s in combat): Dr. Mundo no longer gets slowed by the phase zero and regens 0.6% of his maximum health each second.\r\nPhase 2 (5s in combat): Dr. Mundo&#039;s health costs on abilities are doubled, but Dr. Mundo deals 15% more damage\r\nPhase 3 (7.5s in combat): Dr. Mundo gains 15% movement speed and he takes 15% less damage\r\nphase 4 (10s in combat): Dr. Mundo gains an additional 15% movement speed and becomes immune to slows for 2.5 seconds. After the 2.5 seconds are over, Dr. Mundo is set back to Phase 0 and gets sick. While sick, Dr. Mundo is forced to move at 75% of his base movement speed, deals 25% less damage, and takes 25% more damage for 2.5 seconds.\r\nWhile out of combat, Dr. Mundo will go down a phase every 2 seconds until he reaches Phase 0 once again.\r\n\r\nMoving on to his Q, Infected Cleaver:\r\n\r\n* Cooldown: 5s\r\n* Cost 2.5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s current health\r\n* Target range and missile size/speed remain unchanged\r\nDr. Hundo hurls an Infected cleaver colliding with the first enemy slowing them by 25% and dealing 1/2/3/4/5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s max health, 1/2/3/4/5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s missing health, and 10/12.5/15/17.5/20% of the enemy&#039;s current health in magic damage. The current health damage has a minimum threshold of 30/60/90/120/150 damage. Upon hitting an enemy, gain a stack of &quot;Twisted Cleaver&quot; for 6 seconds and refund 50% of the health spent. If a unit is killed using Infected Cleaver, 100% of health spent is refunded. Upon missing an Infected Cleaver, lose all stacks of Twisted Cleaver.\r\nTwisted Cleaver: Infected cleaver does an additional 2% of mundo&#039;s max and missing health, has its cooldown reduced by 0.3 seconds, costs an additional .5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s max health, and slows enemies hit by an additional 2.5% every stack stacking up to 5 times.\r\n\r\nAnd now his W, Burning Agony.\r\n\r\n* Toggle on a 6s CD.\r\nCost 5/8/11/14/17 health each second (the cost doubles every second while activated)\r\nPassive: Mundo gains 10/15/20/25/30% Tenacity\r\nActive: Dr. Mundo burns himself and the area around him, dealing 5/10/15/20/25 +.5/1/1.5/2/2.5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s maximum and missing health in true damage each second. Once an enemy takes damage from Burning Agony, they are ignited for 3 seconds, taking the damage of burning agony even after leaving the area around Dr. Mundo. For each enemy ignited, Dr. Mundo gains 5% movement speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinishing off his reworked basic abilities his E, Masochism. (Relatively unchanged)\r\n\r\n* Cooldown: 7.5s\r\nCost: 5% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s current health.\r\nFor the next 5 seconds, Dr. Mundo&#039;s next basic attack has 150 range and deals area damage (kinda like Tiamat) equal to 2/2.5/3/3.5/4% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s maximum and missing health. Additionally, Dr. Mundo gains bonus attack damage, increased by 2% per 1% missing health for the duration.\r\nMinimum additonal Dr. Mundo damage: 15/25/35/45/55.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, toping off our favorite toplane monster, his R, Sadism.\r\n\r\n* Cooldown: 85/75/65\r\n* Cost: 20% of Dr. Mundo&#039;s current health.\r\nMundo regenerates 2.3/3.6/5% of his maximum health each second for 8 seconds. During this time, Mundo moves into phase 4 and does not get sick for the full duration of Sadism. Upon expiring, Mundo is set to phase 3 without any drawbacks.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-07-16T13:30:52.366+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I respect the effort you put in this, but this won't do.\nDr. Mundo doesn't just need a small update on his skills, he needs a complete VGU.\nYou are adressing problems he has in his kit like being hard countered by grevious wounds (which they should consider in his VGU), but there are still problems left.\n\nFor example: In my opinion, his W doesn't really make sense thematically. He has fireballs rotating around him.... how does that fit into the madman from Zaun, who is a self-claimed doctor killing people with brute force?\n\nThey have to embrace his thematic alot more in his VGU. And give him more stuff to play around, your kit still contains alot of passive effects who are triggered by the press of a button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"figold666","date":"2017-07-16T11:30:59.684+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overcomplicates a simple champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"M00ndanc3","date":"2017-07-16T08:26:18.898+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like how the changes make each ability have its own thing that its used for but almost all the abilities except the passive are relatively the same as his current except with some tweaks that make him much stronger since both his q and w have max and missing hp scales with the q having an additional target health scale along with there flat damage. also you might want to be careful with aoe true damage on his ww it might be a little strong if mundo goes full hp tank so that the health cost doesnt affect him and the true damage just continues to rise as he gets lower and lower.

Burning agony doesn't have a place in his kit, and if you want him to be a cleaver-spamming machine then he doesn't really need to have burning agony anymore. Try thinking about what would better fit into his idea of a constantly regenerating, mr. Hyde-like monster. Because randomly lighting things around him on fire doesn't really fit, and I believe a while ago a rioter commented something along those lines when discussing mundo as an example of the early champion design process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Citrus Jesus","date":"2017-07-16T22:39:37.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: SURRENDER AT 20 JUST POSTED SOME MINI MUNDO REWORKS??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Citrus Jesus","date":"2017-07-16T21:00:59.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the feedback.
