The most impacting factors for players in India are physical distance from the server (2 seconds is pretty quick to go from India to America) and network routing between the two locations. Unfortunately, there are some problematic nodes between India and NA, and this can also cause latency rises. At the moment, ~200 is realistically about as good as it gets without some huge overhauls (upgrades) to some of the network infrastructure between India and the NA servers.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
