I've tried restarting router and stuff as well.\r\nhttp://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5558043238\r\nThat my speedtest result. Everything else online seems fine but i've been getting lots of lag spikes during peek hours of the game (8pm to 1am EST). normal ping is around 50ish and i'll spike and stay at 300-400, as high as 2k for long periods of time. I currently use an ethernet connection as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any easy solution to this? Note, this mainly happens during peek hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T22:43:19.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a network issue like packet loss that's causing you to have random input delays.
