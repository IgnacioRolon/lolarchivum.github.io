Riot Please Read!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":57,"down_votes":10,"body":"Dear Riot,\n      I love your game. Most of all, I love Zac. His lore, his skins,  his voice, his play style as a disruption tank. He is the perfect champ for me. I love a lot of your tanks. When you reworked Zac I really tried to play him for a while, but after 1 and a half years and it's not working. I've been silent for a long time and I can't do it anymore. Zac felt much more rewarding to play and he could flex top lane with his old Q. His new ult is not as fun as the old one and does not feel as impactful. It is a great ability on its own, but compared to old zac it's not as fu. Granted it is more useful to snatch people and carry them over walls. Could i get either one of those abilities back? or both? PLEASE! I've lost my identity in League. I play other champions but my connection the game is lost. Zac was my main, and I was proud to play him. I miss the Zac I knew and loved. The new Zac doesn't come anywhere close to this one. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Consider this for Season 9. \n\nSincerely, \nA Former Zac Main\n\nP.S. Thank you for all the hard work you do at Riot. It;s a great game. \nPlease upvote so Riot can see and add your own thoughts to the Zac rework{{champion:154}} !","replies":[{"poster":"Thorn Fierce Red","date":"2018-11-27T15:26:28.300+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Zac R is a Trash Bag .... then  grab enemy team to ur team.","replies":[{"poster":"Düff McWhalen","date":"2018-11-27T16:00:32.969+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"My problem with his ult is its too easily disrupted or walked out of even in the chaos of a team fight. \n\nRakan ult does what Zac used to do, and it's bullshit.

He was the third champion I ever played, and the first champion I got to Mastery 7. I've played a lot with his ult and I know how he works. The longer his slingshot charges, the long he stuns the enemies he hits. At Max this stun one second. The charge for his ult (which also makes him immune to crowd control) is barely over one second, and not only that but his ult slows the enemy. All these things combined mean that, if you land a fully charged slingshot, and use your ult as soon as you land, the only possible way for the enemy to espace it is if they have a hyper mobility spell (which you get lucky with and catch them anyways most of the time), or they have really good reactions with their flash. I find that his ult is one of the easiest ults to hit in the game if you know what you're doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawnwolf998","date":"2018-11-27T22:43:46.800+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice tutorial... But this has nothing to do with what the guy was talking about. Not the ease of landing the abilities but that they don't feel as fun and as impactful.\n\nOn the point of it being one of the easiest ults to land is just wrong. All of that is because although Zac is immune to cc while ulting he is not when he is in his E. Zac's E is extremely easy to dodge when cast at max range and can be knocked out of his r by any Root, stun, knock back and knock up. In my entire time of playing the game when teams start grouping Zac's more often die when they E in cause its not hard to deal with. That being said his old ult could disrupt the enemy even if his E was negated.\n\nI have played Zac since release and his old ult although not fancy did a much better job at disrupting the team which seems to be the whole point of playing Zac.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkpegasus11","date":"2018-11-27T23:20:06.312+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was replying to Duff McWhalen about his concerns of the effectiveness of Zac's ult. Not the main thread. Also, as KrakdnKnight mentioned, Zac is unstoppable during his ult, so you couldn't interrupt that anymore than you could interrupt Malphite's ult. I do get his E is super easy to dodge or stop, but that and his W were the two abilities that weren't changed (along with his passive) so that isn't something new to complain about. I think there are some pros and some cons to both his rework and his current state. I personally think that his rework is better.

Your average bronze Zac would just mash buttons and hope for the best. A good Zac would gift wrap your opponent to you during the laning phases. Top lane you'd see him completely dominate or become a feed bag, depending on the player and matchup, but most top lane Zacs were die hard mains, and knew what they were doing. Back in the day, a fellow plat player on the opponent team bought me Pool Party Zac after the game, because he rarely saw Zac played well. Only Zac mains really knew how much skill expression was involved in 'just push W and R'. The new Zac is completely team reliant, which is why he doesn't work in a lane, and can only thrive under organized play or against absolute shit opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Äxsel","date":"2018-11-28T22:24:18.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You, my sir, said all that needed to be said here. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Just Monikha","date":"2018-11-27T23:47:47.859+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Revert League*","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArrowsofAlfar","date":"2018-11-27T19:48:12.815+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanks need to be less reliable and more rewarding to play.\n\nWith the tank update Riot did last year, both Sejuani and Zac gained on-hit cc abilities on low cd, which in turn makes balancing their damage very difficult. Having those reliable options to lock down opponents leaves them with little dmg as compensation. The only \"tank\" in Leage that's well designed in my opinion is Sion. He has counterplay on every single ability and no on-hit cc. This opens him up to having way higher scalings than the rest of the tanks, which in turn lets him carry games when ahead by building damage. Literally no other tank in the game has that option, making them feel useless even when ahead since you rely on your team too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rito Zac","date":"2018-11-29T02:02:04.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane Zac were simpler times. Easy poke, and good sustain. It all started to go downhill when they changed the chances of chunk spawns in favor of opponent. It didn't change much mind you, but it sure made things a bit difficult. That being said, he had easy disengage, having a flat 1 sec stun regardless of charge time on E (**BRING THAT BACK**), making his dueling superbly better than the current E. Being an AP bruiser, Zac had it all. His new kit though is far beyond more rewarding, yet barely plays well with his W. Old Ult played with Unstable Matter perfectly, since landing a 5 man Slingshot practically granted a free W cast, along with an insane 20% max hp recovery, boosted by Visage. You were mobile enough to pick up chunks, allowing for more W casts. It was amazing!\n\nHowever, I am not for a revert, and at the same time I am not against it. I'm indifferent with Zaun's blob boy, because both prework and reworked Zac always made me happy. Of course the first month of rework was almost unbearable, I kept on playing him constantly. As of recent I still do, only kept back by my anxiety for trying Summoner's Rift. \n\nI stay true to my word as a Zac main, and no nerf in the world on my best boy will make me think otherwise. (Maybe that first E change during the rework but that dont count)\n\noops i rambled too much.

He has amazing gank assist with his E and Q, and both let him Duel surprisingly well. Plus your ult is a game changer in ganks since you can become immune to crowd control and just jump away in a second. It's also amazing for ally ganks if you time it right. In the jungle, his Q is much better than it was before, especially \nwhen ganking bot lane. If you land his Q before they flash, and save your empowered auto, you can pull them back and negate their flash. Bot lane it's actually a pretty good damage source as well. I was with you for about the first two weeks of the Zac rework, but I think he is overall stronger than he was before. There's a reason he had over 100% ban rate for a while after his rework. He is still my main, and pocket pick, whenever I need a win, and I don't think that's ever going to change.
