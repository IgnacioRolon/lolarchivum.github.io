Unlike earlier patches conq doesn't give him the same AD that it did before and with the items as they stand do not provide him with enough power early on in order to be the carry he needs to be during the mid to late game. 2. He doesn't have access to enough attack speed in order to hit the cooldown cap on his Q of 1.33 CD without the purchase of berserker boots. 3. In the same light as point 2 due to him not being able to buy merc treads or ninja tabi without reaching the 1.33 CD cap he cannot gain the normal defense he would be able to if this were another patch in around seasons 3-5. 4. Without the same defense abilities of other melee ADCs and his complete reliance on items such as zeal item into IE. His damage is less overall when compared to the other 2 melee ADCs in the game. 5. His ability to evade is very low  when compared to master yi or trynd. He does not have a way to gap close without the use of minions or other champions in a convenient line so he can get to back line. Instead he needs to q 3 times which is nearly 4s at the minimum in order to use his offensive ulti and gap closer and this is if he lands the ability on the back line.6. If his defense does not improve he can not stand in the front line even with the access of windwall for extended periods of time which is what he is designed to do. His cooldown on windwall is to high throughout most of the games extended length. 7. team comps designed around the yasuo force the yasuo player to preform if he does not the team falls apart. The ult damage from yasuo is a decent amount but it doesn't crit or scale with the way you're intended to build the champion. 8. Taking certain runes should proc normally. Ravenous hunter does not proc off of yasuos Q unlike other champions such as renekton and ezreal that also have abilities that count as auto attacks and apply onhit effects. 9. Other champions are able to take defensive runes that help them during the lane phase and can afford to take legend bloodline or tenacity. Yasuo even with boots like I discussed in previous points can not afford to take such runes due to the complete reliance on legend alacrity. 10. Fix yasuos windwall bug.\r\nIght Im done.","replies":[{"poster":"preternatural","date":"2019-07-25T19:03:53.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"why does yasuo need a buff tho, he's just fine.\nactually he needs nerfs but we aren't allowed to discuss that.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-25T21:50:50.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=preternatural,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZaOEublx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-07-25T19:03:53.637+0000)\n>\n> why does yasuo need a buff tho, he's just fine.\n> actually he needs nerfs but we aren't allowed to discuss that.\n\nHe's at a 48% WR and pretty high ban rate. If he gets even a little bit above 50% WR he'll probably be nerfed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-07-25T19:17:31.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Un NO\nFFS these Yasuo Fanboyz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2019-07-25T18:47:31.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in short you want buff everything, turning him into mobile tanky assassin. {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
