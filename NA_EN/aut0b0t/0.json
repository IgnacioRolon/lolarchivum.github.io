The best part is that the hacker added himself to my account and had yet to accept his friend request. It has to be the hacker since I delete any requests as i get them from people i don't know, and i checked my match history and his and we had not played together, at least not recently enough for it to be something i can check) his summoner name is Hoox0rz and I'm not sure what i should do. His friend request is still pending.  ( not sure if this is the right place to post this) \n\nRealistically i have to ask, is there any 2-step verification to RIOT games accounts i can add to secure my account? i don't save my credit card info to the account but I've spent 800+$ on this account over the years and would rather not lose it.\n\nJust to add some information, my email connected to the account could not have been accessed, since it requires my approval Via text code verification or phone call verification to even log in on my personal laptop.  I've also never logged into any third-party sites. only on leageoflegends.com ( and rarely onto leagueoflegends.com)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T16:31:42.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear that you were able to recover your account!
