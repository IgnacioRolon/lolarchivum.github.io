{"poster":"mindofasoul1","date":"2016-03-09T11:38:12.574+0000","title":"$100.00 USD & 5 Hours Later","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":21,"body":"MINDOFASOUL1 Today at 06:21\r\nI am providing you with a copy of a recorded chat of me during a game in which my team mates showed no team work, took my advice as being toxic and reported me for not being a part of the run under enemy turret fiesta they had going on. I would like an actual review in which I am a part of on the grounds that 1. I have played for months and months on end with nights of no sleep whatsoever until my eyes felt like they would bleed. 2. I have also contributed and supported RIOT by spending money that I work hard at a dead end job to enjoy the content this game offers. 3. I have invited many friends along the way to join battles and together we have pushed through Bronze, Silver, and Gold divisions to earn a bit of exhilaration for ourselves from actual TOXIC players who join matches simply to be a pest amongst those who want to earn Legendary and Ultimate skins RIOT offers through determined gameplay. 4. Being that I have money from MY pockets invested into this I feel like I deserve an actual review because somehow a decision to PERMANENTLY BAN my account was put into effect without warning, or even a slight chat ban/leaver ban implemented.\r\n\r\nMost of these games are filled with 4+ people who honestly don&#039;t know much about the characters they choose to play. For RIOT as a company to do these kinds of things is counter-productive to the company and will ultimately be it&#039;s downfall with others on the rise. I&#039;m a League fan because it&#039;s a fun game. And yeah, I can create a new account and spend more money. But the problem lies in the hours I&#039;ve already sacrificed to get where I&#039;m at. If I choose to say, &quot;Hey, you shouldn&#039;t feed. It helps the enemy team.&quot; I&#039;m called out as toxic. Which is totally unfair. If my team mate, or opponent, says &quot;Fuck you, I do what I want.&quot; But is not viewed as toxic behavior it leaves fans like myself questioning the legitimacy and integrity of RIOT and it&#039;s employees. This game has been and always will be promoted as a TEAM game. If one person on the TEAM decides that his or her team mates are not as serious or determined to reach specific milestones how can you decide without any notice that they should ultimately be banned? How can I take, &quot;LOL He&#039;s TOXIC! OMG THE SALT. MAD CUZ BAD. YOU SUCK&quot; as serious forms of wanted help? I never said in these matches I&#039;m the greatest player if you don&#039;t listen to me you will always suck. All I said was, &quot;Okay, well since you don&#039;t want to take my advice, screw it, I&#039;ll go play around in the Jungle and farm minions.&quot; What other choice do I have? Continuously die over and over and over?\r\n\r\nNot to mention that this permanently banned notice popped up on my screen less than 24 hours from me spending another $100.00 USD on 15000 RP. Less than 24 hours of me sending RIOT a piece of my share that I work hard for, they&#039;re sending me a notice about permanently banning my account because I ended up on a team full of either kids who didn&#039;t know how to play, or did, and just wanted to be jerks, roaming around, getting no CS, cursing at each other about how it&#039;s their first time playing PvP or certain champs. I play on the NA server from Florida and am pretty sure there&#039;s a couple thousand of people within that zone. It happens. People get frustrated. But I want to know in what way was I toxic for dismissing them and muting them?\r\n\r\nvayne fortune grief \r\ndeath \r\nyou remember losing to a zed as graves a few hours ago \r\n:) \r\ni changed my name lmao \r\nit was protect ya neckz \r\ncause i had rp with nothing to do with it \r\nkeep ganking me jax \r\nheimer squisher can&#039;t take the love i have for him \r\npea shooters vs cold steel \r\nparry his q lol \r\njax \r\noff \r\nhe&#039;s MINE \r\nwatch this \r\none combo \r\nlol \r\nif i had ignite he was dead \r\nparry his Q \r\nnice jax \r\ncmon lets drag \r\nlol u gotta parry then go into ult then hit all crit spots bby \r\nlmao \r\nreport heimer for feeding \r\nLOL hope u gave the rift buff to heimer \r\nalright, gonna go tanktalon \r\nand bishop bullwinkle! \r\nwhy ur ult \r\nits so shitty lol \r\nomg \r\nvayne \r\nthink faster \r\nyou could have stunned\r\n\r\n[at this point in chat I&#039;d like to add, prior to this the entire team was full of feeders and me and 2 other players were both cracking jokes with the enemy team about things like ULTs, music, and builds. One player that I merely gave ADVICE to playing Vayne Support&#039;s (???) automatic response was &quot;Talon Shut the Fuck up, You suck&quot; and from there I said:] \r\n\r\nbitch i was 4/1 \r\nand jax kept coming mid \r\nyou suck dude \r\ntrash juice \r\nmuted \r\nwhat a noob \r\npro flash \r\nheimer is 1/4 \r\nvarus is 7/1 \r\nbot lane is ass \r\n\r\n[Then I am challenged to 1v1 by the Vayne support on my &quot;team&quot;]\r\n\r\ni dont 1v1 theres no ip in that \r\nyou suck \r\nur playing vayne \r\nagainst varus \r\nand are 7/1 \r\nur opponent \r\nis 7/1 \r\nshut up \r\nur opponent is 7 1 \r\nlmao rekt \r\nnot with vayne and fortune \r\nwhen bot lane gets shitted on \r\npro heals \r\nno \r\n\r\n[&quot;Who do you think is the best on their team right now?

(Not to sound &quot;salty&quot; but why have the emotions input into these characters if using them could be just as easily interpretted as &quot;toxic behavior?&quot;)\r\n\r\nAll in all, I&#039;d like an actual review and feel like I as a player and spender deserve one. I am being ousted as a toxic player and ultimately robbed by your company without a bit of honesty given light to the situation in which I seem to be permanently banned for.","replies":[{"poster":"TNHA Baritone","date":"2016-03-09T11:49:30.589+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do people mention the amount of money that they've spend, Riot said time after time that you get no special preference if you spend money.","replies":[{"poster":"mindofasoul1","date":"2016-03-09T12:00:51.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":13,"body":"Regardless, permanent ban without any notice?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-09T19:41:11.815+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were warned in your 14-day ban that the next punishment would result in a perma-ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Barkhoof","date":"2016-03-09T13:32:59.644+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you honestly can't see the toxicity here, I've highlighted with some explanation:\n> [{quoted}](name=mindofasoul1,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=8t94lBEW,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-09T11:38:12.574+0000)\n>\n> MINDOFASOUL1 Today at 06:21\n\n> bitch i was 4/1 \n> and jax kept coming mid \n> you suck dude \n> trash juice \n> muted \n> what a noob \n> pro flash \n> heimer is 1/4 \n> varus is 7/1 \n> bot lane is ass \n> \n\nSo, independent of what was said to you, I see you jumping down someone's throat, insulting him/them multiple times and not letting it go.

Be the bigger man (or woman, I don't know if you've made your gender known)\n\nI'm not sensitive at all - I'll only report if someone drops an N-bomb or is outright really taking it too far.

When you say toxic, I think of someone going Vayne support, going 1/7, telling me to hang myself and die.\" All I said was, \"Haha, fucking noob, you suck.\" This game depicts people being killed, blood, it exhibits violence and morbid portrayals of war. There's no shadowing the M rated content on League, so the fact that Riot is banning people for saying, \"Haha, fucking noob, you suck\" is a bit loose for one. Secondly, this is NA, I have a freedom of speech. No Summoner's Code can override that right. Thirdly, there was no notifying me about said offenses. An immediate ban automatically throws an outside person who wasn't involved in said game, or has played with me before to think, \"Damn, that dude must really be toxic!\" Because that's what 2016 League is about. Shit talking behind a computer when your game isn't going good. And to the person like me, my top and jungler as well as some members of the other team, the natural response is \"HAHA [enter expletive] GET BETTER.\" We are adults and if not, the lot of us are of age to understand that it's a grim game. It involves demons, angels, Gods and demigods, humans with honor and some who live heinously. Cursing in itself should not be deemed as toxic. Maybe salty. But definitely not toxic. Cursing does nothing to the growth of this game, and vice versa. Cursing is simply a part of it for those who are actually indeed ADULT enough to chuckle at certain things that happen on the battle grounds. It's not my fault he/she chose Vayne support.

I will simply correct everything else I read.\nChoosing something off meta (Vayne support) is not toxic. Katarina support is not toxic. LeBlanc support is not toxic. Choosing someone who doesn't go support isn't toxic. If they are doing it to troll, then that is reportable but if they are legitimately playing that then it is not reportable. Also, going 1/7 is not toxic. If they are intent. feeding, then yes, it is toxic and is reportable, but playing badly is not reportable. Otherwise Bronze would be banned. The last part, however, is VERY toxic and is punishable by an almost instant 14 day or permanent ban. Also, your comment while on its own might not trip the system, is toxic, reportable, and if you were just off a 14 day ban, proves you haven't changed your toxic ways and will get you banned. \nAlso, just because it portrays violence, it does not excuse poor behavior. Many games have that and are T rated as well. Riot wants to stay popular with older teenagers (16+) so they need to keep it legal for them to play. I'd rather be playing a game portraying baby death than play a League game with my team not shutting up about how bad I am.\nFreedom of Speech?

Riot spells out exactly what you will get punished for and clearly explains that you can be permanently banned without warning and without any refund to you. You should not have spent money on this game if you didn't agree to those terms.\n\nIf you were on your last strike then the ban is completely justified. Not only were you toxic but you also asked others to report heimer, which in itself is a punishable offense. Players feeding does not permit you to be toxic. Players being toxic does not permit you to be toxic back.\n\nMoral of the story, read the terms of use before you spend money on something.

Everybody gets 4 strikes and if you already got a 14 day ban then you were on your last strike.\n> \n> You seriously need to read the terms of use you agree to every single time a new patch comes out. Riot spells out exactly what you will get punished for and clearly explains that you can be permanently banned without warning and without any refund to you. You should not have spent money on this game if you didn't agree to those terms.\n> \n> If you were on your last strike then the ban is completely justified. Not only were you toxic but you also asked others to report heimer, which in itself is a punishable offense. Players feeding does not permit you to be toxic. Players being toxic does not permit you to be toxic back.\n> \n> Moral of the story, read the terms of use before you spend money on something.

Are we all just one synthetic League being with a one track mind and no diversity? Or can 10 people in one lobby be goofy with each other? Because that's literally how I took the entire exchange until I saw that I was permanently banned. And I am a working man, I spent $120.00 in the past two weeks to boost to level 30 and I haven't gotten any word about bans or anything. Even before then. I stopped playing for a few months as I worked and saved my money up. I can't recall any bans placed on me for anything. Not a 8 game chat ban, 14 game chat ban, 14 day suspension on my account, or anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Randomonium","date":"2016-03-09T12:24:12.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The terms of use and the summoner's code define what toxicity is pretty clearly.\n\nInstant permanent bans are very, very rare. If you think that happened to you and it was undeserved you can always submit a support ticket. What is far more common is people ignore the reform cards they get until it's too late.\n\nLike I said, the moral of this story is don't spend money on stuff if you don't fully understand or haven't read the terms of use or the contract you agreed to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lolptwo","date":"2016-03-09T17:58:51.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legit feel bad for you, if this helps at all.
