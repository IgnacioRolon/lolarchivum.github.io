That means that some things, while they did get changed, won't show up on her tooltips until we do a regular patch. If you test Lunge in game you'll see it does go on a 16s CD instead of an 18s one, though the text of the tooltip itself will still say '18 seconds'. Riposte by contrast is set up a bit differently file side, so it does incorporate server side changes into the body of the tooltip (given we don't generally make changes server side without patching the client at the same time that discrepancy's normally a non issue).","replies":[{"poster":"Dadgasm","date":"2015-08-12T14:46:19.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick reply! Fiora does feel smoother with these changes. I held back in some potential trades due to thinking that the CD would leave me at a disadvantage. Knowing this makes me feel a lot better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slightly Sexual","date":"2015-08-12T14:56:08.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What she really needs in essence; here is the dream list that could actually make her viable. Because I have been extensively playing her - and i'm just confused. What is her damn role in a team fight? She still feels completely clunky.\n\n-x2 charges to lunge: Explanation: It gives her the necessary mobility to either engage or pursue her opponents. \n\n\nNow here is the main thing: Her ULT!.\n\nSolution 1: Return the old ult back. \nExplanation: It was awesome! Gave her melee carry status. Hell if riven can have such an awesome wtfpwn ult. Why can't fiora keep hers?\n\nSolution 2: Each time fiora procs a \"blue vital\" - it heals her for 20% of her max hp. \nExplanation: This would actually help her when falling behind or a tower dive. This gives both offense and defense in a fight. And lets her survive to proc the final heal ult.\n\nSolution 3: Increase range by 100-200% for her ult. Increase duration at least by another 8 seconds.\nExplanation: Lets her actually be able to plan/activate the ult. It has a frustrating short radius. \n\nMy thoughts?: Personally I like solution 1. It adds the terror! But in reality: a combination of 2 and 3 would work best.","replies":[{"poster":"Dadgasm","date":"2015-08-12T15:08:25.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After these buffs, I've noticed a huge improvement in performance. It's still to early to decide at the moment.\n\n   While the old ult is awesome, I understand the need for its removal. There is no outplaying it. While I laughed at the poor sods that got caught by it, deep down inside I knew they weren't having fun. If Yasuo is fed, I could probably dodge the whirlwind and maybe turn the fight around. Can't do the same with the old one. That being said, I wouldn't complain if they brought it back :P\n\nNew ult has the potential to be way flashier though. People are impressed if I can pull it off. The lunge changes help A LOT. Try these out. I'd love either solution of 2 or 3, but I'm going to keep on trucking with these new changes.","replies":[]}]}]}
