First I thought, this is because old threads just get locked eventually, but I have many threads more than twice as old, that aren't. In fact, this is the only thread of mine, that I can find, that ever got locked. Why?\r\n\r\nI am not upset, just confused and I would love someone to fill me in!\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T01:18:08.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Soooooo first of all, that was quite the read. I honestly really enjoyed reading over all the thought and work you put into that post!!!!\n\nI talked to some of the mods, and sometimes these posts will have the commenting locked if the conversation derails, stops being directed towards the poster, or simply gets too old. I'm guessing this one was locked just because it was fairly old and the mod may not have seen the older posts yet.","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2017-09-20T15:11:50.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Rioter that reads _my_ threads? What is this magical place?\nI feel very humbled. That must have taken at least half an hour of your time.\nThank you very much!\n\nI guess that thread has been fairly active for a long time,\nsince people came back to it every now and then.\nLooking at it like this, I don't think it makes sense to lock it, to be honest,\nbut this is _your_ decision, not mine.\n\nIf there is ever something I can do for Karma or you guys in the coming update, I would gladly offer my services.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-20T21:55:39.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy I love reading our players ideas!

But I am yet a colorful mouthpiece for ideas and thoughts that are already out there. I just... combine them as well as I can!\nIf by any chance you know any good people that might want to read this stuff before heading towards that Karma  update brooding room, you might want to give 'em a hint, right :) ? Otherwise I would like to repeat my offer, if the community or I can be of any service to make this update for Karma go well, please let me know. I am willing to do an unreasonable amount of stuff for that champion!\n\nAlso I would hate for the Karma community to split yet again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
