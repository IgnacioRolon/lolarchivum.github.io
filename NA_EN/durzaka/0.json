The jungler, by rule mostly, is filled with either very tanky champions, extremely high burst assassins, or bruisers who can duel well. Anything that doesnt fall in those categories tend to get walked all over the entire game. And I dont see Kindred falling into any of those categories.\n\nThe other thing that bothers me is this is a champion that is 100% being forced into the jungler role. All because of her passive. And that really pisses me off. Tahm Kench is a support, but he makes a kickass top laner as well. Ekko was/is a middle laner, and works/can be played jungler as well. And so on. Some champions are more restricted in their roles overall, but nothing in their kit makes them physically weaker for going to a lane other than intended. (You might not want Bard in a solo lane, but he could fucking do it without losing part of his kit).\n\nLastly,     \n Cripple an enemy, slowing their movement speed by 70% for 1 seconds. \n\n If Lamb attacks the target two more times, her third attack instead directs Wolf to pounce on the enemy, dealing massive physical damage \n\n.... ANOTHER 3 hit ability. I defended these things in the past, but this is just getting ridiculous. 5 of the last 9 champions released have had this mechanic (4 hits for Braum, whatever). It is getting stale.\n\nStill excited to get to play them, and see if they actually work in the jungle in the current meta.","replies":[]}
