Fiddle support and Laneturne both suffered. I know because I played both at the time. That's why they even had to give fiddle some special buffs and Nocturne a passive on his E that gives him massive movespeed bonuses when traveling towards a terrified unit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2017-12-29T23:47:37.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if he could walk slowly while channeling his W.
