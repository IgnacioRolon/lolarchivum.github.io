I'm not quite 100% sure if this will work, but let's go ahead and try resetting your config files for League to see if that helps. \n\nDISCLAIMER: This **will** reset any custom keybinds or settings you have. You'll need to set all of those up again after doing these steps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
