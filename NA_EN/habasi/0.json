I don't think the bug is in the mastery pages, but in the disappearing panel. I've noticed that the client, after launch, will open to a resolution that is larger than my current monitor's (1024x768) This places the rightmost edge of the client (including the exit/options buttons and right half of the username/password entries). I know that it's an odd resolution, and I've had to deal with that for other games, i.e. play dark souls 3 in a pseudo-theater mode, but with the right side of the client closing with no way to open it up, this should be addressed. I tried to find an options menu to set the client at a new resolution, but i can't access it (it's on the right side of the client).\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T18:40:39.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confident it will be addressed, and this is the perfect time for these issues to happen since it's during the Open Beta and during the ranked pre-season. Since this issue is stemming from the client's scale, you should be able to alleviate this by resizing the client on the fly. You can do this by holding down **CTRL** and pressing the **-** key to reduce the size of the client. Alternatively, you can *increase* the size of the client by pressing the **+** key instead.\n\nLet me know if this worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Balukaa","date":"2017-01-07T16:49:58.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem, and this worked. thank you! <3 {{champion:54}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Burek Bozji","date":"2016-11-17T10:54:36.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here.
