Baseline Kayn is pretencious and annoying. This Kayn has humility to him, he knows the soldiers and has many friends. Its almost tragic what Rhaast is doing to him to the point i actually for once want him to beat Rhaast. Something i wholeheartly DONT wish with Baseline Kayn since i hate his guts. \n\nAlso, this short story was missing one thing: A sequel, full of Back and forth jokes, roasting and banter between him and Rhaast. I swear that is the flagship of this champion concept is the hilariousness of their relationship","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotaRobot1006","date":"2018-09-11T21:07:08.819+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am loving this version of Rhaast. Baseline Rhaast is great and all, but he's got a sympathy angle that detracts from his horror as a villain. We know that at baseline Rhaast must have been at least sort of a decent person pre-Void or he wouldn't have been able to Ascend.\n\nMeanwhile Odyssey Rhaast was straight up created by the Dark Star to corrupt people and destroy the universe and he's loving every minute of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vlada Cut","date":"2018-09-12T08:55:08.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like kayn's original story on steroids.
