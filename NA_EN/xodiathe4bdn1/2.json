With that in mind I really hope riot will do what blizzard have been doing for overwatch: release more short story videos. Before league didn&#039;t really have any real story to lead up to, it was a bunch awesome people of different stories all part of this huge fight club commanded but summoners . now that they&#039;ve shoved that concept off and made a huge linked story for the lore. riot has mainly told the stories through character stories and small novels, but I really hope they st&ouml;rt making more short films.\n\nI&#039;m not talking about champion teaser videos or something like new dawn whereby the animation and action was good, but none of the characters were really connected to each other lore wise and had no reason to all be there.http://riot-web-content.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/newdawn/media/ND-TG-WP.jpg I mean something like the rise of  shurima three part videos. http://img13.deviantart.net/cb90/i/2015/203/0/d/azir___shurima__rise_of_the_ascended_by_mowblack-d92ffpw.png\nIf they could take the sort of animation in new dawn and the storytelling in rise of shurima that would be beyond awesome and I nice way to get the lore more fleshed out","replies":[{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2017-01-03T12:00:02.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might be \"beyond awesome\" but it would also be beyond time consuming and beyond expensive.  There's a reason Rise of Shurima is mostly still images, that's a lot easier than full fledged CGI animation.\n\nEven then, there's not a guarantee it's going to take off.  A New Dawn was popular, yeah, but it was stacked with fan favorite champs.  Does anybody talk nearly as much about that Kalista CGI trailer?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ve1vet","date":"2017-01-04T20:55:13.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rise of Shurima was still pretty time consuming as well.
