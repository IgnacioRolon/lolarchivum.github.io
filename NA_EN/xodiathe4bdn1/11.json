Nunu & Willump would also presumably side with the Avarosa.\n\nThe only actual irrelevant champions in the Freljord are Gragas and Tryndamere (his relationship with Ashe doesn't seem to be cannon anymore ever since his lore update with the Aatrox release).","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-08-07T15:15:16.847+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Trolls are actually on Lissandras side.\nTrundle is their king and he is Lissandra's servant.\n\nI don't think that they have to bring a Frozen Watcher, though.\nThey can easily introduce other Freljord champions, which are siding with Lissandra just like Trundle. Some more \"evil\" Freljordians would be pretty _cool_, if you ask me.\n\nIn my opinion, the Watchers are LoL's version of ragnarok. There is the ghost with the horn warning if they return. And if they return, it might be the end for Freljord. Just because we have the story of them imprisoned there, does not mean that there has to be a Watcher able to flee.\n\nI undrstand why peope want one and it is possible that Riot is really going this route and giving us a Watcher in the future.
