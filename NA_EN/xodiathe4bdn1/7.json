The Frostguard story was a good read and Lissandra’s new lore is refreshing for the most part.\nVel’koz is my main, and saying that I am satisfied with his new lore.\nHowever I am a little sad he is more akin to a pawn though, but for those who think the same, keep in mind Vel’koz is basically one of the oldest (if not the oldest) Voidborn. To me it seems like Vel’koz is a Witch King like figure where the Watchers are Sauron (Lord of the Rings reference). Vel’koz is the herald of the invasion and might be a commander of sorts for the lesser Voidborn when the time comes for an invasion. Vel’koz is in control, he just serves a higher power.\n\nThanks Riot for the new lore! The Void is just so interesting of a place, and ever since I started playing League I have been curious about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2018-08-20T18:27:53.257+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying that vel is a pawn is probably understating him a bit, he might have started out as one but do consider, by now he has been alive for thousands if not tens of thousands of years.\n\nIts like a pawn reaching the other side of the board and promoting to a queen.\n\nHe is the oldest, smartest, most cunning and experienced voidborn in the world, to the watchers he is probably their plan B if they cant get through Lissandra.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-08-20T19:01:01.915+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the Pawn ---> Queen analogy.
