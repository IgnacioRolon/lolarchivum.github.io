Skins writer here.\n\nThese are awesome! Allow me to shed a little light on your groupings and where they currently stand:\n\n* The Death Blossom/Elderwood skins are _extremely_ popular internally as flavor for new and existing high fantasy universes, so there's a bit of a battle to see where they ultimately end up. People _really_ love these skins.\n* The Medieval and Feudal Japan skins are also interesting -- we haven't talked about them much yet, but they could (keyword could) have a lot of potential going forward. They could also end up as their own skinlines without universes -- I'm not sure quite yet.\n* Demon Realm is extremely awesome and I can't wait to write the descriptions for that skinset (we probably won't call it Demon Realm, but it'll likely involve demons and/or fire).\n* The potential list for Deep Sea skins is even longer than the one you posted, but it's likely we won't get around to it for a few more patches. It's definitely on our radar.\n* Wild West exists as High Noon.\n* Hospital/Arabian will probably end up as skinlines without universes, unless something drastically changes or they get a Legendary (or they already have a legendary in them and I don't know it yet).\n\nAs I understand it, a skinline won't become a Universe unless it's really popular or has a Legendary+ tier skin already in it.\n\nEDIT: Just saw Elemental Lords!

You have already did a great Job by adding Hyena Warwick into the Road Warriors set, as well as Dark Valkyrie Diana in the Fables one, but I do have several other suggestions if you are willing to hear me out.\n\n**Dino Gnar in Toy Box**\n\nThis one should be a perfect finisher for the skin set, since the description for the set says:\n\n**_\"Gnar's toy chest is brimming with priceless treasures, but when no one's home, his toys take on a life of their own...\"_**\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/55/Gnar_DinoSkin_HD.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171026155536\n\nSince Dino Gnars thematic revolves around a kids toys, playrooms, and the Toy Box set stating that the toys are from Gnar, it only fits to add that skin in the set.\n\n**Dragon Knight Mordekaiser in Dragon World**\n\nThis one would be added currently because of the name, since the visuals of the skin need update (as well as Mordekaiser in general), but he would be a great addition in Dragon Slayer or Dragon Master sub-sets of the skin theme (Or make him a former Dragonslayer turned Dragon Master like Swain was)\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/6d/Mordekaiser_DragonKnightSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170621201036\n\n**Emerald Taric in Elderwood / Enchanted Forest**\n\nThis one is no surprise, ever since Tarics Update gave us this amazing new look and artwork where we see Emerald Taric healing the GIANT hant of Elderwood Hecarim. A wood elf dude in an Enchanted Forest theme, it fits.\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/2/26/Taric_EmeraldSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170616231647\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/5/59/Hecarim_ElderwoodSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170615212803\n\n**Tribal Ryze in Prehistoric Hunters**\n\nThis one is a suggestion for several reasons. One: The new artwork shows Tribal Ryze fighting some Prehistoric Cho Gath looking Dinosaur in the background. And his clothing match the more primal setting.\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/c/cf/Ryze_TribalSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170615215409\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/3a/Cho%27Gath_PrehistoricSkin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170616215823\n\nPS: Love that Gnar can be seen in the background next to Prehistoric Renektons tail, thats so cool.\n\nTwo: The Olaf vs Everything comic shows Tribal Ryze being part of the same alternate universe as the Beast Hunters when classic Olaf came to their world.\n\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/f/fd/Olaf_OvE_pr07.png/revision/latest?cb=20180509161135\nhttps://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/09/Olaf_OvE_pr08.png/revision/latest?cb=20180509151817\n\n\n\n**Other Random Suggestions:**\n1. Add Full Metal skins in the PROJECT, Steel Valkiries, or Battlecast skin sets.\n2. Combine Cottontail with Bee Keeper/ Beemo skin sets.\n3. Combine Riot, Police skins, Mafia, and Secret Agents skins into one giant Cops and Robbers skin set. The Punches and Plants comic is so amazing how it intergrates all of them in one universe that makes sense.\n4. Put Immortal Journey in the Lunar Revel skin set.\n5. Combine Lost Empire and Guardian of the Sands, Sandstorm, Shuriman, and Arabian looking skins into one giant Shuriman Alternate Universe skin set.\n6. Make Marauder and Warden skins part of the Verus skin set, their visual look match nicely with God-King Garen and Darius.\n7. Combine Thunder Lord skin theme with Ashen Lord Aurelion Sol, Obsidian Malphite , Elementalist Lux and other similar Elemental skins into one giant Elementalist skin set. Obsidian Malphite even looks like the creature Elementalist Lux fought in her release promo video.\n8. Combine Arctic Ops, Omega Squad, Commando, and Special Forces into one giant \"Military\" skin set.\n9. Add Dryad Soraka into the Elderwood / Enchanted Forest skin set along with Emerald Taric. \n10. And if possible see if you could combine Academy with Star Guardian where Academy Ahri and Star Guardian Ahri are the same person, just from different periods in their lives.\n\n\nThank you for your time, hopefully you were nice enough to read this Carnival Knights and that Riot were able to implement some of these suggestions into current skin sets and future skin sets.","replies":[{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2018-07-11T01:37:45.287+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tesla Effect,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=jM8UoZAg,comment-id=00090003,timestamp=2018-07-10T21:46:17.512+0000)\n>\n> Hi Carnival Knights,\n> \n\nI'll comment on the major ones you posted as well as Olaf vs Everything (which is super fun but ENTIRELY NOT CANON). \n\nDino Gnar will indeed go into Toy Box, Tribal Ryze will end up in Prehistoric Hunters, and DK Morde is similarly scheduled to end up in Dragon World.

In those cases I tend to go for 'funny' instead of 'serious,' because it's more fun to write and generally appeals to a wider audience for a longer period of time. I understand this doesn't please everyone, but if I committed to deep backstories for every skinline we'd have stuff like The Statue Of Karthus holding extremely developed plot significance in a universe that includes... The Statue of Karthus.\n\nThat said, we do a yearly review and see if the descriptions need to be punched up or are too jokey to stick around. If so, we'll change them. But we need to get through the rest of them first, barring some sort of thematic relaunch for a skinline (kind of like how the Mecha line went from Kha'Zix Skin 2 to a whole alternate fantasy). \n\nSpeaking thereof, I'm campaigning internally for a revisit to Fables. If I can convince enough people, you'll be getting that epic, dark fantasy description you want (as will stuff like Muse Sona and Leprechaun Veigar), along with some sort of tangible world description/story.
