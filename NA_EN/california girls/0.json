Bans that started before 8/22/2017 will not disqualify a player, even if the ban period extended past that date.\n* Players banned for boosting during the 2017 season remain ineligible for rewards.\n\nThat may be a reason that they weren't granted, but if you were a good noodle and don't fall into those categories, please [shoot us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Our player support team will be able to take a look at your account and see what the deal is. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2018-01-24T22:03:42.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how can one be a good noodle if we are not part of Rito's spaghetti?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-24T22:44:14.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can be anything if you try hard enough. \n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"edoxbox1","date":"2018-01-24T23:10:39.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...\nI can be dead if i try hard enough ?\nI will do it !\nTy Rito for the advice !\n\n\n~~S~~","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-24T23:37:27.313+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://unrtd.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Alex-Norris-Webcomic-Name-comics-12.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2018-01-24T20:36:16.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you receive the silver rewards?","replies":[]}]}
