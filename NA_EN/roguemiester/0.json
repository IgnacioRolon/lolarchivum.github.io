I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tune up your network just in case.  You should also head over to the [alpha boards ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AMiK4QqL-alpha-client-wont-work)for the most up to date troubleshooting on the alpha client.
