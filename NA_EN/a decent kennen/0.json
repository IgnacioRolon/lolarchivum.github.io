I just wanted to say sorry i was having a bad day my cat got hit by a car and i was just really ticked off today, i just wanted to say that im not only sorry to you, im sorry to the community, im only asking for another chance, i spent a lot of money on this game. Im not asking to completely unban me, im just asking for a reduced 2-3 weeks ban, i understand if you dont want to give me this 3rd chance and you get the final say, but i did spend over 100$ and many hours dedicated to this game playing with friends and family. So please if you could, give me one last chance, i promise you wont regret it. -A Decent Kennen","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T22:11:11.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're more than happy to take a look at your account to see what happened to have your account hit with a perma-ban.
