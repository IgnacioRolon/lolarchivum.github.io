It becomes abundantly clear that you have no impact on the game, because the losers lose it before you can even buy an item. Worst game quality hands down, largest lane skill disparities easily.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jamlance","date":"2019-05-24T17:14:49.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This happens in every elo, not just silver. I climbed from S4 to G3 played 450 games. Sometimes the jungler just camps you or support camps (very unlikely in higher elo though). I would say silver is the most toxic and ego inflated elo in league of legends since the majority of players sit in silver. I totally feel you and it sucks.","replies":[]}]}
