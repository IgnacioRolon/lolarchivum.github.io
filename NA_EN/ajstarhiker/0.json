People have been asking for years for Riot to institutes some form of reward for good behavior in addition to the punishment system.  Honor was a first attempt, but that depends on how other people perceive you.  And the ribbons were difficult to earn.  What I remember was that it was supposed to be based on consistancy in receiving them, but casual or irregular players may not ever see a ribbon despite positive behavior.  That can be discouraging, especially to players who haven&#039;t internalized the kind of behavior Honor was meant to reward.\r\n\r\n2. The problem with rewards is that, if not handled properly, they become achievements, rather than a continuous reason for a shift in behavior.  Take games like Mass Effect or Fable, where a player can chose between morality paths (I&#039;ll use the Star Wars Light/Dark side for simplicity), and achievements based on each path.  A player who normally prefers a Dark Side approach to games sees the Light Side achievement will chose those options long enough to get the rewards and then will go back to their normal behavior.\r\n\r\n3. I&#039;ve seen a number of posts about &quot;I haven&#039;t been punished for X time frame.  Why am I ineligible?&quot;  This is most likely the section that I&#039;ll get flamed on:  Why are you surprised Riot chose to link good behavior to this?  They been looking for years for a way to reward good behavior beyond events like Snowdown and Pool Parties.  I can&#039;t speak for the appearance of inconsistancy in ineligible players, but they&#039;ve linked *reform* to becoming eligible again.  That means players need to *prove* that they&#039;ve changed.  My best guess?  The differences are due to punishment levels.  A player who has received a 10-game chat restriction has far less to prove they&#039;ve changed than a player who has shown toxic behavior consistantly enough to receive the 2-week ban.  I&#039;ve also seen far too many 2-week/permabanned players who don&#039;t seem to view the chat restriction levels as a &#039;real&#039; punishment and conveniently &#039;forget&#039; that they&#039;ve already been through those levels of punishment.\r\n\r\nAnd no, I will not do a TL/DR.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2016-03-17T16:11:28.710+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":8,"body":"Ya honestly all the negative stuff I see are from toxic players or players who have been ban and can't participate in this.

Does a burglar get told that he can't charge another burglar if he's robbed before, after, or while paying his own fine off? No. He's allowed to (funds,time, parole allowing) charge that burglar, and lead that burglar to the same point he had been at before getting robbed: paying off the due fine he received which **should not** be equal to a fine for a more heavily weighted crime.\n\n3) With that premise, both a (theoretical) 1-game chat ban and 1000-game chat ban both did something to be 'fined'. That's all good and just. They need to be fined in exchange for their previous heinous behavior, even if it was justified, as there are community social guidelines where the logical and moral (expected/standard) thing are two very different things. The 1-game chat ban, however, shouldn't have an **identical or higher** fine than the 1000-game chat ban.\n\nThrowing aggro around is only going to make this argument go nowhere, and get you perceived as hostile and down-voted into oblivion as it's already begun doing.

And his play was picking Tryndamere for any role and playing him hybrid AS/AP. We haven't won a single game and the game went downhill from his lane every time. Then he wouldn't participate in any fights, he would just push his lane endlessly. And once you told him something, literally anything in chat, he'd just come down to your lane (abandoning his), take your farm and then suiciding into the enemy team a couple of times, just to show you he means business and that he doesn't care how the game ends.\n\nWhat i've told him is that i'll be making sure that he gets reported and advised everyone to do the same, including the enemy team. You can imagine he wasn't happy so any other chatting with him i muted and at that point, he was just digging his own grave if he was being toxic. I also blocked him and reported him the subsequent 3 times i've gotten matched with or against him.\nThen i simply went to his op.gg profile and watched what happened.\nEntire match history filled with losses (a few peppered wins here and there) but his builds the same. I imagine i wasn't the only one who reported him and after 3 days, his next match was 2 weeks after - indicating a 2 week ban. After the expiration of that ban, he came back, played for 3 days and that was the last i ever saw of him.\n#He'd gotten himself perma-banned.\n\nI didn't weep for this guy getting neutered because he clearly could not understand what Summoner's Code meant.

It shouldn't matter what division you're in but your ignorance prompted me to understand with who i'm dealing with.\n\nI'm not going to apologize to you or anyone else by wanting toxic people out of the game.

The system doesn't see this as trolling and completely ignores them, which was the case with DoToT and Disco Nunu - it's when you specifically make Riot aware of such players is when they act and punish them accordingly.\nWhich proves that system isn't foolproof and that it's tuned on the light side - being reserved for the worst offenders first.\n\nI was not asking everyone else to report them, i suggested it.

However, in the original 2016 post about Hextech Crafting, this is how rito described it: \"We’re introducing a new system **to reward you** with loot-filled chests through Champion Mastery **when you or your premade perform well** and also provide a way to pick up randomized content at large discounts.\" If you read through the entire page, there is zero mention of it being connected to positive behavior or punishments. It is described as entirely based on the skill of you or your group.\n\nNow, I am fine with them linking it to behavior as well as skill, but since they did not mention/suggest/hint at that part of crafting, I think that everyone should have been given a \"clean slate\" for crafting with its release.

Or that Riot absolutely refuses to say what they do to determined if someone is reformed. There's no checklist or board to check to see what you have to do to be put back on the good list because there never was one or ever be one. People just get stuck wherever in the 4-strike rule they're in until they're banned.\nTheir behavior specialists are all bots too so there's no point in asking. They all have the same generic replies to everything that they even look for key phrases for their responses. I had 3 instances in the past month alone that they answered questions I never asked because of certain key words/phrases that, if worded in most common things to ask, would have answered it otherwise.\nYou feel alienated by Riot? It's because they did alienate you. They replaced the people who's supposed to help you with bots that only answer in generic, cover all statements. They don't want you to become reformed. They either want you to pay full price for their stuff or make another account so they can get you to pay for the things you already paid for on your main account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jesuszilla","date":"2016-03-18T02:43:39.774+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"All this high and mighty crap is ridiculous.  The simple fact of the matter is this, even the old rewards system with the banners allowed players to participate.  You could still get honor no matter your standing with the Tribunal in the past.  What DID happen was if you went to Tribunal AFTER you got honor you could lose it.  But it didn't just start you off completely removed from the experience.  And there in lies the difference between enforcing a punishment and being cruel to your playerbase.  Punishment is meant to reform the player, and when you don't give the player a chance to reform and instead simply continue to punish them arbitrarily there is no point to that punishment.  It's very simple.  Riot says they want reformation, and they want to be transparent and promote clarity.  People aren't upset with being punished for the Tribunal system.  I haven't seen a single person with a good argument over this issue saying they didn't deserve their chat ban, or wanting those bans overturned.  On the contrary, nearly everyone has been saying \"Yes, I was toxic.  I had my chat ban.  I deserved it, I moved on\".  The issue they have, and the issue that is PAINFULLY real, is that Riot has made statements about their stance on toxicity, about how they want to help reform players, and that they don't like blanket punishments for no reason, and then they release a blanket punishment that seems to affect a multitude of players arbitrarily and without due cause.  Many of these people have had to think back to the last time they even had a Tribunal restriction, several only have basic low game chat bans, Riot's equivalent of a warning, and they are automatically ineligible right off the bat.  They have no way to know if they are working towards being reformed, what that even means, and there is no information.  It has nothing to do with being toxic, it has everything to do with their poor customer service and dedication to the community.  Because whether you think so or not, there are a LOT of players that have been to the Tribunal at some point in time.  And you are FAR from the person to pass judgement on them.  To even act as though you can and to talk down to them as you are doing makes you no better than the people you are chastising.  The irony is the very toxicity you are saying is wrong you are displaying in full force.  And I find that deplorable.
