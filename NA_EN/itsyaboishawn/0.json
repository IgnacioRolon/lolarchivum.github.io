Make sure that you submit a report so we can investigate.  You don't don't want to broadcast drama like that either, best to just use mute instead and focus on the game.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsyaboiShawn","date":"2018-01-05T05:14:57.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand:) I was telling my teammate to mute. I accidentally typed it in all chat and felt the need to explain myself at that point. I understand my mistake and don't expect anything other than feedback. I also didn't find the support ticket button until after I posted this but thank you nonetheless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-04T14:01:02.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you understand why you got punished, then there's nothing to discuss really. They won't release any personal information regarding anyone other than yourself. More than likely if you were punished, then they also would have been too. Those are two extremely negative words that you quoted off someone else, and should never be repeated under any circumstance.","replies":[]}]}
