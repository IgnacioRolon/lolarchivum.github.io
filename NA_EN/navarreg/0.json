The programmers don't know exactly how much work that will be, but are expecting to be done next week. When they think they've worked out all the bugs, he will be released. Riot doesn't know exactly when that is.\n\nThis is all speculation, though; I could be totally wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Tartoken","date":"2015-10-02T17:37:12.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok, I have seen Kindred's profile on the champion page and it keeps changing from amumu to ahri to annie, it's very weird.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"navarreg","date":"2015-10-02T17:12:52.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.
