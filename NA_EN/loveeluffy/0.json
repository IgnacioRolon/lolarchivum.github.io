It's not simply a case of each \"level\" of toxicity having a corresponding \"level\" of ban, and a permanent ban being reserved for the most egregious behavior -- the permanent ban is the endpoint of all non-reformed toxicity, and egregious behavior just gets you there much faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2017-05-04T22:15:38.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Used hate speech which typically bumps you up the punishment ladder.
