He rushed a Phantom Dancer and a Frozen Mallet just so he could stick and chase even better than he normally does while you're doing way less damage back to him. Because he has his passive shield and wind wall in addition to the stats.\r\n\"Use an auto to break his passive shield.\"\r\nThen what? Wait the two seconds it takes for the shield to expire then watch as he throws up a wind wall to stop the rest of your attacks and dancing around that long lasting wall long enough that when it expires his passive shield is up again? That's all Yasuo has to do... Rinse, Repeat, Cash the free wins.\r\n\r\nI don't feel outplayed when I lose to a Yasuo. I feel angry... I feel cheated... I feel tilted...

Yasuo's agency in being able to force trades is simply unmatched which is why he snowballs so fucking hard in lane. Your only real options against a Yasuo are to keep the wave perpetually under or just outside your tower or to be stronger than him at melee range. Many champions, particularly mid mages, simply can't manage option 2 and thus are forced into option 1 for the entire laning phase. Playing something like Ziggs against Yasuo and knowing there's nothing you can do barring a huge misplay by the Yasuo just isn't fun.

Let me give some background information first. I used to be hardstuck silver this season and unable to deal with Yasuo, but due to improvement I managed to climb to diamond. I recently finished my end of the season climb from plat v to diamond v and I banned Yasuo several times during that end of season climb. Since my goal was to win and not to allow people to ruin my games I started banning Yasuo, Lee Shìt and Master Yeast whenever someone in my team wanted to pick him.\n\nSo why did I take Yasuo away from my teammates? Because they were a liability. I rarely see a Yasuo win nowadays. I am an ADC main and I mainly played Miss Fortune. Now one may argue that MF and the ADC role are overbearing, but the only time I really struggled with a Yasuo was when my ENTIRE team was far behind. Yasuo can simply be dealt with by not trying to duel him, just like you don't duel a Jax, Tryndamere, Fiora or Master Yeast lategame. If Yasuo is ahead, tell your frontline that after they initiate a fight and Yasuo dives the backline, that they should peel Yasuo off them. Yasuo isn't very strong right now, even though he might seem overbearing to inexperienced people. He's still very vulnerable, even though he has his windwall.\n\nNow how do you counter Yasuo in lane you might ask. Pre 6 he can be pretty strong, however post 6 other champions get their ultimate to use, while Yasuo has to rely on an easy to dodge skillshot (if one positions correctly) to get his stun off. If he can dash to you as a mage or a range toplaner such as Jayce, Teemo or Quinn  you simply mispositioned or he went to great lengths to even get to you. Yasuo has no ultimate untill you mess up. That's where he gets vulnerable. Other champions will have an ultimate, but Yasuo won't if you play the matchup correctly. \n\nNow to tell you what I really consider overbearing opponents, it have to be Twitch, Rammus, Lulu and Draven. Against Twitch you rely on your team not to mess up, Rammus makes your team kill themselves with very little counterplay, Lulu has short cooldown defensive steroids, and a point and click CC and Draven is just way too strong in the current meta. Against Draven you rely on punishing his mistakes early on. You rely on Draven to mess up in order to stand a chance or else you'll have to hug your turret. One kill and Draven will snowball out of control.\n\n\nI hope that this has helped you.

Yasuo charges his flow while moving around, when at max flow, the next attack that would otherwise hurt Yasuo will trigger a shield that will block damage. Yasuo can also choose to spend all flow, putting this ability on Cool down to create a windwall, blocking all projectiles from one direction. **Flow will not recharge while windwall is on cooldown**.\n\nAnd there you have it, a slight change that I think will add counterplay opportunities and encourage critical thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-10-18T13:57:09.665+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3SheetsTotheWind,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B4d0jLBc,comment-id=0014,timestamp=2017-10-18T13:40:23.186+0000)\n>\n> In my opinion, if Riot insists on keeping his free crit stat in his passive\n\nA passive that you need to buy stats to even use is not free, and it also comes with a crit damage penalty.

I don't particularly dislike the champion. Now there are some pretty tilting things about him, as you mentionned it, his mobility is part of it. The fact that my yasuos often feed can also be listed as a \"tilt inducer\". But ultimately, what i hate the most, is the popularity of the champion. Indeed, playing a video game that has over 140 champs (if i counted right) to play 1 game out of 2 with the god damn exact champion, all the time. Thankfully, the champion is often banned, so it's not that present in actual games.\n\nOther than that, i like the champion : you can play around him if he's in your team due to his high damage / carry potential (so as a support, jungler, you can try to play around him). Now of course, if the player sucks he won't carry, but that would have been the case on another champion, yasuo is not to blame. I've encountered a lot of skillfull yasuo players so i'm pretty sure they are not ALL retarded. In the other hand, yasuo is also kind of a pleasant opponent (in my opinion, i'll get back on that a bit later), since he is easily punished (as a jungler, camping his ass and getting fed on his account is fairly easy), very weak to CC, and squishy (PD works only if he AA'd you, and if he did mallet in second item he doesnt have IE and so his damage is kinda low). \n\nNow, i am some kind of a despicable one trick pony myself, playing mostly tryndamere and master Yi (i can see the comments coming like \"what are u, like bronze 4 ??\", im not, just check op.gg). But my point here is to say that as someone with a very restricted champion pool, yasuo is not a problem. The master Yi / yasuo match up is actually very skillfull and based off mind game, since the 1v1 winner is decided by whether or not i manage to dodge the tornado. It is nearly impossible to dodge it qith the alpha strike point blank (since the animation is fast), i can either try to anticipate the tornado or run from yasuo so i can see the tornado coming and have more time to dodge it. Anyway, my point is that the champ feels good to play against since its a match up im rewarded for winning, and i'm the only one to blame if i lose it (not the champion, not some balance, just my own skill). When it comes down to yasuo / trynda match up top, kinda the same : yasuo has an advantage early, and always \"outmobilities\" tryndamere so he's hard to kill, but tryndamere can overpower yasuo faily easily yasuo at 1-2 items. And in the late game, it just comes down to skill : who has the advantage on the other by having the effect of surprise or the ability of the yasuo to dodge the bullet during trynda's ult...\n\nI'm pretty sure the reason why yasuo doesnt bother me that much is just because of my champion pool. Indeed, when i play ADC, yasuo is a way more abnoxious character thanks to his windwall and his ability to destroy you. And I think that's why you cannot just do that kind of post on boards, saying that champion is overpowered or whatnot. Because match ups are to be taken into account. If u ask me and my rather low champion pool, i'd ask for a nerf of lulu or janna over yasuo ^^ But thats just me, because lulu or janna just make life impossible for melee DPS champions. And I am pretty sure, a lot of people do not care about lulu or janna being \"overpowered\". \n\nThis game has so much diversity that it is difficult to balance out : some champs will be broken given the appropirate metagame (or given the good teamcomp). Now I get what you say mate, and I totally understand why and how you could hate any champion, especially yasuo. I just don't think it is relevant, since the champion is good against some match ups, bad against others, synergizes well with some things, badly with others etc...\n\nAlso, as mentionned in other comments here, yasuo is a duellist, his ability to duel can be matched, and he'll definitely be weaker then some CC tank, or any shield support / hyper carry ADC in a teamfight. Every champion is good at something, and bad at other things. If u dislike some mehcanics in the game (for my part, the ability to peel, since i like to smash squishy targets with high DPS melee champs) it is probably because of your playstyle. If you play a lot of these \"team based\" champions, you will hate to face a splitpusher, whichever it is.\n\nHope I wont get too many dowvotes for saying that i dont hate yasuo, and also forgive me for any mistakes, i didnt read back this comment and am not a native english speaker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mal the Red","date":"2017-10-18T14:48:51.252+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, I can honestly say I am surprised about how much of a positive reception this post has received.\n\nYes, my initial reaction (Spamming \"Nerf Yasuo\" posts.) is the direct result of a tilting loss against one.

I get that some champions are just better in 1v1 situations.\n\nAnd if my some miracle you DO manage to shut him down, he's still just as fed when he comes back.","replies":[{"poster":"GGLineaR","date":"2017-10-18T15:08:27.888+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mal the Red,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=B4d0jLBc,comment-id=001e,timestamp=2017-10-18T14:48:51.252+0000)\n>\n> And if by some miracle you DO manage to shut him down, he's still just as fed when he comes back.\n\nAnd it's not an IF, either.

Ya know, it doesn't. Like, at all.

The effort isn't gonna work, so I suggest just putting him on permaban if he's constantly in your games.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2017-10-18T16:28:39.667+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"The real defense for Yasuo's double crit chance is that it is his damage steroid.

Accepting the fact that I am pretty low elo and as a result am not the most intuitive player on board, there are simply no other champions I feel so easily outplayed by on a consistent basis. I'll put aside the fact (yes, fact after 1000+ matches) that the vast majority of Yas players I've happened upon are also verbal nightmares, in order to focus on the real point here.\n\nHis passive shield for starters. Constantly having to choose between minimal CS gain and pre mitigating the impending new shield is exasperating. If you go for the CS, his shield pops and he starts shit. If you spend time keeping pace with taking his shield down and keeping him dancing rather than letting him bitch slap you, you lose CS.\n\nThen there is the fact that your own CS constantly supplies him with renewed avenues of access to you, despite your constant attempts to re position AWAY from him. It never ends. You have a few seconds to scrape together some gold, or recover a few HP, or scratch his chrome, and then the new wave of minions arrive and he forces a new engage all over again. \n\nI won't say it's unfair, as many champions have seemingly \"unfair\" mechanics, but it is just not FUN. It is a miserable time unless you happen to be a player who knows how to pick a Yas apart, and that simply isn't a lot of us (I can already hear the fanboys poking insults about how easy it is and how noob I am)\n\nCombine those mechanics, and you then get a nightmare of a tower diver who can all too often, too quickly assassinate you. Many mid champs simply do not have an immediate answer. I can not tell you how many times I've had to settle for (barely) killing a Yas because he stayed a micro second too long under my turret after murdering me, rather than straight up defeating him in combat. It is not fun, and the kill I get in return is more an insult to me than him.\n\nThen his ult. The almost constant harass he can output while getting ready to proc with that damn tornado he throws, is a miserable time in itself if you are an easy kill for him. You can run, he will likely catch you, even if by accident. Yes, by accident. I know damn well low elo Yas, much like other similarly coordinated players, are not 100% accurate skill shot gods, and can not always be THAT damn uncanny and accurate with the catch. It is absurd how quickly it reaches you, despite your best attempts to read its potential path and your opponents intentions. Too often the slightest pixel of misstep, and a lucky spam on his part, and bam, Tornado and then ulted. Sweet coin toss for him, pure rage for you. \n\nHis windwall is the only fair to league mechanic he has, in my opinion. It has to be placed, and for all my best intentions, I can rarely meet a Yas who is not faster at placing his wall than I am at casting whatever ranged opposition I had in mind. That, in itself, IS my fault. I am not quick. I am okay with that. And its cool being jaw dropped when you try to Nami ult and have it bounces off of windwall out of nowhere. It makes some hilarious moments.\n\nMany people will point out, that he has to be matched against with certain champs, and that is very true, but everyone doesn't play the champs he is poorly matched against, or matched up more evenly to. From even his early levels, he is simply overbearing to a large portion of mid would be players. \n\nAnd do not forget about his damage. Wow. I've been hit in the face with late game Vaynes and still felt like I wasn't being bent over and having my intestines ripped out from through my back door.\n\nSincerely\nSome moron who can't compete with (any) Yas regardless of skill level","replies":[]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2017-10-19T05:36:27.080+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is the most hyperbolic and biased post i've seen on Yasuo in awhile.

Yasuo players are either really shit because they have no idea what they are doing, or they are fuckin pro because they have about 1mil mastery points. This leads to a bimodal skill distribution which is REALLY tough to balance around, because just looking at the raw data would show that he is statistically balanced, despite the fact that he is highly OP or severely UP depending upon the player using him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"zeskgames","date":"2017-10-19T02:46:45.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't feel outplayed when I lose to a Yasuo.
