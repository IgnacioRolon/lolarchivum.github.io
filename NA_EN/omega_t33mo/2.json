That means his Alpha isn't going to hit anyone else and he's going to come right back out of it, making dodging a lot harder. At least for a few of the deaths that looked like the problem to me. \n\nHowever, I play Yi and I can say I have similar experiences where I can't say it felt good/right. The big things to remember is that DOT still effects someone like YI in his Alpha, its a pain that hurts how the alpha feels but it helps how enemies feel against him. I think there could be a bug there, however with the way the ability works I think it would be really hard to prove or find. Most people also don't like Yi, they feel he's overpowered as is, so it'll be hard to find support for finding and fixing it. \n\nI'd love to see Riot's opinion on it though :) If Katey ever gets the chance to comment, I'm curious how they feel about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
