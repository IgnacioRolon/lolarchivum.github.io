She walks through worlds, sleeping in fields and petting alien creatures, leaving before her past can catch up to her.\n\nNew Taunts\n(Bard) We should go off-world together! That would be SOOO fun!!!\n(Zoe) You use portals too? Awesome!\n(Aurelion Sol) I met a stardragon once. She almost set me on fire! That was fun\n(Any Star Guardian) You seem . . . familiar?\n(Lux) Most peaceful worlds don&#039;t have a Demacia.\n\n\n\nI'm very sorry that not many people like this. If you do't like it, instead of just yelling NO please tell me why you don't like this idea. This makes it easier for me and others to make things that you would like.","replies":[{"poster":"W01fedin","date":"2018-07-31T22:52:01.162+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well since she got the pool party skin recently, I feel like it would be too soon for another skin.
