So I try to grid xp for the first win of the day. That would not seem hard but I can not play more then 1-2 games a day. I jump into a game, start farming cs and then Garen (aka The invincible ) comes and kicks my butt! I try to keep up with him but he is always 300 steps ahead. I even tried to counter Garen with  Garen but nothing works.  Any help would be useful. Thanks. :)","replies":[]}
