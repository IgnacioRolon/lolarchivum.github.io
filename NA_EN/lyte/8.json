(3/28/2014)","subforum":"Announcements","up_votes":20,"down_votes":13,"body":"**::edit::** This experiment has been concluded. For the time being we'll be going back to allowing anyone to become Captains. We're continuing to work on other features to improve queue times.\n\n---\n\nHey everyone,\n\nTLDR: Trying a new experiment to reduce Team Builder queue times. ***Starting today, players will have to invite at least 1 friend to their group to become a Captain.***\n\n---\n\nWe hope everyone has been enjoying Team Builder so far; we’ve been closely monitoring the system and are currently seeing that there are too many Captains, and not enough Solo players available. Although about 95% of players are having queue times of 5-10 minutes or less (even doing unorthodox or creative comps!), this means that 5% of players are having unacceptable queue times. Players who are high MMR or low MMR tend to see these problems more frequently, and players who play during off-peak hours see this problem as well.\n\nIn light of this data, we’re going to try an experiment in Team Builder. Starting today, ***players have to invite at least 1 friend to their group to become a Captain***. This should greatly improve the Captain-to-Solo ratio, and reduce queue times overall in Team Builder.\n\nWhile this experiment is running, we’ll be working on a feature to show Solo players what teams are currently looking for to fill their teams.\n\nAs a reminder, we'll be doing our due diligence here. We'll be assessing match quality, queue times, and overall player experience. If there are any red flags whatsoever, we can revert the change and stop the experiment.\n\nSee you in Team Builder,","replies":[{"poster":"THE Space Jawa","date":"2014-03-29T02:39:57.500+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":12,"body":"Here's the problem I have with this change - in order to be a Captain now, it's not enough to have friends. Making friends is easy enough. However, with this change, you now not only have to have friends, but friends that can play team builder at the same time as you, AND actually want to play team builder, AND are interested in trying to put together the same team setup.\n\nMy understanding was that there were certain rewards and tradeoffs that came with team builder mode - one of them being the acceptance that if you wanted to do something that other people weren't as interested in, you would have to wait longer to get into a game. For example, if there's not many support, and lots of people looking for support, then the support players are going to get into games a lot quicker.\n\nThis overabundance of Captains seems like an example of that in action - if a lot of players want to be captain, then they're going to realize that they're going to have to wait a lot longer. I think that this problem could have been solved a lot easier if instead you were able to apply the wait time system to decision of playing as a captain or not so that if players tried to be a captain, they could get a message saying something like \"There's a lot of captains right now, you will likely have to wait a long time - try joining someone elses game to significantly reduce your wait time.\"\n\nPeople would either get the hint and start playing solo, or if they really wanted to captain a team, they would do it knowing full well that they're going to have to wait and solo players would continue to move into games a lot faster.\n\nIt's also probably worth noting that the full Team Builder mode just came out this week, so jumping to this kind of correction seems like jumping at things way too quickly. Considering that one of the other benefits of team builder is building out-of-the-box teams, OF COURSE people are going to want to make use of the system to build the teams they want to build. I think what's being seen is just an early rush and that if you had given the system time, things would have evened out eventually and they'd be far more balanced. And if not, is there any reason you couldn't have put this system in place later?\n\nLong Story Short, I think you're jumping to a solution to what very well may be only a temporary problem that may well do far more harm than good in the long run.\n\nAnd based on what's being said at the end of your post, it makes me worry if the next step to solve \"unacceptable wait times\" is to tell people they CAN'T play a certain role because there are too many people waiting to play that role. Which kind of makes the whole system irrelevant when you get right down to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2014-03-29T05:02:07.092+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":16,"body":"One, we aren't going to restrict roles--that's not even an option.\n\nTwo, this is an experiment. There's many ways to conduct experiments, and many reasons we chose to do it this way. In the future, we might consider the ability for Team Builder to dynamically show and adjust when/how players can be a Captain. We might consider allowing \"positive\" Captains be a Captain regardless of the current Captain-to-Solo ratio.\n\nGiven the possible future features, it's really important to control and understand as many factors as possible to ensure we understand the impact to the system. For example, if players had to invite at least 1 friend to form a group, how does this change the types of comps that are in Team Builder? How does this change the queue times and overall player experience?\n\nWe decided to bring Team Builder back early, and keep it on. This means that we will be testing features and seeing what works, and what doesn't. Features that work will live on, features that don't will be reverted.\n\nIteration is what experiments are all about.","replies":[{"poster":"daft inquisitor","date":"2014-03-29T14:33:18.446+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Experimentation!\n\nFOR SCIENCE!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hallu","date":"2014-03-29T14:17:22.969+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":4,"body":"Before this experiment, I could get into a group in 10 seconds with any role I liked, and could easily change groups.

Like if a ton of supports are in need maybe an IP boost of some type for playing the Support role in teambuilder and completing a game without DCing? It might cause more diversity in some players if there is some type of reward for doing this. \n\nI dunno just a random idea i had.
