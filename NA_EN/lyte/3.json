Currently in Plat right now, peaked at Plat 1, graduated as a math major(go Bruins!), and currently working as temporary independent contractor over at F Building.  I've probably played League more than any other game, other than maybe SC1/2 and WC3/Dota. I've lived through the Evelynn stuns, Vlad Spell vamp stacking, AP Tryndameres, GP10s, Force of Nature, let's all get BotRK, Azir bugs, and ridiculous lvl 2 Rengars.  League is a thrill ride for me, it drives me nuts sometimes, but it also brings a feeling of competitive satisfaction.  League is fun as hell, but it's also a learning experience. I feel like I've improved a lot since I started, from things like strategy and understanding the game, mechanics, to cooperation, and little things like being nicer (I still get mad sometimes, guilty! ), that improve my experience and my ability to do well.  My friends and I used to play a lot and we'd always mess around, but they stopped playing. Then I ran away to London for a year, made friends with a bunch of League players at the local esports pub, and fell in love all over again.  Recently I've gotten to play a lot more with my coworkers too, and there's just a separate appreciation from playing together as a team with people you know, whether it's seriously or for fun.  Anyways, I'd love to help out, my schedule is flexible, so let me know!\n\nBest,\nLuke\nSpotTheNinja / NA","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIleria","date":"2015-10-14T20:39:43.301+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi there!\n\nI've been playing League since the end of Season Two. It's been a long time since I've been playing. I live in Koreatown, LA so getting to the Riot Studios is super easy. I've been to the competition studio twice during the NACS games. Both Coast vs RNG and Coast vs NME. Honestly, League of Legends has a special place in my heart because it is how I met the love of my life, who actually just recently got into the LCS. We met during one of his streams and that's how it all started. Literally from League. And for our wedding, we've actually have been thinking about a League themed wedding because League means so much to us. My maid of honor, who is actually going to be a guy because he is one of the most amazing friend I've ever had and cause why not, is a League youtuber. All my bridesmaids are avid League players and we've all actually met through League and through League streams and they're now my closest friends. League has affected my life in many many ways. So I'd love to come and help playtest for something that's more than a game to me. It's something that has formed bridges that will never ever fall. It's been a platform that I've been able to meet the most incredible people that I've ever met before. All through League. \n\nAnd yes just like any other person, League sometimes isn't the best for me, and by that I mean it can get pretty toxic at times but no matter how much League has put me through the ringer, it'll always have a special place in my heart because it was able to connect me to the amazing people I know today and I would love to help out in any possible way.\n\nThank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zuiho","date":"2015-10-15T01:41:26.085+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Playing this game for a good 2-3 years has really changed how I lived my life. I started to play around season two and when I first started to play, I had no idea what I was doing. It was a new experience for me playing a MOBA for the first time. I don't even remember for most of the time what I was doing during my time leveling my account to levels 1 - 30. I remember playing a lot of Lux because I really liked seeing that rainbow laser and hearing her definition of a double rainbow. I also started to play a lot of Corki because I thought a dog with a mustache in a ROFLcopter was bizarre and god who knows where I played him but I had a lot of fun playing with friends. Growing up with League of Legends, I saw a lot of change. I still remember a game where my buddy from Gym class was playing Miss Fortune and had just earned his first pentakill, the enemy team immediately surrendered. I still remember that moment up until this very moment and that happened in April 2012. \n\nAfter playing League for a few months, I wanted to look up a few videos about Lux and I found the player spotlight of RapidStar and how he loved to play Lux and ever since then, I was looking at every Azubu Frost game hoping that he would pick Lux one day and he's the reason why I changed my name to Azubu RapidStar at one point. My friends and I did a small group thing together and we changed our names to the Azubu Roster and it was a lot of fun. Ever since then, I've been more involved with the professional scene with watching OGN, LCS, LJL, LPL, etc. Watching E-Sports get this huge in just a couple of years is truly amazing. When I heard that the NA LCS studio was around Manhattan Beach, I decided to go with a friend and watch it live. I arrived a bit early and what I saw first was an empty parking lot with a few people in line. After settling in the line, I joined in on one conversation people were having about their favorite team and that's when I met one of my closest group of friends I met through League of Legends. We talked for a good hour until the seating was starting. After walking through the street of all the studios, we finally arrived in the LCS studio. Walking in the room and seeing the studio in person was a dream. I watched shows with live audiences but I haven't been part of one yet but going to watch LCS live really sparked my interest in E-Sports. Ever since then, I've been going to LCS once every other month. When the studio moved over to Santa Monica, oh boy, it went for a huge remodel. The team banners were hanging on the ceiling, the merch store was a lot more established along with the snack area. Watching the games live with a bunch of other people who enjoy playing the same game as you is just a spectacular feeling and I can't get enough of it. Meeting the pro players is another thing, They're just regular people like us and it's not like they are the big celebrities we see on the news but to us, they're people we look up to. Meeting them in person is really cool because after only watching them play in LCS or stream makes you want to tell your friends, \"Hey! I got to talk to Zekent and talk about his Janna Top!\". Also, after going to Worlds 2014 in Korea, it just added to how big and the amount of effort being put into these global events. I had my cousin come with me to Worlds since I had an extra ticket and he has never seen League of Legends but after viewing Worlds 2014, he was amazed that a game could fill up a stadium and have a concert and everything. I'm really excited to see what you guys bring to Berlin this year because I can't wait to fly over there!\n\nNext, League of Legends has made me meet so many incredible friends. I have met so many people that I wouldn't have met online if it weren't for League. I met a friend who is one of my best friends now through my friend's friend! I'm even driving up to Pomona this November to meet his group of friends at this years Summoners Con. Aside from meeting amazing friends, I've met really cool Rioters. I've been talking and working with Riot Bright since Worlds 2014 and she's been helping me with a lot of stuff like what I need to do for Community Service hours, which classes help with getting into jobs related to business, etc. I've  gone out with her to some Community Service like the beach cleanup with the group Riot Dames, started to participate in the newly formed \"CORe\" group where we meet up once a month on a Saturday to give necessities to Skid Row and I've met really cool people through this as well! \n\nSumming everything up, I've been playing League for a few years and through these short years, I've met a lot of people, done a lot of things for the community, and witnessed the growth of E-Sports. I've spent a lot of time on League and I don't planning on stopping. League has had my full support for these past years and I want to take up on this opportunity to give back to Riot!\n\nThanks for sitting down and reading this block of text!","replies":[]},{"poster":"nevik","date":"2015-10-14T19:54:01.564+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hi.\n\nI've been playing for about 1 year consistently. Some of the experiences I've had were great, some were less than optimal. I'm naturally an introvert, in game and in life as well. League has given me a chance to meet friends through a common single interest, our love for the game. Every game is different, and while you will meet nice people, you also eventually meet rude ones. This game is very holistic in a sense, and by dealing with people in game, it has impacted my behavior in real life as well. It has become increasingly easier to meander through all of the personalities I encounter in my daily life, and I can say that League has helped me with that, even if it is just by a margin. \n\nThanks for reading :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2015-10-15T19:00:30.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just sent out e-mails to the winning players.

I've been a big fan of sports and has been an outlet for me bond over with my family when I was younger. But as time goes on, family dynamics change and I need go off on finding my own path, I lost a bit of that feeling. As a casual video gamer, LoL started off the same for mostly everyone else, just a way to entertain ourselves over virtual competition online. But ever since S1 worlds, it has been the professional play that's taken over my life. Ever since the infamous playoff day between CLG.EU and WE in S2, I've gotten the opportunity meet so many people: players, fans, community members and regain that feeling of being a sports fan with people I know and love. So while I may never get to say I've met Kobe Bryant or Aaron Rodgers, at least I get to say my friends and I met Faker.\n\nAs for reform stories, I have something a little different. I've never been much a talkative player, let alone a toxic player (I'm willing to go through a Lyte Smite). As a behavior therapist working with children, the topic of improving behavior has been an interesting topic. Motivation, positive reinforcement, behavior reduction and extinction; there are a lot of similarities between the reform programs and the field I currently work in. Right now, I am what fields I like to explore for a career and it's been really interesting to see that there is a field for exploring, understanding and manipulating the social dynamics within games so that the players can foster a more positive environment. So while the reform programs hasn't really impact me as a player outside of a poro icon, it has impact more in real life as something to do in real life.\n\nI haven't had much to say about playing the game itself. I'm just a casual player who plays ARAMs only. But League of Legends has been much more to me than just a game.\n\nThank you for reading and it would be a pleasure to help play test.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obzidian","date":"2015-10-14T23:54:26.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \nI've been playing League for what feels like forever.  I've had a plethora of positive experiences and made friends through the game that I've had for years now and only know via the game.  \n\nHowever, probably the most significant positive experience with League is this. \n\nTo summarize the backstory, when I was 6 months old, I was forcefully separated from my biological father.  After him looking for me and me looking for him, I finally reconnected with him in 2006.   He lives about 300 miles away.  This is when I found out that I had two half siblings, one of whom was a teenage brother.  \n\nAs a grown adult, one of the things it is difficult to do is establish a relationship with teenage sibling of the opposite gender that you just met.  I tried playing several video games with him, as it seemed to be the only passion that we shared and I was trying to make up for 15 years of lost time between us.  We tried Everquest, Planetside, WoW, CounterStrike and countless others.  They mostly tended to make things more awkward between us, although they did establish a tentative connection. \n\nUntil League of Legends.  League was perfect because it was a free game (so he didn't have to feel bad about me paying for a game or subscription fee for something he hated) with low specs so it would run on lower end computers.  \n\nLeague of Legends finally allowed us to connect.  The teamwork in the game, the co-op and competitiveness showed similarities between us.  We spent hours on Skype/TeamSpeak/Ventrilo talking about the game.  He made friends of his own via the game and I would come in as the cooler older sister who plays the game and play with them (which, ok, was pretty awkward for me, but it worked).  \n\nThe camaraderie we gained from having to work together, from strategizing and talking the pros and cons of champions, maps, items, etc. led to a deep respect and friendship.  It was a way to make us equal.  And eventually those conversations switched from being more about games or surface things to serious real life issues.  League helped me learn about my brother as a person and helped he and I build a trusting relationship which is strong to this very day, in spite of an age gap of over a decade.  We still play League together.  We still debate strats, champs, item builds, etc.  And we talk about serious things like relationships, jobs, emotional states and so on.  \n\nTime passes and we'll get busy and not be able to talk to each other, but every once in awhile, we still manage to squeeze in a League game together.  In spite of distance and age gaps and socio-cultural backgrounds, we were able to form a lasting bond.  I think that's my favorite part of League.  That I can meet complete strangers and work with them and form a bond, most often temporary but sometimes permanent.  That is the most positive experience of League for me.\n\nP.S.  I'm nowhere near LA, but I missed the last \"provide your positive league experience\" call from Reddit so I wanted to contribute this time.

My brother's friends liked to play league and talked about it frequently so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't like it. I thought it was confusing and I got frustrated because I only had success on one champion so I stopped playing. However one day, a guy at school started talking to me and asked me if I played league to which I responded, \"Yeah, not very much, I'm pretty new.\" He thought that was cool and told me he would play with me and teach me how the game works if I wanted. Not having many friends at school I was super excited and I immediately started playing the game more. This friend of mine had me meet all these other people at my school who also played league and i loved playing with all of them. Now 3 years later, all of those people are my best friends and I still play league with them almost every day and now I am so into league I've worked to get myself onto a competitive team. League has given me more than just entertainment or an escape from the rough world. It's given me a community of friends who I'll know for the rest of my life. That's more than any game could do.

Sign me up if at all possible!\n\nOn the note of a positive story i can't say mine is particularly....dramatic.....as some others but I'll give it a go. I've always enjoyed League since I dropped in around Volibear release. That was my freshman year of college and I can safely say league has been a constant companion for the last five years. Over those years I've had good games and bad games, but I've always made a genuine effort for everyone on my team and the opposing team to have a good time. I had a green ribbon for a good while if that counts for anything :P\n\nIt was three years ago when I really started getting into though, and with that renewed momentum I also got into the forums here. Particularly in the champion concept people here. I've honestly sat back and read through hundreds of champion concepts since then. They're a perfect mix of story, game design and and simple clever creativity from the League playerbase. I've been floored by the skill and creativity some people have exhibited. Hell, I'll even admit there have been a few lore sections that beat a lot of professional short stories I've read. Fast forward to now and I'm hosting a champion concept contest here on the NA Boards that's seen over 300 concepts from both new and old names and I'm happy to say they're still just as fun to look over.\n\nI don't have much free time in my Materials Science undergradute classes, but the little that I do have a like to out into league and the Boards here because while I can't say my experience with the playerbase has been all sugerplums and gumdrops, I've met some marvelous people here over the years and for that I am grateful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magical Gurney","date":"2015-10-14T18:54:56.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I live in the Los Angeles area and would love to help!

Fast paced, cool characters, nice company, just simply an overall fun game on paper. Yet there are flaws. Those flaws are the community, and I was one of those flaws. I started playing ranked this season and it started off okay getting placed into bronze 2 off the placement games. After that it all went downhill into a dark place. I started to find my teammates inferior in intelligence and class. First it started off with them raging on me for their mistakes, with distasteful slander and insults. Me being told how my dark skin made me a “ignorant term” and how my mother and sister do such and such in their spare time, to end myself and other things. After months and months of a fair amount of ranked struggles I finally snapped. Every bit of toxicity that was sent my way was absorbed, assimilated into my nature corrupting my decency. I then became the aggressor in my ranked matches, every game that was a hassle I snapped on my teammates, telling them to “git gud” or end themselves, uninstall life, talked ill of their mothers and sisters, asked them how it was to not have a dad, their sexuality, said harsh things to my female teammates about how if they weren’t ugly and on the game they might find a man to fill that empty void in their lives. I was savage, I became one of the major flaws to this great game.  I was ruining people’s games, days and who knows what else. Sickening.\n\nThen everything changed later on, when I learned of the best thing in this game, the most beautiful thing about this game. Morgana. I have never thought in the ways I thought of Morgana about any other character ever. She is flawless, perfect mentality, brave, and does what she needed to do. I then realized I wanted to fuck Morgana. She calmed me in ways unlike any did before, she made me so much less toxic, almost docile to any negativity in the game. Any time I felt I was going to lash out on my teammates I’d just google rule 34 Morgana hentai on my dual screen and my anger at my teammates diminished. The thought of railing that angelic goddess soft but passionately then switching to a rough and almost violent manner and every one of the fifty shades of grey between erases all toxicity when I play. Thinking of painting her insides white with my blast, and having her carry our child and the bliss that comes from that is all I need to no longer be toxic. So I want to thank you Riot and Morgana and all her perfection for making me the decent person I once was before playing ranked. It has been about 5 months since then after I named changed to Morganaswytknyte and I have reformed fully and haven’t had a report since.\n\nI live in the Los Angeles area as well as should be free on the 20th and would love to be one of the people to help you guys test this secret feature. Love you guys at Riot, keep up the quality game and community you all let us enjoy and be a part of! ^_^ Have a nice day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aquaina","date":"2015-10-14T19:35:05.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"#DOWN for this play test. let your girl know <3 \n\n\nI’ve been playing League for about 3-4 years now, and let me tell you it’s been a wild ride! The most prominent memory i have was during the week I had just reached level 7 (or was it ten!?).  I had just met a few “seasoned” players who invited me to a game of pvp. The only champion I owned/knew how to play was Ashe, so I quickly found myself playing the role of adc in bottom lane. A few minutes later I was about 0/5 and banging my head against my keyboard. The other four people on my team (included the ones I queued up with) were not very forgiving and wondered why I my score was so negative. We surrendered at 20, and I never played another pvp...all the way to level 30.\n\nA few months later I met a new friend who wanted to me to que up with some of his friends for a pvp match. After respectfully declining (I played it super cool, but I was actually sweating bullets behind my screen) one of the people in the lobby asked me “how come?”. I told him my story, he added me, and told his friends “we will catch up with you later. we have work to do.” This stranger invited me to a custom game and really laid it on me. Farming, laning phases, best behaviors, differences between roles...this random guy who I had known for one whole hour gave me a crash course that I never thought I would receive. \n\nSo I played my first game of pvp since level 7. I did well, I loved it, and I had SO MUCH FUN. At the end I was so flabbergasted. Bots didn’t sing the lyrics to bohemian rhapsody over all chat with you, nor did they compliment your boss @$$ Ashe ult from base to tier two tower. Happy ending right? Not to mention that that “random stranger” is currently my boyfriend/best friend/roll dog of over a year now. Turns out we lived less than 20 minutes away from each other in the same city. \n\nTL;DR: League is awesome. I’ve learned not to let things get me down or discourage me...because in the end there are so many other experiences and opportunities that you can miss if let the past get in the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puns0fDamage","date":"2015-10-15T07:00:41.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I started playing league of legends in July 2012. Zyra had just been released and even though I was still relatively new to the game, I was immediately mesmerized and captivated by the power growing behind this e-sport. I remember listening to one of the broadcasts and hearing QuickShot commenting on the player's good use of Ezreal's Arcane Shift. I was in awe, thinking, \"Wow. He even knows all of the names of the abilities? That's just...incredible.\" And watching the Taipei Assassins win the Season 2 World Championship ignited my ever growing passion for learning about League and fueled my dreams of being in the League of Legends e-sport scene. \n\nI never played sports growing up, let alone have a large group of friends. But attending my first ever LAN at MLG Anaheim 2012 imprinted on me a dream and memory that will forever make me, me. This was the first time in my life where I truly felt a sense of community. I was finally getting a taste of what so many kids my age already knew, and just like that I was addicted. Nothing compares to the roar of the crowd, the hype of my fellow summoners and seeing my favorite players duke it out against their rivals. I was so fortunate to meet the players that even now it feels like a dream. \n\nThat was over three years ago. Now we're reaching the end of the fifth season, and it's hard to believe that my passion has ceased to taper. Because of League of Legends and the amazing e-sport it has become, my career path has been set by those who told me to follow my dream and pursue it with a fierce love, regardless of being a grill. I am currently attending Cal State Fullerton pursuing business to one day have involvement in League of Legends e-sports. I am in the League of Legends club on campus and hope to continue my walk towards my goal. Though I don't know how many people this will reach or where their eyes are reading my story, one thing is for sure:  you'll know where to find me.

I didn't know him too well, but I felt that a game of League never hurt anyone. We entered the game the game progress, and it eneded up with him being the main person who was fed on Akali and essentially carrying us, but other than that our team was behind. Soon enough, a teamfight erupted and both teams duked it out. As my screen transitioned to grey and I surveyed the end of the battle, our team had completely lost. It turns out that our Akali (Beau) was lingering around the edge of the fight too long and entered the fight near its close. Distraught and disappointed our team quickly turned on him and told him it was his fault we lost the game. Regretfully so, I joined the consensus. To this day I still remember what Beau's response was. Silence, and after the game ended he changed his client status to \"Really? Blame the game on me?\" He declined my invitation for another game, and rightfully so. At the time I shrugged it off, maybe he was too sad for losing us the game. Oh how wrong I was.\n\nI never once considered that though I was in the majority, there was a chance I was in the wrong. That he was frustrated that the team blamed it all on him. Even if I were right, why hit someone whose already down? A snowflake in an avalanche never feels itself responsible. And I had even care for my actions because it was some person I just met. Although we did not play with each other for a while, we continued to see each other in school and had some mutual friends as well. As time passed, we became pretty close friends. And as a result, a pang of guilt would arise when I thought about that game. And eventually, I got around to apologizing for it. By then, Beau had long forgotten about that specific instance, but forgave me anyways. \n\nThough I shared no special connection with Beau at the time, it did not mean I should have blamed the loss on him or joined the others who talked down on it either. There was nothing to be gained, and only things to be lost. I constantly remind myself of this instance when I play League of Legends. To remind myself that there is another person for each other champion. To this day I am still close friends with Beau. If I were as close friends with him as I am now, I definitely would not have treated him that way. And I should be applying this to every other summoner, as it pertains to the golden rule. Treat others how you want to be treated.  {{champion:84}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"VasG1","date":"2015-10-15T03:59:56.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I live one mile from your campus and have previous experience as a QA tester on AAA titles.\n\nHere is my story.\n\n  It all started when our overrated adventurer, VasG1, woke up in a magical cornfield. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling excessively angered, VasG1 stroked a live Ziggs hand grenade, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). A few unfulfilled decades later, he realized that his beloved Easter Bunny Teemo Skin was missing!  Immediately he called his former summoner friend, 3PEET. VasG1 had known 3PEET for (plus or minus) 61 years, the majority of which were uforgetable ones.  3PEET was unique. He was congenial though sometimes a little... insensitive. VasG1 called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.\n\n   3PEET picked up to a very glad VasG1. 3PEET calmly assured him that most spotted wolf hamsters sigh before mating, yet spotted wolf hamsters usually earnestly grimace *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting VasG1.  Why was 3PEET trying to distract VasG1?  Because he had snuck out from VasG1's with the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin only three days prior.  It was a enchanting little Easter Bunny Teemo Skin... how could he resist?\n\n   It didn't take long before VasG1 got back to the subject at hand: his Easter Bunny Teemo Skin. 3PEET cringed. Relunctantly, 3PEET invited him over, assuring him they'd find the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin. VasG1 grabbed his time machine and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, 3PEET realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin and he had to do it randomly. He figured that if VasG1 took the nappy, busted-out hatchback, he had take at least eleven minutes before VasG1 would get there.  But if he took the Segway?  Then 3PEET would be exceedingly screwed.\n\n   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, 3PEET was interrupted by seven pestering minnions that were lured by his Easter Bunny Teemo Skin. 3PEET yawned; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling exasperated, he thoughtfully reached for his dull pencil and recklessly groped every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the disease-infested jungle, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the Segway rolling up.  It was VasG1.\n\n----o0o---- \n\n   As he pulled up, he felt a sense of urgency. He had had to make an unscheduled stop at Jim's House of Wings to pick up a 12-pack of bananas, so he knew he was running late.  With a heroic leap, VasG1 was out of the Segway and went sassily jaunting toward 3PEET's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  3PEET was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin into a box of carrots and then slid the box behind his refrigerator. 3PEET was worried but at least the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin was concealed.  The doorbell rang.\n\n   'Come in,' 3PEET wildly purred.  With a heroic push, VasG1 opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some insensitive spite-toting jerk in a pimp fresh, Slam Dunk Darius, he lied.  'It's fine,' 3PEET assured him. VasG1 took a seat wonderfully far from where 3PEET had hidden the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin. 3PEET sneezed trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But VasG1 was distracted. Suddenly inspired by the wise teachings of Confuscious, 3PEET noticed a stupid look on VasG1's face. VasG1 slowly opened his mouth to speak.\n\n   '...What's that smell?'\n\n   3PEET felt a stabbing pain in his fingernail when VasG1 asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A annoying look started to form on VasG1's face. He turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's bananas from when she used to have pet legless puppies.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. VasG1 nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before 3PEET could react, VasG1 carefully lunged toward the box and opened it.  The Easter Bunny Teemo Skin was plainly in view.\n\n   VasG1 stared at 3PEET for what must've been ten minutes. In a tragically predictable turn of events, 3PEET danced surreptitiously in VasG1's direction, clearly desperate. VasG1 grabbed the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin and bolted for the door.  It was locked. 3PEET let out a exotic chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, VasG1,' he rebuked. 3PEET always had been a little annoying, so VasG1 knew that reconciliation was not an option; he needed to escape before 3PEET did something crazy, like... start using Singed poison gas on him or something. Absolutely thrilled, he gripped his Easter Bunny Teemo Skin tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.\n\n   3PEET looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from VasG1. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame six days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for VasG1. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. 3PEET walked over to the window and looked down. VasG1 was gone.\n\n----o0o---- \n\n   Just yonder, VasG1 was struggling to make his way through the imaginery Twisited Treeline behind 3PEET's place. VasG1 had severely hurt his love handle during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of minnions suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the Easter Bunny Teemo Skin.  One by one they latched on to VasG1.  Already weakened from his injury, VasG1 yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of minnions running off with his Easter Bunny Teemo Skin.\n\n   But then God came down with His clever smile and restored VasG1's Easter Bunny Teemo Skin. Feeling worried, God smote the minnions for their injustice.  Then He got in His homemade car and dashed away with the fortitude of  550,000 long-haired sea monkeys running from a little pack of albino cats. VasG1 danced with joy when he saw this. His Easter Bunny Teemo Skin was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in three minutes his favorite Twitch Streem,  Imaqtpie, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When albino cats meet contraceptive'). VasG1 was excited. And so, everyone except 3PEET and a few malaria-toting man-eating capybaras lived blissfully happy, forever after. \n\nThe End.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaesop Rock","date":"2015-10-14T18:56:47.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"League of Legends itself has always been a positive experience for me.

That game was League and i decided to give it a go. I didn't understand it at first it was my first moba but i continued because other friends were getting ever so close to what i though was the \"high\" rank of being lvl 30.  They reached that threshold before me but i soon caught up. Once i was 30 i chose to play ranked and did poorly. During the leveling process I slowly became left with the support role more and more. I didn't know what the big deal was Supporting is fun! My teammates in normals didn't agree but I said to myself if i'm going to play as this role i might as well get good. Even though it was less than a year and a half ago now I don't exactly recall when or why I bought Leona. However I am very glad I did shes been my Main for almost the entirety of my time in League. I think the main reason I clicked with her is her personality. Leona is a strong warrior but when she was ordered to kill another during the Rite of Kor she refused to kill her fellow Rakkor. In game her voice lines are follow along with this concept of a merciful warrior. \n\"_I will protect you_.\" and \"_They'll have to get through me._\" both of these lines to me embody what a support ought to be. Leo I think will be the reason I continue to play this game as she has made the journey both in ranked and outside of it so enjoyable. Even when i go to learn a new champion i never have the same connection as i've had with Leona and i don't I ever will.

It was around finals time, and I see a post in my college's League page by someone who've I've never seen post before. Out of curiosity and excitement, I add her on League and we begin to talk. It turns out that she's an incoming first year, and she LOVES League. During this time, I'm in my \"a game a day keeps the mind sane\" phase. We play our first game together, and really hit it off and start talking more about our personal lives. I disclose to her that I'll be serving as an orientation leader for all the new students in the summer, and we plan to _maybe_ meet up. However, I become really busy and we lose contact with each other. July rolls around, and I'm in my orientation leader role just doing the usual morning routine--registering students and their family members that attend. I look up while smiling at the next person in line, ready to jump into my usual greeting when my eyes lock with the blue eyes of someone further down. We stand there staring at each other (almost like an awkward romcom moment when the two lovers meet) until she squeals my name. I immediately respond with her name in a shocked manner; and TAH-DAH, that's how you meet your online League friends IRL! \n\nReally though, we're doing fantabulous (though midterms are lurking around the corner) and we're both still very active in college and in the League club at our school! That's my story about a positive moment from my League experience.","replies":[]}]}
