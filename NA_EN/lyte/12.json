Driven by the desire to try new features, we saw millions of games played and more ranked games than any preseason before. Compared to last preseason, as a percentage of total games played, the rate of Normal Draft games vaulted by 264%, and Ranked increased by 45%. We’ve also heard tons of feedback, and had our fair share of issues. With all that in mind, let’s share what we learned and what we’re doing for the 2016 Ranked Season, which kicks off around the world over the next 24 hours.\n\nHistorically, Ranked Solo/Duo was the place where similarly-skilled players came together to express raw mechanical skill, encyclopedic game knowledge, and their own ability to carry. On the other hand, players told us over and over again they wanted a more competitive experience they could play with friends that lacked the rigid barriers to entry and low queue population of Ranked Teams. \n\nThis led us to Dynamic Ranked, where you can queue up with as many friends as you’d like, as long as all party members are within one tier of each other. This new approach to ranked adds team play and even team leadership to the mix of skills mentioned above. \n\nSo we had two distinct visions for Ranked play in League, Solo/Duo and Dynamic. The easiest solution might seem like just adding the new queue, but segmenting players can be extremely risky because of potential queue time and match quality issues. These risks compound on servers with smaller populations that can only sustain two queues (currently Normal Blind &amp; Ranked Solo/Duo in those regions). \n\nBecause a broad majority of players have voiced their opinion through their engagement, we’re kicking off the 2016 Ranked Season with Dynamic Queues. But there’s a bit more to talk about.\n\nWe also heard from some players who prefer to solely measure themselves against all comers. We’re sensitive to any large swath of players feeling like they’re losing their place in League and while we firmly believe in Dynamic Ranked as the future, the game’s social features don’t offer enough support for players looking for like-minded, similarly-skilled players today. Because of this, we’ll launch a new Solo Ranked Queue (no duo’s!) in the coming weeks. \n\nWe need to work out a few implementation details, especially for smaller servers before we can roll out the revamped Solo Ranked alongside its Dynamic sibling. Because Dynamic Ranked is an indisputably better experience for playing with friends, the Ranked Teams queue skips the 2016 season while we begin work to integrate the full team experience into Dynamic Ranked. Expect more details about improved organized play later in the year. To be clear, ranked queues for the 2016 season are:\n\n* Dynamic Ranked\n* A few weeks after season start: Solo Ranked\n\nSome of you are probably wondering about Ranked Rewards, and because we’ve pivoted to supporting Dynamic and Solo Ranked, we’re still figuring them out ourselves. Expect most of the Ranked Rewards to shift to Dynamic Ranked and some concrete news in the first few months of the season.\n\nOver the course of the last week, even up to Monday morning, we’ve made matchmaking upgrades for normal and ranked dynamic queues and the new tech allows for better monitoring and on the fly tuning than ever before. Marked improvements in overall match quality and queue times should already be making themselves felt on live. Here’s what we know after nearly a week of live testing: \n\n* Premade 4’s are now matching with other Premade 4’s in 98% of their matches, while Premade 5’s are matching with other Premade 5s in 96% of their matches. These numbers are up from the mid-80’s at launch.\n* We’re seeing queue times for high-skill and pro players drop dramatically and are working on further improvements.\n* Most players should now be seeing more competitive (where competitive means each team is [equally likely to win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details)) matches compared to the Solo/Duo Ranked queue from last season).\n\nOne pain point has been lock in failures in new champ select resulting in queue dodges. This issue compounded with the longer queue times of the initial launch for a pretty miserable experience. We believe the lock in requirement is worth sticking with because it encourages players to stay engaged with their team while drafting, and pushes overall time in champ select lower. Lock in failures are already trending downwards, but remind your friends to lock in during the first few days with new champ select! We expect to see this stabilize over the first two weeks of the system, and if it doesn’t, we’ll move quickly to address it.\n\nFinally, we’re also aiming at a number of updates to new champ select and all dynamic queues over the next couple of patches. We’ll keep you posted on each of these in the patch notes, as well as matchmaking tune-ups and bug fixes:\n\n* Chroma and ward skin selection\n* Skin purchase in champ select\n* Preventing pick intent from being displayed to opponents during the final pick phase\n* Allowing players to bring the champion grid back up after a champion pick\n* Further improving the dynamic soundtrack\n* Matchmaking will better prioritize your primary position\n\nThe 2016 Ranked Season kicks off in NA at 2AM PST on 1/20. GL HF in your placements!\n\nEDIT ::: Other servers will all get their season start dates over the next 24-48 hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Chamdin","date":"2016-01-19T08:37:22.292+0000","up_votes":236,"down_votes":16,"body":"so with ranked teams gone will there be no way to play ranked with my friends who are in lower leagues. For example I am plat but regularly play ranked teams with my gold/silver/bronze friends. Will I not be able to play ranked with my silver and bronze friends or will dynamic queue allow this?","replies":[{"poster":"GlideStrife","date":"2016-01-19T14:25:46.098+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":2,"body":"This. I do not play ranked solo/duo, but have begun to play ranked 5's. The majority of my playgroup is Plat, yet myself and one other player are unranked. Obviously unranked isn't a measure of our skill level. I personally just do not enjoy playing League in groups any smaller than 3-man premades, so grinding soloqueue games to determine my level of play doesn't appeal to me. Despite this, I have no problem with playing as effectively as my platinum friends.\n\nThanks to the removal of ranked 5's, I now cannot queue with my friends until I grind out games until at least gold. Then, one member of our playgroup was Diamond, and him and I will still be preventing from playing at the same time. Effectively, the team has to choose between taking him or me, even after I grind out Gold by myself. Let's be honest here: that isn't a decision; I will be benched every time, because it's the sensible thing to do.\n\n> On the other hand, players told us over and over again they wanted a more competitive experience they could play with friends that lacked the rigid barriers to entry and low queue population of Ranked Teams.\n\nYet a new barrier of entry has been created which will keep a number of players from playing with their previous ranked team, such as myself. This is a missed design goal.\n\n> Because Dynamic Ranked is an indisputably better experience for playing with friends, the Ranked Teams queue skips the 2016 season...\n\n\"Indisputably\" isn't the word here, because it's not \"indisputable\". In any scenario such as my own, where one or two players do not have the time/patience to play with randoms until they reach the \"entry rank\" to play with their friends, the new queue system is absolutely worse than the old ranked 5's system, where it was up to my friends to determine whether I was factually a detriment to their team, or just not interested in solo queue. \"Indisputable\" means \"there is no argument against\", yet here we are.\n\nAm I a corner case? Am I getting railed for the sake of the rest of the playerbase and/or the good of the game? Maybe. But I at LEAST want Riot to recognize that, instead of acting like this decision is literally good for EVERYONE, with every design goal met and no players left in the dust. Tell me that people in my scenario are acceptable statistical losses for the sake of creating a better game, and I'll buy it, Riot has the data and I don't. Don't give me this nonsense about the barrier to entry being removed, and the new system being \"indisputably\" better, because it hasn't been, and it's not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ludovico","date":"2016-01-19T08:53:09.960+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":8,"body":"Great now I´ll just ditch my main acc and play on my smurf the whole time -.-' .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-01-19T08:02:20.413+0000","up_votes":133,"down_votes":5,"body":"One problem I see with that:\n\nWith the removal of Ranked Teams, you remove the ability of groups of friends that have varying skill levels to play together on the ranked ladder.\n\nFor example, in my group, we were 2 Silvers, 2 Golds and 2 Plats when we played Ranked Teams between Christmas and New Year's (We rotated between us 6 for the 5 people to play).\n\nWill mismatching elos be allowed in 5-man premades in the Dynamic Queue?","replies":[{"poster":"LittleBigBear","date":"2016-01-19T10:03:23.102+0000","up_votes":51,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ProfDrDeath,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=HGblb9fH,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2016-01-19T08:02:20.413+0000)\n>\n> One problem I see with that:\n> \n> With the removal of Ranked Teams, you remove the ability of groups of friends that have varying skill levels to play together on the ranked ladder.\n> \n> For example, in my group, we were 2 Silvers, 2 Golds and 2 Plats when we played Ranked Teams between Christmas and New Year's (We rotated between us 6 for the 5 people to play).\n> \n> Will mismatching elos be allowed in 5-man premades in the Dynamic Queue?\n\nThis is the problem I'm seeing as well.

I would predict that there is now going to be a huge influx of smurfs in bronze and silver, as people in plat and diamond will have to keep alternate accounts to play ranked with their friends.\n\nOverall, I think the addition of a solo queue and dynamic queue is a cool change.  Solo queue marks your individual skill without queuing with a friend, and dynamic queue allows you to play with a few friends.

My teammates all live far away from one another and are bronze-plat solo que but ranked 5s gives us a chance to all be competitive together even from so many miles apart. \nSometimes we do great, other times we get stomped but we always have a good time. Learn from one another and stay in touch by playing a few games of ranked 5s twice a week. We started out at Bronze 4, and are now silver 4. We had so much fun through the climb and really hope riot considers finding a way to keep ranked 5s.

But it will be for reals solo this time.*\n\nWell played, Riot. Solid setup with the tryhard solo queue and the team-based dynamic queue. Phasing out the old 5's mode is fine with me, as well.\n\nLooking forward to the tweaks and improvements in the new champion select, too. Even with the little hiccups, the new champ select and party system have been really refreshing. This season should be a good one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-19T07:49:21.900+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":17,"body":"I definitely appreciate the team's ability to be dynamic ;) and flexible.

You first stated that separate queues were too risky, and then a paragraph later decide that it's what you guys are doing? \n\nSo the plan is to replace the current solo queue with dynamic, and then make a separate solo queue? Why would you not just keep solo, you know, solo, and add in dynamic as the new/separate queue? Does this mean if we want to join the solo queue ladder, we'll have to start over, as in our mmr is completely reset? And rewards will be shifted towards dynamic? Who is going to want to play solo queue if they have to start over, and most of the rewards are shifted towards dynamic? The entire reason people wanted to solo, was because they felt dynamic rank wouldn't mean as much as a measure of self progression, and bragging rights. If dynamic becomes the primary queue, nobody is going to care about solo rankings. \n\nI don't see the new solo queue becoming popular, due to not being the primary queue, having to start over, and having rewards aimed towards a different queue. (Making assumptions based off how I interpreted the post, as details were not announced.) Due to this, it seems like you guys would eventually just remove it anyways. Was that the plan all along? It honestly seems to me like you guys just decided to choose dynamic, and threw in this solo-queue to temporarily hush the naysayers, knowing that it would fail as a secondary queue. It might've even been popular as a solo/duo (old system), but you made sure there was no chance it would survive by taking it out. I realize you want to make dynamic queue the primary queue, and based on your post, the majority of players supported it over solo/duo. If this is true, then dynamic would've survived as a secondary queue on it's own. Solo, due to the reasoning above, would not. If you truly wanted both queues to thrive, you would've made dynamic the secondary queue, and you must've known that. I'm heavily in support of the old system of solo/duo, but I honestly would have rather you guys kept dynamic as the primary queue, and not done anything else, than to present this fake solution. It's kind of a slap to the face. Oh well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voltt","date":"2016-01-19T20:54:20.718+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"So with no Ranked 5 teams, How exactly will eSports continue because they will have no way to tell which teams are the good challenger teams anymore without the ranked 5s ladder.

TB was the place where you could play any off-meta thing you wanted, no flaming, because people could choose if they wanted to play with you or not. Also you could pick that one champion and role you wanted and play for 30 games in a row **guaranteed**, if you like. That was perfect for practicing a champ or for people who don't have a big championpool. In TB no one really cared about team comps and getting countered or anything, it's more about having fun and getting better at a particular champion. \n\nAll these perks are lost. You choose 2 roles, you never know which one you get, maybe you don't care but maybe there's only one role you want to play atm. That already means no 30 games in a row with the same champ in the same role (at least it's not likely), also your champ might be banned. If I choose Teemo Support most likely people aren't going to be really happy about it ;D In TB that wasn't an issue, someone would accept me in their group, I just had to wait for people who are actually okay with it.
