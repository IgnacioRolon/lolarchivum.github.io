Initially, we tuned the detection to be _very conservative_ because we wanted to be absolutely sure Instant Feedback could distinguish bad games from genuine intentional feeding. Now that the system’s crunched through a few million games of data, we feel confident turning intentional feeding detection up a notch.  \n\nLike with all adjustments to Instant Feedback, the team will hand review the first few thousand cases to make sure everything’s working the way it’s meant to. This upgrade’s already live in NA, and will roll out worldwide before the end of the year. In fact, the system’s already made its first ban. The /allchat log reads:\n\n[All] (Hecarim): uh... i dont care\n[All] (Hecarim): and riot will not care\n[All] (Hecarim): who wants kill?\n\nOh Hecarim. We care a lot. We’ll update this post when the feature’s gone global.\n\nEDIT ::: We are now rolling the system out in EUW.","replies":[{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2015-11-06T03:05:09.878+0000","up_votes":148,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lyte,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=i5yNt3I5,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-06T02:33:56.699+0000)\n> Hecarim: uh... i dont care\n> Hecarim: and riot will not care\n> Hecarim: who wants kill?\n\n[  ] Not Rekt\n[  ] Rekt\n[X] Tyrannosaurus Rekt","replies":[{"poster":"enemy standuser","date":"2015-11-06T10:52:06.999+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-11-07T00:45:08.047+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:89}} Praise the sun, for it brings us lyte!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2015-11-06T07:05:29.425+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"That pun was beautiful.
