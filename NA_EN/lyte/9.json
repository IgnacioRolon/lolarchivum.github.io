We need **your** help! \n\nIF you have a queue time **over 15 minutes**, and have had NO QUEUE POPS or QUEUE DODGES at all, please post:\n\n1) Time of Day \n2) Queue Time so Far (Screenshot would be best!)\n3) Summoner Name (in case it's different than the account you are posting with)\n4) Primary/Secondary Positions\n5) Rank Tier\n6) Premade Friends and their Summoners (if you were premade)\n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT ::: We believe we found the tuning issue that resulted in longer queue times. If you see queue times above 30 minutes, please keep posting. We'll do a tuning change Monday morning that should dramatically reduce high queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"Canzieatzyou","date":"2016-01-16T18:40:43.194+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I love the new style quite a bit. And I can totally see what you guys are TRYING to do and I appreciate that too. \n\nBut... I hate it. The queue times are long, the pick/ban is long then someone dodges and it starts all over again. Yuck. Not sure what can be done about that honestly, so I suppose its something I will have to get used to.\n\nFurthermore, i have seen a serious incline of trolling. Be it troll picks, feeders or ragers in game. I have had to report more people in the last few days than the last two months combined. Not sure whats causing that but I sure hope it thins out soon. \n\nBut the primary reason I hate it is having to choose two roles. Frankly I dont want to choose two roles. The queue times suck enough already so I would be fine waiting a bit longer to actually get the role I want. Especially since it seems ill be playing with toxic people anyway. I may as well have as much fun and get as much experience at my preferred role as I can. \n\nI get it, you see team builder as a redundant system and feel its not needed. Ok cool. Then please give us an option to queue for only one role. Or, when the game pops let us see what role it assigned us. That way if we dont feel like playing the secondary role, we dont have to accept and we can reenter the queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Deekayh","date":"2016-01-17T20:55:59.264+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"^\nAnother thing i hate, you have to LOCK IN, otherwise its  a \"dodge\". When i pick a bann or a champ, i dont want to have to LOCK IN to get my pick. Sometime when you are last pick, you just want to take the whole timer you have to set my masteries.
