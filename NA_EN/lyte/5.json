We saw what you saw. Scarra had some massive queue times--even worse than the old Ranked system. Pro teams were outfoxing teams made up of high skill solos and we&rsquo;re seeing some awful matches at the Challenger level. We also ran into matchmaking and implementation issues. Beyond this, dynamic queue raises philosophical questions about what it means to be a ranked player in League of Legends, so we&rsquo;re going to talk about that as well.\n\nFirst, we failed to communicate that new champ select came with a brand new matchmaking system built to handle position selection as part of matchmaking. We tested on PBE and with simulated matchmaking for weeks, but there&rsquo;s nothing quite like going live. We knew matchmaking would require tuning, which is why we launched this preliminary test during preseason and not the day the ranked season starts. \n\nImplementing this system came with a number of matchmaking tuning issues and hardware failures, some of which have already been fixed. We&rsquo;ll quickly run through them and how they impacted you:\n\n* The matchmaking feature ensuring premade teams were facing other premade teams was configured too loosely, and allowed premade teams to match against teams of solos too often. \n\n* Our new matching making system didn&rsquo;t account for hardware failures and left players stranded in matchmaking with giant queue times. \n\n* The matchmaking feature that tried to reduce queue times for high-skill players was too aggressive, and matched pro-level players against Diamond players rather than other Master and Challenger players.\n\nWe are taking steps to address these issues. Specifically, we&rsquo;ve adjusted how aggressively we match top-tier players and have started enforcing the premade matching rules more strictly. We are collecting data and will continue to adjust matchmaking every day until the season starts.\n\nNow let&rsquo;s talk about the elephant in the room: the philosophy behind ranked. Current competitive players use their ranked standing as a more pure expression of mechanical skill, game knowledge, and the ability to cooperate with solo or duo&rsquo;d players. For those players, the ranked queue was doing its job by emphasizing individual playmaking over one&rsquo;s ability to &lsquo;make do&rsquo; with variable teammates. The expectation was that everyone else climbing the ranked ladder also dealt with the same variables with no exceptions. Dynamic queue changes this considerably, so why rock the boat?\n\nLast year, we investigated why players didn&rsquo;t play ranked, and a huge number said they didn&rsquo;t want to abandon their friends to do it. In other words, there was a large subset of players who wanted to play competitively with friends on a ranked ladder, but lacked a great avenue to do so. We constantly talk about how League is a team game, and we want our core, competitive ladder to reflect that. The ranked queue might be synonymous with the term &lsquo;solo queue&rsquo;, but even a solo/duo queue rewards a player&rsquo;s ability to work as a part or as the leader of a team. The goal was to hone in on that team-like atmosphere without hitting the tremendous commitment issues of ranked 5&rsquo;s.\n\nThis lead us to the introduction of dynamic queues. We designed dynamic queues so the highest level of play relies on teamwork in addition to mechanics and clever application of encyclopedic knowledge. In other words, our vision for ranked is that it should be a more accurate reflection of teamwork, leadership, knowledge and skill. \n\nBut with all that laid out, the question is, &ldquo;_Is that the right vision for ranked League of Legends?_&rdquo; \n\nWe hear you on the impact dynamic queues have on the measurement of solo skill. We&rsquo;re currently doing everything we can to make dynamic queues a great experience, and we [always had back up plans](https://dd.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3rht20/new_ranked_solo_queue_megathread/cwop63f?context=3) for the 2016 ranked season. For now, we want to share some early data on how things are going, where we&rsquo;re at with matchmaking, and how players have responded so far in surveys. We understand this is a philosophical issue in the long-run, but we want to bring some data into the conversation so everyone is working with some facts. \n\nKeep in mind that the issues we&rsquo;re addressing influenced this data, and we plan on revisiting them after a weekend&rsquo;s worth can be evaluated:\n\n* **On the topic of premades vs. solo queuers**: We expected about 95% of premade 4s/5s to match up against other premades of that size, but we fell short at around 83.5%. We still expect this number to reach 95% after we tune matchmaking, and we&rsquo;ll keep a close eye on this issue. \n\n* **In terms of match quality in dynamic queues**: We measure match quality by the difference in average skill between two opposing teams. Currently we&rsquo;re seeing 92.8% of games are about equal to last season&rsquo;s solo/duo queue (and overall matchmaking is better than Team Builder). Because of the issues we just fixed, we don&rsquo;t have good data on the skill differentials between premade 4s/5s, but they&rsquo;re on our watch list of things to track and fix, if necessary.\n\n* **When we polled a random set of players across all of League of Legends the specific question**: &ldquo;I like that you are allowed to queue with any number of people to play ranked&rdquo;, about 55% of players agreed, 20% were neutral, and 25% disagreed. We&rsquo;re not saying this to sway opinions either way--it tells us the system is both polarizing, and broadly desired. We&rsquo;ll check in on this statistic again next week.\n\n* **For queue time (queue start to champ select)**, as measured during non-peak hours, we&rsquo;re averaging three minute queues across all players, and about eight and a half minutes for Master+ players. This is also something we&rsquo;ll be looking to improve over the weekend.\n\nAll that said, please keep testing dynamic queues through the weekend, and keep sharing your feedback. We&rsquo;re going to be scouring the boards, and fixing issues as they come up. **On Tuesday, 1/19**, we&rsquo;ll make a decision about the state of dynamic queues and share a plan for the 2016 ranked season launch.\n\nEDIT ::: Corrected the survey results. They were actually sent to a random sample of the entire playerbase, not just players who played Dynamic Queues. Also, when you broke down the analysis to players who played Dynamic Queues or those who did not, the results were not significantly different.","replies":[{"poster":"Rilea","date":"2016-01-16T06:00:24.975+0000","up_votes":163,"down_votes":23,"body":"Thank you for your honesty regarding a controversial topic - one of the many reasons I love Riot as a company is their honesty and communication with the community\n\nAs a player who purely plays alone, I dislike dynamic queues - I like the idea of a ranked queue testing how you adapt from game to game with a new set of teammates - not how well you can synergise with a group of friends over a course of hundreds of games - in my opinion, that is what the Ranked 5v5 queue is for\n\nI understand that Riot wants to facilitate the players that want to play ranked with friends, but don't have the a stable amount of friends to form a Ranked 5s team, but in doing so with Dyanmic queues, it feels as if exclusively solo players like myself are being forced to make friends and play with them (even if I don't like it or want to) else I am being severely hindered in game with factors outside of mechanical skill, game knowledge etc.\n\nI truly believe the best solution is to have a seperate Ranked Dynamic and Ranked Solo/Duo queue, so both solo players and groups of players can play and enjoy ranked in the way they want to.

Please don't screw with the value of my own individual skill by giving 3/5-man parties the same ranked ladder as solo players.  Although I doubt Riot is fond of Dota, they really could've learned a thing or two here.  Dota has Party MMR and Solo MMR for ranked.  Literally no one takes Party MMR seriously.  What league is doing is merging Party and Solo MMR, thus lowering the value of solo ranking because you can get the exact same score using large parties.\n\nLeague is a team game, but let's be real here: people do not play League of Legends because they want incredible teamwork.  Why do you think supports are so unpopular, especially very traditional \"supporty\" supports?  Teamwork just enhances the experience in many roles.  No, most people want to showcase and improve individual talent (hence the extreme popularity of \"solo carry\" champions).  At least, that's how all of my friends think and it's how I think.\n\nTLDR: People want soloque, not group que.  If you want to implement Dynamic Que, keep it out of soloque.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CelestiaTheDryad","date":"2016-01-16T07:45:54.749+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lyte,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=XvqbAgrF,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-01-16T05:48:06.262+0000)\n> * **On the topic of premades vs. solo queuers**: We expected about 95% of premade 4s/5s to match up against other premades of that size, but we fell short at around 83.5%. We still expect this number to reach 95% after we tune matchmaking, and we'll keep a close eye on this issue. \n\nWhy is 100% such a problem? Why is it even a discussion for it to not be 100%? Even at 95%, that's still 1/20 games that are essentially free wins for people that play as 5-person premades. Assuming balanced games elsewhere, that's plenty to climb the ladder. And for the singletons that get stomped by the 5-man, it's the worst feeling in the game. You're losing horribly in the queue that's supposed to be tailored to your skill level, **and it's not even your fault.** It's the queue system giving you a great big finger.\n\nI'm guessing the logic for the 95% is that it will even out over a lot of games with people playing in various premade sizes. But that's working under the assumption that people play in various premade sizes. I prefer, and have always preferred, to play ranked alone. This is because I used ranked solo queue to determine **my personal skill level** compared to everyone else.\n\nI played about 250 ranked games last season, and roughly 15 of those were duo games. And those 15 were only because my friends pressured me into them. On the other hand, I have a friend who's only ranked games are ranked teams, and 5 man queues are the only type he feels like playing. In the new system, he and I are matched on the same ladder. Because of this 95% practice, his rank will be inflated by an amount and mine deflated by an amount simply because of matchmaking.\n\nWhich builds into my next point. Ranked queue no longer functions as a measure of individual skill. It was foggy enough with duo queue's ridiculous restrictions (gold V to plat I, really? the differences between those rankings are like night and day). But with the 3-5 man premades there's simply nothing left. The simple fact is that variable party makeups destroy the value of the ranking system.\n\nSay there's two players, Player 1 and Player 2. P1 only plays by himself and is matched against other solo players. P2 plays only with friends in 5s and is only matched against other 5s. They should, hopefully, never get matched with each other. The players they play against belong to two different groups. However, they are both ranked on the same ladder as having Gold 3 skill. Their ratings are not comparable and should not be listed as so. Their ratings just means that they're skilled \"in some way\".\n\nI imagine the problem will be even worse in the highest levels, since at the top of mechanical play, the players who play in a group have an advantage that cannot be matched in terms of rating. If TSM goes strolling in dynamic queue, the only people to stop them are other LCS teams doing the same. It becomes impossible to prove yourself as a single player.\n\nFurthermore, your reasoning for this is so that \"you are allowed to queue with any number of people to play ranked\". There were already ranked teams that allowed you to queue as 5. Solo/duo queue let you queue ranked as 1 or 2 people. So this whole system is rocking the boat for the sole purpose of letting people queue as 3 or 4 people. I don't get that decision at all. And don't give me any of that crap about \"the tremendous commitment issues of ranked 5s\", the only reason that might not exist in dynamic queue is because people are getting compared against people not playing in premades, and issue I've already pointed out. You can start and join as many ranked teams as you want so the results don't matter. The only reason it feels more serious is because you know it's team vs team rather than group of people vs group of people, which is what premades in dynamic queue should feel like anyway.\n\nWhat i'd suggest is Solo queue, 2/3s queue, and teams. I understand that this won't happen because of \"splitting the playerbase\" issues, but it needs to be realized that the people queuing as 5 man premades will already be separated from the people in 2 or 3 person queues and people going solo. Or at least **should** be for the reasons I've outlined. Riot is simply trying to cram too many styles of play into one ladder and queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DadVees4","date":"2016-01-16T07:41:41.131+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":8,"body":"> \"Last year, we investigated why players didn’t play ranked, and a huge number said they didn’t want to abandon their friends to do it.

My friends and I play League together almost every night. I am diamond and my friends range from Silver to Plat V. I love competing, but I also enjoy playing with my friends. I should like dynamic queue, right? Well I don't, and here's why:\n\nNormals give me plenty of opportunity to play with my friends. Ranked solo gives me the opportunity to compete with other players, try as hard as I can, and improve. It also gives me a place to prove my skill/dedication compared to other competitive players.\n\nEnter dynamic queue. I will still play normals with my friends because I cannot queue with them for ranked (I wouldn't even if I could). When I want to play ranked I have two options - I can either continue to play by myself, which puts me at a disadvantage, or I can find 4 other people to play with to make the most of the system. If I choose to play by myself, my personal achievements will be compared to other people who chose to play as a group of 5. Even if I never have to play a game against a group (5% of the time I will) I still am compared against them in the ladder. Even if I do decide to play ranked with a group, it no longer is a gauge of my personal skill. Either way this new system makes my ranking meaningless. It is either inflated by the fact that I played with a group, or it loses meaning when compared to the inflated rankings of other players who did queue as a group. \n\nI guess the question at the end of the day is if every aspect of league needs to be inclusive to every league player. Say 10 people are at a party. 6 of them are playing go fish and having a great time. The other 4 are playing a very competitive game of poker, but also having a great time. The host of the party wants everyone to play together, so they decide that they're going to take away one deck of cards. Now all 10 people are playing go fish together, and some of them are still having a great time, but some of them are not enjoying the party as much as they were before. Sure, they're playing with the group, but they didn't choose this, and they were having more fun before. \n\nThis is how I see dynamic queue. It does not give me more ways to play, it give me less.

Perhaps those players would prefer to play ranked with their friends, but they could have easily formed a ranked team, so you have to ask yourself why they weren't. Dynamic queue seems to solve for the objection that it's hard to get 5 friends on at the same time, but is that the main objection?\n\nCould it be that individual ranking & pride in individual accomplishment, by its intrinsic nature, makes it very challenging to play with people who you want to get along with? Could it be that team environments with aligned individual incentives to be good teammates and friends are best served by recognizing the accomplishments of the team as the primary metric for success?\n\nI believe that's the case. I don't want to play solo-rank with my friends because we have different skill levels. I don't play much ranked because I don't want to abandon my friends, but I don't want ranked to change so they can play with me.\n\nI think Riot's core business revolves around people believing they could be at the top. Dynamic queue is a tradeoff between competitiveness and fun. If your business goals align with making the game more fun, then this may be a move in the right direction. But I think making the game more fun  is not necessarily in your best interests as a business. That is, not when the fun has a trade off.\n\nBroad live testing is certainly the right approach, but be careful. Even if this game is merely perceived to be less competitive (and that perception is wrong), it may be enough to damage the real value in your business. Riot isn't so successful because they have the most fun game on the market. Fun isn't enough.

I only play with friends in normals for that reason. \n\nIt's flawed in a ranked system because ranked will mean nothing with this queue.

When comparing single players with a system like that, it is very quickly possible to determine their skills. We ran two \"leagues\", one for solo play and one of tag team dueling. Our seasons lasted a month after which everyone was reset. 1500 Elo was the standard. During one of the seasons, I asked a good player (2403 rating in the previous season) to play with a \"poor\" player (around 1100 rating in the previous season) in the tag team league for a season.\n\nTheir individual ranks were around the same for that season (the good player dropped slightly, but not much), but their \"ranked team\" ended up at 1927 rating. This was not an accurate reading of either player's skill level, but as they only played together in that league, it was impossible to determine where each of them were. If you compared the low-placed player with the people he played with in the solo league, he looked to be head and shoulders above them (like bronze vs plat above them), but his actual skill wasn't anywhere near that; he was just being carried.\n\n**Dynamic Queue in Heroes of the Storm**\nIn Heroes of the Storm they used to have dynamic queue, but honestly, it just wasn't working. There were several reasons for this:\n\nThe premades rose insanely high, far higher than the individual players were fit for and the second they no longer played with their premade they were a huge deficit for their team. I have friends who, before the reset and removal, were ranked around rank 1-4, who can't get below rank 20 when they only have duo queue. This, apart from meaning their rank did not reflect their skill level, meant that there were fights that were hugely imbalanced because the match making had no way to account for the MMR of the player not being valid.\n\nAll harassment issues aside (and yes, the 5th player when there was a 4 man premade did face quite a bit of harassment), there was a different problem for the solo player in a 4 man premade; They hardly got a say in what the team did. You might say \"Oh, but you don't do that in solo queue at the moment either\", which might be true, but neither does the rest of your team. But when the rest of your team is on skype/VT/Whatever together, they can plan, discuss and coordinate without you. We all know that ganks work best when well coordinated and at high levels of play, this can be done wordlessly with 2 or 3 pings. Not so much at lower elos. Hands on your hearts, junglers who play with your friends at bronze, silver, gold level; How much more likely are you to gank the lane your premade is in than another lane, if both lanes are doing equal? Now imagine only the top laner is not on your team. He is the only one you can't coordinate your ganks with at the same level as you can with the others.\n\nThe last problem was the frequency with which players got matched in a 4-5 man premade vs all solo queue. These games were no fun, and usually stupidly quick stomps. You say you will prevent this in 95 % of the cases, and that number is still too low to me. That's 5 % almost guaranteed win for the premades by default.\n\n**Suggestions**\nRather than looking to destroy the idea of ranked meaning anything about the player's skill, how about we look to improve ranked 5 man instead? I agree that the current system is far too rigid and has way too many problems, but I have an alternative solution, because Heroes of the Storm actually fixed it, imo.\n\nTheir ranked system has two queues:\n\n* Ranked solo/duo\n\n* Ranked team\n\nHow is this different from how League does it at the moment, you might ask. The difference is that you don't make a team to play ranked teams. You just group up, press play and then it finds you a match. You then have a rank, not for a specific team, but for your skill in teams. So, if I have 4 friends (A, B, C and D), we can just go play a few games of ranked team. We then get a rank of, let's say... Silver 2. Then B has to leave, but another guy E asks if he can play. We then invite him, and go play team league without any hassle at all. His and our ranks are combined to make a MMR (like dynamic queue would do it) and we are then matched with someone approximately equal.\n\nNo hassle, no great big barrier of entry.\n\nedit: Just a small extra question for Lyte: Have you considered that asking players who are playing ranked at the moment is not a good indicator? People playing ranked at the moment is probably people excited with the new system while many solo players might skip out on it, hoping it will be changed back soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D1onys1us","date":"2016-01-16T11:31:34.882+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm master rank on EUW and I wish to keep playing SOLO que, I don't want to play with friends in ranked and I don't play this game to make friends.\n\nHow it currently stands there's no way I'll ever reach master again seeing the MASSIVE disadvantages of playing vs constant premade teams. This is completely unfair and makes your individual rank completely useless as it isn't a correct measurement of skill anymore.\n\nI wish we had a true SOLO que, a dynamic one and a 5v5 one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rockman","date":"2016-01-16T09:24:01.346+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":5,"body":"Delete 4 man premades\n\nyou have all the evidence you need they shouldn't exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silvonius","date":"2016-01-16T06:51:44.442+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":6,"body":"Dynamic queue completely sucks the fun out of ranked for me. I spent last game getting constantly gang-banged in lane by an obvious pre-made who were voice coordinating 3 and 4 man ganks and tower dives. Then, even though we were only 3 kills down and almost even in objectives my team surrendered at 20 because I guess the 4 premade on my team decided they didnt feel like playing anymore. Any way you look at it, the solo players on a team with pre-mades are getting shafted. \n\nOn top of that, there will be people who only play with friends but will be ranked on the same ladder as me and other solo players. That doesn't make any sense and it de-values the value of someone's individual rank.\n\nSolo queue should be solo only, I don't think they should even allow duo queue. And they need to bring team builder back because team builder was the only way to guarantee getting a specific champion whenever I felt like trying a specific champ and role. \n\nIf they bring back solo queue (I could live with duo as well lol), remove dynamic queue and allow the option to pick only a primary role without needing to choose a secondary I'd be happy. I don't think the more casual players who play with friends a lot understand just how different the dynamic queue feels to people who are hardcore into solo-queue and earning their solo rank. \n\nIf they're making their final decision about dynamic queue on tuesday then I guess that's when I'll decide whether to quit this game or not after 3000 hours of gameplay. I know that seems a bit dramatic but League is my favorite game and something that I've spent many hours a day on for years, and it's sad to see it ruined like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Top Lane Tommy","date":"2016-01-16T17:39:50.051+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are only 3 real solutions I see:\n\n1.

Last season the duo-queue option wasn't bad since it had very minimal impact in terms of outcomes. But 3+ premades just makes it easier to exploit and bully out the soloists. Then again the psychological ambiguity that ranked gameplay implements in to minds of the players, especially hidden info like mmr, is a big factor with stuff like smurfs playing with friends and so forth. Personally I feel like there should be risk vs reward when playing as a team with friends in dynamic queue. I've mentioned that depending on how many people you queue up with LP gains and losses should be adjusted to reflect the skill cap that gets shifted by how much synergy is within the team or yourself. I feel like if you go solo (which is basically making matches much easier to fill up and get made) you should get rewarded more than if you play with friends. This is for people who want the faster climb. Vs people who still want to play with friends in a competitive and fun environment.","replies":[]}]}
