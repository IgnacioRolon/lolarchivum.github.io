What prompted this change? Is there any concern about champ select quotes (Sona, etc.) that don't make much sense this way?\n\nWe're planning some deep dives and behind the scenes looks at the building of the new Champ Select, and our initial testing was actually with these ugly (sorry boourns!) prototypes that just had grey boxes and words. This is called UX lab testing in the games industry, and allows design teams to focus feedback and testing on the actual _functional experience_ of the system and not be distracted by the polish of fancy visuals or animations. It's only until pretty far in the project until you start adding in the stuff that makes the system look like magic.\n\nThe Champ Select quotes being played was actually a spontaneous idea by RiotBahamut. He was tinkering with the Champ Select and thought it would be cool, and the team instantly loved how it felt. We're aware there could be some trolling or spammy experiences, but we think the overall value would be worthwhile. In fact, we'd love to add some more easter eggs to the system...","replies":[{"poster":"Top Ramen Chef","date":"2015-11-12T20:06:07.966+0000","up_votes":279,"down_votes":3,"body":"> In fact, we'd love to add some more easter eggs to the system...\n\nIf we pick an all Demacian team, can you make it so the entire team yells DEMACIA! when the final champ is locked in? ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Crazytank","date":"2015-11-12T22:09:00.020+0000","up_votes":190,"down_votes":2,"body":"I never knew I wanted this until now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ADepressedLeona","date":"2015-11-12T18:39:33.269+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":7,"body":"I still have a concern with everyone showing what champion they want to play before the bans.\n\nI can already see the trolls grinning from ear to ear.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryedan","date":"2015-11-12T19:17:53.829+0000","up_votes":113,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snowy Poro,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WV2VqZca,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-12T18:39:33.269+0000)\n>\n> I still have a concern with everyone showing what champion they want to play before the bans.\n> \n> I can already see the trolls grinning from ear to ear.\n\nBans are important. In the live version of Draft, the captain has the opportunity to use 3 bans to troll his teammates. Each ban used to \"troll\" allies means that some dangerous, high value champ is left on the table. The distribution of bans makes it so when you DO have someone trolling, their power is contained to a single ban.\n\nAlso, you don't have to declare a champion intent if you don't want. Something I pitched to Lyte was having the 6 roles (Tank, Mage, Assassin, Fighter, Support, Marksman) available in the champion grid as an option instead of declaring a specific champion, so you could be like \"We have a Fiddlesticks jungle and we have a Leona bot, I think I should play a fighter top to round out the comp, but I'm not sure which one.\"\n\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Skadeglädje","date":"2015-11-12T19:22:39.802+0000","up_votes":36,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ryedan,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WV2VqZca,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-11-12T19:17:53.829+0000)\n> Also, you don't have to declare a champion intent if you don't want.

Ultimately we believe this will let players focus on strategy instead of just trying to figure out positions.\n\nMy experience using it on the PBE was that the trolling issue wasn't as bad as people feared -- and in fact because there was more clarity about positions, there was less of it than usual.  The only time in champ select that it came up was when I tried to play a champion in a non-meta role -- namely, jungle Lulu.  I knew from then on to declare a more meta but similar jungle (say, Kindred) and then switch during select.\n\nHowever, the benefit of declaring champs was terrific in general. For example, when several people chose champs who popped people up (for example, I was playing support Zyra), one of the earlier pick players changed his mid pick to Yasuo.  Also, it really gave everyone a chance to talk and say, \"Woah, we don't have a tank here.  Can someone pick one?\" I enjoyed the new champ select experience on the PBE, and I think people are worried about trolling too much.  Trolls will be trolls (and they can be reported). The new champ select makes the situation better.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GPU","date":"2015-11-12T19:18:13.841+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey guys, when will this go live in EUW?","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2015-11-12T19:26:37.314+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tryiaxle,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WV2VqZca,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2015-11-12T19:18:13.841+0000)\n>\n> Hey guys, when will this go live in EUW?\n\nWe'd like to do some pre-season testing on NA and TR first, and if things are going well, we'll rapidly roll it out globally.","replies":[{"poster":"HeruEdhel","date":"2015-11-12T19:28:49.665+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":3,"body":"do we have an eta on when it would role out on NA?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2015-11-12T22:13:09.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just out of curiosity why do you do all your testing on the NA servers which has your largest server population instead of testing it out on smaller servers that would effect less people if something goes wrong first?","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2015-11-13T08:36:46.933+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fongletto,realm=OCE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WV2VqZca,comment-id=001000000004,timestamp=2015-11-12T22:13:09.212+0000)\n>\n> Just out of curiosity why do you do all your testing on the NA servers which has your largest server population instead of testing it out on smaller servers that would effect less people if something goes wrong first?\n\nWe see this question a lot, so going to jump in even though it's late in the thread. When we choose to test new systems and features, it has everything to do with timezone. Although some teams work in multiple offices around the world, 100% of our team works in the LA office which means we prefer to choose a test server that has a timezone that does **NOT** completely wreck our sleep schedules.\n\nYou generally want to turn on a new feature or system during off-peak hours, say 6 AM, and then monitor it for about 24 hours at a time. By choosing NA, we can basically wake up and sleep at an OK time which is far less exhausting for the team.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FlippyGoneTrippy","date":"2015-11-12T18:50:53.769+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm worried that this will increase the time before games by too much.

We may re-visit this in the future though, and would just have to balance out the negative behaviors that were created. For example, in a distant future when we have more than 5 levels of Champion Mastery, maybe we only show Champion Mastery **only** when you are Level 10 or higher--this is a significant investment, and something \"cool\" to show you're a master with a champion. However, Level 10 might be a lofty, challenging goal. If we decided to show, say Level 2 Champ Mastery or higher, it would create an immediate perception that if you WEREN'T showing Champ Mastery with a champ, that you shouldn't play Ranked at all. We're aware some players would love this type of \"gate\" on who you can play in Ranked, but it's not something we're going to consider today because there are more important issues to improve in Ranked Mode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanillite","date":"2015-11-12T19:17:04.353+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will we be able to choose ward skins and buy champion skins in the future during the new select?","replies":[{"poster":"Lyte","date":"2015-11-12T19:19:23.668+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=yifei123,realm=EUW,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WV2VqZca,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2015-11-12T19:17:04.353+0000)\n>\n> Will we be able to choose ward skins and buy champion skins in the future during the new select?\n\nYes!

At the beginning, we actually had Players 1, 2, 3, get the bans, then Players 4 and 5 get 1st and 2nd pick. However, this was super confusing to players in the testing because they already had **years** of prior experience of picks \"starting\" from the top of the team. So, we swapped it the current format where Players 3, 4, 5 get the bans, then we \"reset\" into Pick Phase and start from the top. This was much clearer for current players of the game, so we stuck with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bauble","date":"2015-11-12T20:16:36.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guys please.. very important question for me!\nDid you consider adding Summoner Icon Select into new Champion Select?

Your summoner icon isn't really shown in champ select (unless you count the load screen). Let's be honest - as your ally, I care more about what you're playing than what your icon is in champ select.\n\nNow, being able to choose icons, ward skins, skins, chromas, finishers etc. all together AFTER I've selected my champion is a feature set we're considering.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NativePervert","date":"2015-11-12T19:09:28.295+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"when will this be released?","replies":[]}]}
