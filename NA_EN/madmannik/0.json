If I try to move toward any lane from base - and not moving the mouse while champ moving - it will freeze for about 2-6 seconds. After the 2-6 second lag/freeze, the champ will move smooth for like 2-3 seconds, and then again, go in-to this *** freeze-state in same amount of seconds.\r\n   _If I move and click constantly it will run with very few freezes, but as a jungler or any laner for that matter, this isn't an viable option. The \r\n   loss of LP and not being able to make plays or communicate proper makes the game hopeless and frustrating.   _\r\n\r\nI've read numerous posted on the boards about this very issue the past weeks. For many fellow summoners this have been a big problem for several months. In these posts I've followed every advise known to man - and still, nothing have worked.\r\n\r\n**List of options which were followed**: (some options are not listed as being to obvious like internet connecting etc.)\r\n\r\n_- Uninstalling the game.\r\n- Re-patching and several full repairs with Hextech Repair Tool. \r\n- Changed graphics\r\n- Disabled 'Shake Mouse Pointer to Locate' in Accessibility\r\n- Ignored the 'built-in trackpad when...' in Mouse &amp; Trackpad in the Interaction Menu.\r\n- Delete game.cfg file in Config folder _\r\n\r\nWe need some help right now. Several Rioters are aware of the problem and it's driving people insane. \r\n If anyone has any new work-arounds or thoughts about this please do share. Been way too long! \r\n\r\nAwaiting some magic from the Riot wizards.. \r\n\r\n~~Peace. ~~","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-23T23:01:21.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of those steps have been able to help out with these weird Mac mouse issues, and I've got one more trick up my sleeve too.
