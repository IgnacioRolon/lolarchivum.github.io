The entire time I was lagging, and because I was playing lee sin, that obviously didn't go well. Tired of dealing with the constant increases in ping, I decided to simply restart my game. Upon restarting it, I was greeted with a message that stated something along the lines of: Restoring client to an older version, will update now. I attempted to log in, only to find out that I couldn't log in because my \"Username or password is incorrect\" After seeing this, I typed it out several times, copying and pasting it from other windows, only to get the same error message over and over. I checked to see if my internet worked by loading the boards on the computer, as well as a few other web pages, which worked perfectly fine. The problem wasn't my internet or my login credentials, and I was forced out of the game entirely. I restarted the client several times, which changed nothing at all. This error is very frustrating, please fix it so that other players don't have to go through this, I can't imagine how bad it could be during ranked. I've linked an image pointing out the error here.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:27:19.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're still getting that incorrect name or password error, try changing your region to something different and then switching back to NA. It should force another patch and then let you login. Hit me back if that doesn't help!","replies":[]}]}
