While I'm trying to be patient and frankly, am happy just to be accepted, I'm wondering how the progress is coming along. No updates have been posted on the PBE Status Page, or anywhere else that I'm aware of.  Please give us some feedback on what's happening with the website update, thank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-24T04:08:35.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That signup page is still down while we work on improving the signup process. It's been a little shitty for awhile now, so we want to do our best to make the process a little easier for our Summoners as well as ourselves. Be sure to check up on the [**PBE Status**](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) every now then to know when it's open again.","replies":[]}]}
