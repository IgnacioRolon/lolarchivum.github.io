Taking an of the assassins and putting them against each other, they would be pretty matched and the better player would win, but in  {{champion:84}}  case, she has been screwed over.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/oYoKrR47-akalis-rework\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Lyq8BlsJ-rip-akali\n\nA few things that are wrong about her passive that many might not see is that shes completely lost her damage and a core part of her build, &quot;SpellVamp&quot;. \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/04fc6ec7683aabed1cb06c37371dd466\n\nHer current Post-Rework passive. as you can see not very assassin like is it? A mage using autos to do anything worth while during laning or skirmishes, not likely but sometimes it could work. you can see where rito is coming from when they wanted to rework {{champion:84}} .\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/78ae2ed554075ba933fde172b02f1a2b\n\nPre Rework as you can see, is more assassin like, the bonus damage and balance between ad and ap was excellent for a Hybrid champ. The difference between balance and Nerf is very clear here. Her old passive didn&#039;t use AP to higher her SpellVamp, but ad, and for her bonus magic damage on &quot;AUTO ATTACKS&quot; they scaled it with AP. the main burst of her came from this first part of the passive &quot;Discipline of Force&quot;. The rework removed this very important part of her kit and changed it to a mini {{champion:84}} q and a auto attack heal which in no way is useful in team fights if you cant burst them down.\n\n{{item:3145}}  is a main build for her, it was nerfed and it also indirectly nerfed {{champion:84}} . the autos and the nerf didn&#039;t help her at all.\n\nAnother thing wrong with her rework is her W. Her shroud is where she {{summoner:4}}  from not where she {{summoner:4}}  too. this leaves not much room for error or to even escape, the extra movement on her is great but not helpful when her ult got so nerfed a lvl 1 support does more damage then it. the two second CD at all ranks is what basically ends it all. &quot;Two seconds omg stop being such a baby&quot; She is an assassin meant to jump from target to target killing them swiftly. The two seconds compared to 2/1/0.5 is really hard to be able to use skilfully in team fights .\n\nLets look at {{champion:55}} . If skilled enough you can Shunpo 4 times with only one kill. her e is the same distance as {{champion:84}}  ult (basically) and the reset form the dagger puts it on a lower CD then {{champion:84}}  ult, whilst also dong more damage due to picking up the dagger and jut the base damage of the ability. \n\nSome of the problems I've had in game were the comparisons to {{champion:84}} and {{champion:55}} As i was playing a {{champion:84}} She had lost her burst, her core passive making her really weak in the game, a change of the build could help her with the spot shes in but the most useful to utilize her passive would work unless you had near perfect cs, and many kills, which as stated before was almost impossible due to the passive change, losing all of her damage. \n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/auEY7jEU-assassins-mini-updates-discussion?comment=000b0000\n\nRiot is trying hard to change akali for the better, and for the akali mains out there, not the casuals. But riot just couldn't reach that mark for just one assassin in the rework. \nhttps://gyazo.com/831fda7d076d0cfae0b2c80c42d4906a For the TLDR people here's the shorter version of all that. Her new passive is a complete waste of a precious rework that wont happen many times for champions (excluding {{champion:13}} ) All the other assassins have the \"assassin\" part worked into their build, other then a few tweaks riot has basically perfected everything, Other then {{champion:84}} . {{champion:55}}  and {{champion:91}}  have more mobility while {{champion:107}}  seems more of an assassin, {{champion:7}} rework turned out for the better with an almost perfect balance in her abilities and, scaling well in the late game. \n\nNow for {{champion:84}}  ult, probably the **MOST IMPORTANT THING** of her kit, the dashing is the only way she was useful, quickly killing on target to another, but they had to slightly change it so it screwed her up so bad, she is basically unplayable, with the low play rate she already has, this isn't helping her at all. The complete nerf to her damage and CD was completely unnecessary when people like Diana can do the same thing almost instantly eg; {{champion:131}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:157}} \n\nAll of the listed champions above all have **2 or more** that can be used in quick succession, faster then 2 seconds. Lee Sin can e during his q instantly.  {{champion:55}}  especially with the multiple target ult and e with  virtually no CD build into her kit not as a glitch or bug or something that has been exploited but as something meant to be there. \n\n\nIn conclusion, she has lost all her identity as an \"assassin\" in this game, her win rate is abysmal, her play rate was low to begin with and now shes worse then {{champion:6}}  and {{champion:266}} at the moment.\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/auEY7jEU-assassins-mini-updates-discussion?comment=000b0000\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/6v44zww3-list-of-champions-who-have-2-or-more-dashes\n\nReddit.com\n\nBoards.na.leagueoflegends.com\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/akalimains/comments/58838r/akali_pbe_changes_my_thoughts/\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/yAMAmmH7-akali-rework\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/u6VQytEY-akali-nerfs\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/0MzYEfaJ-for-everyone-saying-rework-akali-sucks-read-this-s7-lethality-akali-guide\n\nhttp://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-gameplay-feedback/6vQX9EAV-akali-rework-clunky-unfun-ineffective\n\n\nMake {{champion:84}} Great Again","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-11T07:09:36.337+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say Akali and Katarina but then only talk about AKali...\n\nThat said I agree.
