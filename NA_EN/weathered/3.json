The reason was We'd always lose 3-4 Kench's but we'd ace the Jinx's, however TK couldn't push a wave for shit. The game turned into a stalemate until the Jinx's finally got tired and surrendered. Both teams were down to their Nexus and the inhibs had all respawned at least 5 or 6 times each. After that match we got All For One PTSD and swore never to touch that stupid game mode again. Had those Jinx's decided to never surrender I'm pretty sure that game would've gone for the rest of the night and until the sun came up and everybody had to go to work/school. Never in the 3 years I've been playing League have I been in a match that came even close to the time length of that one. It's probably the reason I will do anything to avoid playing Tahm Kench ever again. Another friend of mine got in an {{champion:12}} vs {{champion:14}} match I believe it was. Both teams decided to all build tanks, he said at one point people started right clicking each other and going afk to get food/drink or take a bathroom break. \n\nAll for One is by far the most evil game mode ever created disguised as something fun and innocent/silly. Don't ever go into an AfO match if you don't have 2-3hours of emergency spare time. Nobody wins those matches, they only lose slightly less.\n\n~~Good luck in the pain olympics!~~ \nGood luck with winning some AfO!\n-Vaz-","replies":[{"poster":"ImmortalBloodCY","date":"2016-04-22T09:55:49.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god that seems funny i want to watch that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2016-04-22T14:11:06.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.meme.am/instances/52559801.jpg\n\nhttp://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Mordekaiser_1.jpg Me too... of Elder Dragons!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knalxz","date":"2016-04-21T23:26:55.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You become an {{champion:2}} main.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjqsYzBrP-M","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-04-22T05:44:02.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One for all vs 5 teemos = {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zane Zephyr","date":"2016-04-23T00:31:50.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo and Karthus were disabled last time OFA was up","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Qarekeo","date":"2016-04-23T00:19:55.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You arm wrestle to decide who gets dragon, duh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embertine","date":"2016-04-22T13:53:12.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the last mord to his the dragon gets the ghost.
