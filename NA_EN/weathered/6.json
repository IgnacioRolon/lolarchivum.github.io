Contrary to popular belief, Anivia's passive does not work like GA or Aatrox passive. It has a number of differences that make it work like that. \n\nHere is what probably happens. When Anivia goes into her passive, it blocks out player spell, movement or auto attack input. So a channeled summoner spell like teleport would still be active if she was popped into her egg. However her ult would suggest other wise. If Anivia is ulting and then popped into her egg, the ult stops. That is because her ult can be described as a channeled AND toggled ability. Its like a Vel ult (is channeled the entire duration) and a swain ult (you can turn it on/off almost at will). So when Anivia is ulting and is popped into her passive, the toggle mechanic is turned to off rather than the channel being interrupted. That would also describe why Anivia can't detonate her Q manually while in egg form.\n\nThose are just my observations from being an Anivia main since S1.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2015-12-16T15:02:37.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if you channel an ability and are killed (put into egg form) mid channel the ability will finish the channel and cast?

That is why Anivia can start teleport, go into her egg and have the teleport still active. Her Q is a bit weird though as it is more like a generic skill shot with the option to be a toggle. Kind of like Vel koz Q. If Q was a channel, then you could interrupt the spell itself by interrupting her. What actually happens though is that you will just prevent Anivia from detonating Q early. So if you throw out your Q then immediately get thrown into your egg, the Q skill shot will continue but you will be unable to detonate it early. It will look like the egg threw out the Q, but the Q technically already started before that.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2015-12-16T19:25:16.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
