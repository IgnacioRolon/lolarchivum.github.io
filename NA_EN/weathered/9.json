This is my opinion.*\r\n\r\n**Tip: \"If a player makes you uncomfortable in game, report them.\"**\r\n\r\nNow, I'm a firm believer that you should report someone for doing something report worthy, it makes the world a better place from the perspective of the players who don't appreciate damaging behavior. But on that note, I don't think being uncomfortable is a reason to report a person. There are A LOT of things that can make a person uncomfortable, even more so depending on the specific person and their background or views. \r\n\r\nIf I start talking about Trump, would it make you a little uncomfortable?\r\nIf I started making self depreciating jokes or kms jokes, would it make you a little uncomfortable?\r\nDoes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) make you uncomfortable?\r\n\r\nWell, you get the idea at least. None of these things are reportable or against the rules, but would still fall under \"makes me uncomfortable\". Frankly, I don't think this tip should be kept, or it at least should be rephrased.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-04T03:46:52.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean that's any of the reports, they're all opinionated... cept for \"cheating\" such as scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-07-04T03:52:42.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good deal of the reports aren't really dictated by opinion.
