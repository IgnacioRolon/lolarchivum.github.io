Bard ultimate, Kindred ultimate, Taric ultimate, Ryze ultimate, Kindred W, and those are just the circles.\r\n\r\nI play champions like Grag, Kha, Shaco, and Wu. I enjoy champions with instant action abilities and weavable abilities (I think they take more skill). I haven&#039;t enjoyed any of the new champs.\r\n\r\nI understand this new champ philosophy is easier to balance, &quot;more unique&quot;, and is more focused towards areas and the team. Is there any other reasons? I feel like champs are becoming less mechanical and more focused towards new players with the attention grabbing effects.\r\n\r\n(I don&#039;t want anything about LC$ Big Plays or corrupt Riot or Solo Queue etc etc. Real ideas, good convos)","replies":[{"poster":"ff4sk","date":"2016-07-09T23:02:09.731+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Shaco main here. I feel you on that. I feel like every champion that has came out after bard has been underwhelming (besides maybe tahm kench). They just feel so, uninspiring and lacking in personality.\nMaybe I'm just biased towards older champions but yes, a lot of the newer champions are all \"meh\" I no longer feel any excitement when a new one is released","replies":[]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-09T23:27:36.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a skill be delayed does not reduce the skill required to properly use it.  It requires prediction and/or the ability to force them between taking the powerful, but delayed, skill, or getting caught by other members of your team.\n\nIt's more of a strategic, rather than mechanical, skill type.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2016-07-09T23:04:58.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Delays are there as a form of counterplay since it makes the move much more telegraphed and easier to react to","replies":[{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-07-09T23:09:57.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If everyone plays those champions then high ELO becomes hour-long games where its about who scales because its all telegraphed.\n\nIf I get out played by a Shaco who dodges my skillshot with Q, I'm not mad.
