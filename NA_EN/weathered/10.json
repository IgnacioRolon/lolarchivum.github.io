The only one I can really think of is Evelynn, who is both excellent with Spellblade and poor with Luden's. To be honest, I imagine she'll go back to building Warrior or Cinderhulk again. But who's left aside from that? Nidalee and Diana both like Luden's and while Elise has never built it before, she uses it as well as anyone. Fiddle isn't amazing with Luden's but he's 100x better with that than with Spellblade.
