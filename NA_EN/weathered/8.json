Assassins need mana to get in and out of a fight and to actually make use of their burst rotation. Bruisers need mana to wreck havoc - even if they go an autoattack-based build, their method of diving into the enemy team costs mana.\n\nSo I'm not really sure where you're getting this \"infinite resources\" thing. Mages are balanced around blue buff, yes, but not because no other class would want mana sustain, but because they utilize blue buff so much more effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadragon","date":"2016-04-13T10:26:46.928+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is that almost every champion that uses mana has a comparable base mana pool and base mana regen. Mages have on average about 100 more max mana at level 18 and 3 more mp5.\nMeanwhile their mana costs are double or even triple that of their counterparts. Nonmages tend to have costs around 30-60, while mages can have costs from 100-140 in some cases.\n\nRunning out of mana as Talon is a feat you have to work towards, one that takes about 10 minutes of uptime, using your abilities freely with no regards for your mana costs.\nRunning out of mana as Malzahar, Swain, Xerath, Brand, Lux, etc. is par for the course. You manage your mana carefully and do what you can until you run out, then you play passively until you can regen it back. Playing any of these champions without a mana regen item means that you're useful for the first half of a teamfight until you run OOM and have to back.\n\nMalzahar is a particularly good example in my opinion because he gets a lot of mana from proper use of his E during the laning phase, but it requires him to push hard and put himself at risk. In mid and lategame, that mana return becomes less and less significant as you spend less and less time around hordes of minions to slap Malefic Visions on. His mana costs at max level are 100/110/120/100 respectively, and his E only gives 26 mana per bounce at max rank, which means that a full minion wave only gives 130 mana back, meaning you only make a net profit of 10 mana.\nEven with the current mana regen items, Malzahar still has to manage his mana (Unless you go overboard and buy TOO MUCH mana, in which case you lose out on a lot of damage)","replies":[{"poster":"Atanchan","date":"2016-04-13T22:14:53.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this is true, I think this mostly stems from the fact that mages have far more opportunity to use their abilities far more often. Talon specifically only really has Rake as an ability he wants to use when he isn't going in on someone, but even then using it whenever it's off cooldown for harass or wave clear will end with him not being able to do his full combo when he finally sees an opportunity pretty quickly. And on a champion like him, not having access to your full combo makes you pretty much OOM anyway, and he doesn't exactly have any good options for mana sustain unless he wants to go some weird crit-ER build.\n\nIt's also pretty easy to see this on, say, Maokai. His saplings are fantastic scouting tools, but they'll wear his mana pool down in no time, and while he doesn't need mana as much as Talon or a combo mage it will still seriously impact how well he can use his ultimate and how long he can keep someone locked down.\n\nAnd that's why mages would be balanced around blue buff: they're a class who basically by design is constantly spamming mana, so having an objective that can keep them on the map forever is a pretty big deal when the alternatives aren't quite as good. It's not that they _need_ blue buff to be effective, but it's such a powerful tool for them and any other mana-reliant champions because it makes their mistakes less punishing and allows them to stay on map for far longer.\n\nIt's basically the same thing as Baron is - his buff isn't necessary for to push down objectives, but it's such a strong power increase for them. Riot's trying to make non-tower objectives more appealing, and making sure blue buff has less competition among mage items is one way to make sure it's a big deal to not handle the buff with care.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DREADN0UGHT","date":"2016-04-15T22:03:51.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they are just trying to make Dragon relevant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-04-13T00:19:40.486+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":5,"body":">Blue buff will reward restore a greater proportion of max mana pools per tick (1% instead of 0.5%)\n\nSo if your Blue gets stolen as a mage or you don't have access to it you're fucked?

Sometimes you just have to let a lane go in favor of helping the other lanes. When I'm jungling, I constantly watch my laners while I'm taking camps to analyze how well they're playing and whether or not it would be worthwhile to gank for them. If I see that my mid laner is constantly getting out-traded and out-played in lane, then I won't go mid, or give them blue buffs.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things it's better to leave the feeding laner to their own devices because if you get the other laners ahead enough, the 4 of you should be able to carry him. Ganking a losing lane is extremely risky because the enemy laner might be strong enough to 1v2, or the enemy jungler might counter-gank and kill you both. \n\nSame goes for giving a losing laner blue. They're already behind, and sure blue might be enough to bring them back. But it's far more likely that they will just die and hand off blue to the enemy. Like I've said previously, the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. Good junglers are constantly weighing these odds and trying to determine the best course of action. And the best course of action is usually to let a feeding laner be and help the winning lanes snowball.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-04-17T16:14:41.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the one not getting it.\n\nIn situations like that you can either risk wasting time and resources helping the losing laner or take the buff for yourself and help lanes that are still managable.\n\nYou sacrifice one lane for the sake of two others and by extension increasing your team's chances to win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2016-04-13T00:43:29.066+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wait, by making the Blue buff basically key for a mage late game doesn't that kill any chance for a team to run two mages...?","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2016-04-13T08:39:34.904+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's bigger problems than that with running two mages right now, namely it's just more efficient to replace both with ADCs and run triple ADC.

Lower death timers in the 15-30 min range so losing a skirmish around blue isn't two mid towers lost. This is also the reason ZZ and/or Banner is so prevalent because no one wants to risk pushing a lane themselves so they buy items to do it for them.

To avoid that feeling like too much of a cost to mana restoration though we're currently trying out a version of the current Athene's passive on the revised Morellonomicon (Kills and Assists restore 20% max mana).\n> \n> One other piece of context that might be useful when looking at the revised AP items is that there are also changes to Blue and Dragon buff coming. Blue buff will reward restore a greater proportion of max mana pools per tick (1% instead of 0.5%), while one of the dragon buffs is shifting to a model where it restores % missing health and mana occasionally. Both of those should make larger mana pools more attractive to mages than they have been in the past.\n\nI'm not quite sure how balancing mages around blue buff is a fair way of balancing how strong or not strong (by virtue of not having blue buff) they are in lane? What happens if blue buff is stolen? Or the jungler happens to need blue buff themselves? Do we just say screw it against zed, talon, yasuo, enemy mage who does get their blue buff, etc? I'm a little baffled by this design decision to be honest. I feel like mages should be balanced INDEPENDENT of neutral buffs like blue and some random Dragon buff ( which is just a win more mechanic for the winning team anyway). Am I seeing this the wrong way? Or are there some other facts or changes I'm missing here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2016-04-13T01:29:40.145+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"i have to agree with some of the others: Please remove mana from bluebuff!\nMany champions are already kinda forced to go mid as it's the lane with best acces to bluebuff and they need it for mana.\nBalanceing mana around the possibility of bluebuff is a bad idea and leaves you lacking unless you havebluebuff, resulting in even harder snowballing from mapcontroll.\n\nWhy not try to give bluebuff something eintierly new that doesn't affect **essential stats**, just how redbuff gives a nice boost to combat power without champions feeling lacking when they don't have it, as it doesn't give any essenial stats?\nI think something like the relic shield buff from Dominion could work for blue.\n\nI'm happy to hear that dragon might give %missing mana, though i do hope it is in one of the first two buffs, else it will be to snowbally if mana gets balanced around it as 3+ dragons rarly fall into the hands of a team that is behind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosnirak","date":"2016-04-12T23:52:18.515+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please just get rid of blue buff affecting mana at all!!!\n\nIt doesn't work out in far too many games. You can't balance around mages getting blue buff and then still be bothered by them not being able to go anywhere but mid, or just being bad in lower tier games. Even in gold I often don't get blue until way late in the game and even then only if I go and solo it.\n\nAnd to top it off, it makes things even more snowbally as well.
