Tank akali was born because they buffed her Q energy regen. Its bittersweet to me, because I love seeing people play akali, but its sad that they are using her (majority wise) as a tank when she is meant to be an assassin.\n\nNext, a good amount of your issues is due to just being in a low elo:\n~Herald: low elo people tend to not care much about objectives and more towards just killing every champ they see no matter if they die or not because many dont see the big picture.\n~Tahm Stench: people in low elo tend to ban the same champs on repeat, reasons why i still see illaoi banned almost every game. \n~Zz'rot and Banner: while good in themselves for split pushing and dividing up enemies, low elo peeps tend to unconsciously play ARAM on summoners rift and always go all mid all the time, thus people have found a way to punish those for doing that.\n~Pink wards: need i say more? \n\nNext, riot is already addressing a good amount on that list as well:\n~Devourer is getting nerfed which will help with champs face-rolling before others can get a power spike.\n~Lux is being looked at currently (even though she is meant to be a safe Ap caster)\n~Kog is getting changed a bit \n~Ezreal just got nerfed (while it was his ult nerf, he also got hurt a bit from Ice Born getting altered a bit)\n\nNext is just random stuff that has changed awhile ago that you are venting about that riot has stated somewhere (too lazy to look up) why they did that change:\n~Sword of Occult: While the idea is fun, it was less interactive than its Ap counter part (because Ap's have to use spells to use, not just right click) and it probably was taken out because ADC's got buffed, just like how they removed revive a few months before ekko was released, because it would have been broken.\n~Tiamat passive: Which I'm happy about, too many games i've had where i get that item and it forces me to push my wave before i'm ready for it to happen, so this change is actually good.\n~Towers and minions and death timers: while I agree there could be a small buff to towers and less death timers, the problem riot was facing is that they didn't want people to always have to commit to a 40+ min game every time they que up, so they have been altering it a bit so it is more fast paced and harder to stall out game. Also for minions change, they deliberately become stronger and push so the team behind doesn't have to venture out so far to get farm to attempt to catch up. \n~Zhonya's was changed to fit in with other ap items so as to make it so not every ap champion under the sun only ever bought the main 3 items, now it is in a place where you buy it when you either want to or need, not because you have to. \n\nLast but not least:\n~Corki: always has been a midlaner, he might be just a tad too bursty as is, but he always has and always will be viable as a bot marksman or midlaner. \n~Hextech crafting is a huge thing coming to the game, it would be absolutely asinine to put something of this scale and not make as perfect as they can, I find that obvious. Its better to wait for something good then to rush something out while its still imperfect. \n~Tanks do not have terrible build options, its just the current meta. This happens. In 3 full moons from now, people will be complaining about how class \"X\" is broken and class \"Y\" needs buffs. \n\n\nAll in all, while I understand that this was just a post to vent about said issues you have, try to separate yourself and view the big picture.  Many of the things here aren't all that bad or are getting fixed currently or in the future.  A lot of this just takes practice to beat, like for me, i despise everything about Morgana but that mainly only comes from the fact that I haven't figured out how to play against her effectively and I refuse to play her to learn that because I'm too stubborn lol. \nIf you truly have an issue with something, then post it on the boards politely and talk about options that could be taken to fix said issue. Not just sit and vent on the boards like every other shmuch and their moms, thats what friends are for.","replies":[{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2016-03-01T17:01:02.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, a few things to note\n\n- Herald.  No one does this at mid-high mmr either.  It's incredibly obvious when top lane leaves to help, Herald deals enough damage where the enemy can probably win a 1v2, and whoever gets the buff is going to get ganked, since they have no control over the lane anymore.  The main reason people go for it is for the 5 devourer stacks.\n\n- Split pushing items.  Again, ZZrot pushes from half a map away.  With death timers being so oppressive, split pushing is relatively safe.  At mid-high mmrs, I'll see most top laners going 1st or 2nd item, and occasionally on the support.\n\n- Tiamat passive.  Top lane typically builds damage if they're ahead, tank if behind.  Tiamat passive allowed for a person to rush the item, but unable to freeze the wave, or not auto-shove it.  Without the AOE, people are able to hold lane better, making it harder for the opponent to come back.  \n\n- \"40 minutes,\" personally, I'm playing a 10min game that takes 20min to end.  You can argue it's shorter, but it's certainly less interactive.  \n\n- Corki became a mid laner after the changes, in part due to his roaming potential, and in part to his new passive, which interacts incredibly well with trinity force.  It's on par with the course, seeing how Quinn and Graves turned out, but still worth noting.","replies":[{"poster":"The Other Keller","date":"2016-03-01T22:28:57.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the insight into higher elo's. \n\nI know im in a lower elo but I dont really see tiamat passive as all that bad of a thing? \n\nAlso i've been playing since Lucian came out and have seen corki mid since my start.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-03-01T22:16:53.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank Akali became a thing because that's the only viable way to play Akali.\nIF you play her as assassin glass cannon, the risks are to high for its rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"The Other Keller","date":"2016-03-01T22:33:11.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt say thats not viable though...

I had to stop playing my main because she is so disgustingly unfun for both sides.\n  \nLight fighters in general need a huge rework + identity and itemization.  Fiora is just one of the worst atm because of %current health true damage.\n\n> Yi, Xin, Trynd, Shyv, Udyr, Jax, etc., are abusing rageblade+devourer.\n\nRageblade should never have made it to live.  Highest attack speed in the game; builds from 0% attack speed.  Absolute disaster.\n\n> Corki is no longer an ADC. He is a midlaner currently being abused.\n\nI dont really see why this is a bad thing.  People complained about diversity forever, Corki was a huge step in a good direction towards that, after a huge misstep (cough{{champion:82}}cough)\n\n> Towers are way to weak, minions become way to strong, death timers are way too long.\n\nYes.  The changes this season to all 3 of these have been terrible, but Riot is focused on making the game all about flashy LC$.\n\n> No one does Herald.\n\nFalse.  If you have a good jungler, he will look to pressure that if you have a stronger top/mid, or if the enemy is doing drag and you can't contest.\n\n> ADC's have too much power. Almost every comp is centered around the ADC.\n\nThe game has been this way since Season 1, but yes ADCs are ridiculously strong right now.  What I really hate is that a 4 ADC + tank/peel support can be viable right now, but if other champs go to other lanes/roles they get nerfed.  Riot balance has a huge boner over ADCs.\n\n> Lux's kit is unnecessarily safe.\n\nHas always been that way, she has huge mana costs, is immobile and requires landing skillshots.  She's not immbalanced, shes just good into certain picks or if your jungler doesn't pressure and she can just passively lane and acquire items.\n\n> Stop banning Tahm. He is no longer ban worthy, just chill.\n\nTrue.  But solo queue will always be late to what is currently strong/weak when it come to bans.\n\n> Why is tank Akali a thing. Something is wrong.\n\nRise of the 2016 metagolem.  {{item:3748}} needs a warmogs like peak before it starts working, light fighters/assassins need higher scalings/lower base damage.\n\n> Kog'Maw feels ruined. He doesn't even need one of his skills, and AP is not an option whatsoever.\n\nRiot fucks up balance as usual.  Completely remove relevance of Q, look on PBE it gets worse for our little void puppy.\n\n> Ezreal. Just Ezreal.\n\nI fucking hate this champ.  Has broken every item ever created that didnt have a \"Melee Only\" tag.\n\n> Zz'Rot and Banner are being abused because of the sad state of towers.\n\nYes, but also because its really nice to be a tank and have split-push power, even when you leave lane to teleport to fight/baron.\n \n> No one every buys pink wards. No one ever even wards.\n\nWHAT?!?!?!  Are we playing the same game??  But I still miss greens/old yellow trinket, and they need a slot for pinks for late game.\n\n> Hextech Crafting has been on the PBE for months.\n\nW/E\n\n> Zhonya's is still terrible, and I don't even midlane.\n\nZhonyas has always been bad compared to AD alternatives, but this season just made it worse.\n\n> Fiddlesticks, despite a new item and buffs, is still bad.\n\nFiddle will always be bad as long as the jungle doesn't require A+ sustain in order to clear it.\n\n> Tanks have horrible full build options, while bruisers abuse the few tank items that are good.\n\nWrong.  Only Thornmail is bad atm.  Tanks, especially armor tanks are in a very good spot atm.\n\n> What happened to Sword of the Occult.\n\nWe really don't need an AD snowball item in this super snowball AD meta.  We really just dont.\n\n> I still feel that Tiamat should have its passive.\n\nYes.  And I miss Tiamat Tuesday, simply for the luls...
