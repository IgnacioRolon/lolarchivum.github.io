I've patched the client already.\r\n\r\n1) On occasion my sound will just not work. Out of game sound like personal music still play but in game sounds are silent. I found that this is most likely because either I am playing music on my computer before the loading screen starts or when I alt esc out of the loading screen.\r\n\r\n2) My HUD will glitch. This has happened multiple times, and all of these will happen:\r\n\r\nMy health bar on the bottom hud will turn black, however the numbers are visible and turning on HUD animations makes it slightly visible.\r\n\r\nWhen pressing tab, all of the timers at the top are there but the background is missing.\r\n\r\nThe portraits above the map will have one extra portrait, but only the border with a small 0 occasionally for lvl.\r\n\r\n*I've found this is also most likely because I will tab out of the loading screen to do things multiple times. Relogging also fixes the hud.*\r\n\r\nAny suggestions to prevent this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-22T23:50:59.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These visual issues could be happening for a few reasons like outdated drivers or game files.
