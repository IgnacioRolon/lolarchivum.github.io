Pressing OK and reconnecting crashes it again and displays the same message, even after repeated attempts. I am currently doing a full client repair using the in client button. Help is appreciated.\n\nEdit: After a full repair, I tried a custom game and the same issue happened, however it would only crash if I pressed OK on the message. If I tried to ignore it, the game would launch (into the custom game with just me) and I could play normal. If I Alt+Tab'ed out of the window and pressed 'ok' on the message that is still there, it crashes the game and I can't reconnect because it will just repeatedly crash.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-08T22:57:12.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error can be a result of configuration modifications or 3rd party programs that interact with league.
