When I attempted to do this, my client froze for a second and I wasn't able to correctly use my loot section so I decided to close and reload the client. To my surprise my key total on my account was still 0, even after having forged one moments before. I hope a Riot employee can resolve this issue. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-29T22:12:39.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I was able to figure out what happened with that missing key. It looks like right after you crafted the key from your fragments, that key was then used to open a chest which gave you a Twisted Fate champ shard.","replies":[]}]}
