Jax also takes 25% reduced damage from all area of effect abilities.\nAt the end of the duration or if Counter Strike is reactivated, Jax stuns all nearby enemies for 1 second and deals physical damage to them, increased by 20% for each attack dodged, up to a 100% increase.\n\nR: {{champion:2}} Ragnarok\nPASSIVE: Olaf gains bonus armor and bonus magic resistance while Ragnarok is inactive.\nACTIVE: Olaf removes all disables from himself and becomes immune to them for the next 6 seconds, gaining bonus attack damage for the duration. For the first second of Ragnarok, he also gains bonus movement speed when moving towards nearby visible enemy champions.\n\nI&#039;m sure there&#039;s more ridiculous stuff than this.","replies":[{"poster":"Trap or a Trick","date":"2017-01-28T21:04:31.329+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}} Passive {{champion:53}}  Q {{champion:12}}  W {{champion:27}}  E and {{champion:18}}  ult\n\ndarius passive just because, he can pull you, flip you and then bopp you back into his team, then rocket slam you evern further into his team :v ULTIMATE SUPPORT","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2017-01-29T00:23:45.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking kidnapping the carry to a whole new level","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXRaichopXx","date":"2017-01-28T21:21:39.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might have to change your username to \"ADC IN 2017 LUL\"\n\n\nNice champion mix btw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jimmy Rustles","date":"2017-01-28T22:44:24.419+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:157}} Passive {{champion:157}} Q{{champion:157}} W{{champion:157}} E{{champion:157}} Ult\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"xXRaichopXx","date":"2017-02-04T07:15:24.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very original\n\n\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/8v3ryY124RHIk/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AbsolutelyCasual","date":"2017-01-29T02:23:10.597+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idea 1: The \"Let me just have 20 minutes to myself and you're screwed\" champion.\n{{champion:45}}  Passive, {{champion:75}}  Q, {{champion:14}}  W, {{champion:157}}  E, {{champion:245}} ult.\n\nA champion that infinitely stacks AP, Nasus Q, HP, that can dash around like crazy (and this has an AP ratio, so make of that what you will) and an ult that lets you come back from the brink of death and deal ludicrous damage because you're stacking AP.
