I went 21/5/13 on Vi I didn&#039;t get an S I got an A..farm was decent for 36 minutes into the game. 114 cs around that all from Jungle itself at the moment. Am I supposed to just afk farm in the jg the entire time when fights are going on. I mean seriously what in the name of Fuzzy bunny butts am I supposed to do for an S in the jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Divine Winds","date":"2016-09-11T17:11:04.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play VI support trust","replies":[]},{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2016-09-11T17:06:36.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"114 is bad for jungle in a 36 minute game though. Try taxing/holding lanes more when possible. Tax like 1 or 2 minions after burning a flash or 3 minions after letting your laner get the kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deflum","date":"2016-09-11T03:10:22.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward placement and Ward removal is a big part of the ranking system in my experience. i've had games like that where i was amazing but only got an A+ because i didnt have constant pink wards down on the map or didnt remove enough to make up for my lack of ward placement. Also, its compared to ALL other Vi players. Vi is a pretty easy champ in the jungle, so they expect better and better of Vi players.","replies":[]}]}
