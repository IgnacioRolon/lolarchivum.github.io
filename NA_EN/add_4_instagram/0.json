Side note: if I disconnect my internet or switch WiFi whilst on the clients' login page, everything shifts upwards. By this I mean the bottom half of my screen (where it has the password box and some \"forgot your username/password\" and \"create your account\", whatever) is taking up the top 25%, as in it has been moved upwards, though the window hasn't been moved. Like the browser having this text at the top of the screen with the task bar underneath it at the quarter-way mark and the rest looping around to have the now-top be at the bottom. \r\n\r\nEither way, this is another page made literally in plaintext .html, alike the homepage/store page that sometimes goes white, if anyone has seen that. This showed me my own password in plain sight, and that could be abused. \r\nNote that I have \"Remember Me\" checked. \r\n\r\nI'm posting it here for people to test it out more, whoever tests this out. Riot can be aware of this, players can, it's up to whoever uses it in which way to do whatever you want to do with what is found.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-08-26T23:59:51.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of this makes absolutely no sense from a tech perspective, i dont think most of those things mean what you think.\n\nThe client is definitely not \"using internet explorer\", though.","replies":[]}]}
