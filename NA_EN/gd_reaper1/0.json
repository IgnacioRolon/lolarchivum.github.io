Client crashed in champ select at end of ban phase. In ranked. Lost LP after already having lost promos the other night. I'm using the legacy client because it's less laggy for me. Unfortunately it isn't the first time this has happened on either client. Would appreciate quick resolution, and I can provide client logs if needed. Thanks.\nUpdate: upon restarting my client, I did get a bugsplat, and sent in the report. \nUpdate #2: it appears it was only a 3 LP penalty, but I'd still like to have that returned if at all possible. Hard enough to climb without LP disappearing due to circumstances beyond my control.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-24T04:47:37.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Crashes in champ select are an indication that your PC is unable to maintain a stable connection to our matchmaking servers.
