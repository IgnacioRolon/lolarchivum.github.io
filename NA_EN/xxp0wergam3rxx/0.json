The game would not let me log in whatsoever, so I followed the steps to update the icons like it said on the FAQ, but nothing worked at all, so I uninstalled the game and reinstalled it.\r\n\r\nNot only do I have the same launcher icons as before, but now the launcher won't even load. I've seen mentions of a \"LeagueClient\" file, but I don't have it in my LoL directory. All I have are the following : \r\n\r\n*  Logs \r\n*  RADS \r\n*  lol.launcher.admin \r\n*  lol.launcher\r\n\r\nI miss this game and I want to play it again, so can anyone help please?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-30T17:16:58.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I understand correctly, it sounds like you're still on the legacy client and unable to update.  As a first step, grab the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and use it to reinstall the game to fix up any bad files.\n\nI also recommend going over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide in case your OS or antivirus settings have changed and blocking your game files from scanning.  That should do it, but let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"xXp0wergam3rXx","date":"2017-06-30T17:34:43.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still not working. The launcher is exactly the same as it was, I'm still missing the same files. The League logo pops up for a second, the loading bar fills up a little bit but as soon as it does, it closes and doesn't do anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-30T21:34:23.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!

In this case hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and attach the logs provided in the HRT.  Our tech team will work with you and get this figure out.
