As in the link, Championship Thresh and Shyvana return along with the Fnatic, SKT1, SSW and TPA skins. From a previous post, Riot is giving us the chance to win Championship Riven by completing a perfect worlds bracket. If the other championship skins are Legacy and will return from year to year, why does riot intentionally make Championship Riven so hard to get?","replies":[]}
