I love this skin so much, but I refuse to use it with the awful meshes present on that cape. The images above should hopefully represent what I&#039;m talking about. You can literally SEE the pixels and just how bad the cape looks compared to the rest of the skin (especially the arm, make the cape look as clear and cool as the arm does with all that swirly stuff!).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMalifact","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-04T17:45:02.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, would you be able to provide me with your graphics settings?","replies":[{"poster":"Truesworn","date":"2017-01-04T21:04:03.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything is set to the highest setting possible for graphics. I'm even running an ENB of sorts that enhances the graphics of the game even further. No matter what I put my settings to however, this cape never seems right compared to the rest of the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-05T01:23:31.142+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heads up - I can dig into this tomorrow morning.","replies":[{"poster":"Truesworn","date":"2017-01-05T10:37:25.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much!","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-06T17:40:19.943+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, of course. Poked around a bit, and it looks like this is how the skin has looked since launch. Not sure if that's what they're meant to look like, buuuut, I'm talking to the pod who worked on the skin to see if there's something they can do to smooth this out a bit!","replies":[{"poster":"Truesworn","date":"2017-01-13T05:54:00.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any update if there will be a fix or not?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-01-19T20:07:34.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! Not a huge update for you here - I did log the issue and shoot it to the pod who worked on them. I followed up this morning with our QA on that pod, and he's catching up with the VFX artist today. I can ping this again when I have more info, but it looks like we're going to try to improve this. :)","replies":[{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-11-18T18:05:37.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Katey, I know i'm asking you something that you talked about 2 years ago.
