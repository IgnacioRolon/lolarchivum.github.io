I believe this is because the way her damage is calculated/coded calls for a damage value twice on hit.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm not against this entirely, she's still getting an effective extra level of damage on her Power Chord base value with FrostFang for the whole game. She also only has to land one combo per minion wave to get the highest gold reward support item in the game. While the range is short enough for some counterplay, a skilled sona can skirt around many of the dangers in the lane with E buff.\r\n\r\nMy issue with this is that there's an immense lack of CLARITY and CONSISTENCY here. I noticed this about her after they reworked her kit, and when I tried it with supports like Nami, Viktor, etc (ppl who buff THEIR AA's but don't reset the AA timers with the buff), this didn't happen, despite having similar text tooltip. I understand the difference is \"in addition to another effect\" in Sona's versus theirs, but should a 50% damage buff deal 100% more if a spellthief charge is up? \r\n\r\nGonna leave a poll here asking if mages that buff their AA's should get two procs in the AA (base AA and bonus damage both trigger), or if Sona should be brought down to everyone else's level.\r\n\r\nI'm sure this came up in design and testing, so I'm really more or less wondering why it was left in if it's not being entirely consistent with the rest of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-09-29T19:51:11.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I voted the first option just because alot of champs can get multiples on one ability.

The thing with Morg is that her pool ticks every .25 seconds so centering the pool on them without boots guarantees at least 2 procs (morg mid main).\n\nMy issue is that there's some counterplay/interaction there, as well as no point-and-click gold (unless ad and supp are tightly grouped which they should never be).\n\nChamps I feel should benefit from this ON THEMSELVES only: Nami, Viktor... huh, not that many (maybe leona but since it's an AA reset I'm kinda leery about giving her that kind of burst).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thamios","date":"2014-10-07T03:25:20.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While that may be what's happening, just check next time you play her and count the stacks for just the AA Q proc. I feel that the extra 50% damage gets added on as an extra tick of damage and counts as an extra proc for Spellthief. The pattern you're describing isn't the one that's been happening for me, and that SHOULD have the high risk-reward for it. Will edit when I hop into a custom game to confirm that this isn't what's happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-09-29T21:53:39.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think whether or not Sona gets the double proc is less important that that all champs get the same treatment.  Lux and Lulu both have passives that do magic damage on hit, so it should work the same.\n\nThat being said, you have to keep in mind that Spelltheif is supposed to be the best gold generating support item.  The reason why is that it is much less safe than the others.  Targons has that amazing heal on it, and the coin is the easiest to optimize and has really good health regen passive.  Sona might benefit the most from it since she has the built in heal to help with the safe part, but it is still riskier than a coin.","replies":[{"poster":"Thamios","date":"2014-09-29T22:18:05.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's kind of what I was trying to hint at in the post but I guess I went off on a tangent, lol. My main gripe here is the lack of consistency in the game, where all these other champs have passive bonus damage to AA's DON'T GET THE PROC THEMSELVES. We're on the same page, but I think you're turning to a different topic from what I can tell.\n\nI'm honestly surprised that Lux's passive doesn't proc plus the AA (I always thought it did, I don't play Lux support). I was pretty sure that Pix attacks proc'd it too, but I could be mistaken.\n\nI'm fully aware that Spellthief line is the best gold-gen in the game. I'm also aware that it offers no combat stats other than more damage, hence it's the riskiest for the highest reward. That's literally spelled out by Riot in the design and patch notes whenever they modified this. I'm just saying that the gold gen shouldn't be \"I charge Q in nexus and smack you with a PC-Q for all 3 procs at lvl 1\". Sona's Q is pretty mana-efficient and is usually the thing she maxes first as it has minimal lane-pushing impact (unlike Morg W where it's likely to take casters with 3 points in it).","replies":[{"poster":"Hullabaloo907","date":"2014-09-29T22:23:41.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im actually pretty sure pix attacks get the gold too, but i havnt played lulu support in awhile.

Usually u'll be able to land on one of them and then the AA to proc 2 stacks... Going for all 3 is extremely risky and almost all meta supports now can combo to 1 shot you while you have 0 counterplay other than flash..\n\nWhen I am playing as Sona, I usually only go for 2 procs unless I know that the support than I am playing against isnt having a good game and is missing all his skill shots..\n\nWhen I am playing against a Sona, I'll wait for the moment when she tries for that 3 proc Q and its a easy first blood of me or my ADC..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
