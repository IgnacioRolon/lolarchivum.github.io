Darius takes care of his little Brother after they became orphans.\n _Notice that Baslich is a port city and they were Orphans. Noxus used to send Orphans to the war_\n2) Darius goes to Freljord to fight for Noxus without knowing that Quiletta was going to have babies, Draven in other hand goes to Ionia. \n_Why do i say that Draven went to Ionia? Well, because i suppose that, in that place, is where he meet Swain, lets remember that Draven was one of the allies of Swain, when the birdman killed Darkwill, and Swain participated in the Ionian War... It would make sense that the rest of his allies participated in that war as well _\n3) So, Draven, \"seeking greatness in the Noxian military\", joins the army and goes to Ionia (or is send as a Child Soldier like Kayn and Riven) in order to conquer some Ionian territories (Like Fae Lor). During that time, Draven meets a Vastaya and has a child with her. _It is important to mention that there are territories of Ionia that are part of the Noxian Empire._ So, even if the Ionians were not happy with Draven, the Female Vastaya and Sett, they had to accept them because, well, Noxus rules that part of Ionia.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hcfU6kO.png (The red X is Basilich)\n\n So, in theory, Draven was in Noxian territory when he lived with the mother of Sett. There, he sees a better method to share ''Draven'' with the world (The lore literally says \"world\", no just Noxus), the arenas where he decides to work as a pitfighter, killing Ionian prisoners (after all, it would make little sense to think that Noxus would send the prisoners from Ionia to Noxus, just to kill them).\n4) After a many years (as said in the Bio of Swain), Swain prepares a bunch of allies (Including Draven) in order to defeat Darkwill. _Maybe Swain promised him the fame that Draven wanted or something like that._ \n5) So, Draven goes back to the Inmortal Bastion and helps Swain in order to get the fame that he wants.\n6) Darius returns to the Inmortal Bastion and finds out that Swain took over Noxus with the help of Draven.\n7) Draven keep fighting in the arenas as a pitfighter, but now in the Inmortal Bastion.\n8) He finally becomes the Glorious Executioner after Urgot is send to Zaun.\n9) Darius goes back no Freljord to fight for Noxus, during that time, the son of Quiletta (and Darius) dies.\n10) Darius returns to Noxus, and his comic happens, The Wispering Doodad happens after that.\n11) Sett becomes the boss of the ionian arenas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Korvus Klaw","date":"2019-12-12T17:09:00.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is not, his father must be a warmason","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheMan292","date":"2019-12-17T15:26:17.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just happy we are done with Draven not being his dad. just a dumb assumption in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CurS1VE","date":"2019-12-16T23:19:23.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sett is for sure similar to Draven in attitude, I could see them hanging out or Sett looking up to Draven as a Role model. \n\nSett's daddy is for sure a Fighter/Bruiser though, I could see something like a Udyr being his Daddy (i don't know a lot about lore or anything) since he fills some criteria and it also would explain why he got with a Bird Chick or whatever \n\nAm I close?\n\np.s. he is one of the few males in the game (Jax as well) who i could see sticking around for a little before going off to fight, all the other males for the most part are extremely bad or good, no in between","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalfTangible","date":"2019-12-13T03:04:53.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
