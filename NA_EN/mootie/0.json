I'm no Malphite main, but from what I saw, it looks like its more of an optical illusion because he raises his arms. From what I can see initially, Malphite continues his auto attacks while the Brutal Strikes (W) animation plays. Same case for Ironside Malphite, as OnlyBourger14 had mentioned below. \n\nIf you have a video, I'd be happy to take a look and look into it further. :)","replies":[]}]}
