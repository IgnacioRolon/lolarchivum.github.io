Can i get some Help?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently i have been getting client crashes as soon as I click join. The champ select screen doesn't even come up half of the time and the client basically forces you to close it out with an error message that says if you would rather close the application or wait for it to respond, which 100% of the time doesn't fix itself by just waiting. To makes things worse the fact that one gets a wait time  after the incident blows, why would  want to make my friends wait 5 min to 2 hours  just to play a normal game or a game of nemesis draft?\r\n \r\nAnyways i would really like some help on how to resolve this pestering issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T21:12:42.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some players have been crashing in champion select as a result of third party programs that interact with League.  If you have any apps like play.tv, remove them and try again in a custom game.  That should get you fixed up!","replies":[{"poster":"JackintheB","date":"2016-08-20T21:23:47.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that the champion select in the custom games isnt the same as the dynamic queue one,will this impact the thing at all? thanks for replying as fast as you could!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T21:41:36.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, the reason a player would have a 2 hour timer would be due to dodging during nemesis draft.  The penalty for a second offense dodge is higher to prevent abuse, like a player not liking a champion they got.  From what I've seen here on the boards, the crash can happen in any game mode.  In general we don't support third party programs or modifications, and these are some of the reasons why.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"JackintheB","date":"2016-11-08T07:22:34.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i took your advice and deleted plays.tv, haven't had a crash yet.

You probably have a habit of leaving queues or games. So for one, I'd recommend you own up to your own actions. Secondly, if you are really adamant that its solely because the game is crashing so often, test yourself in a custom game, wherein there is no penalty for leaving.","replies":[{"poster":"JackintheB","date":"2016-11-08T07:19:56.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking through your past comments towards people, seems you have some type of grudge towards people that leave a game, do not make it your sole purpose to belittle people for what might be a simple mistake, sure there are people that leave on purpose, but there are also people that are playing on pc's that are outdated. My crashes were due to having plays.tv. My comp could not run both so it crashed the league client. As for my \"Habit of leaving games\" they have stopped due to deleting it. Stop being a bully in the help boards please, and if you see a rioter thats already taken care of it and one has thanked said rioter, please it would be best to keep ones opinions to themselves.","replies":[]}]}]}
