Our [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) is pretty useful too, and can offer tips based on your specific issue.  This packet loss might be due to an unstable connection, and I definitely want you to get back in-game!  The steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide should help fix things up, but test it in a custom game!","replies":[{"poster":"Scuttle","date":"2017-09-13T17:06:54.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

It looks like you're getting some massive packet loss early in this (on your second hop).  This would be ISP related, or router struggling to join a local network.  You'll still want to run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to troubleshoot router issues and settings, but give it a good power cycle as well first.\n\nOnce finished, give it another traceroute to see if things have improved.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Soraka Rules","date":"2017-09-13T20:53:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, don't bother, its all my isp......
