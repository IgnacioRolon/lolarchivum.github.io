Restarted and I get that message on LCU and can't log in. Legacy client gives a RADS error.\n\nHave tried:\n\n* Added exceptions for League in my firewall\n\n* Restarted computer\n\n* Disabled and re-enabled wifi\n\n* Ran as administrator (both clients)\n\n* Currently doing full repair...\n\nWhy would it suddenly stop working? I don't get it. Between the time the client was fine and the time it said I had a connection error, the only thing I did was take a nap. So it's not something I did.

I just had the problem myself.\n> \n> First, close out of league and open Command Prompt (Windows) by searching for \"cmd\" in your start menu (without quotations, obviously.)\n> \n> Next, when the Command Promp appears, type \"ipconfig /flushdns\" (again, without the quotations.)\n> \n> After you've done that, it should immediately flush your dns. Open League, log in, and check to make sure that functionality is restored to your Play button once more.\n> \n> Lemme know if this helped, my dudes.\n\nCopy-pasting this from the thread I made. Let me know if this does the job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrossbowRanger","date":"2017-03-24T19:51:57.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, it's something on their side obviously if you aren't the only one.","replies":[]}]}
