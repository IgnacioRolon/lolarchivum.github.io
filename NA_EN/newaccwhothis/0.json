Have tried all suggested solutions and using the helper tool to no avail.\r\nApperently the hierachy has changed since the 'show packet contets' has changed but going to the client I think I found the culprit: the riotclient exec file. It will give this message on opeing: \"“LeagueClient” is damaged and can’t be opened.

Sorry to hear about this :( \n\nDo you mind sharing a few details to help us investigate?\n- Did League work for you before or did this just start occurring on a new Mac with a fresh installation of League? \n- Are you on the new Riot Client?

I'm not sure why this would be the case but would love more information to see if we can come up with an actual solution :) Thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whulf","date":"2019-10-15T03:39:31.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if its a good idea or not but I ran \"sudo xattr -cr /Applications/League\\ of\\ Legends.app/\" in the terminal on my Mac.
