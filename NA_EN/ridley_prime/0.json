Is it the flavour of the week ADC~? Is it an OP ADC? Is it Urgot? Just like that, judgements are made~ LOL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-12-25T05:02:51.895+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why it is so great when an ADC recognizes you're good at what you're doing.

Sure ADCs can go \"that enemy is alone in lane, we can jam on them and get a kill\", but about 65% of the time that ends in something between a bad trade and one or two deaths. I've died like that as a carry more times than I'd like to admit, and seen carries do that countless times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXSomeoneElse","date":"2014-12-25T17:41:51.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you think about it adc's all they do is just stand there and auto... supports are the ones that allow them to just stand there and auto so yeah supps def more important.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-24T13:18:05.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"yeah them new supports pretty broken.\nHard to not preform above average with most of them\nNami thresh braum\nLordy, those kits and base stats.","replies":[{"poster":"SirFeedselot","date":"2014-12-24T21:27:06.046+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ImHerVoice,realm=EUW,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=2eKH0AeY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-24T13:18:05.116+0000)\n>\n> yeah them new supports pretty broken.\n> Hard to not preform above average with most of them\n> Nami thresh braum\n> Lordy, those kits and base stats.\n\nIt's almost like there's a 5th player.\n\nDisgusting, I know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2014-12-24T21:50:20.777+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember when league was 4v4.\nWhat prompted to add this 5th, I have no idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2014-12-25T03:35:30.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Alistar's been my pick since s1, Never had an issue actually existing in a game since the first day I played him.\nBut Ok.\nYa know, needy kids need to have broken stats+ champions+items to be noticeable.\nRIP top laners/jungler then right?\nAll their items suck unless they're a sabre abuser or someone thats actually viable to build a GA as a top laner.\nYet they still build tank for you because they're nice and want to win just as much as anyone else","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-26T21:40:13.883+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"The feels are real.","replies":[{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2014-12-27T10:41:16.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice to see you again ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2014-12-25T07:14:27.822+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"i always get noticed by adc senpai\n\nbecause thresh can make them plays that impresses all the adc's","replies":[{"poster":"ThatAutofillSupp","date":"2014-12-26T20:51:27.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know how you feel… but most of the time if you get the adc fed they're just like \"GG EZ\" and ignore the support :c at least, from my experiences","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2014-12-28T02:34:20.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KawaiiPotato,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=2eKH0AeY,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2014-12-26T20:51:27.543+0000)\n>\n> i know how you feel… but most of the time if you get the adc fed they're just like \"GG EZ\" and ignore the support :c at least, from my experiences\n\n  lol ok then you are not a good support if you can't get them to say WOW your not trying hard enough just practice and you will make them say WOW adc mains  have easier times supporting i guess because you have to kite  and protect them use  if you can't make them say wow you haven't done your job well enough","replies":[{"poster":"ThatAutofillSupp","date":"2014-12-28T02:40:06.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2/0/29 thresh by 30 minutes, Lol okay","replies":[{"poster":"theragingnerd","date":"2014-12-28T03:04:52.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KawaiiPotato,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=2eKH0AeY,comment-id=0006000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-28T02:40:06.323+0000)\n>\n> 2/0/29 thresh by 30 minutes, Lol okay\n\nwell then your adc is a dick we all have games like that in aram i was 16/1/25 as nami it was my first time nami","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2014-12-28T02:54:14.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loves me a good Thresh player.
