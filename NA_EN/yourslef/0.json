Is there anyway to fix this? I just got a new desktop and my ping is always 34 on medium.

Are you seeing your actual latency (ping) change, or is there a visual change in how your champion moves after you crank up the graphics settings? For most changes in latency, the guide *Rineyy* linked is a good starting point in solving the issue. Let me know a bit more context on what's going on and I'll be able to help further.","replies":[{"poster":"Yourslef","date":"2016-07-28T22:49:47.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see an actual ping change when i turn up the graphics settings past medium.
