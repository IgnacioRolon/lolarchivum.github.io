I updated to the new client a few weeks ago, and now i cannot seem to play One For All! I go to \"Play\" and click PvP, but only get the options for Blind Pick, Draft Pick, Ranked Solo/Duo, and Ranked Flex. Wherever I look, I cannot find the One for All game mode! I was hoping someone could tell me whether this is a bug, or if I just am terrible at looking. Preferably pictures of how to access it on THE NEW client would help greatly. Thank you.\n\n\nAlso, Is anyone else having this problem too?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T23:42:38.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The featured game mode isn't up on the updated client yet!  You can hop back on the legacy client fur the duration:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nYou can switch back and forth this way without too much trouble!","replies":[{"poster":"IEatLouis","date":"2016-11-30T00:25:42.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you could at least put a piece of news in the beta client, right? I mean, how am I supposed to find out that there even is a rotating game mode in the other client otherwise? Am I supposed to just remember that it's on every weekend when I'm stuck in the preseason-quicksand? if I hadn't decided to check up on the Boards today I wouldn't even have found out that I missed a whole weekend of One for All and also would've missed the next one right after too...\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \nnot cool, man. not cool at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Beau Berry","date":"2016-11-30T00:54:12.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sad i just looked up why i wasnt able to play and when i switch to the old client i come to find that its gone again :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}
