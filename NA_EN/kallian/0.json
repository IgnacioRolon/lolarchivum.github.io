What kind of swords did he use? What&#039;s his alignment?

Here’s what I would do.  \n\n\nAssuming you are looking at early adult, late teen Jhin.   He was already a monster then Cause...\n\n   Jhin started training super-young (4).   By the time he was a tween in d&amp;d terms he was already a pretty decent level Kensei Monk. (From Xanthar’s Guide) (At least lvl 5, prob  much, much higher) .   \nYou can use that class as a baseline or starter— however as a child Jhin should probably start lvl 1 as a sorcerer (wild magic) then become a Kensei monk for 5 levels.  Then multiclass again into fighter for 2 levels and then yet again into rogue for at least 6 levels.  \n\nJhin’s dad specialized in daggers and darts— not swords.   His father’s school was all about attack speed— think a ranged attack storm of daggers.  BUt Jhin hated his dad, so while  Jhin was trained to attack fast, he chooses not too.\n\nOnly in his adulthood does he move into a bard class — though his magic is spirit and nature based (So i would look for spells bards share with Druids).   \n\n\nHe’s probably lawful evil.  He’s the kinda guy who would be very upset by someone failing to follow even some minor social  norm— but personally believes he is above the law.\n\nHis stats... hmmm.  \nThis will be hard with a point buy system.\n\n Start with max wisdom.\n  Then high intelligence. \n Dex is only “average” at the start. (But he trained a lot, so your advancements will go here—cause Jhin’s lack of natural agility was a huge dissappointment to his dad) \n\nStrenght and Constitution are your dump/garbage stats.   \n\nLastly, charisma is “good”, so you should start it at the min for the bard/sorcerer class (13?).","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2018-02-14T18:05:46.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe in December it was mentioned that Riot was planning to do a larger post or something on the overall direction of League's lore and how Riot is handling it.

This fighting style was invented by Jhin's father, and apparently it would have been far more well known, but wuju style (Master Yi's thing) overshadowed it.\n\nJhin would power his blades with chi energy, and this energy would let him change things physically when he struck them.
