Today I got an email stating my account was banned for 3rd party program use or something and I have not even played on that account in a month or two. When I tried logging on, it would not accept my password, which means someone clearly was able to reset it when they tried a week and a half ago. I dont and have never used any 3rd party programs, why would I risk an account with money and time invested into it for nothing? I was hoping some of you could upvote / bump this so that it gets resolved as I'm pretty pissed. Been busy as heck with school and finally have reading week next week (league week) and now my account is banned... what a joke :( \r\n\r\nHELP!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-07T04:34:38.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh gosh, sounds like someone was able to submit a password reset and actually had your email information. They were probably able to check your email as well and follow up on the reset and changed your password. \n\nAnytime you ever need account assistance, your best and only bet is to reach out to our account agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asap. There's just not a lot we can do here on the boards for in-game security =\\ .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeoghul Lucifer","date":"2017-11-07T03:10:49.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, have you sent a ticket to Riot ?\nIf you did, and your account was indeed \"stolen\" and someone connected to it from another computer, Riot should know it. They will see that your account was opened from another computer and will most likely retrieve it. But remember that it has to be from another computer, because it is the only way for them to know that it wasn't you. I'm not saying you used a 3rd party program, but if you did, there is literally no way you're getting it back. But as I said, Riot will know of any suspicious activity on your account, so just send a ticket and hope for the best. Hope you got all of it and good luck.","replies":[]}]}
