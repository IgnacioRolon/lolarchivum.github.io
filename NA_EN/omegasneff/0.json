I thought that wold fix it .... WRONG.. it only made it worse and now it wont even launch saying the PVP.net kernal patcher broke... so if anyone at riot or just another player has found a fix I will be glad to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-13T03:28:19.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically that Kernel Error is a sign that League doesn't have all of the right admin settings to make sure that it has access to all the files it needs.
