Without the League, he's just another \"bwahahahaha\" evil monster who murders everything. It seems like some Demacian would just go and smite him, and that would be the end of that.\n\nI suppose the idea I proposed there could be used in a non-League setting as well. Here it is:\n\n* **Essential Lore.** A mad Zaunite Summoner named Istvaan conducted an extra-planar Summoning ritual. Fiddlesticks now haunts the chamber in which the ritual was performed. He allows himself to be summoned, gleefully slaughtering the enemy on the Fields while spooking his Summoner through the link, but otherwise just sits in the locked chamber and murders anyone who comes in. (The League apparently uses him \"as an executioner\". That's kind of a weird touch.)\n* **Observation.** Without the League, he's just a crazy murder-fiend who will probably run around massacring people until he's destroyed. This is not the most exciting story. With the League, he's at least more interesting as \"the demon in the basement\".\n* **Story Example.** Write a story about a Summoner who calls upon Fiddlesticks more and more, and begins to lose their sanity. That'd be a cool Fiddlesticks piece: the diary of a Summoner slowly driven mad by this monster. But, okay, that's not strictly \"character progression\". I'm not convinced that all characters need to \"progress\": I mean, how much does Cthulhu \"progress\" in Call of Cthulhu? But I'll stay true to the letter of my promise.\n* **Development.** One day, Fiddlesticks doesn't come when Summoned. Insert haunting story bits of Summoners reporting the sound of wooden clatters in the bedrooms at night or whatever. There are probably accusations that it's all a ruse to try to close down the Institute, a stalling tactic by a faction that knows it's going to lose the next match and wants to hold it off a bit longer. Then, Fiddlesticks appears in the Council chambers during an audience, a flock of crows around him and his eyes ablaze with balefire. Champions and Summoners alike are so horrified that they can only stare. But Fiddlesticks doesn't attack: he launches into a cackling proclamation. He claims to be an ancient sorcerer from the Shadow Isles returned to the mortal realm and determined to retake his lands. He was not a necromancer, but instead an incarnation of older earth-magic, worshipped by the farmers who inhabited the Isles before it was transformed. Karthus and company are not happy. Maokai realizes that this Fiddlesticks is a psychotic killer, but also sees a chance to reclaim part of the Isles and restore them to life, even if it means blood sacrifices on the way. Cue League dispute where Maokai and perhaps some others join with Fiddlesticks against the Shadow Isles, seeking to carve out a new realm. Either way, Fiddlesticks stays in the League, whether to rep his new territory, to hone his magic, to spook Summoners, to piss off Karthus, or (if he loses) to build up enough favor to one day make his claim anew. (As for how he escaped in the first place: it could come out that he needed a certain number of killings to break free. Once that last victim was executed, or stumbled in and got killed if we want to drop the executioner thing, he had the power he needed.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecretLore","date":"2014-09-30T14:37:56.326+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well with all these different world champs becoming native to runeterra I think that fiddle will also be made to be from there(as opposed to be the result of interdimensional summoning gone wrong).\n\nI am personally a fan of the vodoo lands,the faction led by annies parents.\nI mean they are a fiction filled with dark mages,so I think fiddle could have been easily the result of some kind of magic ritual gone horribly wrong there(or horribly right)","replies":[{"poster":"2nd Fiddle","date":"2014-09-30T16:44:59.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may go nuts with wild lore guessing, I would like to point out that Fiddlesticks, Nocturne, and Shaco are all friends according to the champion pages.

The same idea goes with mannequins. You're staring at it, and it's staring back with this hollow gaze, like it's looking right through you. And while one part of you tries to reassure that it's not alive, you're scared to look away in fear it'll stab you in the back...or something...I'm not good with horror, but I know when I'm scared stiff. \n\nNow looking at the live version of Fiddlesticks, there's some lost potential that I see. When I saw the \"Twist of Fate\" Cinematic, I was blown away by how terrifying Fiddlesticks actually looked. And then I look at the live version, I see a prancing little wooden figure, like he's Pinocchio singing a tune and wishing he was a real boy. While I know this was back when League of Legends still had it's comedic values, (after all, this horrific creature is called \"*Fiddlesticks*\"), I don't really buy the whole \"*Fear me*\" effect.

Fiddle is in no need of a gameplay update, he just needs some visual tuning. His animations are conflicting with this arching lore and theme but his voice is spot on. I will say that now.

It told of a boastful craftsman named Fiddlesticks, who as bidding to build a war-golem for a kingdom. This man promised a cost and date of delivery his competitors claimed impossible, and was chosen for the task. The artificer built his golem, but the design failed to move. Unable to find the flaw preventing his success, and with the promised delivery date only days away, he hearkened to an alternate solution. He stole a scarecrow from a nearby field, and summoned a spirit to animate it. This decision proved catastrophic, for when he presented his claimed success before the king, the scarecrow slew all in attendance. The scarecrow returned to the field from whence it was stolen, to protect it from any vermin to harm it. Many of the former king's vassals attempted to remove and destroy Fiddlesticks' folly, though each would succeed only in fertilizing the fields with their blood.\n> \n> As time passed, the artificer was forgotten, and all that remained of the story was the scarecrow Fiddlesticks keeping watch over a bountiful field. The tales of the scarecrow vary. Some say that crop thieves would run in silent terror from the field, never to be heard from again. Others tell of men who tried to steal the scarecrow to protect their own fields, usually ending with the greedy farmer drained of life and the scarecrow inexplicably back at its post.\n> \n> I had always though they were told to frighten children into good behavior, that there wasn't any truth contained in them. That was until a battle broke out near its guard. Survivors say the battle had been progressing as normal, until they entered that one field. Combat magics ravaged the ground, and then suddenly stopped as the casters were beset by crows. Panic spread through both sides as foul magic began to emanate from a solitary scarecrow, which began to slaughter combatants from either side indiscriminately.\n> \n> After the massacre ended, the landscaped was scarred and infertile. Fiddlesticks had vanished without a trace.  Some think it perished in the chaos, others claim it seeks vengeance and hunts the few remaining survivors it missed. Recently though, I've heard a field with an exceptional bounty these past years, and that some of its less reputable neighbors have recently perished under strange circumstances...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Katunga Jones","date":"2014-10-02T02:03:48.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about this?   {{champion:56}} IS Annie's Father.....what's left of him,  the actual living nightmare of the father is he is out to make her suffer \"himself\".

The voodoo land theme of using monsters against monsters.\n\n{{champion:1}}  Then you can work out a good story about Tibbers the teddybear that protects against nightmares which nocturne represents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nosafterburn","date":"2014-10-01T23:57:04.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:9}} In my own personal opinion I have always felt that Fiddlesticks was some sort of Rune-war Relic that was left behind in the city state of Noxus and was changed (maybe by the following people) before the big magic-user purge that made Annie's parents leave and The Black Rose (I think that's what LB's group is called) go into hiding.
