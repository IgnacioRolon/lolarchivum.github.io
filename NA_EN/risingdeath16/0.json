Emergency, parents, or a call in from ur job. then if u left that one game it will send u back into the lower priority cue but say last time u had a penalty it was 10 min wait... well now that u missed one it starts at 20 minutes... it would be nice if u were to modify it so it is a little more reasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T17:20:55.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system will only place you in a lower priority queue after multiple games, not just one.  This will continue to escalate unless you are able to play constantly without interruptions, and restore your standing with teh system.  This will treat all players equally even if the leave isn't intentional, because all leaves cause other players a negative experience.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"risingdeath16","date":"2016-09-13T17:23:24.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it never resets i know not after one but it never resets","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2016-09-15T07:14:53.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nYou are mistaken, the Leaverbuster does in fact reset. However it is afer X amount of games and not X amount of time. This is there so that you canÂ´t just wait it out on a smurfaccount.\n\nThe Exact numer of games needed for it to decline is not officially knows afaik.\n\nRegards Rkoturdo","replies":[]},{"poster":"iamacrook","date":"2016-09-13T17:42:43.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quit leaving games, buster.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
