No one answered and i literally cannot figure out what is happening and how to fix it. Please help... I keep having to disconnect to try to fix and restart comp but i cant play and i take low priority hits over something that is outside of my control. Please... im desperate for help.\r\n\r\n\"Hi so I've been playing league for a couple years now, but took a break for my first year of college because of the poor wifi. When I came home I rebooted my PC and loaded league. I started playing as if it were any game but randomly got hit with some sort of lag/freeze in game. Wondering if anyone else has similar experiences and if they could help.\r\nThe basic run down is when I am in a game of league, and it only happens in league, I'll be playing a game on any map or game mode. As the game goes I will be randomly hit with this phenomenon completely randomly where my champion can still be controlled, but all other champions and minions are completely frozen in place. During this time multiple things are still going home. The minions are still shown casting spells, but the game does not register creeps killed. Also I can still see health and mana, but I don't see any spells, any movement from the enemy champions or my own team. It does basically just show my health bar depleting (Because I don't even know what is actually happening) and it still somehow kinda registers my spells sometimes, other times it does not. I also can't back if I'm, for example. at a jungle camp and it freezes. The health bars are depleted on the jungle minions, but it does not show the back animation, and it shows me still getting attacked by jungles with no health. I am using a AMD Radeon 7900 series graphics card and am connected directly through an ethernet cable so I don't see how it can be a graphics or connection stand point, but I'm not sure. I have tried resetting my computer, reinstalling league, opening the firewall, i've defragmented the spot on my computer with league in case that was a problem, and still no success in fixing this problem. The little glitch window ranges from a second to up to 5/6 seconds and makes playing any match almost impossible. Anyone have any ideas please share, I'd greatly appreciate it and will try to help in anyway I can if you need more information on the problem.\r\nThank you for the time.\"\r\n\r\nKommentieren","replies":[{"poster":"Poppa Chocolate","date":"2016-11-08T22:43:13.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://n2.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=36a470be-19749-21a7427e-8ae0-40e1-a4cf\n\nhere is the link to my net analyzer results if that helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poppa Chocolate","date":"2016-11-08T22:38:10.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through the guide and it seemed to fix it for about 4 hours worth of games, but on my last match last night the same thing happened late in the game.
