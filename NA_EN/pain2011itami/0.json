This one's quite something. It's totally affecting the overall quality of the game. Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n1- I login into the game\r\n2- Find a match\r\n3- Pick a champ\r\n4- Immediately after \"The battle is starting!\" and going into the black screen of loading, I get the bugs splat. \r\n5- Try to reconnect, fail, bug splat again. \r\n6- Try to Relogin, hoping it'll get fixed. Get corrupted client error.\r\n7- Login with the seemingly \"fixed\" client after like 5 minutes of waiting (Meanwhile my team is doing a remake vote)\r\n8- Get welcomed by a big pop-up saying that I've got 5 matchmade games of low priority due to AFK behaviour. \r\n9- Lie down, try not to cry, cry a lot.\r\n\r\nThis has happened like 3 times to me, in such a short amount of time. Having to wait 20 minutes before each match is a real drag, and losing that hard earned LP as freely as that? No way that can be fun. I've tried reinstalling, changing the OS, etc. Nothing seems to work. Would be great if I and others like me could get a real solution to this, while we wait 100 minutes. \r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"AGCWarry","date":"2016-07-27T09:57:23.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the same issue after last patch. Re-install the game worked for me. I \"got away\" with only 2  ranked losses and as good as all my LP gone. Afterwards i tried custom games to check if the problem was solved...
