I&#039;m and adc main, I get 2 kills in lane and back to base.  I come back to lane push it out and get ganked I die 1 time in lane and lose tower I mean WTF.  bonus gold goes to other team games snowballs out of control within 10 min.  Since when is a game fun that you lose one fight and the game ends.  Towers are to easy to take give too much gold and dont do enough turret damage.  anyone else have anything to add to this rant?  Ive been playing for about 5 years and Im close to giving up on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Napoleon3","date":"2018-08-19T12:08:46.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you bro after season 6 this game started being shit and get out of control also the most  games are ending in 20 minits","replies":[]}]}
