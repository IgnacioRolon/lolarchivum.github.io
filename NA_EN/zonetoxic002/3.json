Requires longer waits and inherently damage what skill looks like by removing the value from naturally occurring player averages. You cant create an artificial average of skill then use that to compare accounts for who is more skilled.

Let me explain it to you this way. You win and lose , sometimes the system gives you the better team and you win, its testing you if you are \"that bad\" and if you lose those kind of games - well thats bad. Sometimes the system is testing you on the other side, you are the one with the worst team, and the question is - \"Can you carry this SH*T\" - if you do - very good , if you dont - not that bad it was just a chance. I had many winning streaks, I felt like i cant lose a game and all that time I was thinking \"I AM SO FUKIN GOOD DAMMMNNN\" , but after that I got games where my team were like monkeys and this drived me insane. \nAfter trying to understand what was going on I kinda saw the picture. When I was winning I wasnt kinda carrying the team all the time, it was somebody else , I was helping, when I was losing hard I wasnt good enough to change the game. So in the eyes of the ranked system I am exactly where I should be and if I progress its going to be a slow and steady climb.\n\nI saw your ranked history and can tell you that you are in the same spot even tho in different ranking (I am plat 1). Even it seems to me that you are losing your lane most of the times, no matter vs golds or silvers , winning/losing, you are behind. In the eyes of the system you are at your place. \n\nAlso you play a lot. You want to climb and its not kinda working out so your mental drops which will reflect your gameplay which will reflect your mental and so on. Give it a break and watch some streamers that play your main champs, improve. I play mostly only on saturday evening and with 130 games I made it to high plat. I can even make it to diamond and higher but dont have the time for it. I learned from streamers and their vision of the game. \n\nGood luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-09-28T22:07:27.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm looking through your op.gg and the reason you are getting matched with B1 players  is because your MMR is low Silver. B1-S3 is what you are being matched with and against. Thats also why you got demoted from G4 to S1 and fell so quickly. It's actually incredibly difficult to get demoted between full tiers. It lets you stay in 4 divisions far too long. By the time you fell from Gold it was like a dam bursting. You MMR was already low Silver and once you lost the insane amount of protection you get in 4 divisons, you were just playing catchup at that point. Your rank means literally nothing to matchmaking.
