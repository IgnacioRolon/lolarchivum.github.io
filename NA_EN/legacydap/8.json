All his kit is pure DoT, only his Q being a burst ability. \n\nHis base damages and ratios are insane, his E poke can be devastating and a perfect combo with his ult can kill almost anyone.\n\nIs he powerful? Yes. He is deadly? Totally! Is he OP? Not really. He has lots of ways to play around him, his range and his low-mobility. He can 1v1 almost anyone, but when there are two people, he is forced to play a lot safer.\n\nSo, if the DoT user has lots of damage, he/she will most probably be balanced in some other areas, to compensate the enormous amount of damage.
