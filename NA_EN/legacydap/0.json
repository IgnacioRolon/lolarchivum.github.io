She stops, has to wait for the cast to complete, can't be interrupted by anything else than death, CD starts at end of delay. An instant spell is one with a casting time of 0, like Kata's E. The Rengar example just meant that post-cast delays don't count, as in the fact that Veigar's W and E, Swain's W, Cho's Q and others have both a casting time ( movement is stopped) and a post cast delay ( they can move around but the effect didn't start yet.\n\nAs for Lux, it's just a longass casting time, like Ezreal's ult.
