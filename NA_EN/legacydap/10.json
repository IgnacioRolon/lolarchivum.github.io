I've seen a lot of people asking how can I win my games more often, and others saying. Jesus Riot fix your dumb game, afkers and ragers everywhere! I'm going to explain to you how you can improve, and how I did this below.\n\n**Ragers and AFKers**\n\nI know it's hard to believe guys, but it's not always rager's and afker's faults for your loss. It sadly isn't, because 3 out of those 10 games. I had at least 1 rager and/or afker on my team, and sometimes I had both. In the end I actually ended up winning all 3 of those games. Yup that's right I won those games, because I didn't ignore them, nope I didn't press that mute button that everyone wants to go for, or I didn't hit that report button. Nope instead of that I actually tried to help them. I don't care if they're raging and everyone hates their guts. That is an actual person, and that person is having a problem. You might as well do what you can to help him solve it. If there is an afker that one's a bit trickier. You and your team will have to be very positive, and think at like 1,000 API (practically). You will have to think of every little thing you can do to actually win these games. Which is what I ended up doing in all 3 of them. I thought when will dragon spawn, when's baron coming up, where would I be if I was their mid, top, jungler, supp, and adc. Yes it's quite a task, but if you're as good as some of you say you are. Then you should be able to blow this task of easily. **Do not argue, and do not ignore. Have a conversation with the man, to get him back on track to the real task. Playing the game, and doing good!**\n\n**Champions**\n\nYes, you will have to have one certain champion that you like. I know you like playing every champion, because I do too. They're all so much fun with different kits, and it's boring playing one. Even when I had lost hope, I had picked Malphite. Why some of you may ask? He's a really strong pick right now in this current meta.\n\nPros: He's really tanky, wins most trades because of shield, has decent poke, can shove lane with e, his e actually scales off of armor, and the current meta is mostly ad tanks top, and he has a great engager ult and can set up nearly every teamfight, and insane synergy with every comp.\nCons: Mana hungry, ap mages destroy him early, team reliant\n\nNotice how the pros of him out weigh the cons. That's what you're looking for in a champion that you want to play. You're going to also need to play this champion more than anything, and play him against every single champion in League, so that when you finally go against every champion you'll know how to beat that champion, and what works against him. *I do not fear the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but the man who practiced one kick 10,000 times - Bruce Lee * **Pick any champ you know you're good at and you can play well. I do not care for the man who picks Urgot and goes 10/0, but I get annoyed when I see an Akali picking an \"OP\" champ and going 0/10**\n\n**Mindset**\n\nThis actually helped me the most surprisingly enough. If you have a good mindset pass it on to your teammates, and help them do better, and make them actually feel good even if they're doing bad. Every time I started a new game, I'd tell myself \"I do not play to win, but I play to improve, I win because I am better, and I have improved.\" I tell this to myself every game, it actually makes me try to think better on improving instead of winning, because if you act like each game is a competition you will probably get more frustrated when losing. It usually ends up putting most people on tilt, and wanting to play another to win games. Then they go on a losing streak, and it's hard to actually want to play the game if you lose so much. **Every game is winnable, under certain circumstances, but not every game will be won. Deal with it. If you're as good as you say you are you will win more games than you lose.**\n\n**Take Breaks**\n\nNobody likes them, but everybody needs them. You got to take breaks every 2-3 games. In fact I'm taking one now, I decided to post this, and help acknowledge the community to help them improve their play style, because that's all I want, is good games, where nobody gets frustrated, and everyone can have a good time. Yes winning usually helps having a good time, but as I said you simply can't win every game you go and play, sorry. **Take a break. Say hi to mom for once. Do something other than play the game all day. You will lose more often. From experience I have seen me and my friends rage more as we play longer, or as it gets late.**\n\n**Practical Tips for Mechanics**\n\n* Skill shots are definitely easiest to hit when they're going for a creep. They either take damage or miss the creep (definitely works well on a siege wave)\n\n* Know the enemy ranges. I can not even tell you how many times this has helped me. Especially as an adc.\n\n* This is a typical one, but yes WARD FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. How are you gonna blame your entire team for getting caught out with no vision!\n\n* Wait until enemy spells are on cooldown to engage. Win every trade, they can't use spells.\n\n* Click constantly. Keeps you on your feet (metaphorically) and you will be able to dodge skill shots easier.\n\n* Bait the skill shots. Act like you wanna get that cs, but then be like \"NAH GIRL JUKED\" -Trick2g\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAm I hoping this guide will help everyone that reads it, of course. But knowing from experience it won't. This is not guaranteed elo freelo baby. This is put effort into something, and do good at it to win. I might be only silver, but I definitely know what I'm talking about. If you guys do all this stuff, most of you will hopefully improve, and that's what I'm counting on. **May all of you have good luck in the future for your next game!**","replies":[{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2015-01-18T23:10:24.975+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"GG get on a lucky  win streak and convince yourself you figured it out!

I have gone on 10 game winning streaks then go on 7 game losing streaks right after (not the same day mind you) and nothing changed by my teammates. \n\nMy mindset was the same, my champs were the same, even my kills and deaths didn't change too much (I've gone 13/2 and stomped and gone 13/2 and had 2 teammates go 2/13 and can't do jack about it)\n\nThe whole matchmaking system is based off of the assumption that everyone at a certain MMR level is at the same skill leve but it is so far from the truth that games can go any sort of way. \n\nYou could be on a team with a guy on the way up and wrecks or you could be on a team with a guy that never should have been up (got carried by a duo for example) and on the way down and feeds. You get lucky one game and unlucky the next. Everyone says \"you are always to blame for good or bad because you are the constant\" but that isn't always true. I've had great games and great teammates....then I have had games where I die once the entire game....but then I have teammates that go (this happened a couple of games ago)\n\n0/6 mid\n0/4 jungle\n0/7 support\n3/7 adc\n\nThere just isn't any way you will win with that sort of team. (I was 0/1 to be fair but had as much CS as my entire team combined and was drawing jungle aggro trying to help my team, and everything I could do to help without going to feed a losing lane)\n\nSometimes you get lucky and have a Riven that gets 32 kills in a game like I had, then you have the team like I described above. You have a lot less control than you should because One person feeding can easily lose a game but it is very difficult as one person to win a game if the rest of your team is feeding. Mindset and happy feels doesn't help when your entire team has a combined 3 kills and less CS than you do altogether. Nothing you are doing about that but surrendering at 20.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yulen Xoshxius","date":"2015-01-18T22:45:53.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your view my good sir!","replies":[{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2015-01-18T22:49:02.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.

The game is designed so that when you are playing with players near your level your contribution to the outcome as a single player is marginalized. I would think you matter  a an individual somewhere less than 20% overall.\n\nNow when the skill gap is gigantic or you duo q with another player better than the range you play in you can have a significant impact. So that is why Wildturtle can get to challenger every time he is massively better that everyone until diamond and by then due to his hugely overinflated MMR from stomping weaker players the system is rigged to cushion his run through the set of players that near his equal.","replies":[{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2015-01-19T03:44:57.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes 1 player is only 20%, but 20% can affect a whole team. Yes, but why the heck do you think Wild Turtle is stomping people like that, it's because he main's adc, and he plays champs he's good at. I'm applying this to everyone, but since when have you seen any challenger player go against a bronze or silver. I haven't nobody has, because they're not gonna make it extremely unbalanced. Yes all matches will be lopsided, but not unwinnable. You can effect your entire team, because they're not just computer players that follow all commands. You got to actually get into their heads emotionally. If you call them dumb and retarded, they're not gonna want to play or do better. If you give them advice only some players will take it. I recommend you don't compare League of Legends to some lottery game. There is a bunch of skill factors that add up in this game, that some people don't even realize sometimes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-01-19T04:01:23.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a good point of view I'll agree, saying you want to help someone but you can't simply stop and start typing away in the midst of a game to try and placate someone raging. \n\nYou aren't doing anything in that time and they probably aren't either\n\nIf they are completely unwilling to listen, like a lot I tend to find, you just end up getting more flustered then your team is getting annoyed, and it makes matters worse.\n\nSome people don't want your help they just want to blame someone else because they are not doing well and it probably is best to just not acknowledge them and they will just play after a while if no one bothers to respond, the problem is most times at least one person will respond, tell them to shut up, ask them to stop, whatever the case is.\n\nYou do in most cases win people over more with honey than hand grenades but that doesn't always work with this community like it does in every day life because the majority of the League of Legends community is young and immature (I mean that in an age way not  saying this community is immature just because). When you get a lot of teenagers together...with the anonymity of the internet, then make it competitive, eventually the immature IS going to come out, and trying to reason with an angry, immature, teenage boy isn't going to work so well.\n\n------------------\n\nI'll admit that I tend to view a lot of people in ranked with a negative mindset but it is more that I've been conditioned to from the tons of negative experiences. I tend to just hit mute and I haven't had all chat on in years. I just tend to go in with the mindset that I'm playing with strangers, It is solo queue so it is on me, if they act a fool I have to mute them because I'm not giving them attention because they are tossing a hissy fit. All too often even positive interactions end negative so I find it best to just simply not talk. \n\nI've won just as many games with negative teammates as I have with positive and lost just as many with negative as I have positive. .\n\nhonestly you have to keep yourself in your own head if that makes sense, think about what you are doing, what you need to do, how you can help your team, and not what your team is doing, how they can help you, what they need to do. If it is just solo queue then you have to remember it is in fact..solo, the others are solo as well, you are just teamed together. Don't go in with a negative grouchy out look but go in with a realistic one and enjoy the game. Sometimes I just act as if I'm playing with bots and put on my music and it helps. \n\n---------------\n\nWork on your mechanics and work on your game knowledge, I don't see any reason to be here to pat some grouchy teenager on the back and stroke his ego because he had a bad day in school. I'm a big boy and I don't want people to coddle me so I treat others as I'd like to be treated, like a person. If someone on my team doesn't want to act like a normal human being and wants to toss a hissy fit I see no reason to stop what I'm doing to type to them to make them feel better. If they can't last for 30 minutes without throwing a fit with 9 other human beings then really they shouldn't be playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thebodyH2O","date":"2015-01-19T03:52:25.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that people afk at the champ select and for two games in a row, so that my team never has an adc or any range, for that matter,\n\nThen, I try to help them and they end up leaving me to die, even pushing enemies towards me when im at low health to watch them kill me.\n\nI will be taking your advice, though, and taking an extended break for this game.
