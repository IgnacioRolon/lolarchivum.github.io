When you make changes to a champion, you don't just completely remove a feature from their kit and expect the champion to \"be fine\" without out it because of how OP he is, and vise versa. \n\nJust take a look at that Veigar \"quality of life\" change that Riot made a month ago. All it did was make his W land more smoothly and speed up the time frame a bit, by .25 seconds, to be exact. Then what happened? Veigar went from being one of the weakest mid laners, to the strongest mid laner.\n\nAlso, how are you going to compare Braum's Unbreakable to Yasuo's Wind Wall?\n\nBraum's wall not only lasts longer than Yasuo's wall, but with it he can move around to continue to block incoming attacks. In addition, Braum's wall synergizes with the rest of his kit much better, and considering he's a tank and will probably be using his w with it, it makes a lot more sense that he tanks the REDUCED damage from the enemy.\n\nAlso, how are you going to say that he doesn't need his double crit? I don't think you realize, but without it his early game is FAR  weaker, it would be hurt severely, and as a consequence I'm willing to bet that If no serious compensation is given, he would instantly become the shittiest champ in the game.\n\nAlso, his shield that he has built into a kit easily taken away by 99% of the champions that go mid against him, you know, by a simple auto. And don't fucking tell me his tornado is OP and is a contant harass threat, not only is it not that strong in terms of pure damage early game, but it's fucking easy as shit to dodge and predict.\n\nFinally, don't you think that if Yasuo was truly OP, his winrate and overall performance would show it? I mean, he is NOWHERE near the strongest champion in the game at the moment, and nerfing him isn't that necessary now that I think about it. Maybe a very MINOR nerf, but that's all. Winrate and performance wise, he is actually in a fairly balanced state at the moment, there are far bigger problems Riot is worried about at the moment.\n\nI almost never lose lane to Yasuo, maybe it's because I became so good at playing against him, but to be honest, he's really not that hard to lane against as long as you're not playing someone who he completely counters.
