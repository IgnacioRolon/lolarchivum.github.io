Thresh is a strong support, yes. Probably the strongest in the game. But he isn't overpowered. He is only the strongest by a small margin (I do believe Braum and Alistar are right next to him in terms of power). I made a comment on Thresh on the boards a month ago in terms of his power compared to every other support, and it went like this:\n\n\"Thresh is the Jack-of-all-Trades support. He does a bit of everything and does it all well, but he doesn't have anything that he himself does better than any other support other than his lantern. \n\nDisplacement? {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:111}}   are better at that. Lock down? {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:223}}     are better at that. He has no sustain without {{item:3302}} , and even then it isn't nearly as good as {{champion:432}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:44}}. Shield? {{champion:43}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}}    all have better shields. Peel? {{champion:12}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}}    can all peel better than Thresh can. And the list goes on. He is strong, yes, but he does not need nerfs. The last couple to his lantern and to his ult were enough to put him in a solid spot.\n\nAlso, to point out, if you nerf Thresh to a point where he isn't that strong anymore, another support will take his spot and be \"the strongest\", and then people will cry for nerfs for them, and the cycle will continue. Supports are in a great spot now, no need for changes at this time.\"\n\nThresh isn't overloaded. He is really really balanced. The only thing that I would ever change, if anything at all because he is really solid right now, would be the passive damage on Flay. I would reduce it a little bit, because it gives him a lot of lane power. However, even I wouldn't change that since it is almost meaningless late game. And that's another thing. Thresh's late game is kinda poor compared to his lanning phase. He is like {{champion:53}} in that his design is to win the lane and showball the team by roaring out of the bot lane. Early-mid game, a hook means death. Late game, a hook means almost nothing if the other team is positioned correctly (if they are positioned poorly, that's on them, not on Thresh being \"OP\") because you will hit the tanks, and going in on the tanks is stupid unless you can turn that into killing the carries, which is difficult in its own right.\n\nI'm getting tired of people senselessly complaining about meaningless things on the boards. And you, Keevalroy, have a history of complaining. I have to assume that you only complain instead of changing strategies in-game and working around difficult decisions, because the people that do aren't complaining on the boards, and they have nothing to complain about.","replies":[{"poster":"Midder Scray","date":"2015-10-19T18:28:24.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh annoys the shit out of me, but I agree with you.

Few champions have this ability (maybe rammus? he needs more time to charge up though).\n\nHis E is not interruptable.
