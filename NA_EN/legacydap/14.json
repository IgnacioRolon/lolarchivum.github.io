I am a Riven one trick pony on 4 accounts, but cannot climb on this one, could I be higher elo if I played simple champs yes, but I love Riven, so I am not consistent enough to climb quickly. That is what your post gave me the impression of, a desire to climb quickly. \n\n\nAlso if you were truly good enough to play any champ to a high level to climb with you wouldn't be posting on the forums, so please do not insult me when you ask for \"easy champs to carry\" and I pointed out that mechanically complex champs would not fit that bill.","replies":[{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2015-04-15T01:06:26.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am able to play **MOST** champs at a high level. I will admit I do not know some champions, and how their play styles work, but for the most part I've done pretty well. The fact that your basing my skill off of rank is close minded in that sense. I don't know if you are one, but that statement surely made you sound like one. So I apologize for hurting your feelings, because I'm not trying to do that.\n\nProperly? Again what do you mean properly? You've never seen me play how do you know if I'm playing mechanically properly? You're just assuming again. \n\nNo. Rank doesn't show anything. I'm extremely good at shot calling, but that doesn't mean the rest of my team is. This game isn't only about being mechanically skilled, but it takes a good bit of strategy.\n\nYou're almost proving my point by saying you're a Riven main, and play on different accounts. If you noticed your 3 other accounts are higher than your other 1 then you'd see my point of view if that one was your main. And like you said you couldn't climb out by playing Riven. If you can climb elo on your other accounts, but not that one don't you kind of see the pattern here? I doubt it's just luck, because most people who get what rank they deserve in the higher elo usually deserve it, but the few people like me who get stuck at a lower rank don't always deserve it, and of course I could not prove it to you that I don't deserve Silver, but my fellow peers who are Plat believe I should be at least high gold.\n\nLastly, I said champs who can _easily_ carry. Not _easy_ champs who can carry.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-15T21:25:01.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't climb because of a trend of basically every bad game I play is on this account. So it is entirely my own fault, however I still CANNOT play Riven properly, because if I had the mechanics to play her, 1 I would climb easily on all accounts, 2 my higehr accounts would be much higher elo. Purely off of good mechanics and not shot calling players can reach plat, that is my point. If you had the mechanics to properly play Zed/Riven/LB you would be at a much higher elo.\n\n\nAs far as champs who can EASILY carry, which is easier a champ who if fed sure you can do alot wrong and potentially lose the game or a champ who is more linear, still has the ability to carry and is overall easier to play. Example looking at Annie Bot, he has said many times that he is not a challenger level player, but because he one trick ponys a simple and easy champ where he lacks in mechanics the champ doesn't punish that, If he were to be on say Zed or LB, champs that require literal fucktons of game knwoledge/timing/mechanics as well as decision making in team fights ability to read who is out of position in split seconds he would probably drop to plat, That is the point I was making, not that you are bad, simply that you don't have the experience/knowledge, neither do I, hell most NA challenger players don't understand alot of things about this game. \n\nYou asked for champs who can easily carry, I will leave with this point, which is easier to carry with a flash Tibbers stun on 3 people as Annie or looking for a misstep you might not have the knowledge to see as LB, or worse yet being fed seeing an \"opening\" but not realizing they have the CC to stop you mid combo and 100-0 you where you lose the fight and lose the game?","replies":[{"poster":"LegacyDAP","date":"2015-04-15T22:02:44.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I don't play Zed/Lb/Riven in ranked. I play champions that I prefer to play, but I was seeing if anybody knew some other champs I would like. You still have no idea what my mechanics are like, but I am a Kass main so I hope that gives you an idea. I could have all the good mechanics in the world, and I'd say my mechanics now are above average, and about a Gold-Plat range, but it doesn't matter if I'm wanting to get baron, and the rest of the team is split pushing. One can't solo baron, and even if I had extremely good mechanics in the team fight. My team will, and has thrown themselves 1 by 1 at the enemy team.\n\n2. I've never seen a Zed or Lb require fuck tons of knowledge. They probably have one of the lowest skill floors in the game, but skill cap wise. Yeah they're pretty hard, but they're not super fucking hard to win every game with, and the other problems is both of those champions requires a team behind it. If you go and assassinate the back line that's good, but their is still a front line, and it's hard for assassin's to engage a fight compared to tanks and bruisers.\n\nIf I don't have experience or knowledge doesn't that make me bad. I have good experience with this game higher than most golds actually, but I think you're not willing to stand the fact that I'm just silver because I got thrown down here for no reason. I honestly think you believe that everyone is where they are for a reason, and sometimes there is no reason.\n\n3. How was that even a question? I'm honestly curious your punctuation has got me all confused, but I'm assuming you're asking me which one is easier to carry as, and that's all dependent on play style, and team comps. If they got a shit load of squishies, and You're playing Annie. Then Annie would be better, but if you're playing against all tanks, and then a couple of squishies. Then Leblanc would be much better. IMO anyways. If the tanks don't deal any damage.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-15T22:38:12.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do i say it makes you bad? I say the exact opposite? \n\nAs far as if i believe everyone is at a level the belong at then yes they are. There are many many reasons we are at a rank/MMR we are. Now is rank perfect? No but you assumed I meant based on your rank is why I would recommend not playing high skill cap champs, rank is simply a representation of MMR, the MMR is what I am actually considering, IDC if you are silver or bronze or never played rank, the MMR for you, according to OP.GG is 1,059, a bit above your DIVISION, however it is no insult to say a low/mid elo player cannot play a champ to their full potential.\n\nAs far as your point of depending on team comp it is actually irrelevant, if you play Annie there are very few ways of making terrible plays and losing the game, especially when compared to the likes of LB and Zed, while you can play those champs and be passable at them, if you want to climb, you will see more consistency from Annie and other simple champs, because their kits allow for many mistakes to be forgiven, where as a misstep of LB is much more punishing. If you are not playing a champ to its full potential you are really only hurting yourself climbing, you can take offense to it or whatever you wish. But this is all backed up by stats, how many \"fed\" LeBlancs and Zeds and Rivens and any other difficult champ do you see a game lose? How many simple champs, Annie Ryze Renekton Ori, Lucian/graves? In lower elo it is much easier to snowball and win off champs who are simple, because their kits, while they give less outplay potential also are much more forgiving. \n\nLet us say the skill floor for Teemo is 30, these numbers will be completely random, the best Teemo in the world can only take his skill cap to 75 and an average Teemo plays him to a rating of 60 now lets compare a LB. Let us say LB has a skill floor of 10 (because if she is played wrong good lord is it wrong and terrible and no chance of good things) but the average player can play her to a skill of 40 , but her skill cap is 150, while the LB can be taken to unbelievable heights, can YOU or any low elo player (INCLUDING ME) take her anywhere close to 150? The answer is no, however can we all play Teemo/Annie/Ryze to a better average skill rating? Yes, because the champs themselves are very hard to do badly on, for example if you compare the absolute worst Teemo player to the worst LB player the Teemo is still going to be better, because as bad as they are they have to almost DC to be worse than a player on LB unable to play her. Now how does this apply to climbing? Very simple, you are going to have bad games, now would you rather have bad games on Annie and Teemo and still be capable of helping and playing at a better skill rating, or would you rather be on a 10 skill rating LB? Obviously the numbers are fictional however the point has been made even if the numbers are purely random. The point being purely to climb, simple champs give fewer bad games, meaning fewer loses, as you lose less and climb you will learn more about the game, making you better, to where you can begin to handle the LB and Zed.\n\nAnother analogy I have heard is from pokemon, let us say Zed/LB are Mew, and Silver is a trainer with a rank 5 badge, sure Mew may do what you want most the time, but he will also sit there and do nothing no matter how much you scream and yell and want him to do something.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-04-13T22:03:00.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana, great burst and scales to late game.
