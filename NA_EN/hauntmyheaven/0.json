So i decide to install it again in another location so i can maybe save some space, while keeping the old install just in case. Big mistake. The new install shows 13GB to download and now it's stuck on &lt;50% applying patches. It's been hours now. The new folder is showing 7GB atm.\r\n\r\nWhy is it stuck on applying patches for so long? Will the new install be actually larger than the old one? If so, why?\r\n\r\nI remember league being only 4GB once you download it again. Why the hell is it so different now?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T21:05:43.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're downloading the entire game again, it's going to need to download everything up until this point. Your old game install might not have been updated to the new client, which would affect the game size as well. If it's taking abnormally long to download, there might be something slowing down your network's connection to the download servers. Hit up our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if there are any settings you could adjust to speed that download up.\n\nLeague's install size has grown over the years as we've updated graphics and added new champions and features into the game, which is why the install is larger than you remember in the past.","replies":[]}]}
