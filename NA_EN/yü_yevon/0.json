You can do so by: \n\n* Run League of Legends.\n* Click on the gear located in the top right corner of the window.\n* Click Initiate Full Repair.\n* Wait. The repair function can take anywhere from 5 minutes to over 30 depending on the number of corrupt files it has to repair.\n\nIf neither of these issues fix the issue, please ping me. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Yü Yevon","date":"2018-01-12T18:09:02.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i make the repair but nothing i cant hear sona.\ni can hear only the first second off the song when i change form","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-12T18:15:17.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm okay. It's working fine on my machine, so I can't repro it to troubleshoot it. Could you grab me a video with audio, and your r3dlogs? \n\nEach r3dlog file appears like this: [yyyy-mm-ddT15-40-03] _r3dlog.txt, where yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the match played. So, you'll need to grab the logs from a game where you played DJ Sona.\n\nYou can find them here: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Game - R3d Logs","replies":[{"poster":"Yü Yevon","date":"2018-01-12T18:50:39.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"file:///C:/Riot%20Games/League%20of%20Legends/Logs/Game%20-%20R3d%20Logs/2018-01-13T00-58-42_r3dlog.txt\nThis?\nim not sure of what im doing sry  {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-01-12T19:17:11.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All good!
