What happens with the system is punishing players who are innocent.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the system doesn't work - is because things are not handled like they should. Things should be handled on a case by case basis, There is no review by an actual person - It's an algorithm that bans people if they say bad words. This is insanity.\r\n\r\nI just received a 14 day suspension where I was not being aggressive towards my teammates. Merely defending myself from their comments. But that doesn't matter. A human being does not look at the context of the game. A human being does not oversee the chat logs and see where my teammates are flaming me. All that matters is I was reported by a few members of my team because they wanted to punish me for my poor performance, and the system sees I called someone a moron, so I must be at fault.\r\n\r\nHere is my chat log for the game I was banned for. Of course perhaps it looks vilifying without the context of the entire game.

The only other major successful multiplayer PC game I've played is WoW and they have excellent customer service.  Considering how huge Riot is, you would think there would be something comparable in place.\n\nYou know who gets banned in WoW? Cheaters. Botters. People who say things so inherently evil that there must be a chat restriction. \n\nIf the words I have chosen to use really go against the TOS that league of legends has - Then League of legends has the dumbest rules in the history of gaming.","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2020-01-11T22:44:03.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"UltimateShield13","date":"2020-01-11T22:47:05.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4Wz6R5yo,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-11T22:44:03.818+0000)\n>\n> You can provide evidence by showing that there is a **significant** (i.e. more than 1/10000 or so) number of punishments by the automated system that are wrong **given the rules**. \n> \n> Not that they \"may\" or \"could\" happen.

Not like Riot IP bans or HWID bans anyone anyways, so I just log onto one of my 1,000 level 30 accounts and keep on going. No skin off my back, and I actually have fun flaming/trolling people that deserve it. If I get banned, so be it! I just swap accounts. It takes maybe 15 seconds to do. lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-11T21:31:38.988+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Gimli,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4Wz6R5yo,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-11T21:23:29.645+0000)\n>\n> I was not being aggressive\n> \n> Lord Gimli: you're a moron\n\nYou flamed the whole time.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Gimli","date":"2020-01-11T21:49:05.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"What is this, baby preschool?

This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments.

You could've sent positive or neutral messages instead, and those wouldn't have been flaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Gimli","date":"2020-01-11T23:14:38.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"OK - What is negative or insulting about telling someone not to steal cs when you're farming as an adc?\n\nour asking your team not to surrender and saying we can win?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-11T23:53:57.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Gimli,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=4Wz6R5yo,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-11T23:14:38.827+0000)\n>\n> OK - What is negative or insulting about telling someone not to steal cs when you're farming as an adc?\n> \n> our asking your team not to surrender and saying we can win?\n\nWhen you ask someone not to take CS by saying \"yeah nice job stealing farm from the adc,\" that sarcasm is negative.\n\nWhen you're telling people how to vote because you're keeping them in an unpleasant situation (a match with you) on purpose, that's a little negative.\n\nDo you think you shouldn't be punished if there was the slightest arguably neutral word in your chat?
