They rarely run into players more skilled than they are, at least not to the point where I'd guess those players are smurfs.\n\nAlso, I've never seen a new player complaining about fighting for farm, or not having a support.  It's a completely player driven convention, that new players wouldn't even know about.  The guy complaining about lack of a support is almost always some scrub on a smurf trying to stomp on new players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KuroCaliber","date":"2018-02-18T16:58:44.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, are you actually new?  Or a guy trying to level up a Smurf?  Because I've been new, I've watched new players get into game and they don't face those issues most of the time.  I've only seen it happen to old players making new accounts, on which case they deserve all that shit because the only reason a player would make a new account is if their first one got banned, or if they want to pub stomp lower elo players because they're tired of losing to people at their own elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2018-02-19T01:41:03.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a smurf thinking he knows what's up","replies":[{"poster":"ComeGankMeBro","date":"2018-02-19T02:23:44.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a player from other MOBAs that's pointing things out actually.\n\nBut whatever ignorant fantasies help you sleep at night denouncer.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2018-02-19T04:05:04.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That still counts.\n\nThey just separate experienced vs not experienced because 90% of experienced are smurfs.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
