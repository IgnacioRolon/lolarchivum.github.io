This is frustrating especially when my team is winning or has a chance for the comeback. On top of this I hae recently begun being punished for my \"offences\". Just hoping that this can be looked into, it usually only happens once eery 50 or so games but recently it happened 2 or 3 times in a day and I was warned then put into a lower priority queue... I beliee I hae found the issue and rectified it (Seems a background program may affect the way my league runs)  but I just don't see lagging out as something I should be punished for. \r\n\r\nHopefully I get a response.  \r\n\r\nThanks Riot. And happy leagues.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-16T19:39:31.119+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey I Play League79!\n\nI completely understand your frustration.  While these errors appear to be a result of unintentional tech issues, LeaverBuster cannot determine the difference between intentional or unintentional problems (such as someone unplugging their router instead of having an internet outage, or someone uninstalling their drivers mid-game to force a crash as opposed to a legitimate crash).  In addition to this, even though you didn't intend to leave, the other 4 players on your team had an unfair 4v5 battle.  The initial warning and subsequent penalties are meant to notify you that leaving is not ok, and that you should work to resolve the issues first, before jumping into another game with other players.  Playing a Custom Game with just bots is a good way to test to see if your still having issues or resolved them!;\n\nAlso, I'm very glad to hear that you seem to have found the fix to your game freezing.  Certain 3rd party programs that run in the background have been known to negatively affect League of Legends, and might be a good idea to disable them before playing.  While we can't alter LeaverBuster, if you continue to experience issues, we'd be glad to help in resolving it completely! :)","replies":[{"poster":"I Eat Thyroids","date":"2014-12-16T20:05:38.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"would it be cool to post a list of known issues? that would be good info for the community","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-16T21:22:04.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually more difficult than it seems due to the nature of troubleshooting with tech issues :(  For example, one player might be running LoLRecorder that consistently crashes the game and is resolved by disabling it; yet 10 other players run it without issue perfectly fine.  Each computer configuration is different, which can cause certain programs to be an issue, and others will be fine.\n\nAdditionally, we consistently put up sticky threads when we notice a widespread issue that many players are experiencing with common steps to  resolve it.  We do sometimes miss some things as well, which is why we spend a fair amount of time in Help and Support reading through threads.\n\nAs for other gameplay bugs, it may be a good idea to create an expansive list of all issues we know about and are working on resolving.  This is something we will consider in the future!","replies":[]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2014-12-16T21:17:43.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's already a list of common issues in [the Wrenchmen's Toolbox](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/peVhMJAo-the-wrenchmens-toolbox-common-solutions-to-your-problems-technical-issues) on the front page.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Play League79","date":"2014-12-16T21:23:57.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for the response, and no issues as of yet.
