My fps/ping do not change during these intermittent lags but it stutters animations, champs slide and/or jump around my screen, sometimes my ability animations don't go off and I lose sound but can hear and see the animations on my husbands computer and vice versa when he's experiencing lag.\n\nSomething new that we just noticed is that when I have the client loaded and he's in the middle of a game he starts to lag. When I shut my client down he has no issues while in game. This has only been an issue since we both updated to 7.12.\n\nWe are also having issues with the client itself where we can't create or join a lobby (and this is intermittent), issues with logging in taking forever and a day or the client saying an error occurred or won't even recognize that I have an internet connection available to login with. And at times my husband's friend list won't load for five minutes or so.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustJayson","date":"2017-06-16T20:08:35.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=l Magnet l,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=6N5AV8e6,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-16T19:48:24.488+0000)\n>\n> some times it freeze like a sec or 2 \n> some times i can see my champ is moving but cant see my ability or attacking \n> and there is no way that is due to my computer because my friend have it too\n\nI have had similar issues after an update a couple patches back. If your fps is dropping during team fights etc. then adjust the settings. If your ping is jumping from 40's to 129 or higher at random then its likely a connection issue. Sometime windows updates or other processes running in the background can cause this to happen as well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LocatedEagle232","date":"2017-06-16T19:48:03.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh you kind of just double posted buddy, I'd avoid doing that as much as possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2017-06-16T19:47:21.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you probably have low fps","replies":[]}]}
