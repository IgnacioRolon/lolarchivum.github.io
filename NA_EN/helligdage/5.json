However, when doctors found an umbilical cord, she later admitted to having had a miscarriage. Coming from a conservative Hindu family, she'd panicked over the extramarital pregnancy and attempted to conceal it by placing the stillborn in a bag and throwing it in a dumpster.\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nUsing laws to protect women against women. In theory, feticide laws were introduced to protect pregnant women, increasing the penalty for those who harm or kill women carrying a child by essentially including two lives in the charges.\r\n\r\nAs Al-Jazeera noted, however, \"Activists say the case highlights the way that prosecutors across the U.S. are increasingly using laws designed to protect expecting mothers to criminalize women for terminating a pregnancy or allegedly harming an unborn child.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the widespread criticism over the trial also has to do with her charges. Slate wrote, \"The two charges against Patel — feticide and felony child neglect — appeared to contradict each another [sic]: If Patel killed the fetus with pills while it was still in the womb, that would suggest there was nothing she could do to save it once it was born.\"\"\r\n\r\nQuestions/comments/concerns?","replies":[]}
