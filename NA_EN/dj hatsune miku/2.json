Lets do some quick math.\n\nTL;DR one infernal dragon can give a meta team comp 3400-4500 worth of gold in AP and AD. The point: new dragons give gold and, in fact, snowball the game harder than old dragon that just gave raw gold.\n\n\n**Lets do infernal drake. I will use Jhin as my example.** \nAt 10 minutest game time, when you will really start to see people going for dragon, Jhin will be around level 6 or 7, giving him a base AD of about 70 and he will likely have a close to about 45 bonus AD from items, giving him a total of 115 AD. One infernal drake will give him 9 more AD at this time. One point of AD is worth 35 gold in LoL, so he just received the equivalent of 315 gold in his most important stat. And that's only at the beginning of the game. This gold value will increase as the game goes on. Late game Jhin will have anywhere between 350-400 AD. At 350 AD, one infernal will give him 28 more AD which equals 980 gold. \n\nLate game, the gold value of one infernal dragon on one champion gives almost the same gold in stats as the old dragon did in raw gold. I can't repeat this enough: THIS IS ONLY FOR ONE CHAMPION.\n\nWhen you include a common meta team comp of a 500 AP mage, a 300 AP support and a 350 AD jungler, that total gold value worth of AP and AD equals 3439! ONE DRAGON CAN GIVE YOUR TEAM 3439 WORTH OF GOLD IN STATS! That's absolutely insane. This number doesn't even include the base AP of the tank on your team, so it will actually be higher. And if you are running a carry top laner instead of a tank, you will get about 4400 worth of gold in stats. \n\nAGAIN, THIS IS ALL FROM ONE DRAGON.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-02-15T16:16:09.240+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":10,"body":"Except everyone can appreciate the power of Dragon, so it isn't exactly Invisible.

What Riot hated was the fact that you could dump a lot of gold into an item and get an invisible effect from it. That all the gold you funneled into an object was an aura. Also comparatively (While still \"invisible\"), the effects are much stronger and far more noticeable. A boost to out-of-combat movement speed or neutral objective damage is far more noticeable than the old aura items such at +10% Mana regen or +15 MR to your entire team.\n\n>They disliked early advantages rolling out of control (First blood bounty) yet make first tower gold much higher which only incentivizes cheese strats.\n\n>They don't want lane swaps yet constantly weaken towers. \n\nThese two things are entirely unrelated. As it's been pointed out before, advantage wasn't exactly exploding when they added tower FB. (Also labeling something a \"cheese strategy\" isn't really fair when you consider that things that are cheese loop around to being full-blown strategies, ala lane swapping).\n\nOn the note of lane swaps, a weak tower does not incentivize lane swaps. What made lane-swaps good was the fact that you could pick a champion with a weak laning phase and circumvent the problem by swapping lanes and shoving down the tower ASAP, giving them a valuable advantage and a safer lane. A weak tower isn't a catalyst to it. (Side note: lane swaps still aren't as viable even if you weaken the towers due to the first brick gold.)\n\n>They want to increase champion diversity yet make the jungle brutally punishing, skew itemization, and play blatant favoritism. They dole out reworks that do little to help the champions they're targeting and instead just either make them needlessly more complicated or give them a gimmick they're allowed to be viable with for like 2 weeks before smashing back down into the dust. \n\nTo achieve actual champion diversity, you'd have to do things the playerbase hates. AKA Balancing around the pro play. But we don't want that so we make excuses. Your argument also fails when you consider many champions who have had reworks now see more play than they previously did. Graves still finds play, as does Poppy, Taric, even Sion is being played top despite your accusation that he's trash tier. Reworked ADCs all saw play even as the meta shifted and rotated, albeit not every ADC is played in the ADC position. Most reworks see some level of play even beyond their initial rework.\n\nBut, as I said, you have to balance around pro play if we want actual diversity. AKA: Buffing weaker champs like Yi and Garen. God forbid that happens right?\n\n>Keystones just blatantly break some champions and classes and rather than scrapping the idea in favor of a simpler one to make balancing easier they just keep giving themselves more levers to play with. There are way too many, you don't need more.\n\nPretty sure they already said they want to rework the mastery system to divide the trees up into shorter and cleaer choices. It's also funny how you argue for simpler choices when the old trees were even more bloated with needless wrong choices (Yah sure I'll take oppression said nobody ever). If anything, the new trees have become simplier.\n\nBut let's be real:\n\n#For all the criticism levied at Riot, the playerbase has not evolved in the slightest.\n\nI remember back in Season 1 or so where someone asked Riot if they were going to nerf Annie. I believe it was Morello who said \"Naw, we're going to let people learn to play around her\". Surprise surprise, they did. Fast forward to 2017 and now look what we're dealing with.\n\n* People don't learn to play around champions. They call them \"cancer\" and \"toxic\" while asking for Riot to nerf them.\n* People don rose-tinted goggles as they ask for reversions to champions who saw even less play or were more problematic.\n* People argue that Riot should balance for the masses when the masses aren't all that good at the game (myself included).\n* People accuse Riot of bias yet regurgitate the same complaints for the same champions, regardless of their actual strength. (Yasuo anyone?)\n* People stay blind to their own bias or inadequacy because they hide behind the shield of \"choice\", \"Nostalgia\" or otherwise.\n\nAnd you know what? I wouldn't have a problem with this...but as someone who has played and gotten incrementally better (though not by much), it makes me sick to see people taking these hypocritical stances and arguing that it's all Riot's fault for breaking the game when actual change is met with screeching and flailing. Even if Riot does have a good point (Regardless of how you feel about plants, Smite buffs -were- a system that didn't offer much choice.) The game, as I often argue, is a byproduct of the community's stance toward Riot and League. \n\nRiot's got problems that they need to fix, absolutely, but let's not sit here and pretend that people would welcome fixes made. If every champion was optimal to the point of being worth picking, the top complaint on the boards would argue that there's too much to ban and Riot should nerf everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempist","date":"2017-02-16T04:46:41.963+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CaptainMårvelous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tRob3dR1,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2017-02-15T19:55:14.956+0000)\n>\n> \n> To achieve actual champion diversity, you&#x27;d have to do things the playerbase hates.

That way, we really will have balanced champions.\n\nAnd if it means that you have 60% winrate Garens rampaging through Bronze, so be it. You either ban those champs, or get good enough so you can properly deal with them.\n\nIt's what Dota2 does, in point of fact.

Unfortunately, they changed \"Philosophies\". There old philosophy focused on a balance of skill and fair play. If something could beaten through some level of viable skill, then it was balanced. If something could be played to become strong through viable skill, then it was balanced.\n\nThis isn't how the game is designed now. \n\nRiot's changed over to a \"Game health\" philosophy which primarily focuses on trying to improve general player experience with the game. The more players they  can get to enjoy the game, the better. Simple examples of this was the assassin rework. For the longest time Riot considered the assassins balanced because it took skill to beat them and they also took skill to play. Anything else was meaningless. \n\nBut when they changed then the top priority was to stop the general hate of assassins due to their gameplay that tends to frustrate players who are playing against them. So the main agenda of the class update was to change each assassin to a point where they would no longer cause the same amount of frustration and stress. Naturally that also meant they had to be handicapped and overall nerfed. \n\nFortunately, (Unfortunately?) a few assassins remained the same or even got better and continued to be a dominating force that could rule the game when played properly. The issue to that is these changes gave some of these champions less counterplay. Best example of this is Rengar who before rework was VERY good but had his counterplay in the fact that he could still be properly focused and killed due to his full damage builds. Now he benefits from bruiser builds which forced nerfs on him in order to keep him in check.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-02-16T09:23:06.554+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except you couldn't beat an Assassin mechanically.

Before the mage update, mages were nothing more than assassin bait because of their lack of mechanics and just bland un helpful itemization. They implemented the update to bring more variety, power, utility, versatility, and just an overall fresh feeling to the mages. At that point the game had changed enough to the point where assassins were in a good spot. Durability was up for all classes, all classes were also being strengthened with raw damage, and itemization for almost everyone was in a good spot. \n\nBut riot still decided to go through with the update and handicap assassins. About the only assassin in the game at the time that actually could've been considered a massive problem was Leblanc and maybe rengar. However they could've easily implemented their reworks in a stand alone format and the assassin class would've been perfectly fine for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-02-16T14:25:11.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't change the fact that if an Assassin decided to go in on you, you were likely 100% dead like LB QRE, or Talon EQWR.","replies":[{"poster":"HongChongDong","date":"2017-02-16T15:20:29.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NineTailedMystic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tRob3dR1,comment-id=0011000200000000,timestamp=2017-02-16T14:25:11.833+0000)\n>\n> It didn&#x27;t change the fact that if an Assassin decided to go in on you, you were likely 100% dead like LB QRE, or Talon EQWR.\n\nAgain. This was before, and we're discussing now. Assassins could win lane easily, granted. But that was still when other classes were considerably weaker, easier to kill, and thus easier to just snowball from. All of those classes though got their individual class updates aimed at fixing those problems and making them considerably stronger. By the time the marksman and mage updates were out, assassins were actually working for their games and had to put in quite abit of skill and effort into winning games. But they handicapped the assassins even though this was the case which led to hem being below other classes now.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-02-16T15:34:43.169+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because those Class Updates made them _blatantly_ overpowered.

Unfortunately, they changed \"Philosophies\". There old philosophy focused on a balance of skill and fair play. If something could beaten through some level of viable skill, then it was balanced. If something could be played to become strong through viable skill, then it was balanced.\n\n>This isn't how the game is designed now.\n\n>Riot's changed over to a \"Game health\" philosophy which primarily focuses on trying to improve general player experience with the game. The more players they can get to enjoy the game, the better. Simple examples of this was the assassin rework. For the longest time Riot considered the assassins balanced because it took skill to beat them and they also took skill to play. Anything else was meaningless.\n\nThis reminds me of Melee and Brawl. Complete and utter casualisation of a game pretty much kills its longevity. Melee is considered a timeless masterpiece amongst fighting games due to just how much it rewards skill. Brawl is pretty much a shitfest where the first player to RNG trip losses. There's a reason people like Melee and not Brawl.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2017-02-16T10:15:36.905+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't really want these things... they just SAY they want these things.

You could survive in your base for an extended period of time, cracking the base was incredibly hard even with good siege. This more stall heavy style, while not everyone's cup of tea did lead to some important parts about season 2 that made it better in a lot of peoples opinion. Teamfights were more important in season 2, it was almost impossible to play a game without them, this lead to more AOE focus, more tanks, ADCs specifically to handle tanks and fewer assassins. Additionally since it was very hard to close out games without diving towers you almost always saw some late game champions on a team. The idea of hard snowballing a game was far less prominent then than it is now.\n\nFor people who don't like what assassins do to the game, enjoy mages, tanks, ADCs and bruisers and enjoy longer games with more teamfights season 2 was great.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2017-02-15T17:20:00.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"so it rather reeks of lessons not learned i pressume?\n\nor rather, somehow they forgot everything that made the game actually really great S2-4 and threw it away (somehow reminds one of how the presidental elections went some months ago *cough*).","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-02-16T05:33:12.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">reminds one of how the presidental elections went some months ago \n\n\"Season 7 will be great.
