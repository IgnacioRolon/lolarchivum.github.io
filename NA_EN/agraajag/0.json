It takes time to get used to. Believe me, the people on the East coast will not back you up in the slightest. If you are complaining about 70-100 ping, play on 150-170 ping.\n\nThe other issue could be your ISP. As Riot said when the move happened, depending on how your ISP routes information, distance may not have the biggest impact. Example of this would be people who live in Chicago getting worse ping after the move.
