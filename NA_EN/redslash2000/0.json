Im wondering if there is a way i can locate the files and put them back into a folder ready for transfer. I'd rather not have to redownload it as my download speed quite poor at the moment and it would take a while to reinstall games.\r\n\r\nAny help/guidance is appreciated!\r\nThankyou.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T22:34:29.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like one of Ziggs bombs got left where it shouldn't have been =\\ . \n\nThe only solid way I can think of to get a safe, complete installation of League will be to get a fresh download.

I'd suggest letting that download run it's course to make sure League runs correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"Redslash2000","date":"2017-05-14T08:42:20.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=XzZKzWEM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-13T22:34:29.961+0000)\n>\n> Seems like one of Ziggs bombs got left where it shouldn&#x27;t have been =\\ . \n> \n> The only solid way I can think of to get a safe, complete installation of League will be to get a fresh download.
