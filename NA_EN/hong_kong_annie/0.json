(My bad, my brain skipped a line which I caught after I reread your  post) Andimerdinger, who literally has a brain on his head. (granted I believe there was lore explaining  that) actually as far as lore goes yordles look nearly nothing alike barring lulu and Tristana. And the rats. \nFizz, blue fish looking creature. \nTeemo, furry rat\nLulu and Tristana both have puple skin, no fur \nCorkie, has a huge mustache. Otherwise we can't assume anything. Other then based on his lips and chin he is probably white with no hair. \nHeimer, very hairly similar to Teemo. \nGnar, very hairly. However mega gnar looks nothing like any yordle so not sure how we explain that. \nRumble, also very Harry and looks like a rat. Or a rodent of some sort. \nBased on Kennedy skins he is also furry. \nPoppy,also purple. \n\nSo we have rumble, kennen, gnar, and Teemo who look like rodents. \n\nWe have heimer and corkie who look more humanoid with rather intense facial hair\n\nAnd Lulu poppy Tristana and fizz who are all hairless and different colors. \n\nBased on your reasoning this is all flawed. Based on a realistic approach it is. However in a land abundant in magic that the stories writers are constantly adding too it's far more likely that we just haven't been told yet. Obviously magic can have interesting results. \n\nFfs ahri is a humanoid fox. Due to magic. And there was explicit interaction with magic in nunu's lore. So the correct assumption (assuming we should be doing those) would simply be to listen to the lore and assume that magic played a part. Not to go drawing all kinds of evolutionary parallels when we don't even know if evolution exists in the same way that it exists in the real world. Or if it exists at all. Like I said. Some cosmic entity could have created runeterra for little more then pleasure and without anyone knowing. Hell for all we know the aspects could have done it thousands of years ago as a combined powerful linked spell. \n\nBut to assume evolution in the manor we understand it in the real world is akin to me simply deciding that the aspects joined hands 7.5 thousand years ago and created runeterra out of boredom and started demanding riot answer my questions based on that assumption. \n\nIt makes no sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hong Kong Annie","date":"2018-08-15T00:07:13.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Again every story should have its own internal set of rules that govern it.

Because of this we don’t need a detailed explanation of every aspect of the story. Good writers should allow the reader to use their imagination to form the world along with the actual words written. So hes a yeti.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2018-08-15T01:58:22.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's a yeti.
