So what can we do that wont completely gut her(although many would love this idea)?  How about we make her w have higher base damage but have an AP scaling. This way her w would do damage but it wont be as much. Also the stun should be lowered from 0.75s to 0.5s as it is not only aoe but instant cast. \nFor Example Only:\nBase: 70, 90, 130, 160, 210 + (100% AP)","replies":[{"poster":"city of refuge","date":"2015-10-23T02:08:06.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is why i say put an AP ratio on the W it causes it to not do as much damage but it still does some","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eastrid","date":"2015-10-23T01:48:19.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like people have said in other forums just increase her cd would be the easiest or getting her something like mana/rage so she can't spam her skills like she does.","replies":[{"poster":"city of refuge","date":"2015-10-23T01:56:29.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eastrid,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=22nlclpv,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-10-23T01:48:19.391+0000)\n>\n> Like people have said in other forums just increase her cd would be the easiest or getting her something like mana/rage so she can't spam her skills like she does.\n\nmaking her CD's too long would force Riot to nerf all the other resource-less champs as she has fairly average cooldowns for resourceless champs. her q is a flat 13 seconds before CDR and after 40% CDR it is 7.8 seconds which is pretty long. they should perhaps make CDR not affect her but giver her something like minus 1s per 100 AD so she does have shorter CD's but not as short as 40% CDR","replies":[{"poster":"Eastrid","date":"2015-10-23T02:05:53.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q isn't the issue though the main thing is her W and then her E with the CDR. Maxing E with the 100% AD she can take to much dmg and by time you break it in a solo fight she can use W and and do her Q it's an easy rinse and repeat.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-23T02:24:03.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What...? Break her... W? Leveling her W? Her E is her shield and is commonly leveled second unless you're snowballing and keeping up the rapetrain. o.o Her E also only lasts for a second and a half. If she E+W's then Q combos you, which is one of the most common combos to be done, her shield is gone by the time the CC is over. lol. You can also easily use knockbacks in a real team fight to beat her. No one played against Riven when Huni used her.","replies":[{"poster":"Eastrid","date":"2015-10-23T02:46:30.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mixed the keys up but does the same thing can shield dash and Q away. If that doesn't work you W stun dash E and Q jump over a wall.

Look at ROC's team comp when Huni used her... The only one they had that could escape Riven was Caitlynn. OUT OF 5 CHAMPS, ONLY ONE HAD AN ESCAPE. Then they of course only had Gragas and Janna for CC if Varus couldn't land an ult (Which is really easy to dodge as Riven). Huni picked into a team comp that he could very easily win against, especially since his lane opponent was going to be a Rumble.. Plus they ignored Riven the entire game, letting Huni just decimate top, keep a 100 CS lead on his opponent, push in an inner turret 10 minutes in.... Seriously. They played it as if they could ignore Riven all game while she just split pushed and killed the Rumble. Huni had the entire game handed to him on a silver platter. He could have played AP Talon and won at life with how he had jungle and mid help him get free kills non-stop that entire game.\n\nSeriously though.
