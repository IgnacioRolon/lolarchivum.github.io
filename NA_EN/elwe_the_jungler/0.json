Look at Ezreal traditionally, after his nerfs from release, he was primarily a 'low tier ADC pick' due to his usually non-ADC build, which could be a good ADC pick based off team comp / enemy team comp due to him being a safe ADC that needs next to no peel while offering poke\n\nAdd in IBG, trinity was still more powerful for the single target damage and synergized better than IBG for infinity edge, when ahead or fed Ezreal could deal a ton of damage, he also now has BOTRK available to him.\n\nNow we're in S6, mages took a hit, assassin mids and tank tops that have a ton of dive reign supreme, Ezreal is a really popular pick due to his utility primarily from IBG, he helps chase down, he helps poke, he helps prevent being engaged onto. He still isn't the highest damage ADC, but he's a fairly safe pick even if he gives up lane pressure due to being Ez and/or building tear, and he usually does well despite team or enemy picks due to the nature of his kit with the items.\n\nIt's essentially the 'what does his kit offer with items' compared to other champions problem- and the answer is that really no other ADC offers the same range and threat with IBG that Ezreal does.\n\nI don't think Ezreal is a problem, I think it's a problem of the meta we're in which is why he's so prolific, he's essentially the only ADC building IBG, and I think the flexibility of having an Ezreal as an ADC with IBG is good for diversity and anyone who enjoys the play style. Maybe they can nerf the width of the proc on ranged again, but IBG on Ez is fine imo","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-04-11T00:18:15.584+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"fking this.
