Not due to ms or fps, but something different entirely: When i try to move my camera, it moves very slowly and jaggedly, and my abilities go through slower and at weird angles, while neither my fps drops below 60 or my ms rises above 30. Anyone else have this problem? is it a problem with my computer? I'm not having this issue anywhere else but i suppose its possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T01:36:19.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm it sounds like you're having a specific kind of connection issue related to packet loss. Packet loss happens when your connection gets damaged or loses important information before it can reach us, causing some really weird stuff like sliding/teleporting champions, abilities mis-firing two seconds after you clicked, etc. \n\nThere's not a lot we can do on either end for packet loss since it happens on the ISP side of things (since it's caused by faulty or improper routing), but we can still check by using this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to scan some recent network logs from a laggy game.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortroxx","date":"2017-12-20T14:12:06.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thanks for the help, but this doesn't seem to be it, my packet loss is apparently at 0%. Although my \"jitter\" seems pretty erratic, maybe that's it?\nhttp://prntscr.com/hq2lmg","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-20T21:21:04.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good that there wasn't any packet loss! Should make this a little easier to deal with once we get to the bottom of it. Let's make sure nothing is going wrong with your config settings by resetting those with the steps below, and run a quick repair to check if any of the game files are damaged.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Mortroxx","date":"2017-12-21T16:46:00.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, i did this although im not sure what you mean by sync, do you mean to reset all my preferences?\nAlso, seeing as I had the opppurtunity, i decided to test with some other logs, and this is my log from my last game: http://prntscr.com/hqm6xd","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
