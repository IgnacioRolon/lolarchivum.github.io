Now i know leaverbuster is automated and is based on leaving but thats because I just worked one off. In a match i only played 20 out of 35 minutes i got third most damage and only 1k less gold then the enemy top laner and I'm still busted??? I get the whole auto punish but cmon you can't disconnect me from your servers and say \"hey we are sorry you couldn't connect so to brighten your day we added a punishment so you can think for 20 minutes before 5 games what a mistake you made choosing LoL as the game to play.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not complaining about LeaverBuster, its a fair punishment. I'm not complaining about the fights between my internet and the servers.\r\nI'm complaining that these 2 are mixing and reallllllllllllllllllly pissing me off","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T17:47:43.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disconnections usually don't come from the server end, but usually are from the local client's end when it drops its connection to the server.
