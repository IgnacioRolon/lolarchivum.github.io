I understand why you can&#039;t do this, because people would only play champions like xerath etc. But instead of being given a random champion why not let people choose from maybe 5 different random champions that you are given. This way it would be much more fun in my opinion. The rerolls could give you 5 new champs to choose from instead. I hope RIOT will take this idea into consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragfin","date":"2017-06-21T15:47:51.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be willing to bet that ARAM is the most played mode in league.
