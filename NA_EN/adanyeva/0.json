Unfortunately, I don't have knowledge around the Quinn issues (my expertise lies in skins), which is why I'm not responding to those.\n\nThat said, I do forward many of these issues on, and in addition, Rioters from other teams do browse the boards and look into various issues reported, although they may not respond to all of the threads. \n\nFor example, I sent [this report](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/iAHQz0GW-gameplay-so-its-been-over-a-year-and-tfs-w-can-still-pass-through-yasuos-windwall) over to Riot Time Wizard who has more expertise in regards to gameplay, and she's investigating that particular issue. ^-^\n\nHope this clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-12-08T19:38:17.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well at least Time Wizard responded totn hat thread, but often enough there is no response.\n\nFor example ot would have been nice, if you posted that you called her, that way we would ahve known someone registered the issue even if TW hadn't responded.\n\nThere are way too many threads, that someone at Riot may or may not have noticed, but we don't know either way.\n\nIn my opinion every single valid thread in this board should at least have Rioters stating either \"I forwarded this to ...\" or \"I'm looking into this\" or both.\n\nAnd any dublicate thread should have an Arbiter(is that a general or specific titl?) linking to the original thread with Riot response.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-08T20:42:36.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that the current system isn't ideal. We actually have a beta version of a new [Report a Bug](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/pbe/en_BE/bugReport/create) where you'd directly report an issue, and it'd be logged and the proper team would be notified. I don't have an ETA for this, but it's something we're trying out on PBE to see if it functions better than what we're using now. That isn't to say this board would go away, we're just exploring other ways to get the bugs to the proper teams and get issues resolved efficiently. \n\nI don't usually call out that I'm getting another Rioter on the board, I just ask them to take a look at it. I wouldn't be adding much to the conversation, which is why I leave it up to the subject matter expert - in the case of the TF bug - Riot Time Wizard. \n\nThe idea of linking a red response to duplicate threads is a good idea - players have actually taken it upon themselves to start linking, but I think it's a good solution in some cases. It's certainly worth a discussion. ^-^","replies":[]},{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2015-12-08T19:42:19.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A simple sentence letting the player know their time posting the bug on the boards wasn't in vain would definitely be nice :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AdanYEva","date":"2015-12-08T20:23:11.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=Z3gmGxaP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-08T18:50:40.830+0000)\n>\n> Hiya AdanYEva! \n> \n> Just wanted to pop in here to clear things up!
