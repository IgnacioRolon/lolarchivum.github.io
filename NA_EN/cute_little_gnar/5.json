The win before and the game you just played no longer have any value.\n\nIt is not a valid argument that they have just as much chance to get an afk because aside from the fact they don't have one and you do, no one should have one and lose all the effort they put in to climb in ranked.\n\nIt is NOT abusable at all in ANY WAY to have loss forgiven for someone who has been afk for ten minutes in a game. If a game has lasted more than ten minutes the game was not so bad it couldn't have been won if it was fair.\n\nIf in a 30 minute game you have someone under level fucking ten, why the hell should you lose ANYTHING. The winners should get their points and the losers shouldn't even have the game in their record.\n\nIm tired of wining a few games only to lose cause i have an afk or a troll. \n\nThis is 100 percent your fault riot because in 5 years you did absolutely NOTHING to fix this. \n\nNo the new harsher leaver buster doesn't mean a damn thing, it doesn't stop my effort to climb being wasted, stop the frustration it causes 4 people, or prevent the fact that i just lost all of my previous wins points invalidating all the effort in BOTH games. The new leaver buster in fact doesn't do a damn thing. \n\nYou have no argument i guarantee i could come up with a SIMPLE solution to fixing this that would beat EVERY counter argument.\n\nYou lose points while your team doesn't if you afk. Lets go a step further and say the more you leave the more you lose. It would start at standard point loss and double every time up to 100 points (you would drop entire divisions.) If you don't leave for 5 games it goes down from 100 to 80 and after another 5 without leaving it goes to 60 and so on.) If you leave too many duo q will be turned off for you until you complete a certain number of games. You will also get a ranked ban. If you hit 0 points at bronze 5 from leaving you will be unable to play ranked until you complete 100 normal games without leaving.\n\n(idea)\n\nIf you are duo qing, then if your duo or you leave then the leaver loses points and it doubles each time, however if you or your duo leaves twice (there is a five game with no leaving reset time) then you BOTH start losing equal numbers of points. It does not matter if it is a different duo. If you are in a game where your duo leaves twice in a row you both lose points. If you don't have a duo leave or someone else leaves then neither of you lose points.\n\nTLDR if you're too lazy to read you don't have an opinion that needs to be heard. It is NOT a long post.\n\n","replies":[]}
