In the last 30 games in ranked i have had some of the most stupid people in history. I can be 5 2 in lane and they have made the enemy 10 3 and my lane enemy 7 5 by the time laning is over and my score will suddenly hit 5 12 while i try and save these people but they don't want to be saved you give advice and they say shut up or mute you.\r\n\r\nSo now i get to play normals for 35 games. But not just play, i have to WIN 35 games and i have already gotten 2 games with trolls. The first one had 4. Forcing people to play normals will only make me into an actually toxic player.","replies":[]}
