Here are the specs:-\r\n\r\nIntel i5-7200\r\nNVIDIA GeForce 940MX\r\n8 GB RAM\r\n1 TB Hard Drive\r\n\r\nLike the title says it itself, my laptop freezes the first few games I play after turning on the laptop. But after 5 to maybe 7 games, it's normal, although I have to keep the same settings (60FPS + Low Resolution). Anyone know to why this might've happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Chipsicles","date":"2017-08-18T08:27:23.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fan usually go to turbo mode after 7-8 games of League (meaning it's starting to overheat).
