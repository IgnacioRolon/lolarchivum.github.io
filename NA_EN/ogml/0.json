I then went through the same process as before AND I even changed my password to try something else. After having gone through the same process as before and changing my password i was now still having the same issue logging onto the account on EUNE but i could no longer log on to EUW.\r\n\r\nI tried logging on to the account with EUW server and i could actually log on with my old password, and again, no RP was withdrawn. Even after logging on EUW i still got the \"this account is transferring\" when trying to log on to EUNE.\r\n\r\nI'd really just love to have my account transfered.\r\n\r\nI've reached out to riot support with the same message but if there is anything to be done immediatly from my side of the fence it'd be lovely to hear suggestions about what course of action i should take.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T22:38:07.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and looked into that transfer and for some reason it keeps failing. I'm not entirely sure what's been messing up, but if you keep talking with our agents in your ticket they should be able to get the account switched over for you!","replies":[{"poster":"OGML","date":"2017-09-26T11:47:52.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks! So far no agent has been assigned to the ticket but i'll just wait for one to be assigned so i can proceed. Do you by any chance know how long it could take before i'd be put in touch with an agent? I've been waiting for about 24 hours now.","replies":[]}]}]}
