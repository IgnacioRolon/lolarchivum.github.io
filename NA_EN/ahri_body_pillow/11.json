So building health is penalizing her. You not being more tanky than someone else even though you have the same amount of HP is not penalizing someone building HP is someone getting more use out if it, you using so much HP for a single skill that can be spammed is.\n\nI'm no saying that Her heal shouldn't have a health cost since i know why it's there but at the same time wanted to clarify that having more armor/mr than others isn't penalizing those others for building HP","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-04-12T22:22:49.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The simple answer is because for balance reasons they do not need to be penalized for HP.

What i was arguing was your \"because 2 people with the same HP the one with better resistances is going to be tankier\" comment and treating it like that's some form of penalty for building HP. It's not, % HP costs is a penalty for building HP not having higher armor/mr values","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ahri Body Pillow","date":"2015-04-12T22:00:44.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mezzie,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LoaEhbuV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-12T21:56:37.048+0000)\n>\n> Because stacking HP is something designed for tanks/bruisers/front line champs.

I really appreciate it. Why doesn't riot giver her some percent missing/max health on her Q or something? That way she could health while still having her heals limited.
