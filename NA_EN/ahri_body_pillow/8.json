They update their game so much more frequently than Blizzard. I feel like their balance team more or less knows how to balance their game, and how to do so throughout most levels of play. For the most part, they know what feels good to play against and what feels bad to play against. \n\nNot to mention, they communicate with their players a lot more. I think the best thing about Riot Games though is their ability to take criticism. If Blizzard even thinks you MIGHT be calling out their development team, they&#039;ll delete your post immediately. For the amount shit of this these Rioters get, they got some thick skin...  \n\nSeriously, we take Riot for granted. Disagree with me/ flame me all you want. Don&#039;t care. Riot Games is infinitely better than Blizzard and that is  my very strong opinion!","replies":[]}
