Basically meaning the Foxfire chooses a target if one is available. \n\nIf you W when you are NOT in range of an enemy champion, it will choose your most recently AA'd target.

When I meet a Ahri player they are one thrick like me. She's also a champion that people don't ban even when she's strong letting her play favorable matchup more often. I'd not say she's weak, I'd say she weak in high elo and average overall. You can say some champion have to be beginner friendly but it was originally not the case so some Ahri player feel cheated about her rework in season 5 and they keep removing her skill expression later.\n\nHer firefox (w) has q huge QoL problem, not only it's frustrating for whoever play against a fed Ahri and get kill by auto target, but it's also frustrating for the Ahri player because its AI is buggy and bad designed, it mess up easly and is non skill expressive.
