No matter how many different options I try, or how much rescaling I do, I can NEVER seem to find a setting that was just like how it was. I used to have a windows computer who's settings were perfect. When I play Mac now, my screen is unnecessarily zoomed in. When I try to zoom out, it's like it reached the peak it can zoom out. I have tried changing display settings on both my Mac and my League. It is a Mac so I am unsure how to modify the folders, but because of this \"bug\" or display error, I can no longer play how I used to. I'm not sure if League supports 4k display with the Mac Client or what, but if someone could help me out, I would definitely appreciate it! -Thanks ahead of time, I would really like to get started playing again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-19T18:45:20.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grats on your new Rig!  Your issue is likely caused by the 4K which isn't something that's currently supported, and could result in error if scaling is messed up or exceeding 1920x1080.

I have talked to the technical team. Right now they are trying to sort out on what they can do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flyleaf","date":"2017-08-19T19:02:30.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thank you so much for your reply, I was able to follow all of the steps, but unfortunately did not solve my problem.
