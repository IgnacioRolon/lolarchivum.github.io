I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game over 5 times. Whenever I get lucky and i can enter a game, the next day the black screen comes back. I was able to get 1 ranked game since the demote and now, I have another 8 days before Inactivity again. If I could get advice how to fix this issue because, if i can't fix this soon i will decay even more. This bug has already caused me to lose my diamond rank and i don't want this to snowball even harder when i simply can't fix it. \n-Beastmania","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-05T15:59:08.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens during champ select are usually an indication that your client hasn't been able to properly connect to the matchmaking service.
