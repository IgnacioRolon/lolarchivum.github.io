There were a lot of special comics released for stories such as Ekko or Poppy&#039;s, to name a couple, and I don&#039;t see them on this page. I&#039;m fairly certain that these should be included, but I think that the page is pretty new, so I figured I&#039;d just throw it out there.\n\nHere&#039;s hoping a Rioter sees this. Love your work.\n\nEdit: I also think that your videos section should be divided by type into finished promotional videos and animations, and then rioter interviews, (login screens?), and behind-the-scenes content and other stuff. Somebody stumbling into that page would be confused by the disparity in content, I think. Again, just figured I'd mention something since it seemed a bit odd. This videos section does contain older videos like the Ekko cinematic and others, so it makes me more sure that the comics for him and others should be on the other page.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Biomarker","date":"2019-01-09T11:38:45.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm a dev on Universe! \n\nYou're totally right about comics missing. Right now the site is only displaying comics that are setup in Universe's comic reader, but there's a handful of comics released in different readers. Transferring them into Universe's reader isn't super easy, but we could add a link out to them so they're easier to find. I don't think we'll have any fix for this soon, but I will make sure to bring it up to the team. \n\nI also agree with your thoughts on videos. More granular categories would be really useful. I don't think this one will be solved soon, but I'll make sure it's on the teams radar as a place for improvement. \n\nThanks for the input! Let me know if you have any other feedback or thoughts about Universe :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fishing Boat","date":"2019-01-15T07:39:07.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just really glad that my feedback reached somebody lol, honestly I think that it's fine that they're in different readers, but making sure that interested readers can access that content in its current form was what I wanted to bring up.\n\nThanks for responding!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2019-01-15T08:01:08.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah there are no comics for Taric, Poppy, Ekko, KaiSa, Camille, and the small ones for Yasuo, Riven, and Azir, and some Piltover/Zaun related images that were promoted on Facebook for the short stories of Orianna, Jayce, Vi, Jinx, Blitzcrank, Ekko, Dr. Mundo, Ezreal, and Janna. \n\nGood thing us Wiki peeps tracked all them down and archived them (plus links to the original pages) on the site, its pretty easy to find them by using the comic category there.
