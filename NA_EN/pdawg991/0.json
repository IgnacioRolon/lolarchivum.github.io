It feels like you're playing the game a man down in exchange for a small boost to health regen. I dodged game one cause it was a yuumi with an atrocious win rate, and after 5 minutes, got put into a game with yet another yuumi, this time, a first time yuumi. I'm really trying to hit gold my first season of league, and I'm so close (Silver 1). I've found when I ban Yuumi on them, they get really mad and troll pick anyway instead of using a real champ. Any tips on what to do? I got my bot lane (Yuumi/MF)  the first two kills, and then they lost lane after that 0/12 by 15 mins.","replies":[]}
