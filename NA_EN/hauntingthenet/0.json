How the hell can it take 9 hours to get a simple patch done? I have over 50 mbps stable cable connection that is wired not wifi and nothing going on to steal bandwidth yet I login and can't start a game because the LoL patch server patches at an insanely slow 23~24 kbps. If I could still play I wouldn't mind as much, but this patch won't let me play any match until its done.\n\n...\n\nThis is NOT a fun way to spend a night. Fix your servers please! T_T\n\nEdit: Nevermind after it got to 5% suddenly it went from 5% to 99% in a few seconds. Fastest 560 minutes ever. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-28T02:38:04.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyy sometimes those estimations can be a liiiiiiiiittle off!
