I&rsquo;m a totally obsessed video gamer (in the best possible way), and games like DOTA, WoW, LoL, and pretty much anything with the Star Wars brand have occupied the best years of my life. \r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve been a few places around the game industry before Riot, most notably I worked at Treyarch on Black Ops 2 right before I joined. They taught me some great stuff about how to make everything feel OP, and how to really sell a fantasy. \r\n\r\nI currently own: 1 cats.\r\n\r\n**WHAT AM I DOING AT RIOT?**\r\nThere&rsquo;s kinda two sections here for me, the past and the future:\r\n\r\nThe past (and present): I&rsquo;m the Lead Designer of the Champion Update team, which has worked on many of your favorites (and unfavorites I&rsquo;m sure) like Sion, Poppy, Gangplank, Fiora, Juggernauts, Marksmen updates and many more. I have a TON of history with this team, having helped build it up from the ground when I started at Riot almost 3 years ago until now. \r\n\r\nThe future: I&rsquo;m going to be moving over to be Lead Designer of the Champion team. A new set of challenges and a really talented new group of people there is really exciting. Building up the next generation of new champions and hopefully surprising you all with some great new innovations is my goal. \r\n\r\n**WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT?**\r\nChamp-Up has grown and changed so so much over these past years, and I can talk about so many things. &ldquo;Why did we start doing group updates like Juggernaut/Marksmen?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do we decide how much to preserve or redo on a champ-up like Poppy?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nOr even less specific stuff that is more related to our champion/game design philosophy like: &ldquo;How have we evolved our strategy for making interactive gameplay without overusing skillshots?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do we build up a new champion from concept to completion?&rdquo; &ldquo;How did we go about categorizing our champions into archetypes so that we could better understand them (see juggernauts)?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;d also like to bridge the gap - when I can - of how our general game design practice can carry over into good character mechanic design and vice versa. It might be cool to do some topics that explore how to apply our champ design principle to other systems or even games altogether. \r\n\r\n**WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?**\r\nAnything about Champ design or Champion updates is definitely on the table for me. Get creative, I&rsquo;m open to whatever cool topics you all would like to talk about.","replies":[{"poster":"Gordofrog","date":"2015-12-10T22:09:56.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Scruffy, congrats on the new role in the company.\n\nQuick question in regards to your new position, is there any fantasy or gameplay niche you feel is missing from League?

I like that they all can turn the fight around in their favor but most of them do it thru just bursting people instantly rather than by tactical play. **Most of these characters are great at waiting for the right moment to strike and they all need more nuance to do it better.** \n\n___________________________________________________\n\n{{champion:62}} **Deceptive Re-directive Fighter **\n \n- I love playing as Wukong because he outright fucks with people\n- I wish more focus was on his Clones and decoys rather than just \"EQR now I win\"\n- W with lower CD and E creating Decoy and even Decoy on his R would be hilariously fun for a Monkey Warrior to do\n- He should mess with the opponent far more than he just bursts them down\n- AS on his E doesn't really make sense and his passive is HEAVY invisible power that is crazy good but not ever noticed\n- Suffocated by Mana\n\n{{champion:5}} **Commanding Soldier**\n\n - Counter engage and constantly able to have an answer in a crazy war environment makes him awesome thematically\n - Would make more sense to have quick AoE offensive bonuses like Battle Cries since he seems like a Commander\n\n{{champion:266}} **Inspiring War-Artist**\n\n- Creates war and strife because he sees it as an art, turns a losing battle into a winning one because its beautiful and poetic\n- Being able to show up to a fight and turn the result of it would be perfect for him\n- I like his R and think the idea of a Range increase helps with that, and AS + Utility + Sustain is a good mix\n- Currently has way too much burst and not enough utility and teamfighting to turn any fight around\n- either cheese you immediately or he sucks which doesn't fit his archetype or lore at all\n\n{{champion:39}} **Ebb and Flow Spiritual Master**\n\n - Way too much straight up burst to match the Flow, not enough Ebb and Flow\n - I like how she can constantly flow in and out of fights either with Q or just fast MS\n - Her E is good in terms of being able to get them off of her to reposition but it having burst is odd\n - She feels like she should be the fighter version of Ahri thematically but her R is just straight up poke burst\n\n{{champion:80}} **Tactical Soldier**\n\n - I love that his ultimate allows you to show up to save a teammate and fuck over the bad guys and by design it is very tactical\n - I think he should have a lot more tactical uses to his Q and E rather than pure burst\n - His passive and W feel very Strategic battle wise and should be focused even more on that","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-12-11T01:03:01.275+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that wukong also needs a similar approach to those other 3. \n\nAlso, it's correct to call out that these characters need nuance instead of a full redo.

Maybe her ultimate could be a form of a self-buff, such as removing her Q's cool down and increasing her W's damage/healing for a period of time.

It kind of fits ionia though.  Fighter ahri is kinda right but it's kind of wrong too.  She's definitely got an assassin's mobility like Ahri, leblanc, Kass, or Akali but she's also tankier than them.  \n\nHere are some thoughts:\n\n1.  TF is core on her and needs to remain that way.\n2.  I also like Bork on her too, that needs to say.  I also like hydra items on her, but those are a rare luxury when feed.\n3.  I think she should kinda be like evelynn where she could build a lot of damage or a lot of tank depending on the game.  Think of it more as ebb and flow in terms of item builds.\n4.  I wish she could jungle, but she's too money-dependent.\n5.  As much as riot hates her, I kind of like her as is.  She's someone I wish you all would leave alone.\n6.  If you do anything with the ult, than her W is going to need to be buffed, esp the self heal.\n7.  Right now she's kind of simple to learn kit-wise.  I think that needs to stay.\n8.  I don't think her Q or W should change.\n9.  E generates most of the arguments on her but it's also an iconic part of her kit and enables her outplay potential.  If this is replaced, she needs something that is reliable when she's behind  and can help her turn the lane around to make up for this.\n10.  I'd really hate for her to lose that passive.  \n\nWhile you don't like her ult, it's really important to her kit, especially her sheen proc playstyle.  Without it, she's not that fighter version of ahri you are talking about so much.  She'd lose a lot of healing and damage potential.  Let me put it like this, she can build tank partly because her ult and TF let's her deal damage.  That's a lot of her assassin potential.  Take that away and suddenly she's forced to be squisher or she isn't doing any damage and the nerf/change to E is also taking away her CC.  What's that leave us with?  A broken (bad) Irelia if she goes tank.  However without building tank, I'm not sure she can do some of her diving and outplays that she can do now.  That means she either needs to stay a sustained assassin/tank or the end result of whatever rework probably won't be irelia.  \n\nThen you'd be left with another rework where a lot of the fans of the champ you reworked hate it.  You really don't want to go there.  Cass still sucks cause riot done screwed up her identity.  I hate the new soraka; you guys screwed her rework up as far as I'm concerned and it's obvious half of the problems you guys are having with her is because of how you screwed her up.  Some of the old Karma fans are still bitter.  Riot has admitted the new ashe unfortunately still has the same core problem as the old ashe this preason thanks to all the changes.\n\nI really don't want to see irelia screwed up (she's my only top champ).  Yes there have been good changes, but the track record isn't perfect.\n\nHere's a weird question.  Do you think she could be one of those champs who are both melee and ranged like jayce, nidalee, or elise?  Considering her Ult is ranged, it'd be interesting if y'all turned that into \"I'm now a ranged champ\" ult and have her flinging swords at people.  If you do that, her old ult could be the ranged form of her new W.  Maybe give her a boomerang style skill in her Q where her blades go out and come back and a ranged CC in her E.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UrgotFantasy","date":"2015-12-10T22:45:10.220+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=xIY31zLt,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-12-10T21:48:15.554+0000)\n\n> 3.

I assume that you guys are happy with where she is in the meta right now, me too, I also think she's fairly strong but not out of position.\n\n  But I think you missed her weakness on the Howling Abyss; You see, her passive still runs on the same pace as SR, and for a game mode that lasts mostly 20 to 30 mins, a Cassiopeia player won't last to experience the AP transition when reaching 500 stacks (hardly 300 either), and I think it isn't fair for a champion that shines through her passive to not be able to reach that late game fantasy. Even Karthus can get to his late game fantasy faster than Cassio because he's more of an item reliant champion which isn't a problem on the HA, and both Cassio and Karthus usually follow the same build paths. So Cassio is a little left out.\n\nI would love to hear from you Scruff.

From my experience in game I've found that ball of stats characters feel necessary, mainly to deal with champions that dramatically reduce the agency of enemies. Champions with good counterplay can deal with balls pretty well, but have strong issues with agency reducing champions. Yasuo is the premier example of this for me, or Kalista. While balls of stats aren't interactive at all, right now I kinda think they're necessary or important to deal with agency reducers.\n\nGranted, my view of which champions are balls of stats may be a bit broader than yours, I see morde mundo and vlad as balls of stats as well as the stuff like irelia and shyvana","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wind234","date":"2015-12-11T00:01:29.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! I have a few questions, so sorry if this is a little lengthy!\n\n1. I'm curious about the champion \"archetypes\" that you mentioned before. We have the six standard classes (Fighter, Mage, Tank, Assassin, Marksman, Support), but we also have the Juggernauts who are...sort of a sub-class, I suppose. A class within a class. What are some other archetypes in the game and how did you group them up like that? \n\n2. Since you're working with the champ design team, I'm really interested in all the potential new ideas that could come to the Rift. Are there any cool mechanics that you'd really like to see in a new champion? Any sorts of spells, themes or abilities that you think would make something really interesting to play as (or against)? I'm not very good at kit ideas, so I'm not sure what would be considered healthy for the game. \n\n3. What about awesome concepts that haven't been used yet? Personally I'd love to see a champion based on a hellhound - we don't have too many champions that are outright bestial. Could we even see some more avian champions like Anivia or serpentine like Cassiopeia? I think that'd be some really cool diversity, though I'll admit I don't have too many good ideas myself. I'm mostly interested in all the possibilities (secretly hoping for another Void monster champion at some point). \n\n4. And speaking of concepts, how do you pick out the ones you end up working up? I'm sure there's thousands of concepts going around about new potential champions, so how do they make the cut?  Are there any old concept ideas that you might consider revisiting? \n\nlol I hope I didn't ask about anything too confidential.....but I'd appreciate any answers you could give!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-12-10T22:06:59.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How often do you guys use ideas/designs/etc from the players as a base or even directly on new champions or updates?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2015-12-10T22:22:43.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of the time honestly, but never completely.
