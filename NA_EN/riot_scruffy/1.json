{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2019-04-05T17:30:57.030+0000","title":"Item Shop Cleanup","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone, we have some broader item work we’re hoping to do later this year and I wanted to share our goals and philosophy for these changes before you start seeing potential updates on the PBE.\n\n**What are we planning to do?**\nOne of the main problems that keeps us from exploring exciting and meaningful new items is that the shop is overcrowded. This can make it hard to quickly find the item you're looking for and makes the store overwhelming to both new players and players trying champs or roles that use items they aren't yet familiar with. We want to remove \"dead\" items from the shop to clean up unnecessary clutter, make the shop faster to navigate and easier to understand, and make room for new additions. \n\n**What items should we remove?**\nUnhealthy items, meaning items that:\n\n * Massively reduce or remove counterplay against a champion\n * Incentivize not interacting with the enemy team\n * Give access to an effect (usually reactive or defensive) that we don’t actually want all champions to have access to\n\nItems too similar to another item:\n\n * This leads to always picking whichever one is stronger rather than making decisions around the items' unique properties. Either we find better ways to differentiate them or we can just combine these items and retain both user bases\n\nVery low usage rate items:\n\n * This can sometimes be because we nerfed an unhealthy item. Removing the item would be better at this point since it's too weak to be a good item, but we aren't going to buff it since it causes gameplay issues when strong. \n * It can also be because a too-similar alternative is currently better so everyone's using that alternative instead\n * Some item niches aren't really something that any champion would want\n\nItems reducing or not adding impactful decisions to the system:\n\n * Overly similar versions of Zeal items or tank items with near identical stats have had this problem in the past\n * Overpowered or \"always good\" items can squash a lot of other choices in the system - core items like IE can be great for power fantasy but if we have too many of these there is no room to make choices\n * This can also be true of overly similar component items, like if we had a 500g health item that was used sometimes instead of Ruby Crystal; we’re not really gaining any new decision space\n\n**What kind of items are we looking to add?**\nOnce we free up space, we want to deliver better versions of certain niches that we haven't been able to fill in the past. As an example, we'd like to make a healthy \"tower pushing\" focused item that doesn't have the problems of Banner of Command or Zz'Rot Portal.\n\nWe also want to add more viable and differentiated choices to build paths that lack diversity. Lethality items are a space that currently lack enough choices for AD assassin players to have meaningful build differences game to game. \n\n**When and how are doing this?**\nWe don’t want to just rip out items and tell you \"hey, we promise this will be better soon.\" So our approach is to combo future item removals with item reworks or new items that often replace them in spirit and overall make for a more deep and satisfying item system in League of Legends.\n\nScruffy\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.2.1/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2019-04-05T17:35:52.417+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Aside from Zz'rot and Banner of Command, are there any other potential problem items that the team has identified that might need this treatment?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2019-04-05T17:45:19.464+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yea \n\n * Mikael's crucible is in need of a rework.

If a person is trying to do \"X champion only to Diamond\" and they are not able or less able to use items to make up for the fact that they won't be able to counterpick with a champion, that's going to lead to very frustrating games.

Remove {{item:3147}} once and for all. This item is the root of all problems for many assassins, mostly causing nerfs on the champions then nerfs on the item (Good ole' Riot special). It was insane how many assassins back in 2017 when the item got changed also got big changes, mostly being nerfs. Sure you can argue that in early season 2018 it got nerfed but Riot were compensating the champions affected, that's of course a great thing, but it doesn't resolve the problem duskblade has. The item is just overpowered in many ways to put. Has damage just by being in Fog of war, you literally can see on your hotbar if you are seen or not by the enemy even when duskblade is down, and the fact you have insane vision control being able to kill a ward in a single hit allows for multiple wards to be killed in the vicinity. This is just my personal opinion, I think the item will never be balanced and should be removed as it certainly hurt more champions than it helped.
