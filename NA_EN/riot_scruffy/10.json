{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2019-10-22T16:51:29.743+0000","title":"Preseason: Rise of the Elements on PBE!","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all, let’s begin this epic journey into season 10 with Rise of the Elements, preseason's gameplay component, on PBE today! We're keeping the changes on PBE for an extended 4 week period to iron out all of the bugs and polish that we can before patch 9.23.\n\nGo here for our original announcement blog with most of the details:\nhttps://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/preseason-2020-gameplay-rise-elements\n\n**Some extra clarification**\nWe think that the new dragon changes will probably push more power in to the bot/jungle side of the map, so with a combination of herald and XP changes, we’re aiming to put a bit more late game carry potential into the hands of top laners.\n\nElemental drake spawns\n\n* The first 3 drakes will always be unique.\n* Ex. Ocean->Infernal->Mountain is possible but Ocean->Ocean->Infernal is not\n\nRift Herald buffs\n\n* Spawn time 10 >>> 8 min\n* Can respawn after 6 min\n* Channel time to spawn the herald 4s >>> 1s\n\nMinion XP changes\n\n* 2% increase to solo lane XP and 2.4% decrease to duo lane XP\n* Level 2 breakpoints are the same for both solo and duo lanes\n\nJungle XP changes\n\n* Overall 4% decrease to xp, less if you're gaining catchup xp\n* Krugs XP nerfed, Gromp XP buffed to make both sides of the jungle viable pathing choices\n* Clearing any side of the jungle will get you level 3\n\nMonster Buff VFX Updated\n\n* We’ve got an updated version of Red, Blue, Baron, Elder, and the new Dragon Soul buff VFX in\n\n**Changes from our announcement**\nCloud drake soul\n\n* Announced: Reduce your cooldowns when hitting enemies with attacks or abilities.\n* Updated: Gain a burst of Movement speed for 3s after using your ultimate\n* The previous effect was pushing basic ability cooldowns too low in a way that felt similar to the reasons we decided to remove Spear of Shojin. Our new effect instead puts the power into a movement speed buff to also create more interesting uses on more champions. \n\nKleptomancy Rework\n\n* We previously announced: Power siphoned out of gold procs and into elixirs to weaken the \"farm my opponent\" pattern, especially ranged vs melee. \n* Updated: Klepto has been significantly reworked into a “mastery of all keystones” playstyle. You cycle between all of the keystones - they key is to use them effectively and quickly for max value.\n* Gain a random keystone - once it is used gain another after 7 seconds.\n* Includes - Lethal Tempo, Fleet Footwork, Aery, Comet, Phase Rush, Predator (only if you have boots), Electrocute, Hail of Blades, Grasp of the Undying, Glacial Augment\n* Keystones cycle pseudo randomly - you cannot repeat a keystone for 5 rolls after it has been used\n* Entering the fountain will reroll your current keystone\n\n**More preseason item changes**\nIt's been a few months since we talked about our intent to clean up the item shop, and preseason is the time for those changes. As a reminder, we want to remove items that are (a) unhealthy, (b) too similar to another item, (c) very low usage rate, and/or (d) reducing the number of impactful decisions the item system offers. This'll free up space to add more items to the store, such as the new Sanguine Blade lethality item.\n\n**Item removals**\nZz’rot Portal\n\n* This item has led to split push strategies that don’t involve enough champion interaction. We may revisit this type of strategic item in the future, but it would require more risk for the champion user to apply tower pressure. \n\nOhmwrecker \n\n* This item has been underused and underpowered for a very long time. The tower disable effect is an interesting interaction that can exist in LoL, but it has been hard to balance in the item space because we would not be happy if we saw tower disable become a baseline on most team comps. \n\nRaptor Cloak\n\n* With no items to build into, we can clean this up. \n\nShurelya’s Reverie Reworked \n\n* Shurelya's has had a hard time finding users and overlaps considerably with Righteous Glory. We want to try and shift it to enchanter stats to create a new option for supports and leave tanks with Righteous as an option.\n* Updated Shurelia’s:\n* Forbidden Idol + Crystalline Bracer + 850g (total cost 2300g)\n* 300hp \n* 10% CDR \n* 100% health regen\n* 100% mana regen \n* 10% heal/shield power\n* Active: 40% movement speed for 3s for you and nearby allies (90s cooldown)\n\nKircheis Shard buff\n\n* This middle tier item has been quite underpowered and a bit of a trap to build early. \n* Kircheis Shard damage 50 >>> 60\n* Damage from Energized procs now stacks, rather than using the strongest one\n* Stormrazor proc buffed from 50 to 60-80 based on level\n* Statikk Shiv and RFC Energized proc reduced from 60-140 to 60-80\n\n**Coming Soon**\nMelee vs ranged lanes\n\n* Primarily we want to make sure that we have mechanics to safeguard from ranged champions taking over top lane, which is the primary place where we get melee 1v1 matchups\n* Current iterations have some additional melee only power added to Doran’s Shield\n\nFinal icons for new items\n\n* What you’re seeing are very early sketches, updates will be coming soon\nStormrazor improvements\n* We’re hoping to both improve the power of Stormrazor (as it’s only viable for 1 champ currently) and find ways to make it a more appealing item for more players. Should be some updates in the next week on this. \n\nTons of visual polish and performance improvements\n\n* We are still finishing up all of the pieces for each elemental rift to make them feel unique and alive. Additionally in the final weeks we will be cleaning up a lot of stuff under the hood to make sure that there are no FPS drops or hitches with all of the new art.\n\nA few more things still might be coming. \n\n* We’re testing out a few other item changes and making sure that we have mechanics in place so that we can tune every position after launch if we need to adjust.\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing Rise of the Elements early and we would love to hear feedback or any issues you encounter in the wild. \n\n-The Summoner’s Rift Team\n\n**UPDATE 10/23**\n\nPresence of Mind Rune\n\n* Ult CDR removed\n* Still restores mana on takedown\n* Restores 20% energy on takedown\n* Grants 5 max energy or 35 max mana on takedown (up to 10 times)\n\nDoran's Shield Update\n\n* 80 Health\n* 6 Hp5\n* Basic attacks deal 5 extra damage to minions\n* CHANGED: On taking single target attack or spell regenerate up to 40 (melee) 30 (ranged) health over 8s (live is 30 over 10s)\n\n**UPDATE 10/24**\n\nJungle tuning iteration 2\nAfter our first round of tuning we see that balancing Krugs and Gromp is going well but the balance between ganking and farming has been overly skewed towards ganking as priority. We want to open up more varied strategies for junglers and make the lost farm for ganking more substantial.\n\n* Krug -> Gromp rebalance unchanged\n* Non buff jungle camp respawns 2min 30s >>> 2 min\n* Average camp gold / XP down by 5%\n* Gold / XP per min for pure farm up by 12%\n\n**UPDATE 10/29** - Energize ADC items\n\nOur goals here are \n\n* Make Stormrazor a viable and more integrated item into ADC build options\n* Simplify the energized system so that stacking or not is a clear and compelling choice\n* Differentiate RFC and Statikk Shiv more\n\nEnergized\n\n* All energized effects now stack\n\nStatikk Shiv\n\n* Energized damage 60-140 >>> 140\n* All energized attacks chain to lightning targets\n\nRapid Fire Cannon\n\n* Energized damage 60-140 >>> 50\n* Range increase max 150 >>> 200\n* Attack Speed 30 >>> 35%\n* No longer increases energize charge speed\n\nStormrazor\n\n* Cost 3100 >>> 3200\n* AD 60 >>> 50\n* Crit chance 0% >>> 25%\n* AS unchanged\n* Build path BF + Cloak of Agility + Kircheis Shard + 500\n* Energized damage 50 (unchanged)\n* Energized effects are increased by 35% >>> Charge Energize 35% faster\n\n**UPDATE 11/5**\n\nLethality Items\n\n* Set bonuses removed - these were feeling more like punishment than bonus, so this iteration makes all of the lethality items standalone and choices should depend on their unique value\n* Lethality item stats buffed (to compensate for lost set bonuses)\n* New item added Umbral Blade - this item takes on the blackout passive from Duskblade and is a cheap utility focused niche \n* Umbral Blade - 2400 total cost, Serated Dirk + 2 Long Swords, 50 AD + 10%CDR + 10 Lethality + Blackout passive\n* Duskblade now has Grevious Wounds on the Nightstalker damage proc, and the blackout effect is removed to create a bit more context for when Duskblade is the right choice\n\nEnergize Items\n\n* Some tuning on the individual items\n* Zeal now builds out of Cloak of Agility instead of Brawlers Glove (total cost 1400g and now has 25% crit chance)\n* Cloak of Agility crit chance 20% -> 25%\n* Brawlers glove removed from the shop\n\n**UPDATE 11/6**\n\nFinal mechanics update, after this we're focused on bug fixing and numbers tuning. \n\n* Duskblade - removed the new grievous wounds effect. Replaced with more AD and Lethality.\n* Sanguine Blade - The \"unquenced\" passive now grants some additional Lethality alongside the Attack Speed bonus when only facing 1 enemy. This will help us balance power between champion damage and pure minion/tower pushing.\n* Cloud dragon soul wasn't bringing enough power to match the other souls - added 10% movement speed baseline passive, still keeps the burst of speed after ult cast\n* Conqueror penalty for ranged changed for better usability - Instead of a shorter buff duration ranged stack 1 per hit and melee stack 2 per hit (max stacks 10) \n\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.20.1/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Quáx","date":"2019-10-22T17:00:02.818+0000","up_votes":106,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trick2g is on suicide watch after reading the item removals","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kampsycho","date":"2019-10-22T17:17:50.009+0000","up_votes":101,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hey can you PLEASE NOT REMOVE {{item:2053}} Atleast!?

The changes to splitpush items feel a little bit questionable to mee. Sure {{item:3056}} was doomed from the start but the {{item:3512}} removal came to a bit of a supprise. The main reason why I think zz'rot removal doesn't make sence is that only tanks where using it. But we all known how weak tanks where this season so removing options feels like a bad direction for them.\n\nWhat also worries me is the {{item:2065}} rework. Where yet another AP support item has been removed from the game. It's serously start to hit the AP catcher playstyle for supports. Thinking about picks like {{champion:25}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:53}}. They still will go for this item but overal it's seems to promote enchanters more  right now.\n\nYou mentioned that tanks have {{item:3800}} as an alternative but it's combine cost really makes it difficult to get this item. I was wondering if you would concider having an onetime use active item for righteous glory similar to {{item:2423}}. It could cost 600 and build into items like {{item:2065}} {{item:3800}}. The active actually could be {{item:3056}} or a righteous glory active.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2019-10-22T17:14:40.115+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">Channel time to spawn the herald 4s > 1s\n\nOut of curiosity, does this still allow sufficient post-Herald-fight counterplay to Herald? If that's not a concern, is there a reason you opted for *any* channel time instead of, say, making the item into **Zz'Rot Portal** and having it be an instant-use item that summons Herald after a short delay? It feels like this is a somewhat arbitrary change, and I'm curious as to the intent here, unless the goal was *only* to still prevent mid-fight Herald summoning.\n\n> Cloud drake soul\n> \n> * Announced: Reduce your cooldowns when hitting enemies with attacks or abilities.\n> * Updated: Gain a burst of Movement speed for 3s after using your ultimate\n\nThis concerns me a bit. All of the Drakes seem fairly universally useful (and I agree lowering basic cooldowns is problematic), but I think there are a number of champions here that unfairly benefit (Kog'Maw and Kassadin come to mind) and a number for whom this buff is almost entirely useless. Given the always-useful, always-on nature of the others, I would encourage additional exploration here.\n\n> Kleptomancy Rework\n>\n> * Gain a random keystone - once it is used gain another after 7 seconds.\n\nThis is interesting, although I worry it doesn't create the same sort of consistently fun micro-game that Kleptomancy did, and may be frustrating when so many of them require adapting your playstyle. Some champions also simply don't benefit from some of these or find them very hard to use, and it would be frustrating to roll Predator to find it on cooldown (or to just burn it immediately because you don't want it), or Hail of Blades on someone with incredibly long range, or Glacial Augment on someone who can't meaningfully proc it.\n\nI guess I'm just not sure what the intended user pool or gameplay here is, because it feels strictly inferior to simply picking on keystone you can more reliably utilize and plays better to your champion's strengths. I struggle to think of anyone who actually benefits from this new iteration, *especially* as I now have to sometimes pause in combat to try to figure out if my playstyle has to adapt for whatever the psuedo-RNG has decided to grant me (and the visible Keystone buffs aren't flashy enough for that to be instantly recognizable).\n\n> Zz’rot Portal\n> Ohmwrecker \n> Raptor Cloak\n\nStrong removals across the board. Maybe Herald could be summoned with Zz'Rot portal and have the Ohmwrecker buff indicating its massive turret damage? Kill two birds with one stone and all that. :P\n\n>We want to try and shift it to enchanter stats to create a new option for supports and leave tanks with Righteous as an option.\n> * Updated Shurelia’s:\n> * Forbidden Idol + Crystalline Bracer + 850g (total cost 2300g)\n> * 300hp \n> * 10% CDR \n> * 100% health regen\n> * 100% mana regen \n> * 10% heal/shield power\n> * Active: 40% movement speed for 3s for you and nearby allies (90s cooldown)\n\nThis still feels a bit tanky, although I like the intended split. Have you considered pushing it even further into Enchanter territory with Aether Wisp in place of Crystalline Bracer to double down on the movement and appeal to casters?\n\n> Kircheis Shard buff\n\nLovely.\n\n> Melee vs ranged lanes\n\nAlso lovely. I'm especially interested in seeing how this diversifies Mid and Top match-ups, hopefully allowing more characters to play in both.\n\n>Current iterations have some additional melee only power added to Doran’s Shield\n\nHave you considered making this change to Ring, Blade, and Corrupting Potion as well? As there are melee champions who might consider all of these it seems like it might be best to hit all the common melee starting items so you don't *just* opt into Doran's Shield in every ranged-vs-melee matchup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aean","date":"2019-10-22T17:09:08.025+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'm undervaluing this but what is the advantage of the new Kleptomancy keystone over taking one keystone that reliably gives you something you can use?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazekiba","date":"2019-10-22T19:47:30.987+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:432}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:27}} basically removed from the game, why? \nHow are you supposed to use these champs without their corest item, the famed Zzrot? \n\nWhy even take Ingenious Hunter if you arent buying Zhonyas Rocketbelt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Off ßrand","date":"2019-10-22T18:16:21.691+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what I'm seeing is that midlane will be overturned now because solo lane XP is up and individual bot lane champions lack agency even more since their XP is down. Bot laners are too dependent on teammates to succeed as opposed to the solo lanes. Maybe balance bot lane by making it so that ADCs don't get blown up in the early lane after one trade, making it a kill fest lane, so early game isn't entirely support difference? Make it so late game ADCs don't take over because of their abhorrently overpowered itemization? We don't need these extremities to define roles where the carry has high damage potential but are too squishy to do anything with it unless someone on the enemy team isn't abusing that weakness easily. Just some base health up, a few base resistances up (MR mainly so supports don't take out half your health by themselves) without the issue of oversustained lanes by bringing down health growth and resistance growth stats. \n\nI'm a jungle main and this rant so far has been about bot lane. These XP changes make it even more impossible to impact the map by ganking solo lanes. Not only is our own XP been getting consistently nerfed over the last couple seasons, but this time, duo XP being nerfed affects us too. Another round of XP nerfed for junglers and one of the most popular ways to make up for our lack of XP (absorbing XP by pushing waves after ganking a lane) is down as well. These XP nerfs are double dipping on junglers, I suppose the only viable way to play jungle now is to hypergank early to get your laners ahead and make sure you're not too low from jungle clears, or else the solo laners that are level 7 when I'm level 4 are going to blow me up otherwise. So our only choice is to camp boy lane as per usual because they'll be the same level as me and won't be blowing me up. \n\nOverall, these XP changes are a really artificial ways to balance the discrepancy where bot lane is too much of a win condition and top lane isn't enough of one. The core issues here are not being solved. I hope riot doesn't go through with these XP changes, these are just so unhealthy for the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShanDaSHARKZ","date":"2019-10-22T19:40:30.167+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Remove stopwatch.

What purpose does it have for champions like Udyr, Jayce, Elise, Nidalee, and Shyvana? Ultimate cooldown reduction does none of them any good unless it functions on their transformations or Phoenix Stance which current ultimate reductions do not. On top of that, having a Nimbus Cloak-like effect on the Dragon Soul for Cloud Drake is another wasted spot. This pushes champions who are currently viable (Jayce and Elise in particular) further down into the dirt because of lacking a traditional ultimate ability and **more importantly, 4 of the 5 champions that will lose the most from this change are freaking junglers who should be focused on and have priority on these drakes.**\n\nOn top of that, we're taking away Ohmwrecker (admittedly a mostly useless item) and Zz'rot Portal which is niche but much healthier than Banner of Command ever was and then removing a very useful component item for playing from behind in Raptor Cloak which is a very important component for quite a few top lane champions. One of the stated goals was to address the disparity between ranged and melee top laners and the removal of Raptor Cloak is going to make that worse because it's an armor/health regen item to help survive in poor lanes but more importantly a way to either engage or disengage near turrets into a matchup you may not traditionally be able to catch or escape from. Instead of entirely removing the Raptor Cloak component, shift it over to replace the Chain Vest in Deadman's Plate and Righteous Glory. Glacial Shroud already builds into quite a few items so it wouldn't lose anything by being taken out of Righteous Glory and the Point Runner passive attached to a couple items that are meant for charging forward would allow for Raptor Cloak's unique and somewhat important passive to remain on other items.\n\nThe changes so far just feel really bad for a player like me who is now going to have a useless drake possibly appearing, some of the items I've come to depend on when behind being removed, and jungle experience being nerfed at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2019-10-22T19:59:19.977+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not make Ohmwrecker a tank support item tied behind a quest (something I read you guys would be changing for support items so that non-supports could abuse them)?
