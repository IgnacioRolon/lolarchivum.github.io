While they may not affect a static teamfight much - 80%-99% slows like Nasus, Trynd, Zilean, Tahm K, etc can have a huge impact on the aftermath or pre-fight. They fly under the radar because hard cc is complained about most but 9/10 times I'd rather be hard CC'd than slowed on my way to or from the fight. I just think the slows in the game are due for a little more scrutiny and perhaps a duration/intensity decay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ReyIIon","date":"2019-07-02T15:09:42.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you really certain people will change their build based on one death with a really specific scenario instead of pressing tab the whole game and seeing who's playing good and what their comp really is?
