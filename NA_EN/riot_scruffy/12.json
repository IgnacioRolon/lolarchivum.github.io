Celebrating 10 Years of LoL","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone!\n\nWe are so excited to be celebrating 10 years of League of Legends with all of you and as part of this, we wanted to spend some of our time working directly with you to make the game better. Today, we’ve gathered a group of Designers, Engineers, and QA from across League to squash the bugs that matter to you most. Drop a post here with a description of any in-game issue that you want to see fixed and we’ll respond in the thread as we fix them! We're not the full dev team so in particular champion and Item bugs are the things we're most likely to address. \n\nTo help us out, please be as specific as you can about each bug and include any other information you can think of that might help. Videos/gifs/replays are all super useful for us to narrow down whether we are fixing the right thing. Based on our patch scheduling, we expect that most of what we fix here will be shipping in the 9.22 patch and the more risky issues might take longer than that. We won’t be able to tackle everything that gets posted here, but we’re looking forward to improving the game for you in any way we can. \n\nWithout further ado, let the bug squashing commence!\n\n-Lol Devs and Fans\n\n\nhttps://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/9.20.1/img/champion/Sion.png","replies":[{"poster":"Thê Unforgivên","date":"2019-10-15T16:30:05.785+0000","up_votes":98,"down_votes":2,"body":"The bug where u go into loading screen, get stuck there and can’t close the client to reconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ruhepol","date":"2019-10-15T16:48:41.884+0000","up_votes":84,"down_votes":4,"body":"After being seen by Ashe's Hawk Shot (E) ability, the icon (owl eyes?) above the champions which were spotted do not disappear again and most likely stay until the end of the game.

Place a target dummy close to Riven.\n2. Knock the target dummy into the air with the 3rd cast of Riven's Q.\n3. Cast Q again while the target dummy is airborne and targeting it with your mouse cursor (*note this requires the usage of the refresh cooldowns feature.*)\n\n[Demonstration](https://giant.gfycat.com/ImperfectFreeApe.webm)\n\nSome quick notes on this method of reproduction:\n\n* Riven's Q will move towards where her target dummy is facing, not where it is moving, this is how you can knock the target dummy backwards but be sent in the opposite direction.\n* The target dummy will face the direction of your controlled champion when placed, this direction is denoted by the arrow at the base of the target dummy's model.\n* This particular method of reproduction does only demonstrate it with an airborne target but **it happens due to any kind of movement, not just knockups or Riven's 3rd Q**, which I'll demonstrate in other clips.\n\nSome other quick clips for the dev's demonstrating just how destructive and consistent this unintended interaction is:\n- [Consistency](https://giant.gfycat.com/FormalImpishAmericanwigeon.webm)\n- [Against CS](https://i.imgur.com/7eliTFL.mp4)\n- [Against champions](https://giant.gfycat.com/FixedSparseGar.webm) &lt;- both of these Q's missed although cursor was over Jax when the Q was cast.\n\n\n\n**To keep this discussion productive, I would like to ensure that everyone is as informed as possible on the subject, so I'll spend the rest of this post demonstrating the various behaviours of Riven's Q. I'll try to only describe the behaviours that may be relevant to this discussion as otherwise I could be here all day.**\n\n**Riven's Q has two main groups of behaviours, depending on whether or not the player is highlighting a target with her mouse cursor when the ability is cast.**\n\n* **Riven's 'Untargeted' Q**\n - Riven will dash the maximum distance of her Q, ignoring all unit collision, in the direction she is facing at the time the ability is cast.\n - This behaviour ignores everything other than terrain and the direction she is facing, including all unit collision, even when starting from inside a unit, even when travelling through another unit and even when ending inside another unit.\n - Here is a clip demonstrating these behaviours where Riven is initially standing inside the collision box of the a target dummy, travelling through it in the direction she is facing without being directed immediately away, and travelling through a second unit throughout the dash, maintaining the direction she is facing. [Example 1.1](https://i.imgur.com/VBx7nfh.gif)\n\n\n* **Riven's 'Targeted' Q**\n - Riven will dash in the direction of the centre of her target, travelling the required distance for Riven and her targets hitbox to make contact, ranging from the minimum dash distance to the maximum, again completely ignoring unit collision.\n - Here is a demonstration of the targeted Q redirecting Riven towards her target and travelling the minimum amount as her target is close. [Example 2.1](https://i.imgur.com/OOIsfMq.gif)\n - Here is a demonstration of Riven travelling as much as required to meet the target's hitbox. [Example 2.2](https://i.imgur.com/MZbvHGR.gif)\n - Here is a demonstration of Riven travelling the maximum amount to attempt to meet the target's hitbox. [Example 2.3](https://i.imgur.com/Y7WBfs5.gif)\n - Note in all of these examples the direction Riven is initially facing is ignored.\n - To demonstration the concept of Riven always at least dashing a minimum distance here is Riven standing close enough to the centre of her target so that the minimum dash carries her to the other side, causing the following Q to travel in the other direction towards where the centre of the target now is. [Example 2.4](https://i.imgur.com/yBsGAg3.gif)\n\n**Everything working as intended, until the target starts moving, Riven's targeted Q will instead:**\n\n1. Travel, **not towards the direction of the centre of her target,** but instead towards an area in front of where her target is facing, once again ignoring all unit collision.\n2. Here is a demonstration of Riven travelling towards in front of her target instead of towards both it, and the mouse cursor. [Example 3.1](https://i.imgur.com/FcMerss.gif)\n3. Here is a demonstration of Riven travelling away from her target as although she is highlighting her target she instead directs herself towards an area in front of the target. [Example 3.2](https://i.imgur.com/3sE5Krr.gif).\n4. **This may look like some kind of collision, it is not. Dashes, blinks, flashes, shunpo's etc, do not initiate any pathing calculations that cause irregularities in the direction champions are facing and Riven's Q when targeted ignores the direction she is facing anyway.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2019-10-15T17:19:21.107+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":3,"body":"OMG, it's not april right? I'll make a very long list here, and i'll update it if you guys answer and have started fixing them. There will be a section dedicated to Illaoi, based on this post https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/2Ncw9ex9-illaois-50-bugs-updated-list , then a section with some general champion bugs, and then another section for items, runes. **please ask me anything about the bugs if they're not clear or you can't reproduce them**\n\n#Illaoi\n1. Tentacles can be commanded to attack 0.25 seconds after their death. During this timeframe they can also queue other attack commands. At the end of the slam their animation bugs out. Normally they shouldn't be able to queue attack commands if they die while slamming. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iirLAJQKfrY&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n2. If you command Tentacles to attack while they're in their spawn animation their next attack after spawning will be delayed. This is because the tentacle tries to attack before spawning, and even though it can't it will still trigger the tentacle queue attacks timeframe. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUcTjjNQGik); [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z8xC6-_xdQ)\n3. Since patch 9.13 tentacles are supposed to not go dormant anymore, and yet they still trigger an internal spawn animation cooldown. And because of this, if an enemy champion becomes a vessel near dormant tentacles, those tentacles will not attack him when they wake up. This, as i said, is probably because the tentacle tries to attack before it's fully awaken. This negates the attack completely and the tentacle goes on cooldown. Note that this doesn't happen with ult tentacles, because ult tentacles are actually coded to not go dormant. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm52XxtMdoU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n4. The same thing happens the other way around, i.e tentacles try to attack but are dormant. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a3YwqgSzKQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n5. Tentacles have different attack ranges. E tentacles hit based on the target's edge, while W tentacles hit based on the target's center. It is possible to have an E tentacle attack a target that stays still, and when you W that target the tentacle won't attack.\n6. Tentacles reveal nearby control wards the same way wards reveal them. It's like the control ward tries to deactivate the \"ward\" tentacle unit, but since it can't it simply reveals itself.\n##W\n7. If Illaoi is rooted and is not in range to basic attack a target, she can still attack command and then cast w to use a dash range melee w.\n8. The W always breaks spellshields, but the bonus damage is only blocked when using a close w. Tentacles always slam.\n9. Dash range W does not trigger hail of blades, while close w does.\n10. Illaoi's dash W triggers on-attack effects at the start of the dash, rather than upon hitting enemies. Garen had the same issues, but he was fixed. On-attack effects are for example energized effects and spear of shojin.\n11. Tentacle slams are inconsistent with blocks. Jax will always negate slams. Shen allows tentacles to slam with close w. Teemo negates everything on close W, but doesn't block anything with dash W. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKN2vuETIQ)\n12. Bone plating will both trigger and reduce the W damage from a single attack (it's supposed to reduce the damage from the second attack).\n13. If she close W-s a spirit, and the spirit vanishes mid animation, or a target became untargetable (zhonya, vladimir, etc..), tentacles will slam, but they won't slam if Illaoi dash w-ed. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUlojKtZGF8&amp;feature=youtu.be); [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOcA7oSdlqM)\n14. If Illaoi has Guardian Angel and starts w before she “dies” but hits while she’s “dead”, Tentacles won’t slam. If however she queues W and then “dies” the Tentacles will attack. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pqtZtUZMqI)\n15. When using it together with Dead Man's Plate it grants 2 stacks of Conqueror, instead of 1.\n15. The damage applies before blade of the ruined king's. I don't think it should.\n##E\n1. If Lulu polimorphs a kayn spirit the game crashes.\n2. If Illaoi E-s a target that is camouflaged (and not invisible) while there’s a control ward revealing them, the spirit will be invisible and untargetable. It can still get damaged (i guess, because you can’t see its hp but you definitely redirect the damage), but you can’t hit it with basic attacks. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJp-p_kTMtc)\n3. The same invisible bug also happens when hitting the champion that's inside Kalista's Ult. Afaik the target should be untargetable, and i'm not sure if it's Illaoi's E fault or Kalista's R fault, but in any case, that's wrong. [video](https://youtu.be/cApbCTz_lIQ).\n4. Spellthief and Predator. The attack that procs the bonus damage against the spirit only reflects double proc damage, not taking into account actual damage done to the spirit. \nFor example, if the proc deals 10 bonus damage and you deal 1000 damage, what gets redirected is 20 damage. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNxHbtbebdY)\n5. Some abilities/effects work as if the spirit were a monster, for example Blade of the Ruined King which deals a maximum 60 damage (this doesn't happen with Bloodrazor) and Tahm Kench may launch it as a minion when he eats it. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njYash_tWRs)\n6. The spirit's duration is inconsistent. It varies between 6.25 and 6.5 seconds (never 7 seconds). [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVAg2zjX-kY&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n7. Towers will not increase their damage per shot when attacking the spirit, and they will also deal 50% reduced damage to it. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnJQSZsk6Co&amp;feature=youtu.be)  \nThe hit to the champion dealt 125 damage while the ones to the spirit dealt a static 62.5.\n8. When the spirit times out it still counts as an unit kill for Illaoi. She doesn't actually need to kill the spirit, it only needs to time out or have the target leave range. This will give her Phage’s full movement speed and 1 creep score in game. I said in-game because it only counts in-game. Every game you play with Illaoi you'll have a lower amount of cs at the end of game screen than you had in-game, supposing you grabbed at least one spirit.\n9. When the spirit gets low it will start redirecting less and less damage [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2ASLYcuTXE)  \nIn the video i have 625 ad and rank 5 E which equals to a 95% redirected damage. Until the spirit has 673 hp i redirect 296 damage with my basic attacks, which is correct (625/2\\*0.95). When it has 360 i redirect 180. When it has 48 i redirect 23. I believe this is because the redirected damage is done with this formula. Damage (before resistances)\\*E modifier&lt;=Spirit’s Current Health. If this is false the redirected damage becomes equal to the Spirit’s Current Health. This will then get modified by resistances or amplifiers of the enemy champion.  \n10.  Another issue of the current redirected damage formula is that the damage benefits twice from Conqueror, converting 19% of the damage to true damage. (1 - 0.9 \\* 0.9)\n11. If the target goes into guardian angel just after his spirit is being grabbed, the spirit will have 0 hp and be invincible. It will not redirect any damage, but when it expires it'll count as being killed. [video](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousRichGazelleANELE), [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecb5Wr9pMBw)\n12. Sometimes when you get knocked up or silenced your E can look as if it got blocked. But it doesn't. The ability will still go forward, but it's invisible. [video](https://streamable.com/pmt5d), [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoLVkhvhY-c), [video3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTnFdpnu6bk)\n13. Why can nobody see who's vesseled other than Illaoi? Tentacles randomly do AOE attacks against that target. Allies should know not to stay close to it and enemies should know to attack it.\n14. E is invisible when invisible. I agree with having nunu r or sion q or whatever be invisible when they're invisible. But i don't really agree for a projectile to be invisible. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6-E5JiXpIw)\n##R\n1.  If Illaoi dies right after ulting, already spawned tentacles won't get ult buffed. During this time you will have both normal and ulted tentacles around you. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq3eihP2wdE)\n2. If a Tentacle starts an attack before finishing the ult cast time and then you use W, the tentacle's first attack animation cancels and starts the next one. Only the animation cancels. The first attack still goes on, but it’s invisible and will still hit the target. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bpl9fngHA)\n3. The other way around, if you W when the ult finishes the attack will be delayed. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfhjDEpEA1c)\n\n##General\n\nShe has some weird bufferings, as you can see in this link https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-reports-eu/RUi5gXLv-gameplay-illaoi-buffering-inconsistencies","replies":[{"poster":"AnataBakka","date":"2019-10-15T17:51:57.523+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"#Other champions\n1. Azir doesn't spawn ult soldiers near the fountain's edges. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tFMT8oGN2E&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n2. Is it normal that shaco fear roots you for 0.5 seconds? Other fears don't do that.\n3. Katarina remains locked out for more if her E kills a target. Also she doesn't correctly buffer movement commands. \n4. Wukong's E clones are targetable for 0.25 seconds upon hitting their targets. They can be hit by Illaoi's E and Katarina's Q for example. This is a video with attack move illaoi W. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IPkMVlAi40)\n5. Vayne's W is consumed upon hitting an untargetable target (i.e zhonya). [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LH5TcEk42C8).\n6. If fizz gets stunned while untargetable during his E, his E will stop and make him targetable again. Abilities like Blitzcrank E can stun him during the untargetability. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zjtcee-OvUQ&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n7. Wolf stops attacking Rift Scuttler if it enters a bush. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqlKVljP6G4&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n8. Gnar can completely reset his Q cooldown if he grabs it at maximum range [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udeY5oKE75Y).\n9. Wukong's E applies a stack of Electrocute through untargetability. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTOrHRPU0WU&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n10. If Yasuo gets stunned during his E after pressing E-Q, his Q will still go on cooldown even though it did not cast.\n11. Malzahar gains W stacks at the start of the ability's cast rather that at the end. If he casts an ability and the target dies mid-cast, cancelling the ability, you still gain a W stack.\n12. Yasuo and Braum cannot block Swain's raven's projectiles from returning to him but they can block soraka's Q rejuvenation projectile. Kind of an inconsistency?\n13. Casting Pantheon's or Pyke's Q-s while on cooldown will disable your movement or attack commands for 0.25 seconds. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be0zdBJsDBA)\n14. Aatrox ult doesn't increases spell vamp healing (maw of malmortious).\n15. Diana and Xin passive have both had their cycles changed after the guinsoo change, and yet only jax and yi have a fix planned for them. I think they deserve too.\n16. Some abilities create clones that do stuff only champions should be able to do, like grabbing ~~the eye of herald or~~ turret plating gold. These are, and are probably not limited to, yasuo r test cube, lissandra thralls, wukong e clones, assassin kayn w. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5ikThLzoPE) **UPDATE:** Non-champions grabbing the eye of herald was fixed in 9.21. Turret plating was still however not.\n17. Mordekaiser is granted two stacks of passive when basic attacking with deadman's.\n18. Caitlyn's ability granted passive attacks don't grant her guinsoo or energized stacks. They also don't trigger spear of shojin's cooldown reduction.\n19. Caitlyn is allowed to shot other headshots while one is already traveling. This is because the stacks are consumed on-hit rather than on-attack.\n20. Other abilities can be cast before Sylas' E hits his target. Upon hitting a target Sylas will start dashing even if he's during the ability's cast animation. All abilities will still work, other than his W which will cancel and go on cooldown.\n21. A patch ago Camille's E was made to not be castable during groundings. What was forgotten was to also make her E non castable while rooted.\n22. If Camille is grounded while attached to a wall with her E, she will regain her ability to move, and once the grounding finishes (if she's still attached to the wall) she will dash away from her current location.\n23. Darius' Q will heal from its shaft if the shaft is blocked by a spellshield.\n24. Olaf's W lifesteal and spellvamp bonuses calculate on-cast, instead of based on his missing health. If the ability is re-casted it will simply refresh its duration instead of recalculating the bonuses.\n25. Fiora's Vitals do not trigger if her Q is spell shielded, but do trigger if her W is spell shielded.\n26. On 9.14 Lucian's second shot critical damage was hiddenly increased to 100% from 75%. Infinity Edge still used the old value for its damage increase.\n27. If Garen Q-s a champion before it becomes invisible, his Q will cancel and Garen will be unable to cast E for the duration of his Q buff.\n28. There's no reason for Hecarim's E to go through after he's immobilized / grounded. Rengar's passive and Illaoi's W stop, but Hecarim's E will go through, for example through veigar's wall.\n29. Jayce melee E doesn't knockback his target. Rather he pulls them to a certain location in front of him decided at the start of cast. Doesn't matter if the target is away or behind Jayce during the cast time, they will be pulled on that location.\n30. Infinity Edge increases Kindred's E damage multiplicatively. It should either be 25% damage increase or lower. Instead it's 37.5% more damage. I consider it a bug because it's the only one that acts this way, and inconsistency is usually a bug.\n31. Lee sin cannot self cast his W while rooted or grounded. I bealive the tech wasn't available when he was made, which is why the entire ability was disabled, but the tech should be available now, considering talon q and illaoi w exist, both of which can use their melee versions when rooted / grounded.\n32. For some reason Infinity Edge increases Noc's passive damage to the primary target by 2.5% AD. Not a lot, but still weird.\n33. Riven's W-R cast times are cancelled if cast right at the end of E's dash. Doing E - W - Q is faster than doing W - Q. \n34. Ryze cannot teleport a single minion with his R. This was supposed to be fixed 2 years ago, after a failed attempt on a tourney to teleport rift herald, but the bug somehow reappeared.\n35. Shyvana's Q second strike is affected by critical strike modifiers. However, when in dragon form, it no longer is on the primary target. The ability will deal more damage to the secondary targets than the primary.\n36. Since about 9.11 multiple champions' abilities have been re-coded to work on decoy takedowns, including yi r reset, katarina passive etc... One of these is Swain's passive which is kind of the only one i don't agree with, because it triggers on ally takedown. If Swain is against Illaoi, and Illaoi uses her E, Swain will get free hp, mana, and stacks. Sometimes it's better if Illaoi doesn't use her E at all or else Swain overpowers for nothing.\n37. Sylas' passive is the only empowered basic attack that modifies its damage and when critting it doesn't deal 100% AD bonus damage.\n38. Sylas passive doesn't apply press the attack.\n39. Sylas passive does not add additional stacks of electrocute / phase rush from multiple hits.\n40. If Tryndamere crits the moment guinsoo on-hit triggers, his E cooldown will be reduced twice, even thought guinsoo doesn't really crit.\n41. Warwick's tooltips keep on mentioning that effects on him are triple, when they're never tripled. They're always 250%.\n42. Yuumi's W says that it gives a certain amount of % of the player's ad or ap as adaptive power to the other. The thing is, that % itself is adaptive. When giving it from ad it actually grants you % \\* 0.6 adaptive force. \n\n#General bugs\n1. Melee basic attacks sometimes consume on dead targets. To reproduce this just attack a target the instant it dies. You won't get the kill credit but your attack will go on cooldown. This also fucks up some spells like Illaoi's W (does not make tentacles slam). If Illaoi hits a target before or after it dies she triggers slams. If she hits them the moment they die she doesn't. I think draven's axes also disappear if this happens. [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bHMJZxaV2M), [video3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3tdkvUlwZw), [video4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMGBEXrMSio)\n2. Abilities that hit at the same instant are considered a single ability for black cleaver stacking or spellshields. Spellshields had a bugfix that said \"no longer blocks multiple abilities that hit at the same time\", and yet it still blocks multiple zed shurikens, multiple azir q-s, multiple tentacle slams.  Here's zed stacking black cleaver. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwa3SKU1jP8)\n3. The newest pbe yi guinsoo fix made you guys discover that you can allow abilities to trigger on-attack effects. That would be a cool stuff to add to every abilty that is noted as a \"basic attack\" in the client. I.e yasuo q, which cannot trigger guinsoo for example, because it's not really a basic attack.\n4. Empowered projectiles can still hit you after you became untargetable. Usually the attack either doesn't cast or the projectile disappears mid-air. In this case it just hits you. Pretty sure this is because these abilities destroy projectiles on-cast, rather than for the full duration of the untargetability, and since some attacks don't cancel if a target becomes untargetable, they create the projectile after it, and so they escape the destruction. Can easily be test with Dragon's empowered attacks and Zed's ult / Yi's Q [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g___bjfGKiU); [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haXqPFW_z54)\n5. A lot of abilities interact, i could say, weirdly, if cast under the champion's model. Usually the animation and the actual damage area are placed in different directions. in other cases there's asssassin kayn w which hits every unit in a 4500 unit radius. Here's a video with Illaoi, because kayn is too broken to actually make a video of, but the reproduction is the same. Jinx W had the same bug and after a vandiril video she was fixed. I also saw a reddit post talking about rakan not jumping when doing this. Click somewhere. Don't move mouse. Use ability. Enjoy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1PkOpb1534)\n6.

Conqueror has some stacking issues. Abilities that don't apply spell effects don't stack it (i.e Diana passive). Tentacles commanded by Illaoi's W don't stack it. Runaan's on-hits stack it, but guinsoo's on-hits don't. You stack it on shen w, but don't on jax or teemo.\n2. Unflinching doesn't grant slow resist for summoner spells on cooldown, even thought the tooltip says it should.\n3. The tooltip of Revitalize says it should increase the heals and shield you receive by 5%. That doesn't happen. It only increases that ones you cast.\n4. Presence of Mind had a bugfix which made it reduce the cooldown of abilities that were invisible atm i.e riven or pets. Darius' R still doesn't have its cooldown reduced.\n5. Aftershock does not trigger when hitting unstoppable champions, even if the stun persists after their unstoppability ends.\n6. Conditioning does not increase the effect of abilities that scale of bonus resistances (i.e taric e).\n7. Basic attacks that are triggered automatically by a lot of abilities (i.e amumu q, jax q, panth w) do not grant conqueror, phase rush, electrocute, spellthief stacks. If you find an ability making you automatically basic attack, that basic attack probably has this bug.\n\n#Items\n1. Abilities that apply both spell effects and on-hit effects trigger muramana twice. I'm saying this isn't intended because Ezreal's winrate skyrocked when you made his q trigger spell effects, and you then fixed the interaction only for him, leaving all the others unfixed. Stuff like Illaoi W or Eve E and many more.\n2. Spirit Visage increases bork's and ravenous hydra's bonus damage healing from lifesteal twice (i.e by 1.3 \\* 1.3 = 69% instead of 30%).\n3. A few patches ago spellblade (i.e trinity) code was changed. This change made some interactions act differently, like Camille and Corki. They were then fixed, but some others have remained unfixed, which is ashe passive and Xayah W. I wonder if the change in code was supposed to fix their interactions or if you forgot about them. Previously a Xayah W projectile took spellblade's damage in consideration for its own. Now it no longer does.\n4. A few patches ago Ardent started applying if you shielded / healed yourself. Nothing was mentioned anywhere, so, was it intended?\n5. Recurve bow and runaan's hurricane apply stacks of black cleaver when used with guinsoo or sometimes even without guinsoo. Other on-hits don't, so i don't see why they should?\n6. Hunter's talisman doesn't apply on some abilities like diana passive and rek'sai q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GewitterImĄrsch","date":"2019-10-15T19:17:53.809+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you spam Pantheon Q while its on CD you get locked out of your movement control.

This buglist was compiled by Yura#4616 from the Rengar Mains Discord.\n\nRengar Bug List\n\nGameplay Bugs:\n\n- De-Aggro. (Needs no explanation, it's random, it sucks, it still happens...)\n- Leaping to Enemy Nexus doesn't work, (You're forced to walk a lot closer, then leap, rather than leap at max range).\n- Passive Leap Range Indicator not showing up correctly (It is visually the wrong size, on almost all of his skins).\n- Ferocity Bug 1 where u Randomly Lose Ferocity. (Some suggest it happens when throwing E near End of Timer, or again Randomly.)\n- Target Selection Bug on Leap, (Which may be Related to Clicking on Enemy and Leaping on a Tower). \n- Q + Leap will do Bonus Damage on Towers. (This works on Every Tower, as long as u can Leap to it. 100% Reproduction Rate with Ivern or Top/Bot Inner.)\n- U cannot Q AA Yorick Wall, gets u stuck in an auto loop, (Avoidable by being in the Middle of Spawn Location, but most of the time will get u Stuck in the Loop).\n- There is a chance when in Rengar R, Nocturne can Remove the Screen Glow from Ultimate.\n- When Silenced and you try to Leap, you are able to. However, if u have Q activated and try to Leap, you cannot Leap. (Rare, only with Cho'Gath)\n- When Leaping in front of Baron, Rengar will land in 3 Different Spots. Intended Reaction should be landing at the Foot of Baron from a straight angle, rather than being redirected.\n- There is a random chance u cannot leap when someone is dashing with Lantern. Example: Enemy Grabs Thresh Latern, at the very Moment of Grabbing it, Rengar will not Leap.\n- If you move your camera too far from Rengar, you cannot hear his Thrill of the Hunt SFX. As it isolates on the Heartbeat sound, the heartbeat sound however isn't working correctly, and u cannot hear it through Thrill of the Hunt Ambience.\n- Riot August told me it's not a bug, but in case this has changed. Active Items such as Tiamat, and Smite do not keep up Rengar's Passive Timer.\n- If an auto does 0 damage, Rengar's passive timer is not kept up.\n\n\nNon-Gameplay:\n\n- Attack Speed Buff Sound has been removed. (Really Old, doesn't have to come back).\n- Mecha Rengar Missing Ultimate Quote, but has a Unique Laugh no other skin has.\n- Mecha Rengar uses Base Skin's Max Fero Hand Glow, instead of Night Hunter, or it's own unique version.\n- Basic Q's Trail VFX on Nighthunter Rengar, is Missing.\n- Ult Activation Sound, or the Channel Sound is quiet, this is the Same for the Headhunter Ult Activation Sound, maybe it is quiet on Mecha Rengar as well, but i'm not sure.\n- Rengar's Heartbeat Sound is not working correctly, it isn't changing based on whether a person is far or close, nor is it changing based on how many enemies are spotted, it is also too quiet.\n- https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/0/0b/Rengar.UltimateActivation1.ogg/revision/latest?cb=20170523155706 \nThis sound should play when Rengar Spots a Target, or when he enters Ultimate Mark Detection Range. Instead, Only enemies hear it when the Mark is above their head.\n- Passive Indicator sometimes displays a 6 second timer, rather than 8 seconds.\n- Pretty Kitty Rengar has an Audio desync Bug when using Q with an E.\n- Rengar's Buff Bar features a HUD that shows who's trophy's are left, even with max stacks it'll show up sometimes.\n- Rengar's Tail will clip into the ground sometimes.\n- When casting Tiamat, the AA isn't played fully when on the ground.\n- When Head Hunter Rengar dies, enemies still hear his Thrill of the Hunt SFX.\n- Rengar's Q VFX are playing at the start, rather than the End of Leap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mondet","date":"2019-10-15T17:35:43.571+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Running {{champion:154}} animation during his E jump.\n\n{{champion:99}} Q hitbox (visuals are way too small).\n\n{{champion:266}} auto attack feels like it can be cancelled really early into the animation and still get the damage off.\n\n{{champion:14}} Soul Frunace doesn't stack with jungle monsters properly sometimes.\n\n{{champion:58}} W should work on turrets as double (or triple auto depending on fury), not just as auto reset ({{champion:114}} can hit turrets with Q and E so wth?).\n\nInvisible {{champion:20}} STILL exists, I think it happens when {{champion:20}} has Huner's Talisman and you didn't have vision on him previously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ANARMYOFOVER100","date":"2019-10-15T21:59:18.593+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"When Singed flips Master Yi into his adhesive trap, Master Yi will not be stunned at all if Master Yi is in his ultimate.

Champions work perfectly fine, but the minion closest to the center goes to the last champion's location.  The second minion goes to the first minion's intended position, the third minion to the second's, and so on.  When there are no champions in the portal, the first minion ends up playing the teleport animation but not moving at all since its normal behavior is to go to a champion's location but it fails to do anything when there is no champion at all.  It seems that positions are being stored before they are calculated rather than after.  [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NUF5JzrAic), the first ult shows the minion positions being shuffled even with a champion present (one ranged minion goes to my location, another ranged minion goes to a melee minion's location, and a melee minion goes to a different ranged minion's location), while the second ult shows without a champion present (closest minion is left behind because it looks for the last champion's location but fails to find one).  This also happened at World's the other day, [here is a clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/RoundLazyRatDerp).\n\nTwisted Fate ult pops projectiles even if the channel gets canceled.  This has existed since at least season 2, likely longer.  [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjdLx9jPHbg).\n\nBrand ult has a bug where the current bounce target is hit, immediately decides on the next bounce target, but then that next target dies during the delay before the next bounce is fired.  This kills the ult entirely.  It needs to instead look for a target when the delay ends rather than when it starts.  [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJZfe4M2i6M), first ult is normal to show that it is in range, second ult is bugged due to the timing of the death.\n\nWhen a character exits and reenters vision, their selection hitbox will briefly linger at their last seen location.  This persists until the cursor is moved out of the lingering hitbox.  [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAPrfIsfp4w).\n\nTaric dying during his ult's 0.25-second cast time puts it on a cooldown that scales with his W rank instead of his ult rank.  [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sy0w4krfBQ), first ult is normal rank 1 ult cooldown, then the first death uses rank 3 ult instead due to having a rank 3 W, and the second death uses a rank 5 ult cooldown due to having a rank 5 W.\n\nSivir ult's haste value is bugged.  You are supposed to get the empowered haste for the remaining amount of time that Sivir has it.  However, if you receive the buff after the empowered haste has ran on Sivir, you get the full duration of the empowered haste instead of getting none.  At max rank, with 8 second total duration and 4 seconds empowered, if you receive the buff at 3.5 seconds elapsed then you only get 0.5 seconds of empowered haste, but if you receive it at 4.5 seconds elapsed then you get 3.5 seconds of empowered haste.  It seems that the empowered duration is defaulting to the max value and then being assigned the correct value if Sivir is still empowered but then not being dropped to zero if Sivir's duration has already expired.\n\nBlack Cleaver is bugged with Runaan's, Guinsoo's, and Recurve Bow, causing basic attacks to grant 2 stacks of Black Cleaver instead of just 1.  It appears that the physical on-hit damage for Runaan's and Guinsoo's still exists but is just set to zero now.  On top of that, the damage for these effects seems to be flagged differently than normal on-hits since those don't double-stack Black Cleaver, which seems to check for different flags.  Black Cleaver just exposes both issues.\n\nPractice Tool's cheat for Revive stopped working in 9.19 and still doesn't work in 9.20, may be due to the other changes to Practice Tool cheats on PBE.  Pressing the button just shows the floating text but does nothing else, making you use the fast forward button to skip the death timer.\n\nZac and Anivia passive started proccing on fountain deaths at some random point, they used to instead just die without trying to revive and to my knowledge no other revives were changed to do this.  It seems that they were changed from being \"on damage, prevent the damage and revive\" to \"on death, prevent the death\".  It had previously been explicitly stated to be intentional for fountain turret to not trigger revives, and it was never stated that this would be changed, so this is a bug.\n\nFlashing away from basic attacks used to not cancel them, but at some point it started canceling them.  This has never been explicitly stated to be intended or not.  Which is it, and what are the rules?  The general idea seems to be making enough distance between yourselves rather than specifically flashing, but what is this distance value?\n\nSome basic attacks are uncancelable so that the user cannot interrupt them, however this has the side effect of making them go through untargetable and fog of war, which does not make sense.  Furthermore, some of them will cancel with enough distance while others will hit you across the map.  A common example is Blitz E knocking Fizz out of his E.\n\nSome untargetable effects do only a single pop at the start of the untargetability instead of a continuous pop.  This feels buggy vs uncancelable attacks, and creates situations like Zed being hit by turret shots while in his ult, since the turret starts its windup before the ult starts but finishes the windup after the untargetable and projectile pop have gone off, which allows the projectile to still be fired to Zed since the turret attack is uncancelable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBossVeigar","date":"2019-10-15T16:34:15.074+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not a gameplay bug, just a skin bug: Omega Squad Veigar's eyes disappear when touching Honeyfruit, and don't change properly when CC'd.

Meaning you have to endure one really slow autoattack with a really slow animation before you can get your 3 fast hits (1 slow AA -> fast AA -> fast AA -> fast AA). The problem is, it only triggers on some machines (even though the game is supposedly played server-side). Last time I posted this bug, I heard through a friend that Riot could not reproduce the bug at all, despite all my videos. But I can reproduce it 100% of the time (as can others). I had honestly given up on this bug and just stopped using the rune entirely (and switched to Conqueror, even on champions/builds that would do better with hail of blades). Why Riot never reached out to me in the past to troubleshoot the bug and find out why my hardware/network setup can trigger the bug (and theirs can't) puzzles me, but maybe this time they will. The bug is easier to trigger on some champions rather than others. I can trigger it VERY easily on Master Yi. I can fight in the practice tool for a few minutes and reproduce it on Xin Zhao, but it is harder. I have heard reports from others of this bug triggering on various other champs (including Udyr). I originally reported this bug on patch 9.9. It has existed longer than that (this patch was the patch I started using the rune due to a mini Yi rework - I had never used it before that, and therefore could not discover it before that). The bug still exists.\n\nHow to reproduce: I originally tested this bug on Master Yi. It is easiest to trigger on Yi (out of the champions I play). The easiest way to trigger it is by pressing Q on a target, and then spamming (as fast as you can) E+R+right click on your target so that you will use E + R + autoattack at the same time as soon as coming out of Q. But you don't need to do this, this is just the easiest way to reproduce it. If you get unlucky you can reproduce it by simply pressing Q once and nothing else (automatically attacking the champion when coming out of Q, without even right clicking).\n\nWhy this is gamebreaking and not just a minor bug: you can literally turret dive and then get kited (or flashed from) and your rune just killed you because you didn't kill your opponent. lol.\n\nAnd here is the evidence: I will start with a harder champion, Xin Zhao. I made this video after getting frustrated when the bug triggered 4 times in one game on Master Yi. At the time, I did not know the bug could trigger on all champions. So this video made me come to that sad realization:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SyTycTVDqYI\n\nWatch my attack speed. When I reproduce the bug correctly, my attack speed will drop to 0.9 for one very slow attack, and then my attack speed will jump to 1.6 and perform 2 hail of blade attacks (knocking up on the second one) followed  by one final (3rd) hail of blades attack after the knockup. So, slow AA -> HoB AA -> HoB AA + knockup -> HoB AA. I reproduce it a few times at the beginning, I fail miserably to reproduce it through most of the middle, and then I reproduce it several times at the end. I am spamming right click, E, and Q. But from what I know about Yi, the bug can trigger randomly, even if I am not spamming buttons. I used the \"take my abilities off cooldown\" button but I didn't leave it automatically enabled (I manually took my abilities off cooldown after each combo). So this isn't just a practice tool bug. You can reproduce this in a live game.\n\nNow, I will show my evidence using Yi. This is a **_LOT_** of videos, so please bear with me. (Also, reminder: if you are having trouble seeing it, you can slow the videos down).\n\nThis video shows it very clearly. My R activates first, then my E, and immediately when the E appears on the buff bar (and goes on cooldown) my attack speed drops:\nhttps://youtu.be/jRl9_WPTIjw\n\nIn this video my R is activated before my Q, and my attack speed drops as soon as my E activates after I come out of Q:\nhttps://youtu.be/oJQgYqYrW5U\n\nAnother game, another HoB bug:\nhttps://youtu.be/77QWC61aayY\n\nAnother game, This time I didn't even press E or R\nhttps://youtu.be/u4slYessda0\n\nSame game, another bug:\nhttps://youtu.be/ssqCEhrTfxA\n\nBug happened twice in this game.

This is 2 instances where hail of blades actually worked properly.\n#This is how hail of blades is supposed to work.\nhttps://youtu.be/jlAQ89LfAKc","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheRealBaz","date":"2019-10-15T21:30:57.277+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek'sai E sometimes doesnt bring you through walls.

This causes a few related bugs (unable to issue attack commands while having the indicators out after canceling the pathing, or instantly canceling ultimate when pressing it again).\n\n**Video example:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV01a--usqo\n\n**Suggested fix:** Change cast range from 7500 to 25000 (like the majority of these types of spells have for this particular reason. See Yasuo Q fix earlier this year). Leave the displayed cast range at 7500, however, because that is a really good indicator for the ult's distance when stanting at base movespeed and running for 8s in about a straight line!\n\n[**Suggested fix, visualized:**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/312258593347076096/633715114066837515/unknown.png)\n\n**Further information:** Xenogenic fixed this same bug for Nunu W (minus the indicator, which just got removed in Nunu's case), but it's still there for Sion.\n\n---","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShenisDaddy","date":"2019-10-15T16:27:07.312+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can you fix this neeko bug? it is incredibly annoying against a Lulu to not be able to play. https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/AIbvtzM3-gameplay-neeko-getting-polymorphed-in-transformation-and-then-auto-attacked-neeko-breaks\n\nEdit: It affects all but base skin.
