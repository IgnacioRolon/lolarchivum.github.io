My frame rate was a solid 60 when I was playing yesterday, But as I just now updated and started playing. My frames keep dropping to 20-30 I wanted to know if anyone else is having these kinds of issues and if anyone know's how to go about and fixing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T02:38:42.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you happen to be running Windows 10? If so, there happened to be a batch of Windows 10 updates that went out last night that *may* have re-enabled the *Windows Game Bar* if you previously had it disabled. This feature has been causing severe FPS issues and computer crashes for some players. I'd recommend [disabling this feature](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) entirely to see if it resolves your issue.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Voltic Deign","date":"2016-11-10T08:22:10.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankfully I don't have window's 10, I run the game on window's 8.1 and was playing League just a hour before the patch just fine with a solid 60 fps.  Now it's dropping frames to like 20-30 fps and in team fights it just drops down to 7 fps. I don't have a real reason for this as I've done nothing different to my computer in the time it took me to get the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T22:36:56.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a good thing you're not plagued by that issue. I think it's safe to say this is likely caused by the other common culprits, which are either display driver issues or hardware problems.
