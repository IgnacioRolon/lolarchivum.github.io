Intentional feeding is often a result of hate speech. If you tell me to kill myself I will quite literally kill myself in the game. (Not anymore) but it was fun to do when they told me to kill myself and then wanted to report me for feeding. I was being a good support and listening to my adc but nooooo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-05T18:50:55.121+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind that in Riot's Terms of Use, section 5.1 states that they can terminate any account with / without cause at any time !! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2017-04-05T20:26:15.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OMG halp meh plz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=OJJtcy1B,comment-id=00080001,timestamp=2017-04-05T18:01:43.067+0000)\n> It basically means my account can be permabanned as well with no prior warning.\n\nIt can, and you agreed to that stipulation when you made an account and started playing the game.
