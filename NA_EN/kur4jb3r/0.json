But when l open the CCleaner and try to unninstall using it lt says this : \"The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable. Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing package 'LoL.NA.msi' in the box below\" and it shows me the path. When l press OK it says : \" The path . . . cannot be found.

But it says that you already have it installed and it makes you not able to install League of Legends?\nIt's not in the uninstall section......\n\nHave you tried to delete available League of Legends files? You can search in the search box at the windows 4 square circle '' League of Legends '' and delete remaining files/folders and then try to install it? I don't know how this works but it could work? Anyways I wish you best of luck!\n\nBest wishes, A Kat Main {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
