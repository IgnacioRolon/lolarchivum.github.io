Some aren't. I should of explained better why i put all those champions. I put all those champions to let you guys know that those prices and the amount of ip it costs to get them is high. I only posted 1 2014 champ which was 6,300 which is reasonable. It's normal ,but if you notice the 2009 dates for the champions are high except some. Master yi 540. Which is good. Also \nThats the main reason I posted the champion prices...\n**\nGetting tired of typing sorry if I have bad grammar. \n\nI'll edit that later ,but by now you should get my hint. I will add more champions if you really want me too. I am not gonna do the riot points ,but I am kind of starting to think riot is greedy mainly because they haven't changed the prices in a long time. They might just be lazy ,but please riot fix this. \n\nNow moving onto skins:\n\n**Legendary skins** are **1,820 RP** only 2 are not I believe. If I remember right riot promise back 2 years ago to not do this again? Promise broken. 1,820 rp just shows plain out rude. I don't care ,but I am sure others do ,so I am putting that into this post.\n\n**Pulsefire Ezreal , Spirit Gaurd Udry** = 3,250 rp. That makes my stomache sick.\n\n**Most of the skins are 975 rp**. I said most. Not all or higher.\n\nSo this is what I am suggesting riot you update your prices on everything. I thought you were do this on Janurary 1st 2015. I was wrong. You need to do another nerf on prices. \n\nApril 12, 2011 was the last time you did this by  89400... That is a lot ,but you guys should consider doing it again. \n\n* **This is sensitive subject TO riot ,so I am not counting on any riot post. Though it would be nice to know if one rioter cares. Just one. Or the price manager. I hope you guys fix this soon. **\n\n**I am a 2010 player here. Guys please comment or atleast give me a thumbs up if you agree. I just think the ip prices and rp prices should be reworked again. It's been awhile. Thumbs up please if you agree. Have a good day everyone! **\n\nEdit: Might not be best on the dates of release ,but you get what I mean.\nEdit: More likes the more riot has to pay attention to this.

I understand this, to someone who plays a few games every few days, but for Me and the people I play with - and many others - we are on almost everyday. So getting IP is nothing. LoL has the better of the in game point/gold systems out of the mobas who do it. Meaning you'd get ip relatively fast. Sure maybe price drop - which they've been doing - at a fast pace, but other then that a complete drop in pricing is unneeded from my perspective.\n\nI agree with you ,but what about the new players. They either want to buy a new champion or spend money on runes. Yes us 2010 players have that problem. I am just saying like the really old champions that are from 2010 and 2013 should get a ip price drop. It takes tones of games to 4,800 ip. Even if you play 2 games a day. It will still take awhile. Also leona the support is 4,800 that is wrong. Support is already hard to do. They even said so with items. \n***Give me a like so this post gets up there! ***\n\nEDIT: Riot does care about the customers. I know they do. Mainly because they take a handful of customers service.

I am just thinking the should nerf the prices a little for the skins. Like I said before I made this post mainly because of 2010-2013 champions are still high prices like Galio and others. I did not name them all. Riot should just lower some champions prices. \n\n*  Yea people complain ,but they could still nerf some prices. \n\n*  I listed the champion prices to let people know 4,800 ip for a 2010 champion is high. You think it's normal for a champion 5 years old to be that old? Its not. I posted about the skins because riot promise they would not make the skins prices higher than 975+. I honestly don't care about the skins ,but I am sure other people do. I think. Than maybe riot should start adjusting 2010 champion prices and 2013. I did not name all the champions prices because it would of tooken to much time. It shocks me that this post confuses you. This post is basically to let riot know I am concern about 2010-2013 champions prices. i firmly believe The prices are out ragious for champions. I just named a couple of skins that are high for other people out there. So thats the reason I listed the champion prices. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChrisB5,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=IOreapLP,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2015-01-26T02:03:44.087+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, I think the prices are fine, and here's why:\n> \n> 1. The ultimate skins that are VERY overpriced are that way due to exclusivity.  How often do you see him in game?  Not very.  This makes the skin more enjoyable for those willing to dish out money even if it was cheaper.  The silliness of this is by pricing it higher, the item's value is higher, allowing them to price it higher.  So by pricing it higher they can price it higher :P Now I own the Udyr skin!  Why?  I got it on release.  Would I like it to be lowered and have a partial refund in return?  No.  Well I bought it on release at a sale price, and I love that it's exclusive but not too exclusive (it sold like crazy!).\n> \n> 2. Now let's talk IP.  I own all by about 25 champions.  I have all champions less than 4,800IP except ONE, and some that are 4,800 or higher.  So why don't I want them to reduce the IP prices?  It gives me a reason to earn IP.  I still have so many runes to unlock, and have to only unlock the ones I want for my main champs.  I like working to unlock the champs I own, not too fast but not too slow.  They also have plenty of weekly sales and free champ rotations, making up for the higher prices.  I see nothing wrong with the structure, but that's just my opinion.\n> \n> 3. OKAY, so here's what I feel we SHOULD be talking about.  Legacy skins.  Riot keeps removing them from the Vault.  I am not ashamed to admit I bought the legacy vault package in 2014 (I think it was), including Kitty kat Katarina after she was said to be permanently locked up.  To the original users, they got a special pre-game border on the splash art.  Fancy.  There was a lot of outrage, and rightly so.  On top of it all, we see winter time Riot keeps re-releasing what was supposed to be a one time skin release (unless I am wrong, I could be about the winter promotional skins from past years).  This, we need to address.  This is greedy.  As for IP prices?  This is stuff you can earn for free, or buy early optionally.  Skins are buy only.\n> \n> Anyways, just my two cents (or couple hundred dollars if we're.... oh fuck, on a free game?  Dammit, why do I do this to myself).\n\n\n1.** I guess I shouldn't put the skins on this thread. I honestly don't care about the skins. I guess I have to remake a post about the champion prices.** I repeat I don't care about the skins and sorry for bad grammar.\n\n 2. Cool. I own like every rune in tier 3 and I don't own as much champions as you. So me and you are reversed. I have so many runes and you have so many champions. The main problem I have is that 2010 champions are still high price. Same with 2011 and 2012. Three years. Now if riot did lower the prices for ip they could just lower it by 500 for every 2010 champion. You said you had tones of champions. I have tones of runes. That is the main difference.  The least they can do is lower supports prices. \nYes riot is doing a great job! 2010 player and I believe this game is probably the best game I have ever played. **I mainly disagree with old champions being 4,800 ip. **\n\n***UPDATE: Sorry for horrible grammar. ***\n\n**UPDATE: Sorry if grammar is horribler once again.

There are some people maxing out ,but there are also more and more new people coming out. Riot can't control that ,but looking at 2010-2013 champions price ranges it is high. New people have to make a decision of runes or champions. I personally smurf have smurfed before.  To get a champion that cost 48000 you have to play atleast 40 games. Assuming you don't have a ip boost. 20-40 games. I suck at math you can correct me if I am wrong ,but I only have time for like 1-2 games a day ,but I see your point. \n\nWhat about the new people? 2015 players and 2014? I am a 2010 player so yea.

If like you said u only play 1-2 games a day that means that you are getting your 4800 for a new champion every ~30 days and since riot usually takes ~50 days to produce a champion then you are still gaining more ip faster than riot is producing their content. Especially since the total price of the champion pool only goes up by a maximum of 4800 ip per champion release and a minimum of 3000.\n\nPeople that are new to the game have access to tons of cheap content that can easily bring them into the game with quality champions. There are now 32 champions in the 6300 pricing pool and it used to be the largest pricing pool in league of legends. However, when Gnar was released 4800 because the pricing pool with the largest number of champions in it, and slowly the other pools will catch up to  it as well and even overtake the 6300 pricing pool. We know this because the total number of 6300 champions will never exceed 32 since every time they add one champion to the pool they reduce the price of another champion in that same pool to the lower tiers. every third release they even reduce the pricing of TWO champions to make things even cheaper for people. So i do not feel bad for the people that are new to the game when they actually have it rather sweet compared to how the older users had it. Riot used to NEVER do pricing reductions and so we spent all our ip on all these expensive champions that are now dirt cheap.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-01-26T02:06:27.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH that sounded like someone writing an essay the day before it was due.

I did not name all the champions prices because it would of tooken to much time. It shocks me that this post confuses you. This post is basically to let riot know I am concern about 2010-2013 champions prices. i firmly believe The prices are out ragious for champions. I just named a couple of skins that are high for other people out there. So thats the reason I listed the champion prices.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-01-26T03:19:27.309+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who has been playing this game for a long time, i dont think they should raise it, at least to the points of this thread! nothing against you TC, but it just doesnt seem right.

Now if riot did lower the prices for ip they could just lower it by 500 for every 2010 champion. You said you had tones of champions. I have tones of runes. That is the main difference.

Riot already reduces prices of older champions EVERY time they release a new champion. They reduce the price of the oldest 6300 champion to the 4800 pool which drops the price by 1500 ip. This in turn means that the total cost of all the champions in leave only goes up by 4800 every time a new champion is released instead of 6300. Not to mention every time Riot releases a third champion they in turn reduce 2 older champions prices, one from the 6300 tier and one from 4800 or less tier. which means that along with the 1500 price reduction on the 6300 champions they are reducing the total price of overall champions by another 900 for 1350 -> 450, 1800 for 3150 -> 1350, or another 1650 for 4800 -> 3150. That brings the total overall cost of champions being increased by either 3900 for the 450 change, 3000 for the 3150 change and 3150 for the 4800 change.\n\nSo with all that in mind I have no idea how you can make these claims that they do not care and that they do not reduce the prices of their champions when they clearly do. Especially since their total champion pool cost is not going up by all that great of an amount. You comment about new players starting up in league but when the new champions are being produced at 6300 the people it actually only hurts are the long standing players while the people that are freshly starting are actually getting a better deal since they will be able to make use of the price reductions that riot does every champion release unlike an older player who may already own the champion and thus would be unable to make use of the new pricing of the champion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XVI Jake IVX","date":"2015-01-25T21:40:44.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Edit: Might not be best on the dates of release ,but you get what I mean.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AvariceSyn","date":"2015-01-26T08:10:02.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to point out that League of Legends is actually one of the cheapest free to play and microtransaction games, period.

Either you haven't been playing as long as you claim, or you haven't been keeping up to date with the news.
