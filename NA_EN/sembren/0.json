We have many players who are playing normally on many ISPs all over the world and traffic to most of the large ISPs in the USA is via private connections that have plenty of headroom on them. A good way to spot congestion is when your ping is spiking and you have packet loss in-game. Unfortunately if the congestion is in the local access between your ISPs head office and your home, there is not a whole lot that can be done and the burden falls on the ISP to either upgrade these local segments or migrate connections to new ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-12-29T00:21:52.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friends have reported that they weren't experiencing lag in Guild Wars 2 and HoTS.
