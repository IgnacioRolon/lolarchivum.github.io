The story is the same each time, as I start the game fine and maybe 12-20 minutes in it triggers and I lag so poorly that I disconnect. This keeps happening and I am genuinely scared to play ranked. Has anyone else experienced this and has anyone found a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-06T01:40:44.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a little odd that your lag spikes are always starting around the 12-20 minute mark. A few different things start happening around those times, like Rift Herald and later on Baron. This kind of makes me think that maybe those game files specifically are starting those lag spikes. \n\nLet's try using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a quick force repatch to see if that fixes things up. If that doesn't seem to help too much, hit me back up and we can dig a little deeper!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaisume","date":"2017-05-06T01:16:37.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! This has been happening to me since I updated to the new patch. I can barely last hit, etc. I haven't been in any game in the past few days because I'm terrified I'll disconnect. (I did play one Kindred game a few days ago and got Bugsplat for like three times until I restarted my laptop and the issue persisted) Rito pls fix.","replies":[]}]}
