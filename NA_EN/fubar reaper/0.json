I think Riot should take context into consideration and write more of what your personal ban is about and not the same thing every time. If there is a ban appeal section please direct me to it Riot cause I don&#039;t know where it is. Here is the text on why I was banned and want to see what people think about it and if I can possibly get unbanned by Riot.

As of now, they chat-ban you, give you a 14-day ban as a last chance, then perma-ban you if you can't clean up your act after the 14-day. \n\nThe \"kys\" might have escalated you even if you haven't had a 14-day ban.
