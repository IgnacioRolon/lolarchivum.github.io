He was the leader of the Kinkou, who was noted for his complete emotionlessness regarding tactical decisions. This was put to the test by torturing and killing Shen's father in front of him, while he did not react. \n\nWith Zed's lore, it was said that Zed killed Shen's father(also Shen and Zed's former master and former leader of the kinkou). Zed also already defeated Shen with his forbbiden lore, and all evidence shows he's only gotten stronger from that point. \n\nSo I would say Zed barring further information regarding Shen's current status in the lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Panwar","date":"2015-07-09T19:20:56.556+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it's important to note that Zed isn't necessarily the total bad guy, and Shen isn't necessarily the absolute good guy. The Kinkou is an order based upon upholding their idea of balance, and they employ assassin's to that end. While they may do works of good, they also are killers who put people to death to uphold their own ideological view. \n\nAnd Zed while being focused on power and obviously a killer, also seems to be somewhat of an egalitarian and one who believes in the chasing of knowledge as opposed to the hoarding and banning of it.  Also he comes to his hate of the Kinkou pretty honestly considering he was treated pretty unfairly by them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"arc95","date":"2015-07-09T19:39:51.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed doesn't kill Shen's father in the lore he just kills the Master.","replies":[{"poster":"Panwar","date":"2015-07-09T20:12:04.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"An orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master.
