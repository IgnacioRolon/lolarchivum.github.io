He spent many of his teenage and young adult days chasing down artifacts and traveling the world with his best friend in all of life, Farndam, and on several occasions met up with the legendary Explorer Ezreal{{champion:81}} . The Duo joined forces on treasure hunt in a lost tomb buried under the sands of Shurima and found an artifact of curious power. A whip of an ancient Shuriman Lord. But when they went to grab it they found that it was booby trapped and sounded a call to summon the dreaded monster Rek'Sia{{champion:421}} .  They fled for their life with the whip, both Ezreal and Argon made it out, but Rek'Sia collapsed the tomb before his friend Farndam could escape. Ezreal helped Argon return to Piltover before leaving. Torn with anger at his loss he took the whip to be studied by some of the great minds in Piltover. It wasn't long before the weapon was discovered to have one of the powerful hextech crystals inside of it.  The leaders of the clan studying the artifact made an attempt to confiscate the weapon from Argon, who discovered their plan and fled Piltover with it. With no where to go to he took to the road again, mastering the whip and learning all of its ways. The ancient weapon had a the ability to change from a physical weapon of destruction or turn into a magical tool for helping those around him. So fueled by a desire for revenge on the evil that took his friend from him and an internal striving for good he learned to use the whip to bring evil to bear and help those who evil had harmed. He found himself in Ionia shortly after learning the full strength of the whip. The name he gained for himself caught the attention of the great master Shen who marveled over the weapon and Argon's ability to wield it. Shen offered him a position and a place to stay in his clan. Argon was considering it until one night when he received a letter from Ezreal{{champion:81}}  regarding something he was looking into. With his wanderlust peaked again, Argon declined shen's offer and left to continue to explore the world, and one day return to the sands of Shurima to exact revenge on the monster that killed his friend.\n______________________________________\nBase Stats:\n\nHp:560(+90 per level)                                         Health Regen: 5.5 (+.52per level)\n\nAttack:52(+3 per level)                                        Armor: 25 (+3.5 per level)\n\nAttack speed: .625 (+2.8% per level)                 Magic Resist: 31.5 (.72 per level)\n\nMove speed: 335                                                  \n_________________________________________________________________________________________\nSkills and abilities:\n____________________________________________________________________________________________--\n\nPassive:  Argon's whip has two different forms, one of fully flexible unbreakable chain-links smaller than the naked eye can see. and another of pure magical energy. When it is in Physical form it deals attack damage on hit, and when it is in magic form it deals damage based on 100% AP score. When it changes form to physical, the first attack slows 50% for 1s, and the first attack after it changes to magic it heals Argon for half of the damage dealt.\n________________________________________________________________________\nHis Q: When his whip is in physical form it lashes out and strikes the first enemy hit, whether minion or hero, -- if it strikes the hero it deals a small amount of damage per second based on total hp and the enemy is slowed for as long as he is in range of the attack. -- If the attack hits a minion or jungle monster the whip pulls the monster close and when the spell is recast if can thrown the creature to deal damage in an area burst knocking up enemies hit. While in Magic form the whip can be launched and attached to an ally, increasing his move speed and increasing his AD/AP. While either whip is attached to a target Argon cannot attack. Can be Recast to disconnect.\nCD:(upon release) 16/14/12/10/8 seconds\nDamage=10/25/40/55/80 dps plus  5/6/7/8/10% enemies current health, Slow 20/23/25/27/30%\nMinion: Radios of burst, 400, deals 100/130/170/220/240 (+60%AD) as well as 1s knockup\nAlly:Speed boost (same as slow) and damage increase by 20/25/30/35/40%\n________________________________________________________________________\nW: Toggle: Toggle between magic whip and physical whip.
