Though 14 is underestimation (and this the memes and games page so whatever) the only reason to have 1 person to man those electronic cash registers is to confirm age requirements are met with certain items.","replies":[{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-01-14T22:42:49.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iamthegoatofwar,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=g8qd7yvg,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-01-14T20:38:35.318+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;re moving onto electronic cash registers now to try and save even more money from having to pay people.

Instead of just scanning your items, paying, and moving on with your life, the system is filled with aggravating voice prompts and weird mechanisms (to catch shoplifters, maybe?), like a scale (I assume) in the \"bagging area.\" Every time I try to use those things it's \"HAVE YOU SCANNED YOUR CLUB CARD?\" and \"PLEASE PLACE YOUR ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA\" and then \"UNEXPECTED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA\" followed inevitably by \"PLEASE WAIT FOR ASSISTANCE\" good Lord they are so awful. I would 100% rather have a trusted, trained employee check my items. They don't have to deal with the \"bagging area\" nonsense, they know the codes for produce, they help with bagging, and I even get some basic human interaction.","replies":[{"poster":"MessyStuff","date":"2019-01-23T05:23:25.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?

If u work here for a long time, or studied it, it's disgusting how this trend continues and gets worse and worse. \n\nbig example now is that unskilled jobs are typically all \"part-time\" now even if you work 30+ hours a week, so that they don't have to pay benefits.\n\nbut the self checkouts are ubiquitous now in grocery stores, at least where I live (probably more so east/west coasts).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2019-01-15T00:41:27.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iamthegoatofwar,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=g8qd7yvg,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-01-14T20:38:35.318+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;re moving onto electronic cash registers now to try and save even more money from having to pay people.

Regardless, Walmart is the biggest employer in the south lol. This is just gonna exacerbate an income gap between the south and the north, and since schools are payed for by property taxes, this means that poorer areas will receive even less education, meaning that they are less likely to find work outside of entry level jobs. So much for bringing back jobs I guess? I'd understand if prices went down to compensate but people working walmart jobs won't have any income whatsoever if they cannot find another job, especially with all the competition at the bottom of the ladder.
