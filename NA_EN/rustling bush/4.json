He's not stunned/knocked up for the duration like his target is, so while his opponent is knocked up for the entire duration, as soon as the animation ends for HIM, he's able to GTFO or go in for a last hit. Think of it as him letting you fall on your face or go anime-style and you land on his sword.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xTheCaptainx","date":"2015-10-21T18:28:33.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's intended.
