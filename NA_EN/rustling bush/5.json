Singlehandedly carried the entire game (I was 2/2 lane phase). What did I do?\n\nI made all the shot calls. \n\nAfter every play I told my team exactly where to go, how to rotate between objectives, when to back. \n\nI buy pinks for every single baron and dragon.\n\nI spam ping when everyone needs to group.\n\nI tell them who to kill first, who to peel for me.\n\nYou need to learn how to shotcall, and what moves are the right moves to do (you know how after a teamfight ends, you might have 200hp? Do you B right away, or do you look for other stuff to take before you B?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"fdissht","date":"2014-11-01T14:34:21.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get 2-3 kills, afterwards just push your lane and roam to help your losing lanes (preferably bot).\n\nIf enemy tanks are the problem, the only solution is to try to suggestively lead the team. As in don't use a commanding tone like do this, do that, follow me, etc. Be like we should....or maybe we can.... because if you guys win early, and let the enemies who are built for late game get to late game, it's your teams fault. Push lanes, force fights, and ward up; do that and you should be able to force fights or push objectives.","replies":[]}]}
