She excels at dueling and chases, once she gets into a fight she wants to see it through without backing down.\n\n**Passive:** When Neptune kills an enemy unit she gains 3 HP/1 Mana and a share stack, doubled for large minions/monsters and champion kills/assists.\n\n**Q: Active:** Neptune jumps on an enemy bashing them with her giant sword and slowing them for a moderate duration.  Does damage equal to her current AD + extra base damage and some of her AP.  Applies on-hit.\n**Q: Passive:** Cooldown is reduced each time Neptune performs an auto-attack.\n\n**W: Active:** Neptune braces herself for the prolonged fight, healing some of her missing HP.  Scales a high amount of AP.\n**W: Passive:** Neptune gains confidence from her allies, increasing her base stats slightly for each nearby ally.  Cooldown of active is reduced each time Neptune takes damage.\n\n**E: Active:** Neptune swings her giant sword 180 degrees damaging, slowing and knocking-back enemies to the edge of her attack range.  Scales bonus AD and slight AP.\n\n**R: First Active:** Neptune reverts to Purple Heart, her adult-like goddess form gaining bonus attack speed, movement speed and attack range.  She also gains bonus MaxHP, MaxMana, AD, AP, Armor and MR based on a percent of her shares stacks.\n**R: Second Active:** After performing a number of auto-attacks while in HDD form, Neptune can re-active R a single time to dash around the battlefield dealing damage to each enemy hit once.  Scales moderately both AD/AP.\n**R: Passive:** Maintaining HDD requires mana/second and while in this form, a % of the damage Neptune does is returned as mana.  Neptune will assume Human form when she runs out of enough mana to maintain HDD or doesn't perform an attack for 6 seconds.\n\nAfter-notes: She's a heavy snowball champ with a moderately safe lane-phase thanks to increased sustain and high range.  She's rewarded for getting ahead in lane with slightly higher stats late-game in HDD and normal farming patterns.  The bonuses remain small enough and her aggressive and team-oriented kit deter the pattern of AFK-farming.  Her basic abilities are strong enough that she can still remain an asset while behind by sticking with her team.  Despite a lack of strong escape mechanics, the Jax-like hyper carry she gets when winning is split-bush viable as she'll be strong enough to solo 2 or 3 enemies alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-10T01:09:18.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna strike while the iron is still hot and keep this train rolling.

Killing a unit grants her a share stack, doubled against large minions/monsters and champion kills/assists.\n\n**Q: Active: Human Form:**  Blanc slams her massive maul into the ground damaging and stunning enemies around her.\n**Q: Active: HDD Mode:**  Blanc swings her Great-axe around stunning enemies and shredding a % of their armor.
