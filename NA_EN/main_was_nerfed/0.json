{"poster":"Main Was Nerfed","date":"2015-01-16T03:48:32.844+0000","title":"OP Champ List coming into S5.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":24,"down_votes":12,"body":"We'll define OP as the ability to outplay with little counterplay. This can be accomplished through having mobility, invulnerability, waveclear, high scalings, point and click damage, or point and click hard CC.\n8.5/10{{champion:105}} Needs no explanation. One of the most hated champs in the game.\n\n7/10{{champion:238}} High mobility, only counterplay is QSS (MR item against an AD Mid) or Zhonyas. Not quite on the bandwagon of him being too strong, but can conclude his damage is much too high for that much mobility, and also how well his kit synergizes with low cost items. Extremely safe and efficient to farm with. Uses energy. \n\n7/10 {{champion:84}} Very difficult to completely shut down. 3 flashes on low CD. High damage. Too much sustain with free stats.\n\n6.5/10{{champion:55}} Easy to shut down if you pick champs to do so. Tons of AoE damage. Easy to play, hard to outplay. \n\n8/10{{champion:127}} Point and click CC, high damage. Free Zhonya's. Annoying VO. \n\n7.5/10{{champion:254}} Guaranteed kill if she ganks with ULT. Much like WW, more mobility. Very strong pick in any comp.\n\n8/10{{champion:67}} Epitome of too much damage. Becomes best duelist in game after picking up a couple items. Repositions with invisibility. If terrain is around, prepared to have zero counterplay unless you can instantly burst her down. True % damage + Bork as a core item. The word tank means nothing to her.\n\n7/10{{champion:114}} If she gets ahead, your lane is over. She will ult and dive you under tower while taking zero damage. Then she will wreck your team and you will be blamed. Not on the top of my OP list, but the ability to become untargetable, do damage, and heal back up ( with zero counterplay unless you're AP with Zhonyas) isn't cool.\n\n8/10{{champion:9}} Nobody likes playing against a good Fiddlesticks. There's nothing like having him come in and ult your entire team while he uses Zhonya's and loses zero HP. His fear-> drain-> repeat is just annoying to play against. Point and click CC will never be fun. \n\n8/10{{champion:11}} No, Yi isn't always OP. He's in the same boat as Katarina. If they pick him early, you can pick a team comp to stop him. But if you don't have enough CC, you aren't going to win against a good YI. He can become untargetable and wipe out your entire team if he gets a few early kills. He's a menace and anti-fun to play against.  Becomes top-tier split pusher on the off chance the other team countered you. Good luck stopping him without sending two of the strongest members on your team.\n\n8/10 {{champion:134}} You can dodge all her stuns, but when she hits one, you're dead. She has way too much harass and is completely anti-fun to play against. I personally would disagree with even having her AoE stun as someone's ult.. much less as a spammable ability. \n\n8/10 {{champion:59}} Good mobility. Game changing ult. Synergizes with most comps (especially AoE comps) Does high damage while being built as mostly tank. Snowballs very hard for a jungler.\n\n6/10 {{champion:64}} Guess I'm crazy, I don't mind playing against him. He is annoying, but I guess I've seen him so many times that he doesn't bother me anymore. His mobility is considered the best in league, but he does require some skill to perfect. \n\n8/10 {{champion:90}} Highly underrated. Tank shredder. Point and click massive damage. I've even found myself accidentally killing enemies while farming with E. Ult has zero counterplay early. Lacks mobility, but his waveclear makes that negligible. \n\n7.5/10 {{champion:412}} A lot like Lee Sin.. Has an overloaded kit and will be viable no matter what as a support. One of the most frustrating support champs to play against. Not talked about a lot because he isn't usually the one killing you, but a good Thresh can guarantee kills and safety in almost any matchup.\n\n9/10 {{champion:421}} Screw this champ. Mobility. Damage. Resourceless. I don't even know how this one got released. Zero counterplay ganks unless you want to spend half your gold on wards to get every nook and cranny of your side of the map. If Rek is camping you, just hope your other lanes are winning because you aren't leaving the turret. \n\nAnd even after all that, I think every champ on this list is balanced by a hundred other reasons. Stop complaining. Ban them, pick them, but stop asking Riot to nerf them. Lets get the rest of the champions in line with these instead of making these less fun to play. But really, fk Rek'Sai and Fizz mains.","replies":[{"poster":"DanofDemacia","date":"2015-01-16T05:02:38.095+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"I agree with all of the champs you put up but you forgot the biggest offender.

Fiora is weird, she either is 10/10 OP or 0/10 useless to your team, personally i think that while her ult doesnt allow you to hurt her doesnt mean there is no counterplay to it. Going invisible makes her stop dealing damage, flashing under your turret, she is still effected by ignite and AoE spells so ignite her before she ults so she gets minimal lifestea off of it, build a ton of armor. Also casters do well against her since her W cant parry abilities, so people like Darius do well against her. The only time she gets ahead is if you let her by not playing safe and calling for ganks.  \n\nMalzahar... there is actually a lot of counterplay to him, if you have any form of long range or instant gap closer CC other then a root or slow you can cancel his ult even if he casts his first. Played against a Cass who never used her ult until she saw me ulting, there is a decent windup so anyone who knows what to look for can easily counter it. It also seems that QSS, Olaf, and Gangplank (i think Vi can too) can remove the ult completely, even the damage, Shyvana can still dragon form while being ulted which will still move her the full distance. Let him push with his E then call for gank, he has no mobility and can only ult one person. He has high mana costs so if you make him use his abilities a lot he will either be forced to push the wave or go back. Another trick is, if you have a good amount of MR, let his E bounce to you instead of minions then just run back until its over, he gets no mana back and when maxed his E costs like 120 mana. Watch out for his W (the pool), his ult only deals decent damage so if he wants to kill you (specially if you are a tank) he will throw down his W, make sure you get the hell out of there as quick as you can. He is difficult to fight against if you have no clue how to fight him, once you know what to look for and what to do he is very easy to beat. QSS removes both his ult and his E so its a great counter item if you are AD.  \n\nAlso i think Rek'Sai should be a 10/10, even with the nerfs to her damage, she still deals insane damage very quickly with no counterplay. Should an engage not go her way he can just burrow under a wall forcing you to flash or give up, which makes her ganks and escape 90% effective. You can ward the river if you want but she will just come from behind you from you turret through the wall and there isnt much you can do because she just knocked you up spun 3 times then bit you for half your life in True Damage. Oh you by some miracle + skill you are winning? OH! nvm she escaped healed and came back now you are dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Was Nerfed","date":"2015-01-16T21:44:59.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, 10/10 isn't in the meta right now IMO... In the past 4 seasons, yeah, there have been cases where champs were 10's, but right now, not even Rek'Sai is there IMO.\n\nMalz has defined strengths and weaknesses, and knowing how to fight him is definitely most of the battle.. I regret putting him on the list at all, because I knew I would receive comments calling me crazy... I just think he's a very very strong underrated pick that if he were played more, he would probably be nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephenizgod","date":"2015-01-16T22:45:24.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True i just hate Rek a lot, people complain about Lee Sin and they make a champion who can do everything he can just not as good. Its not the level at which Lee does it that is annoying, its the fact he can do it all and the same problem is in Rek'Sai.  \n\nIm not criticizing you for putting Malz up there, even though i disagree. Im just trying to counter-argue that Malz is only OP when your opponent has no knowledge on how to handle you. We all have our own opinions on things, and i do believe that Malz is going to get a nerf soon, even though i think he needs several QoL buffs (nothing too major but he has some inconsistencies and bugs that go against what Riot says about gameplay).  \n\nThe problem with nerfing Malz is he was out of the spotlight for so long and now that all the people who shut him down are being nerfed and he is a solid pick against Zed, he is seeing more play. He has always been a strong champ, when i started maining him people would tell me not to pick him, then i would destroy lane and people would say \"Malz is just op\" lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ReginaFreedom","date":"2015-01-16T04:39:53.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with a lot of your list.
