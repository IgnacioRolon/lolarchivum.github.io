Humans would look like stupid warmongers to me.  I would either wait for them to destroy themselves and then take over Earth or I would destroy the majority of them and keep a small amount for experiments and what not.\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand how anyone could think we are all alone.  I mean the universe is huge.  How the hell can we be the only things out there. And the whole &quot;even if we did find them they would be micro organisms&quot; thing is kinda far out for me.  It just shows how self centered and cocky humanity is.  I believe we are very low on the totem pole. ;c\r\n\r\nIn another 500 years (if we make it that long) we will be laughing at the stuff we consider &#039;fact&#039; just like we do at the people that thought the world was flat or thought the sun revolved around the earth.\r\n\r\nSometimes I think that religion is just different alien species trying to fuck around with humanity. I mean, who wouldn&#039;t want to play god? (Not a religion thread just a thought)\r\n\r\nThis has all come from me playing The Sims soz.\r\n\r\nQue X Files music!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAAlDoAtV7Y","replies":[]}
