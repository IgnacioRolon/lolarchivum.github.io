Time for another gifting thread, it's been awhile. \n\n**This event will be running from Oct. 28 - Nov. 2, 7pm EST!!!**\n\nSince it's my favorite time of the year I thought I'd be nice and do another giveaway.  The first 50 people that upload a picture of themselves in costume will be gifted a 975 Mystery Skin.  I will also be picking out 3 people to give a special prize for having the best costumes.\n\nGift Chart:\n\nFirst 50 w/costume: One 975 Mystery Skin\n1st Best Dressed: $100 RP\n2nd Best Dressed: $50 RP\n3rd Best Dressed: $25 RP\n\n\nOK so, here is how it works.\n\n**NOTE: USE IMGUR or another site to upload your pics.**  \n\n1) **Write on a piece of paper \"Gifting Fairy\", this MUST be in the picture.**  This is just to ensure you aren't stealing someone else's pictures to get a gift.\n\n2) Upload a picture of yourself dressed up for Halloween **with the paper** to this thread.  This costume can be bought or made, doesn't matter but it MUST be you. **And a real costume, not a blanket over your head.  This also goes for just wearing cat ears or a halo.  You need to be dressed up**. xD\n\n3) Wait for me to add you to my friends list.** I have to wait 24 hours before I can send the gifts out and I can only send 10 gifts per day so be patient.** c;\n\nI hope you guys enjoy this event and have fun this Halloween.  Also, I'll be late on gifting Saturday since it's Halloween.  I expect most people will be posting the picture the day of Halloween or after, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up! \n\nOh and for anyone doubting if this is legit or not, here is a past post on my other event.  This is 100% legit.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/memes/qX8TAXgh-the-gifting-fairy-new-thread","replies":[{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-10-28T19:01:13.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If my costume is really poor quality but i try really hard will i still be considered?\n\n\n:(","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Wake n Bake","date":"2015-10-28T19:10:26.388+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronSolariLeona,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=EkEqIAwE,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-10-28T19:01:13.659+0000)\n>\n> If my costume is really poor quality but i try really hard will i still be considered?\n> \n> \n> :(\n\nHmm here is an example I guess:\n\nNO!!

I will definitely keep coming back from time to time to see the posts people put up. I will not be running for this contest since I am in college and have no costumes with me at campus, but I enjoy it all the same. What a good idea! \n\nThanks again Honeycute!
