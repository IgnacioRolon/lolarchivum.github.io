Since its that time of year I&#039;m here to grant my fellow league players a little happiness.  I&#039;ll be giving away 10 skins randomly everyday for the next 5 days. So that&#039;s 50 skins in all.** Event days are 12/17-12/21.** Here are the rules.\n\n**RULES:**\n\n1) Post on this thread for a skin you REALLY want.  **This skin has to be for a champion that you actually play a decent amount.**  I WILL CHECK YOUR MOST PLAYED CHAMPIONS. For example, If your a Lux main please don&#039;t ask for Omega Squad Teemo.  I&#039;ll just ignore the request and give it to someone that actually plays Teemo.  {{champion:17}} \n\n2) **ONLY POST ONE TIME FOR A SKIN REQUEST! **I will shuffle your name everyday for the 5 days.  So say if you post on day 1, you will have a chance to win the skin you requested Day 1-5.  If I see your posting everyday for a skin request, I&#039;ll just disqualify you. xD\n\n3) Wait to see if you won, **I&#039;ll update the list everyday between 8-9pm EST.**  I&#039;ll send you a friend request in game, just accept it and after 24 hours I&#039;ll send the gift.  And I&#039;m human and have a life (not really) so sometimes I won&#039;t be able to send it out EXACTLY when the 24 hour mark ends so just be patient with me.  If its been more than 2 days after you won just message me in game, I&#039;m somewhat forgetful!\n\n4) I will give a grace period of 3 days for the winners to accept my friend request in game. If after that they still haven&#039;t I&#039;ll give the gift to someone else.\n\n5) **Please don&#039;t try to add me in game.  I&#039;ll add you if you won**.  \n\nAlright guys, have fun and good luck!
