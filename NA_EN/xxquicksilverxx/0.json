They keep breaking and dropping and then the lower priority queue does not hold and restarts. You guys really need to get your shit together ... because this is a horrible experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T02:23:08.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find a recorded issue with the servers. Please note that low-priority queues cannot be placed on your account until a **consistent trend of disconnections* has happened on your account.\n\nMost connection issues are caused by local misconfigurations that really don't play well with League. Our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) is a *fantastic resource* for common solutions for this problem. I'd strongly recommend giving all the included steps a try.\n\nLet me know if you continue to experience disconnections after taking those steps.","replies":[]}]}
