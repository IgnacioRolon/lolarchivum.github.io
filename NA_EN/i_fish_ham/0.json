When I got onto the account it brought me to the beginner page area (where it tells you to create a summoner name, etc.), so I assumed that my account got reset.\n\nBut then when I search up my old summoner name the account still shows up and exists.. what do I do?","replies":[{"poster":"I Fish Ham","date":"2016-10-13T18:57:54.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was able to retrieve my account based off of many questions that I had to answer via email!

I only made two accounts ever though :/  Just this one and my old one.  D:\n\nBut then here's another interesting thing, even though I can search up my summoner name, I can't add that account... it's weird.  I sent a ticket though, hopefully it'll work out. The only big problem though is that since the account was from about 4 years ago, I don't really remember much about it  :(","replies":[]}]}]}
