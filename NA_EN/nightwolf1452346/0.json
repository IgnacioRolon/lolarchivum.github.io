The new client looks pretty good. I do have a couple questions about re-sizing the client.\r\n\r\nAre the devs considering between adaptive or responsive design (or both)?\r\n\r\nThe client right now is adaptive design (the client can be resized into pre-defined sized for certain window resolutions), and requires the players hunt for the settings a bit (going into settings -&gt; general -&gt; windows size). Responsive design would allow the players resize the window to whatever ratio/size they want (but probably a bit harder to implement).\r\n\r\nAnother thing: the old client lets the players resize by dragging the edge of the window, and the new client doesn&#039;t let me do that (at least I can&#039;t get it to work). If I can change the window sized by dragging the edge of the window, it would make changing sizes easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-21T23:36:33.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full screen mode is not in the roadmap. Supporting all the different aspect ratios and resolutions around the world is something we have not made plans for.\n\nDragging one corner to change the screen size is not something we have looked into, I'll brought it up with the team.","replies":[{"poster":"NightWolf1452346","date":"2016-10-22T01:10:11.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the comment!\n\nI figured responsive resize to accommodate all sizes under the sun may not be on the radar, but if resizing by dragging a corner can be added, that would be cool.\n\nAlso, while you are here, has the team discussed any possibility to alter in-game setting (keybinds, video & audio setting, etc.) with the client (without needing to get into a game)?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-22T01:17:39.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it has come up; only casual conversations at the moment, nothing planned though.
