How many minutes do I have to wait in between clicks? All it says is \"Unable to connect to the login queue. Check the server status here If it looks good, follow the guide here.\"  The only errors on the server page state that it's ranked queues that are down. So why can't we log in and play unranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-07T20:17:22.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for being patient with this and give it those few moments.  Login issues escalated a bit and most players were unable to login during maintenance today.
