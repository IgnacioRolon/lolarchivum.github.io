I see there&#039;s a new champ since then.  What&#039;s he like?  He seemed really cool and what not in the champion spotlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs lee sin still good?  I haev heard he isn&#039;t picked very much anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-04-02T18:03:23.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can literally play whatever you want dude\n\nExcept for about 10 different champions who are actually weak, everything is viable.\n\nI wouldnt look to these boards for who is good, they dont really know lol\n\nAs for who is weak atm due to bad numbers,\n\n{{champion:26}}  {{champion:21}}  {{champion:28}} {{champion:60}}  {{champion:121}}\n\n {{champion:56}} (???) (He was buffed, but I have not seen one yet. He needs some more help I think)\n\n{{champion:45}} (This may change very soon) \n\n**Someone will let me know If I forgot someone, Hopefully I dont get too many people calling perfectly fine champions bad**\n\n\nThere are some who are weak right now, BUT, they are getting buffs next patch which SHOULD make them ok. For example, {{champion:122}}  is getting his full reset back at rank 3, and a scaling mana refund if he executes an enemy with R 25/50/100\n\nPeople will try to dispute this, but the statistics, and general game experience, will show otherwise.\n\nTanks are Viable now. Assassins are still good, but arent an instawin. Mages can actually compete due to Athenes buffs and new itemization. \n\nTop is strange, seems to be where you shove whatever your team needs, which is fine imo, due to the new jungle item giving tanks a place.\n\nOverall, game is in a very good spot. Champion diversity is the best it has been in a long time, and LCS is having more picks than we have ever seen ({{champion:31}}  being picked as a counterpick against {{champion:6}} , I shit you not)\n\nShits great m8\n\nWill be amazing once those weaker champions get buffs, some of the old champs get their reworks {{champion:78}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:114}} , and adc's get new itemization (That shit is stale)\n\nAs for who is confirmed to be getting reworked this year.... \"Of those listed, these are actually currently being worked on: \n-Poppy\n-Ryze\n-Fiora\n-Gangplank\n-Taric\n~~-Urgot ~~\n\nI crossed out urgot due to him recently becoming a very good counterpick to some assassins mid due to buffs to his W. Riot might keep him around, because he provides something this game really needed.... A 100% counter to {{champion:238}} {{champion:76}}   and {{champion:55}} (People cry really hard about these champions still, although with urgot's resurgence, and recent nerfs, they really shouldnt anymore lol)\n\nAlso, the best part is the new jungle, which does not revolve around {{champion:64}} anymore. Almost all junglers are viable, except for the 4 on my list above (Those poor souls). Expect them to be buffed.\n\nCheck http://www.surrenderat20.net/ for constant updates.\n\nWelcome back!","replies":[{"poster":"Koldheartedjsp","date":"2015-04-02T22:58:06.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great write up!

Occasional Fiddlesticks, who's still good.\n\nBot lane is traditional adc and support. Support tends to go on roam a bit more now, depending on the lanes.\n\nMid lane is assassins and mages still. They snowball, and delete the adc during teamfights with superior range and/or mobility.\n\nTop lane is admittedly a bit of a mess, with a bit of a \"anything goes\" sort of feel. It looks like a counter lane, where bruisers beat assassins, assassins beat squishies, and squishies beat the bruisers(?). Not quite sure there, but it looks like tanks have fallen out of favor in that lane (but I could be wrong).\n\nLane swapping is pretty popular at the moment, if you ask me. You win tower, you roam and help out. Except in Bronze ranked, though... Oh, and the jungle has smite buffs that's important for the jungler to strategize. Make sure you ask before you just take camps (the buffs are very important depending on the jungler and part of the game) and understand how minion tax works. Don't be afraid to call your jungler out if he taxes wrong (like going into your lane and taking cs for no reason; ass has to earn it by giving you a kill or burning the enemy's summoner spells!)\n\nExhaust is starting to come into favor in the mid lane, if only a little bit. Top lane seems to roam a lot nowadays instead of just split-pushing. Upgrade your warding trinket always, and buy wards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RussoRed","date":"2015-04-02T13:55:54.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"jungle is the only thing posibly playable riot has putt so much focucus on it everything else is now useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-04-02T11:28:47.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ranged tops have made top lane unplayable for tanks.\n\nGood thing the cinderhulk is AMAZING, so jg is the better lane anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"straight4free","date":"2015-04-02T10:18:14.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"New champion sucks don't worry about him, meta favors tanks now especially in the jungle.
