Champions have all been given such insanely high base damage that almsot every game i play now 4 of 5 champions are building one damage item then going pure tank because theres NOTHING you can do about it.  I am so sick of seeing tank assassins, or overly tanky fighters, hell, even tanky ADC&#039;s like graves... Its not fair, its not fun.  Rito has allowed their own game to become so imbalanced it actually makes me not want to play anymore.\r\n\r\nTheres an easy fix to this issue too, thats the worst part.  Riot has already prelabeled every champion in game with a primary and secondary role, so, why not have that mean something?  Have all items in game have a base set of stats, example, 10 MR and 100 HP.  Then, have every single champion in game have their primary and secondary roles impact how those stats directly impact them.  \r\n\r\nSo, let&#039;s say i am an assassin/fighter.  So, as an assassin my weakness is that i am meant to be squishy and easy to kill if i screw up, so items that give MR/armour/HP should give REDUCED amounts of the base value, say... 15% for primary role, 10% for secondary.  So, im primary assassin, my 10MR 100HP item now gives me 8.5 MR and 85HP instead.  \r\n\r\nNow, let&#039;s take that same item and apply it to a tank, well its a MR/HP item, and tanks need those kinds of items, so it gives MORE then its base value for being used on its intended user, so say it adds 15% instead of removing it, so now it gives me 11.5 MR, and 115HP.\r\n\r\nFinally, what if the user is neither tank, nor assassin?  Well, the item jsut gives flat values, 10MR 100HP.\r\n\r\nBut wait, how woudl you balance every item in game?  Well, easy, rito looks at each item and decides who its best suited for, or who its meant to be used on, then labels it as such.  Or, write a line of code that determines what the items gives the most of (defense, offense, utility, etc), and apply that to the item, then determine which of those applies to each champion.  Braum is a support/tank, so he should gain more HP from tanky and utility items, while gaining less damage from damaging ones.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is jsut a simplified, base version of the idea, I&#039;m sure with a bit of work rito could refine the system, a system that allows off meta, or undesired builds to exist, but not be absolutely BS in game, like hypertank fizz, or tanky yas with 100% crit, or ADC&#039;s grabbing gage because it makes duels automatically fall in their favor... etc...","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-02-04T08:27:21.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What your talking about is years worth of work. Riot would have to halt numerous project to even begin to divert the man-power necessary to do something like this. What your talking about is a complete and utter overhaul of the entire itemization system of League. Not only that, your forcing Riot to pigeon-hole current and future champions. Why do you think there are classes, sub-classes, then champions who are a mix of sub-classes and classes? Leagues champions, in their present state are far to unique and varied to create a system like this. If something like this was ever implemented, it wouldn't be League anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-04T09:19:14.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still wouldn't balance the game, because it's basically impossible a game where everyone does something different.\n\nWhen they change stuff, people just research who does what they want better than everyone else and then there will be more balance complaints.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2017-02-04T11:17:43.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The alternative is to keep an horrendously unbalanced mess of a game, or nerf all items to the point of utter uselessness, remember when toplane smite sion was a thing?  Not a thign anymore becuase they nerfed the item allowing him ot be a thign becuase it allowed ANOTHER OP champion to dominate the game (sej), so thats the chocie... Either allow OP as fuck builds in game that unbalance everything, nerf those items casuing it to the point they become useless on the intended champions, or find a middle ground in which all items balance automatically to champions.  And hoenstly, that third option is easily the best given that the game code is already FUBAR, So why not put a team together and rebuild from the ground up, keeping what works, ditching what doesnt, and FIX THE GAME?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheFallenShaw","date":"2017-02-04T08:43:41.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not as easy of a fix as u seem to think. But they did do this with one stat and champion i know of. {{champion:412}} gets reduced AS gains. They did this so people wouldn't play adc thresh.

There was also botlane mord... Waveclear mages... etc... all getting item nerfs when the obvious answer is to BALANCE the items so they are less effective when used with unintended champions.","replies":[]}]}]}
