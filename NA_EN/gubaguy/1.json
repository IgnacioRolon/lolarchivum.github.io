And not only that, but SOME, but not all, auto based abilities ignore the rules of blind anyways.  for example, nasus&#039;s Q half ignore blind as his Q is consumed, but no damage is dealt.  meanwhile vaynes Q DOES do the damage is suppsoed to do, compeltley ignoring the blind.\r\n\r\nI think the &quot;blind&quot; mechanic shoudl be reworked into somethign more along the lines of anythign that requires a target will &quot;miss&quot; for the duration, since you have ot aim, and being blind means you cant see.  Meanwhile skillshots woudl still hit since they are essencially being thrown out in a general diretion without being targeted at anything specific.
