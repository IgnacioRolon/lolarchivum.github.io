No one has access to my PC, i live alone, so unless my cat hopped on while i was asleep no one used this PC.  (I also live in an electronically locked building, and keep my doors and windows locked, but i doubt anyone woudl break in to screw with my LoL account).  I recieved no email notifications that my password had been changed, and i quadruple checked to ensure i didnt mistype the password.  \r\n\r\nSince this occure di have gone ahead and used the email verification to change my password again to somethign more secure, but my question is... How the hell does this happen?  And how cna i see if anyrthigns been screwwed with in game?  I dont remember every skin ive ever purchased, or every champion, so i dont know if anyoens refudned items on me, i think im still in the US, but its hard ot tell since the last game i played everyone started speaking english then suddenly started typing in japanese or something.\r\n\r\nSo how is riot security so lax that someone somehow managed to change my password, and i didnt even get emailed about it?  FYI theres also no way they know my email password becuase the email assosiated with my LoL account has a diffrent name on it, and the rito site blocks people form seeing their own emails.  So they couldnt possibly know what mine waas without a ton of trial and error.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T21:05:34.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got your account pulled up just to be safe and make sure nobody has been messing with it without you realizing it. It looks like someone **was** able to log into your account whether they knew your password, they got it from a phishing attempt, or sometimes the hacker is able to access your email and use that to get the password reset. Regardless, we do take account security very seriously, and we do send e-mails out when, for example, passwords are changed. If you never got it, that means that the email on your account had been changed as well. \n\nIf you're still worried that someone could have changed your account like refunding champions or using RP, hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we'll be able to correct all that damage for you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Destroyah51","date":"2017-05-14T18:13:25.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you log into a fake LoL website or do those \"free rp/skin\" ads?","replies":[{"poster":"Gubaguy","date":"2017-05-15T03:43:17.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, i rarely ever log into THIS website for LoL, i only keep myself logged in for reasons like this, or to upvote things, otherwise i only ever log into the client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TiltoverEnforcer","date":"2017-05-14T22:56:15.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can look in your store history and see any refunds or purchases made in recent history ^_^","replies":[]}]}
