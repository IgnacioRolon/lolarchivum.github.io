All I can do I press play on the launcher (once). Any attempts to do the same after waiting for my game to launch unsuccessfully result in it saying Another instance of the league client is running, please close it and try again\". when trying to get onto league I'm left with that message and white screen where my client should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaja","date":"2016-11-17T21:03:01.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have found a solution and it's pretty easy, and please read the whole thing :) :\n\n1. Right click you LoL launcher and go to properties\n\n2. Press ''Open File Location''\n\n3. Find the file ''LeagueClient'' (It has a new ''L'' logo)\n\n4. Click on the file and you're done!\n\nI think Riot forgot to update LoLClient to a new one so It doesn't launch it. And you can't copy paste the Client to your desktop so you have to keep doing these steps until Riot fixes this. Hope it helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"turbotime7","date":"2016-11-17T04:33:41.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same issue.
