I muted her in chat but I didn't mute her pings because pings are mostly helpful even if he spams them sometimes. I got really frustrated at him because he would only flame, spam pings at me and my teammates, and he wouldn't play the game properly. If he's in my elo, he should be as good as me unless he was really good at coinflipping. He kept getting caught even when everyone pinged him back, and does not roam a single time. Since I have been getting afks, trolls, flamers, and inters in my past 10 games (i could only win about 6 because riots system just keeps on giving me those kind of players) I couldn't handle my good attitude and called him piece of shit and said kys then left (after game has ended). In game, because ahri was calling my jger trash and spamming pings on his chamption, I said if our jg is bad, you have to play better to make it up but ahri obviously kept flaming and spamming pings so I said just mute him and i muted him in chat. Now, I've never gotten banned before, but that just gave me a 2 week ban. I really don't think it is fair to give a 2 week ban for the first ever warning to a player who has never gotten banned before. I was trynna hit masters in a week or a month, but i guess I'll have to quit since 2 weeks of no playing is gonna decrease my skills and performance overall. Or, I could just keep playing but probably will die like 20 deaths every game because even if you report people with 20 deaths riot doesn't give them warnings or any bans.","replies":[{"poster":"FOR JUSTICE","date":"2019-07-30T06:50:55.588+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaehyuk Choi,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=p63XpVln,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-07-30T06:45:05.651+0000)\n>\n Or, I could just keep playing but probably will die like 20 deaths every game because even if you report people with 20 deaths riot doesn't give them warnings or any bans.\n\nthis is false, they most definitely will ban ya.\n\nalso thats because encouragements to self harm is hate speech, its not tolerated in any way, shape, or form, hence why even if its your first time its so severe.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaehyuk Choi","date":"2019-07-30T07:10:33.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"that's good to know that riot is doing some work on intentional feeders","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2019-07-30T12:51:48.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"They arent.

Everyone feeds sometimes, so banning their own players for it would be r%%%%%ed. So inters often get away with it. But many also do not get away with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-07-30T06:52:32.317+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I really don't think it is fair to give a 2 week ban for the first ever warning to a player who has never gotten banned before.\n\nYou told someone to kill themselves over a videogame.

The Instant Feedback Report is unreliable at best.

You should report inters, and the ones who feed are the ones who need the help. Inters dont care about advice. They are inting. You do know int is short for intentional right? Theyre doing it on purpose. Riot bans them, they dont ban you just for feeding.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-30T06:58:42.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> kys = 2 weeks?\n\nYes.\n\nAs your reform card said, your account is now on \"thin ice\": the next valid report on your account means a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaehyuk Choi","date":"2019-07-30T07:00:43.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"I believe after two weeks ban, it's a month and then perma?
