Specifically, with the Vietnam League servers, there's simply a *ton of distance* geologically that will affect what you're seeing and 200 to 300 sounds pretty reasonable considering how far away you are from the servers.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer support for the Vietnam servers since Riot doesn't operate that servers, Garena does. I recommend reaching out to [**Garena's Support**](http://intl.garena.com/support/) for more information or assistance with this.","replies":[]}]}
