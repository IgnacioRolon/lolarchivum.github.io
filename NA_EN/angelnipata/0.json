This made me think of whether OTPs were a good thing in league and if they were, where do they fit? I&#039;ve never been sure so I&#039;ll just state my case.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I&#039;ve never really been a fan of the whole notion of taking one champ and playing them like they were the only champ in the game. Me being a low elo support main, I have always held the idea that you should try to synergize with your team and make up for something your team lacks like engage or peel. I see OTPs, and I don&#039;t understand where they fit in. All the OTPs I have seen are the typical carry type OTP playing someone like Yas, Riven, or Vayne or they&#039;re the super meta resistant champions like thresh and lee sin, because they&#039;re complex kits stop riot from ever making any noticeable changes out of fear of accidentally gutting the champion or making them too strong in higher elos. I can understand where these champions fit in, but I never can understand why someone would pick into their counter or pick a champion who doesn&#039;t work with their team comp.\r\n\r\nOne the other hand, I have always believed that people should play what they want to play. I understand why a person would want to learn a champion to the extent that they know how to get the most out of the champion and I know that they try to use that knowledge to win, or at least not feed, against their counters. I feel like this is the main reason why people play carry-type champions or the meta resistant playmaker champions. I feel that they try to use their knowledge to make up for what their kit lacks through build paths and tactics.\r\n\r\nDespite understanding that some people like to master a champion and then proceed to carry, I&#039;ve never understood why having a handful of champions that you can play well for different situations is in any way inferior. It may be my personal bias shining through, but I&#039;ve always thought that flexibility and the ability to adjust to what your fighting with or against. Really, I just want to know what you guys think about the matter.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Where do OTPs fit in league? Is it better to have mastered one champion or be good at many?","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2016-11-19T03:53:57.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing for a lot of otp's, like myself, playing anything other than their main champ just isn't as fun/satisfying. \n\nSure, we might not win as much as we would if we meta-whored, but at the same time, we are just trying to win and have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"qQE2ABvLSX","date":"2016-11-19T18:29:07.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spicy Rice,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0ecJe7AF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-19T03:53:57.218+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m guessing for a lot of otp&#x27;s, like myself, playing anything other than their main champ just isn&#x27;t as fun/satisfying. \n> \n> Sure, we might not win as much as we would if we meta-whored, but at the same time, we are just trying to win and have fun.\n\nYou're not a OTP though looking at your opgg you play pretty much every champ.

Playing like 3-5 different champs is good, but I wouldn't be able to keep that many at my personal best. If another person could, then that would obviously be better objectively, but I cannot. \n\nCome to think of it, that would probably explain why my other champs are fairly simple, Amumu, annie, lux, sona. I guess its just preference and whats best for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seenan","date":"2016-11-19T09:43:31.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's people like Annie Bot and people like Imaqtpie.

Old Shen felt more like a tank than his rework, I could be wrong but it really felt that way. I played a good amount of Malzahar, Vel'Koz and Garen too. Vel'Koz was my number 1 mid laner but than again I feel that his mini rework was unnecessary In my opinion. \n\nSo I have 4 runepages for Nasus, both on different play styles. One is normal grasp stack q, the other is srs max e(quas build) and an armor/mr for both.\n\nPretty much no other champ stands out for me anymore so I just play Nasus. To me I find him super fun to play and has a simple kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anonagon","date":"2016-11-19T05:34:33.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in the past I would have argued against one-tricking, and would say it had no place in a team-oriented game where champion picks should be strategic choices\n\nbut the way queues are set up now almost exclusively promote being a one-trick, with at the most three backup champions\nbeing able to almost always secure the role you want to play completely negates the need to know more than a couple of champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-19T05:22:21.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never really been a fan of OTP, but that is largely because I know I would get bored of continually playing the same champion.\n\nI would probably recommend building a pool of champions for your preferred role, learning them well and picking whichever is most suitable or you feel like playing at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanctimonious","date":"2016-11-19T05:20:02.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Sorry for the long post, i rewrote this like four times. I'm still not happy with my english, but this isn't english class.)\n\n     One day, i didn’t just choose to be a one trick pony. It could be said the stars lined up perfectly and that it was destined for me to love this character so much. It’s not that i can’t play other champion’s, it’s really that i don’t enjoy them. I don’t want them, i want Kayle. Kayle represents a lot to me, and if anything ever happened to her i don’t think i would play this game anymore. To me, Kayle represents a lot. She represents a Friendship, a competitive grade champion, Right wing politics, and community. Over time, she has meant more to me and changed shape multiple times. \n\n     Let’s start with the friendship. In high school, i was a fairly nerdy fellow. I was lost, in multiple ways. I was never a communicative fellow. I’m introverted, a Nerd who always got too invested in one thing to allow for diversity. I grew up with a rather bittersweet distasteful view of society, that people were evil things and that they needed to be put in bound by something above them. I was never really shown kindness from society, so i didn’t show society kindness back. I never had much for friends in my head. Coincidentally, one day i was trying to test streaming because i wanted to test it out and in the chat box i seen the words “Eric?, Eric, is that you?” to which, i replied, “Yeah, it’s me man, who are you?” to which i realized that it was one of the newer sophomores to my school. He had also played kayle, and it was through him i started a friendship where we talked about Music, Video games, Electronics and such. Likely one of my only high school friends i still talk to. \n\n     The next year, i had became increasingly interested in Politics, Far-right philosophy, and the conservative movement in general. As a Canadian, it makes no sense that i would grow up to be an Individualist, but rather a collectivist. More of a Liberal Democrat in a sense, like my family. Well, most of my Family. I don’t know what my Grandma was, but she always had books laying around. “Politically incorrect bedtime stories,” a satirical book which i never read but later on i eventually looked up the words on my own. I learned of figures such as Vox Day, Stefan Molyneux, Milo Yiannopoulos,  Etc. To me, Kayle really seemed to be a representative of the American far right political spectrum. \n     Since i’ve climbed to high platinum on Kayle in season 5 (Bronze to high platinum), i decided to help people in the community with builds on her.Now instead of having one close friend, i have multiple aquaintences who love her. (Although, i don’t think they’ll ever love her as much as me.)\n\n     In a gameplay sense, she’s flexible and smites people with a fireblade. She protects her allies from the tyranny of others and those would do her harm. She’s a carry / support and embodies the same flexibility as the American constitution. It’s not whether she would fit into a team (She fits into every team composition.) but how the enemy can deal with her. When you understand her to a crisp in one role, the rules change completely in another. She has a lot of depth, and a lot of possible gameplay patterns. I think it’s possible to do this with several champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2016-11-20T00:40:05.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"OTPs have always been cancer because League at the end of the day is a team-game and team comp is incredibly important.
