The specialist in your ticket does have the most context regarding your situation, but feel free to respond back with your Ticket #, and I will be more than happy to look into the ticket responses further!","replies":[{"poster":"motumbo guardian","date":"2014-11-27T05:27:57.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dartagnan!!! \n\nTHANK YOU FOR LISTENING, please dont give me to him again.... I keep getting forwarded to the same guy and he's just wreaking havoc on my accounts. \n\n#14803233 is one of them. this account was suspended and then I got the password stolen.\nas you can see I'm logged into that account but under an unrecognized email.... I created this account.\n\n\nbefore I created that account and a different one I own I had lost my main account  but I was in a lot of trouble at the time so I figured it was long gone.  but this guy offers to help me and then when I confirm I'm the original owner he permanently bans the account so I can possibly never get it back?.... this is a nightmare.... \n#14897223\n\nI keep trying to submit tickets and have someone listen to me but people think I'm crying wolf or something....\n#14934773\n\nI was a little flustered on all these tickets so forgive some of the typos... when I say banned I meant suspended for bad ranked behavior and thats when it was stolen as seen in the screenshot below. also to clear this up. I shared motumbo biggums with my brother. I demanded that he play league with me so I made him an account to play on and because I called it \"his\" as a reference he believes I didnt make the account....\n\nbut when I ask to get help recovering my lost account he permanently bans it because it was compromised....  \n \nPlease dArtagnan...\nI love this game and the money I've spent on it. why would I want to lose that when I'm asking to get it back?\nI dearly appeciate your time and I really hope you can see just how accurate I am about my information considering how long ago this is...\nthese skins to me are more than pixels.... theyre gifts from dear friends that I think about everytime I wear them onto the rift.... \n\nYou're seriously the best. \n\nSincerely,\nAustin","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-12-02T05:24:36.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey motumbo guardian,\n\nSorry for the delay due to the Thanksgiving Weekend >.<\n\nI looked into the different tickets, and it appears that the situation was explained to you fairly directly.  It is impossible to ascertain if you were the original creator of the account, and the account has been compromised multiple times (not just from one additional person) during the lifespan of the account.  Given that we cannot prove 100% you are the owner and given that it is so severely compromised, we permanently suspended the account.  This is done to prevent multiple people who all have relative information from trying to recover the account.\n\nI completely understand how much this sucks :(  But unfortunately there is nothing further that I can do due to it being compromised so severely.    If you want to discuss the issue further, feel free to update your latest ticket, as a public setting as the Boards is not an ideal place for these conversations >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"motumbo guardian","date":"2014-11-29T03:56:22.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happy Black Friday and thanksgiving Dartagnan","replies":[]}]}]}
