It's hitbox is also much larger and goes at basically the same speed as Zed q. It's range is also MUCH further, allowing you to zone someone off to miles away from CS.\n\nNot to mention if you get hit by a shuriken it isn't the end of the world, but getting hit with a Varus Q? You can say goodbye to a chunk of HP, at least Zed has to use his full combo or be far ahead for his ONE Q to do meaningful damage.

No good mid player loses lane to a zed unless it's a heavy counterpick like veigar or something.

The skillshots have less reliability at a range. In order to put \"pressure\" on him you must overextend into that range aka into gank range aka into \"I-can't-walk-back-to-my-tower-if-he-jumps-on-me-and-I'm-squishy\" range.\n\n> Don't get me wrong, he's a pretty safe champion, but Zed is able to be poked down, and he won't be throwing that many Q's if you push him to tower considering he will have to use all of his energy last hitting under it IF you are actually pressuring him and not just letting him farm for free.\n\nSo the counter is to overextend? Sounds like a bad plan to me. If only wards grew on trees. And you act as if he is void of basic attacking to last hit minions and the tower is AoE nuking all the minions from him. No, it's not. He can actually last hit under tower FAR BETTER than any other champion given his passive. On top of that he has Q and E to catch those minions that almost get tower rekked.\n\nAny Zed player with a brain won't be QWE'ing the minion wave if it gets to their tower. And any jungler with a brain will destroy you if your squishy mage butt crosses into over-extension territory.\n\n> Also, are you really in a place to talk about safe champions when your most played consist of Hecarim and Vlad?

All while healing yourself! So fun!\n\nPersonal attacks, always gotta have these. Hecarim is safe? I don't need to argue it. Vlad though? His heal is minuscule pre-hex which is where most of laning happens. All during this time he is extremely vulnerable to a great number of the cast. He is a counterpick to some so it doesn't apply as much but for the most part there is plenty of non-safety to this champion.\n\nAlso I never said he was brainless.\n\nAny other pretentious comments about who I am or what's on my profile that invalidates my statements?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-09-04T09:30:49.168+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"I find that some ranged mages can make it a little harder on him with some autoattacks, though.\n\nWhat I find about Zed is that his laning phase is pretty safe, but he starts to fall off late-game because he can't dive past the frontline all too well.

Varus arrow does more damage and can be spammed with cdr. Get to lvl 30 before trying to argue with superior diamond elo players, kthxbye.\n\nI'm diamond as well, this is just the account i have to use to post here. Get your head out of your ass.\n\nVarus' arrow is like the most telegraphed ability in the game, the only way they are hard to dodge is if you use them from the fog of war, if he is in your vision and you get hit by those constantly you're doing something wrong, specially in laning phase where he can't afford to spam them.","replies":[{"poster":"Indominus Blade","date":"2015-09-04T21:04:29.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hayaishi2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fxx4lKEy,comment-id=0000000000000000000200000000,timestamp=2015-09-04T21:02:22.712+0000)\n>\n> I'm diamond as well, this is just the account i have to use to post here.
