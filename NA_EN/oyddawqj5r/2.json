This isn&#039;t intuitive at all especially with how meaningless the shield gain is when it decays so quickly for such a high health cost.\n\nThe biggest one is his Q though. Why does this have a health cost? It requires him to be melee on a champion with 0 mobility or CC - not even a slow. And yet it comes with a health cost. Just doesn&#039;t make sense to me. Prime example of major risk with minuscule reward.\n\nThis design made sense back when he was released, since he was meant to be extremely strong and gain defense from attacking multiple targets, basically making him the 1 man teamfighting pentakill machine. But nowadays he deals pretty negligable damage especially for how much mobility he has, given champions like LeBlanc and Ahri have just about the same survivability but with far more (reliable) burst.\n\nWhat I think should happen? **I think health costs should be removed and early ranks of E should have a higher cooldown to emphasize the gap between when his shield is up and down during laning phase (especially since it&#039;ll become \"free poke\"). This is to follow Riot&#039;s philosophy of making clear cut strengths and weaknesses. His strength should be his ability to gain shield when attacking, letting him win trades. But the weakness should be the lack of shield afterwards where he is vulnerable and his abilities are on cooldown.** Basically making shield management more of a pressing matter. Late game he should function the same other than ofcourse not having health costs. But that&#039;s only for his E. As for W and Q I feel they should stay the same since they require you to be in melee range which opens you up to poke and ganks. Mordekaiser&#039;s viability as a lane pusher shouldn&#039;t be touched (early E cooldown increases shouldn&#039;t affect this part of him at all).\n\nAlso, **let him put his W on turrets!** Gives him a little more in terms of counterplay to ganks during laning phase with the recent \"magnetism\" buff. As it stands he is one of the most gankable champions in the game if not _the_ most.\n\nI also think a big reason why no health costs would be a problem is the way his ult pretty much gives him his entire health pool back. This just feels like excess power if health costs are no longer involved and should probably be removed. And with that mechanic removed, there&#039;s more room to buff his base health pool or his maximum shield or both.","replies":[{"poster":"canpan14","date":"2015-06-17T12:51:04.897+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":5,"body":"He has health costs because he has no mana costs + his abillities generate a sizeable shield.

His drawback is that when he spams too much he becomes a better melee champion than any top laner before being able to cast shield again.

His shield isn't supposed to be like rumbles. It is supposed to be something he keeps up. Like how tryndamere keeps up his fury. The spammy nature of his q and e are there on purpose so he can spam them at the risk of losing his health fast. Players have to balance how they use those. If you take out health costs and raise the cooldowns he will just become boring and only have cooldowns to manage. Also it would be hard to keep his shield going which is a huge part of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2015-06-17T14:30:21.555+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"Except Tryndamere gets damage and a big heal for keeping up fury while Morde gets a temporary shield that costs him almost the same amount of shield he gets in health.\n\nSpammy abilities with low impact are boring. Meaningful longer cooldown spells that have meaningful risks and rewards are far more fun. Balancing how much health you are using while spamming sounds extremely boring and IS extremely boring. If you take out health costs and raise the cooldown to make decisions more meaningful, he will then have to manage his opponent instead of his health. Which sounds alot more fun than watching your health bar as you push.\n\nAnd the shield shouldn't just be constantly up during laning like it is now. Counterplay counterplay counterplay. Where's the counterplay? There is none, Morde is an oppressive laning champion because of it and thus received plenty of nerfs for it. His only weakness is gank susceptability.

Both ways of playing can be fun. I swear it is possible. Why not raise everyones cooldowns in the game to 10 minutes. That will make it really meaningful /s. \n\nThe shield is only constantly up if he keeps using abilities as it drains at 3% per second.

For Mordekaiser in particular, not only are his health costs negated partly by generating a shield, which creates a bit of a skill differential between the player who lands their damage to get effective health back and the one that doesn't get's no reward, but his abilities are also DoT and AoE centric, which are the 2 strongest forms when interacting with spellvamp. Late game, his health costs are so negligible that he may as well be resourceless, but they are enough to encourage a certain build style (usually heavy sustain) and gate his early game (otherwise you would *never* get him out of lane).","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadDoughnutz","date":"2015-06-17T16:11:42.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there are a few reasons as to why, and I'll list a few\n\nReason One: Mordekaiser is an old champ. By old, I mean very old; his kit is hugely outdated and, while his passive is very unique and core to his gameplay, his abilities are not besides his ult. Back then, Riot was experimenting with manaless champions, and Mordekaiser was one of those. However, because of his spammy abilities and shield, he had to have a tradeoff, and to Riot back then that meant putting health cost on his abilities(Just to keep in mind, this was back when Mordekaiser top lane was Godlike and he rushed Rejuv bead and 20 health pots and then never died.) Nowadays, it's just outdated.\n\nReason Two: Balancing. Even if Mordekaiser had longer CD's, that wouldn't fix the issue of 'No Counterplay, Point and Click spellcaster' that he is right now. Sure, there is counterplay to how you fight him in terms of outranging him and positioning properly, but that's not what Riot really appreciates in a kit. Right now, Mordekaiser has a supposedly weak early game, and he should: A Mordekaiser that gets ahead STAYS ahead and can easily 1v2 or 1v3 due to his shield and the ability to quickly turn that 1v2 or 1v3 into a 2v1 or 2v2 due to his ult if he kills someone with it(And a fed Mordekaiser will have the damage to do so). So having the health costs stay right keeps him from being an utter bully to low range champs in the early game. \n\nI'm not saying Mordekaiser doesn't need buffs right now, but his kit besides his passive aren't really workable in their current state while maintaining a 'healthy' gameplay pattern that other players can fight against and enjoy according to Riot, which makes him a very iffy champion to mess with balance wise. Unless they rework him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-06-17T15:03:57.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of your focus on \"significance\" and the like is misplaced.
