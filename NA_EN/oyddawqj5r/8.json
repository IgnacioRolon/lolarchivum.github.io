Seriously the dudes popular enough that everybody is vaguely familiar with his kit but hella folks don't actually play him enough to justify taking him randomly to ranked.  Also a top 5 in damage to champions in the adc role in every ranked bracket. So there is that going for him.\n\nSo i think the real question here is why do people first time champions they have a vague understanding of in ranked?   My guess is cuz they thought they could or they just wanted to and did not care about the outcome.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-09-02T09:32:42.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I should definitely look at that statistic first. Cuz 50+ games isn't even that much so if they are going 50+% win on him then he probably isn't that bad. But his low win ratio just shows that so many are attempting to play him without actual experience in doing so and bringing the win ratio down.\n\nI was just salty cuz I got an Ez on my team 3 games in a row and all 3 lost lane hard af to a Draven and 2 Tristanas--champs who are generally *much* stronger late game.\n\nI just fail to see why you'd pick Ez if you're gonna lose lane to hypercarries that have insanely better scaling than you. I figured if you picked him at all it was to win lane or at least go even with the safety of long range Q's. But from my experience that's never the case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"koochario","date":"2017-09-02T04:04:52.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or Ryze and Azir\n\nEven Jayce top pretty much loses most games due to comp (only chance is him snowballing massively)","replies":[]}]}
