It is a northern europe place, With many references to modern interpretations of nordic observations.\n\nUdyr should not be trying to control his spirits, he should be trying to become one with them. Instead of being in more control, he should be relinquishing control, stealing and hunting for his food like an actual animal.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-08-12T23:43:42.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point.

The base skin is a more savage, unrefined version of Spirit Guard.\n\nIf Riot is ever to do a VU on him someday, most likely, they would do something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2017-08-12T22:37:28.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Savage\"\n\nProceeds to make lifeless arm motions with little visual power behind them.
