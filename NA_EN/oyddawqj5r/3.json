Because Blood Price&#039;s bonus damage is the only form of bonus physical damage in the game that **doesn&#039;t** proc lifesteal. It&#039;s already dangerous for him to use Blood Price due to the self cost and the lack of W heal but unknowingly to some it costs _even more_ due to all the extra physical damage that you aren&#039;t benefiting the effects of lifesteal from.\n\nPlease make this small QoL change (QoL buff) to help make him slightly more viable and reinforce his riskier W option.\n\nEdit: So there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding here. This doesn't give him a costless W. This simply makes that extra 60-200 (+1.0 Bonus AD) bonus damage grant the 10-15% lifesteal that any Aatrox builds, including tanky ones. Almost every single one has a BotRK or a Hydra. **This change simply makes you heal an extra little 9-30 (+0.15 Bonus AD) on Blood Price if you have lifesteal (this example being at 15% LS).** (Based on skill rank)\n\nThis almost doesn't affect laning phase at all. If Aatrox builds a Doran's Blade then he gets 3% lifesteal on Blood Price's damage, healing him for 1.8/2.805/3.81 (+0.03 Bonus AD) (rank 1/2/3). Hardly anything. Just 2-4 extra health on Blood Price for levels 1-5.\n\nAnother Edit: Apparently his isn't the only one that acts like this. Just one of the very few. Also for the people comparing it to J4: J4 does % health. There's probably a story behind why it doesn't work with LS anymore. I really don't see why it shouldn't anymore though with how tame lifesteal is nowadays (since that was probably to accomodate for s1 or s2 where lifesteal was given in godlike amounts).","replies":[{"poster":"MasterVidallis","date":"2015-06-01T15:07:42.193+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be a really good, logical change, for a champ that needs a little buff.","replies":[{"poster":"DUDE BRO","date":"2015-06-01T22:11:13.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"He needs buffs for sure, but I don't think just upping his damage (he can keep price on for longer since it won't hurt as much) is the right way to buff him.

They all have it as a button to be pressed, with the exception of Yi and J4. \n\nThis is an issue with passives in general though. It's the fact that some count as On-Hit effects and others _PROC_ On-Hit effects. Like the damage from Teemo's E does not proc Vamp or LS because it's considering an On-Hit effect and does not PROC effects. \n\nIt could be fixed, but it would be a bit hard. As of this moment, there's only 3 champions that PASSIVELY gain a boost to their AA's as Physical damage. Yi, j4, and Aatrox. Yi's is the ONLY one that doesn't give him bonus damage though. His passive makes the AA split into two, doing the same as a normal AA, but proc'ing on-hits twice. His passive is honestly just to double proc on-hits like Shiv, his Q's passive, his E, and BotRK and such. J4's passive gives him a boosted damage, but it's considered an on-hit effect much like one would consider a BotRK to be. It doesn't make his AA do the base damage AND the percent of current, it simply adds current health. Yes, it's in the wording. Seriously. lol.\n\nIf Aatrox's W said it makes the AA do <Total AD> plus a Base and <Ratio>, then it would proc LS like everything else since his ATTACK would've been changed to do all that damage rather than it being Every 3rd attack, his AA will do so much bonus. You can even look at Jax's W. It will proc SPELL VAMP and RYLAI's and not Life Steal. LS will only affect the BASE attack, not the boosted  damage from Empower. Some could say, 'Oh, it's Magic damage, that's why'. Incorrect. Nid's cougar Q procs on-hit affects now and will not benefit from Vamp and neither will Poppy's because it states that it does the total AD with the attack.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, you have to understand the AA is either a spell, an On-Hit Effect, or an actual AA. Teemo, Varus, Kog, Vayne, and Aatrox have On-Hit Effects. Nidalee, Poppy, Talon, Draven, and Renekton have actual AA's. Poor Jax has a Spell attached to his W, as does Gragas, but Gragy at least works with it. \n\nIf you have to cast it, it'll proc LS or it'll proc Vamp. If you don't have to press ANYTHING at all and it just PASSIVELY adds boosted damage to your ability, then it procs nothing. The only exception to this rule is Kog's W where it's casted, but the secondary damage is an on-hit effect. Kennen's W is also an exception... for some reason. It's considered an On-Hit effect, but it.. procs vamp and Rylai's. \n\nOnly issue I have with Aatrox's W proc'ing LS is the fact that Teemo's E, Varus's W, Kog's W, and TF's E would need to be changed to proc one or the other. Vayne can stay at gaining nothing. It's bad enough Cho and Nunu can get a hextech revolver and gain large amounts of health with true damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-06-01T23:16:35.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's basically the difference between being an on-hit effect and being an ability that applies on-hit effects (like ez and gp Qs)\nyou're right about everything but poppy, her Q turns her autoattack into a spell, applying spellvamp but not lifesteal, it's coded in reverse of every other autoattack modifier in the game for some reason","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-06-02T00:13:27.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy is... awkward.

Most on-hit effects and autoattack modifiers don't have the bonus damage benefit from crit. For pretty much all of them, the autoattack can crit, and then the autoattack modifier is applied afterwards. Draven axes, Nasus Q, Vayne Q, Blitzcrank E, etc.  Having the bonus damage not crit is pretty standard.","replies":[{"poster":"supes the lost","date":"2015-06-02T22:10:58.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can tell you there was a time where Nasus Q stacks were part of the crit damage calculation, If you give me time to find the video, I'll post it and you can see the nightmare of crit nasus.\n\nEdit: Found it\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=85&v=urPH_AOESNA\n\nEnjoy","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-06-02T22:15:11.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved those videos.
