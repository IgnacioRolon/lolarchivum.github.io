I'll cut it down to the most general terms that portray the situation effectively to try to help this stay simple. For all intents and purposes, the jungler can be anywhere before this starts, for the sake of simplicity.\n\nLets say the enemy midlane is a high mobility assassin, and your midlane is a high mobility mage.\nYou are playing a hyper carry, with a peel heavy support, and the enemy is doing likewise on bot\nYour top lane is a high mobility bruiser, and the enemy top lane is a low mobility farm heavy full tank.\nYour jungle is a low mobility fighter tank, and theirs is a high mobility bruiser.\nThis part is incredibly important, because knowing the kind of opponents you have can determine what your play should be in a game.\n\nLets now say, that the enemy mid lane gets into a position of advantage, where they have managed to force your midlane to base with little harm for them, and instead of going for the enemy tower, they want to secure a dragon by going bot lane to push your lane back. the enemy jungler agrees with this plan unbeknownst to you, and a 4 man is initiated.\nI'm using this position as a point of beginning because very seldom does roaming occur when lanes are even, midlane already has some sort of advantage, and time to push it.\n\nOn bot lane, before all this, lets say you were doing better than your opponents slightly, close enough to be a good looking gank, and currently pushed on the opponents side of the river. your support has the river warded in the bush right next to lane, but there are no other wards because your support does not have a sight stone yet. you have not gotten any kills, but lane is most certainly yours at this point.\nThis part matters, especially at the place y our support put the ward. warding is important, but during laning it can be difficult keeping all the places you need warded near bottom to be warded. specifically you need a ward in the near river bush, a deep ward in the river, and another ward that can see the inside of the dragon pit. this warding is a team effort, but the support alone is capable of it, if need be. I'm not mentioning scuttle, because scuttle would end this roam.\n\nYour toplane is currently winning, but has scored no kills on the enemy.\nAs a final note, this is still important to my overall point.\n\nHere is the actual gank, your ward spots them before the enemy gets to you, but its too close, and the mobility of the attackers make up for this, meaning that you get surrounded and killed very quickly. your support would be able t ohelp a great deal, but in this setting, the skill of all the players is too close for your support to save you from all of the enemy, which is the most realistic thing to happen.\nA few points that should be added to this is that the midlane probably did not ping mia, expecting the enemy to buy.\n\nThen we get to the point where you want your midlaner to chase down the other midlaner. and here is the problem with this, your midlaner in this scenario is already nowhere near, and was not in position at any point to help you.\nThe jungler could come, but the would make it worse. the point of ganking is to bring an advantage, and if you aren't doing that is a gank, you had better not gank. a 4 V 3 is still garbage for you, especially considering the junglers gold and exp is reduced, simply by them needing to jungle.\ntop could tp, but that leaves their laner to farm, and you can be sure that a farm lane will NOT be leaving lane to chase anyone, atleast any decent farm laner.\nThat leaves bot alone in the best case scenario, meaning only two people die. If you want to counter and say that everyone should go, you come across some new problems. jungle and top would show around the same time, but a good chance is bot is already dead. and mid is too far to show up until a bit later, probably after the other two are also dead, so you end up aced, because you cant just flash to other lanes, there is significant distance between them.\n\nso then, bot lane just got boned six ways from sunday, how do you get back from this? relying on other lanes, and helping them snowball as hard as you can. jungler should gank top or mid, to help shove and push back the laners, and mid should start pushing hard to stop the enemy from roaming much anymore, if possible. and after you see the enemy roam once, expect it from then on, and ward, everything.\n\nI can agree with you on something though, it is how you win lane, or more precisely, how you react to the situations given. I can admit, there are situations where chasing the enemy down is advantageous, but there are also times when doing so can cost the game. its just best to keep your head in it, and remember, you don't need to carry every game.\n\nLittle tip as well, Nexus>Teamfight>Baron>Dragon>Tower>Kill>Cs.  Teamfight does not apply during laning.\n\nTldr; Keep on your toes, everything is situational.","replies":[{"poster":"Ih8ucuzurtoxic","date":"2015-06-06T03:43:24.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, like I said, Map Control > anything else.\n\nPushing your tower and losing bot while playing mid is REALLY bad.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2015-06-06T04:28:04.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Losing mid because you went bot is also bad, which is what my case says, if you read it.\n\nMap control is only a part of the game, and not the most important part, that goes to objective control.","replies":[{"poster":"Ih8ucuzurtoxic","date":"2015-06-06T06:29:14.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I can't argue with a wall.
