It seems the only way to know you&#039;ve triggered it is to look at the buff bar. It&#039;s definitely useful in certain situations but sadly half the time you proc it you waste some of the MS boost time since you didn&#039;t even know you activated it.\n\nIt needs some kind of particle on activation. Or even an icon on the buff bar that fills as you deal damage and changes color on maxing out. Anything to make it more visible and easier to use, as I feel this is the only real reason it isn't used as much as the others.\n\nEdit: Also it should activate on kill even if the target has less than 30%.","replies":[{"poster":"Teémò","date":"2016-04-06T13:03:26.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"learning your exact damage output can deffinitely help you with that problem though, it just takes alot of practice. I use it mostly on teemo for \"move quick\" haha it also kills alot of engage most junglers have on him well giving him even higher assassin abilities with enemy champions procing it with mushrooms","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-04-06T13:16:08.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your exact time to hit 30% on a target is extremely variant on the target you are facing. It's already hard enough knowing how much damage output you have when your targets have different amounts of armor, shielding and damage reduction effects--let alone keeping track of how much health they have on top of that.\n\nSo unless you're 2-shotting enemies it's a little difficult to keep track of.","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2016-04-07T03:50:56.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Putting it on Nasus, I pretty much guarantee it procs on 1 Q. Lategame anyway. \n\nBack on topic, I think there's already some particles, it kind of looks like... well a standard speed boost. The thing is, I'm unsure if it even came from the mastery or from triforce or whatever. It did feel too fast to be all from triforce though, and I think triforce's particles look like Nami's/Furor enchantment while the mastery one looked like a {{item:3069}} boost, and that one had similarities to a talisman boost.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-04-07T11:33:10.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah there are. It's like a little blue trailing effect. But it's very small and hardly noticeable and the biggest part is that you have to move a bit in order to really see it. So you may spend some time not utilizing it because you didn't even know you already procced it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadula","date":"2016-04-07T03:45:33.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its easy to tell on {{champion:202}}  cause you hit one crit and all of a sudden you're hitting 600+ ms and running circles around the entire enemy team","replies":[{"poster":"ViashinoWizard","date":"2016-04-07T04:48:21.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta strut fast","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TurquoiseYoshi","date":"2016-04-07T00:21:47.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. Nice particles would put it on line with every other keystone, and the little buff on kills is probably needed.

What color should that be, idk? I would say green but colorblindness needs to be considered. I would probably think purple similar to Sona's aura assuming it's not a problem in terms of gameplay readability. Sona's MS buff isn't really noticeable in terms of vfx, so a purple trail wouldn't be bad.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2016-04-07T11:30:49.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It actually already has a tailing effect, thus why I mentioned specifically on activation.
