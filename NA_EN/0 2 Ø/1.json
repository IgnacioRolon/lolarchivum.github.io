It takes a good 30 seconds for the collection to load up. I have enabled low spec mode, but feel as if nothing has happened. In game, I am also laggy when a team fight occurs. Though, when the client first came out, in-game was fine with solid 60 ping and 60 fps. I have all settings on low, turned of shadows, capped fps, etc. I'm pretty sure its not my computer since it used to run league very fine. I also redownloaded league, but still no changes. Any help would be great thanks{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-28T00:42:37.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is an option during testing to use the client in a low performance mode.
