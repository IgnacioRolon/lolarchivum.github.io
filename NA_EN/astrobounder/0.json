I tried to switch my rune and mastery pages and it said wouldn't \"save\" (aka switch to it). When it was my turn to lock in my champion, it wouldn't let me lock in. I clicked lock in and then it grayed out and the timer kept going. It forced me to dodge. Then when I tried to start up a new game search, the start search was grayed out after I clicked it. I tried restarting the client but it took a very long time to log in and when I did I couldn't do anything really. I couldn't view my profile or start any game, even a custom game. I went on my smurf and everything was fine again, it loaded quickly and I could play a game, but when I got back on my main account I had the same loading issues again. I can't search for a game, start a custom game, or even view my own profile. Any help? \n\nAlso it says trying to reconnect every time i try to start a game, then a message pops up saying \"something unexpected happen when trying to create your lobby\" or \"something unexpected happened when trying to change your runes/masteries, starting your game\".","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T03:41:20.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically when that lock in button grays out, its a good sign that your connection with the game server has become unstable. The button grays out, because it's not able to send the data to our servers so it can't let you lock in. Let's go through this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to see if we can narrow down the main cause of this disconnection.","replies":[]}]}
