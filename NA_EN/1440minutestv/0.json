Who the fuck taught you there's only one continent in the western hemisphere?\n\nWho taught you that \"America\" refers to a continent, the U.S.A. school system? America refers to the landmass that separates the oceans in this hemisphere. The continent names are a science designation that theoretically separates the one land mass into North America and South America. Notice the \"North\" and \"South\" designations to differentiate the contiguous land mass. Sometimes this is further subdivided into regions, such as during prior war eras where it was (conceptually) delineated as North America, Central America, and South America.\n\nThe more you know, the less you don't know.\n\nOn a serious note, every person that calls themself American puts that identity above their national identity; mine being a United States **of** America citizen. The political insinuation is that the federal government of the U.S.A. actually presides as an American government, yet there is no such government. Be careful about which politics you support with imprecise words. The error of using imprecise words for the sake of brevity and simple communication is why the French say that \"Americans\" have lazy tongues. The French do not say that about United States of America citizens. Be aware of the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"YCitizenSnipsY","date":"2016-01-27T01:10:23.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"America describes **the whole continent**.

We are all residents of dry land, because that is what our biology needs. We could all call ourselves Terrans; Terra being a name for dry land; and a political movement to unify the universe of dry land living beings could start in some random country, Mexico for instance.
