Nothing loads everything is at 0 my ping, and everyone's percentage that usually tells how much longer they have to connect to the game is 0.  It usually starts me off at a black screen and then I get to the loading screen and after probably 5-10 min it tells me \"You have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" I tried my luck later and launched up a custom game but instead of the game crashing it was running at 01 fps.  I also had a windows update before I updated to the latest patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Afic","date":"2018-06-15T17:10:21.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Likely an issue related to content discussed in [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/sB4ucqXc-game-client-anti-cheat-changes-going-live) thread.

I recommend reading through that and posting there if you continue to have problems.\n\nI've been following this thread and so far people have been sending their dump files in but aren't getting any solutions atm. One of the Riot members told someone to update their driver for their graphics card and I have done that as well as running a repair, restarting my computer, and disabling my firewall. Nothing seems to work right now and more and more people seem to be having the same issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StumbleDuck","date":"2018-06-21T02:00:53.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, just reported the same thing in a bug to Riot - I thought it was a recent windows update or something, happened right after patching to 8.12.233.
