I tried logging in today and found out I was perma banned for third party software usage. I have no idea what software can be used while playing or anything of the sort. For the simple fact though I received no notification of my account being perma banned. A while back I was hacked with several of my social media accounts, but I did not think my league account was a part of that. I for sure know my account was hacked because after logging in on the website and looking at previous match history the characters used are characters I have never used before in my years of playing league and the people in the match were the same people that I do not know at all and for the matches to have been played all on 5-29-19 all day long I definitely was hacked because that was a wednesday and I was at work all day. I would like my account back because I was perma banned and it wasnt even me playing my account was definitely hacked and I received no notification of this perma banned even happening. This is unfair and I have a lot of skins that i spent money on from years ago. I just want my account back and to be able to play again I have already changed my password and just want my account back.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-09-28T20:13:38.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account was stolen and used by a scripter or botter.
