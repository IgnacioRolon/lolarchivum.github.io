If they're not toxic irl but toxic in-game, they're probably holding in their emotions irl so they can blow it off later in-game. I do that for single player games.

Online, I'm not [Marty McFly - obviously I'm not going to put my real name XD], I'm Famous Gay Actor. You don't know who I am. I don't know who you are. Anonymity at it's finest. I can say whatever I damned well please knowing that (unless you did some sketchy IP tracing), you'll never find me. You'll never see me again. Why should I care what I say to you outside of the possibility of a chat restriction. There's no real-world consequences for doing things in League like calling you trash, talking about how I had intercourse with your mother/grandmother, (insert other female relatives), etc. That's why there's toxicity in League. Because I can do or say pretty much anything and there's no way to hold me accountable to what I said to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2019-12-30T01:01:48.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has nothing to do with League alone. I don't know what happened but it just seems like everyone these days are complete morons... Half the time they are toxic, they do so without actually caring to prove anything, it's just blind toxicity. \nLike you could get flamed and called bad, ask that person \"what makes me bad exactly, and how are you better\" and then they just continue to ask for reports on you as if they aren't flaming you. These people Do Not Care to make sense of anything, for some reason they still feel empowered by being delusional, thinking that everything they say about someone is true no matter how dumb it sounds or how many times they were proved wrong.\n\nIt's mind boggling and very depressing at times because there is no winning with them and these days being a friendly smart person who can make sense of absolutely everything the toxic people can't makes the Smart person the idiot who should be reported, why? Because the toxic people simply don't care to be right and are possibly just dumb, I think it all ties back to bad parenting, just reminds me of my mom saying \"i dont care i dont have to be right im the parent\" and now I think kids are using that shit when flaming people, idk... I've tried pretty hard to figure out how so many people could be so toxic and stupid it's nearly impossible","replies":[{"poster":"in a hood near u","date":"2019-12-30T01:31:08.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like being a teenager.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-29T23:01:26.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Part of it is confusion/miscommunication, part of it is anonymity, some of it is tilt, some of it is rage... which you pretty much already said.\n\nSince you already know that, what are you actually asking...?

That alone builds up how you react to situations in the game. And LoL is not very well balanced so being engages and suddenly being killed because of events out of your own control can pull out knee jerk reactions and anger\n\n>What do they get out of such behavior?\n\nThis is a simple one I think. Part of it is venting their frustration out and another part of it is that anger helps one achieve goals, at least IRL it does.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Naymliss","date":"2019-12-29T23:18:24.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"A lot of people are emotionally immature. They've never learned how to control their emotions. As a result, they tend to get angry quickly and lose control over their actions. This isn't a league exclusive thing or a gaming exclusive thing, just think of things like driving or customer service- people can tend to forget to understand someone's point of view if they get angry.

The reason people are toxic is because LoL is a competitive game that is poorly balanced. When you are trying your hardest to win, but the meta doesn't favor your playstyle or champ and you feel that you had no way to counter something or at a disadvantage it puts you in a mindset. And worse yet is that Riot restricts you from letting out your frustration in health ways by way of the report function. So you have to balance being mad and frustrated along with how you can express it so most people will just say passive aggressive or ironic shit to try and avoid a ban. And frankly i find that worse than just shout a few naughty words out at someone.\n\n>\"Before arguing with someone, ask yourself if they are mature enough to see your point of view. If not, then walk away.\"\n\nThat is horrible advice. People need to speak up about things even if someone else might not get it or want to listen. If everyone just walks away from others then only bad ideas will spread. And this also assumes that you are in the right, and you don't challenge your own ideas against others.","replies":[]}]}
