On the spirit of the topic i will share the story of one memorable game.\n\nIt was way back, cant even remember the season. It was the time that Yorick got his first round of nerfs, still stronger than today. I was playing Yorick against Olaf and had a field day. On our mid lane the exact opposite. Our Cass was having a huge trouble called Le Blanc. And by huge i mean 0/5 huge. Our jungler started flaming her. Out bot joined also. But then i offered her a lane swap. \"Cass, Olaf  is pretty weak now. Want a swap so you can farm till you become a late game monster? I can handle LB pretty easily.\" \n\nSo it happened. Next recall (sadly with another Cass death) we swaped. Since top was a playground for me and didnt had to recall for that time, i had the money and bought a Spirit Visage. Went mid and LB went ham on me bringing me to 30% hp. But 20 sec later i was full hp. This story continued. LB was bursting me, i was healing and farming happily. 5 minute later they made the decision to swap back. And so we did. The swaps went back and forth a couple times until we went back to Cass vs Olaf top.\n\nCass was having it easy top, since Olaf could not do anything to her. Her farm skyrocked and managed to snatch 2 kills. The game went on with me participating on scirmishes being the annoying neverdying meatshield. Since Cass was at that island called top and my team had a fed Yorick to fight with them, the complains dissapeared. Teambattles came and top laners joined the fights. Cass was finally a monster getting multiple kills. The teamfights were won clearly. The game was ours.\n\n\nThe moral of the story is that if i joined the flame squad, the game would go to hell. But instead i offered a solution. And that worked. After all it is a teamgame and we should play as one. I never flame, try to offer solutions and keep the team spirit up. After all i am a support main and have to rely on teamplay. It is not easy to fight 5 enemies, a lot harder if you have to fight your own team as well. Stay positive summoners.\n\nPS: Muting is not a solution to the problem. Is a solution to the symptom. So while it helps, it is not an excuse for flaming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"71883083DEL1","date":"2016-06-13T02:42:58.713+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is the type of attitude we should have as a community.

The only thing you ever have any actual control over is yourself. As cliche as that may sound to some it is absolutely true and in my experience very few people truly understand this. When you attempt to control someone elses behavior you are taking an inefficient and usually unproductive approach. The thing a person should be doing is controlling their own behavior. People will follow the lead of someone with respect. If you treat others with respect it is for more likely for them to assist and work with you. If you try and control others you by definition you do not respect these people because by trying to control them you inherently see them as objects and not other human beings. People do not like to be controlled and will instinctive rebel and lash out at those who try to do so. \"Fight the Power\" is not just a catchy phrase that many people identify with, it is a biological truth and even necessity. We are pre-programmed to behave in such a manner. So, to answer your question the real issue is that people don't understand their own behavior and how it affects others. Because of this you lose games. Understand that your behavior directly affects the outcome of YOUR game. When you become negative your team becomes negative. Lead by example or don't lead because if you cannot be an example you cannot be a good leader.\n\nEdit: To be clear I should state (though I feel sad that I feel the need to state this clearly) - You can only control your behavior, it is a fallacy to think you can control another persons behavior, an illusion you perpetuate to yourself that only you believe.","replies":[{"poster":"gottrjr","date":"2016-06-15T19:00:02.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eternal Zen,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KKF310AJ,comment-id=0000000100010000,timestamp=2016-06-14T02:29:22.533+0000)\n>\n> The issue is actually the detachment from reality, to be fair.

People who join the military consciously agree to the terms of their service/employment and hence have agreed to being controlled. To pretend it is any other way is to take responsibility for ones actions away from the individual, which I think is a fundamentally bad thing to do. Again, the only control you have is over your own body and it's actions. Many people agree to be controlled given various imposing circumstances but given opportunity and a circumstance that is not favorable to the person trying to be controlled, they will rebel and fight back. There are no circumstances in League of Legends that are powerful enough to consistently suppress these instinctive tendencies in humans. Some people are more submissive by nature and will allow themselves to be controlled but as the renowned toxicity of this game proves, that is generally not the case for the majority of players.

It is perceived control that people willing accept because it serves their best interest to do so. There is a difference and you've mostly made this a semantics argument.\n\nAlso, it is pretty obvious I struck some chord with you being that you feel the need to attempt passive aggressive insults. I think this is completely unnecessary and uncalled for. I'm not sure what issues you have or the behavior I have demonstrated to provoke this from you but I apologize for both. I'm sure a part of you feels that you have this 'upper hand' perspective in this... conversation? and that's fine. I might point out though that you too are responding? Why? I don't know. What interest do you have if you prefer that I didn't respond? To me that says you really just want to be right and unchallenged... which is fine. I don't really care, I don't know you or have an invested interest in your opinion, whether that be of me or in general.

Helping other players and trying to help other players is how a community grows positively. \n\nHowever, I'm indicating the crowd of individuals that cave into the gamer rage and take it out on others. If I'm getting destroyed as an ADC and it's very obvious I'm doing poorly, a teammate saying I'm \"garbage\", like \"this quinn\" or \"this MF\", then going off on how I misplayed a fight (not giving actual advice, mind you) isn't going to help me. I know that I screwed up and that I can improve, but degrading me isn't going to suddenly make me tiers better or recover the Gold gap between teams.\n\nAlso, I seriously believe that the removal of TeamBuilder has led to more toxicity in uneven matchups. For example, it's difficult to improve myself as an ADC when my opponents (both ADC and Support) are at the level of my Jungle/Middle (which is where I'm better) - the other laners have more experience and comprehension of the lane. If I needed to practice, I'd hop into TeamBuilder and patiently wait for a match, most players in TB understood it was a practice environment, and there was very little toxicity compared to other queues. TB also altered Matchmaking to place you against opponents who were in a similar boat as you - simply wanting to play against others for the sake of practicing or becoming familiar wit ha champion. We don't have that anymore and that means I'm playing against a Gold/Plat ADC when in reality I'm a Silver ADC at best. ","replies":[]}]}]}]}
