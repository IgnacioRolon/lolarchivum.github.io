They should give us the tools and resources we need to have fun, and leave us be. That is how you make a successful game. If you see a group of children playing peacefully and happily in a sandbox, you don't go up to them and start regulating how they play in their sand. You just let them play.\n\nYOU think playing in a group is more fun... great! You don't need IP bonuses, the reward should be that you are having fun with your friends. I think playing with people I'm friends with sucks. I don't need that kind of stress in my friendships. Why would I invite people to play League that I hadn't ALREADY tried to invite just for... IP bonuses? I have plenty of friends, but they don't play League of Legends. Only me and my partner play, and we DO play together, but we're not around all the time. I don't WANT to invite randos from my games, I don't WANT to use this as a fucking friend finding service, I just want to play the game.\n\nIt CAN be played alone, so why am I being punished for doing that? Why should I be punished because I don't like to play with friends? When do solo players NOT get punished? We get less shards, we get less IP, we get shittier matches and Riot has straight up said, \"Yes, It is harder to win games playing solo into 3s, 4s and 5s.\" Riot has completely thrown solo players under the bus, and the funny thing is is that if we DIDN'T exist, then you couldn't have fun ~playing with your friends. You want to play a 4 man? A 3 man? Those kinds of matches are filled out by solo players. Solo players that are getting shafted by Riot and the community.\n\nLeague is like sex. Yeah, you CAN do it with other people, hell, maybe even that was the way it was intended. But let's be honest, you're probably better at it and you'd have more fun if you just played by yourself. \n\nTLDR; I don't want to play with other people. I want to play by myself. I should not get punished for playing by the rules and following the Summoner's Code, just because you and Riot think that it's not the way I should be playing the game, because honestly, well... fuck what you and Riot think.","replies":[{"poster":"rescued","date":"2016-06-10T18:55:04.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thisthisthis^\nI hate playing with groups so much.
