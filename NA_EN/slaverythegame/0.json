If Riot wasn't dumb and gave him alternate builds or made him able to proc charges multiple times he might be okay, but as is he's worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuroi86","date":"2014-11-03T10:53:37.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not quite, it simply means crit is too strong of a build for any other build to be viable.\nA high AD/cdr build is good on Varus, great for seige.  An AP/AS/cdr build is okay, but not really going to do much until you get your third or even fourth item.  With Crit, IE and PD or Shiv is all you really need to get going.

Jinx needs to know when to switch her guns, and be able to lane her skillshots. Tristana needs to be able to kite her opponents, especially when her team doesn't peel for her, although Tristana is admittedly relatively easy to play among most ADC's.\n\nI don't think these champs are \"toxic\", because the term suggests that they have unfair mechanics that make them unfun to play against, while these three champions have mechanics that may be overtuned.\n\nAlso, Jinx is by no means a top tiered ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-11-02T20:57:57.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Jinx is overall fine (though I think they would do well to make the contrast between rockets and minigun more stark). Lucian just has too much mobility, safety, and effortless trading, and Tristana's problem is more that they completely removed the mid game and she just gets IE and turns on immediately, and they removed the mana cost from her Q because they're idiots. If they brought back the mid game for carries you'd see the field open up more.\n\nBasically the stupid shit they did with BF items is the problem, but Riot's itemization team has never had a clue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Featherztorm","date":"2014-11-02T19:44:48.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ashe could use a rework.
