Regardless of how fed an assassin/ADC is, they have to constantly be worried about positioning because will be focused.\n\nNow lets look at the 'Era of Tanks'. They require zero strategy what-so-ever. They don't have to worry about positioning because they just have to be in the front. **Their only job is to walk to their opposing team and stand in the middle**. THIS REQUIRES SO MUCH SKILL, SO MUCH THOUGHT.\n\nPlease, let's not kid ourselves. This is the noobiest strategy ever, and Tanks shouldn't be so powerful that they don't have to worry about taking damage.","replies":[{"poster":"M Schumacher","date":"2015-03-22T21:17:11.303+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"stay salty adc main","replies":[{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2015-03-22T21:23:00.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Actually I have no main.

So that was a good confidence booster.\n\nYou were against a full team of Bronze 5s and still lost, kda has nothing to do with performance. Being a tank isn't simply standing up front, you have to properly use your cc if you are a cc tank, you have to decide when to go in as most of the times when you pick a tank the team will wait for you before doing anything, if you're more of a fighter tank like Mundo you actually have to be landing Qs to be a threat. Many of them can't escape any situation like some adcs can and assassins, yes they are tankier, but late game they aren't indestructible like many people like to claim. They also aren't being babysat or peeled for, if they are in a poor position they are on their own.\n\nA tank deciding to go in at the wrong time, ccing the wrong people, or messing up can cause a team fight to be lost instantly. I have won many games simply because the opposing tank jungler picked a tank just because it's \"what everyone is doing\" and didn't use their ults/cc properly and we ended up winning. They also have to decide what to build, where as adcs literally build the same things every game in the same exact order.","replies":[{"poster":"meatjunjun","date":"2015-03-23T04:37:26.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do understand and agree that tanks are very important.
