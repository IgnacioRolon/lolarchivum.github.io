I usually have a positive KDA pretty good map awareness and my pings are pretty good.  Most of the time i win lane and its other lanes that do poorly. I can help this out when im jungle because i can apply pressure for them but most of the time i get top. I&#039;m just wondering is there an easier way to climb out of bronze? I know you&#039;re going to have loses here and there... Anyway advice would be cool and i wouldn&#039;t mind queueing with people if anyone is looking for that. \r\nSincerely, \r\nBrosiden Lord of the Brocean","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-05-13T22:14:55.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have pretty good stats all things considered.

Yeah once I get in to silver I want to take some time and just improve on all of my skills like builds last hitting and things along those lines. I only had a bad kda because my team didnt have much pressure top so i was 2/2/1 because every time graves would get a gank and kill me he would stay too long so i would tp back and kill him. Then when they started to group and siege thats where my other 2 deaths came from.  Yeah i like corrupting potion for the sustain i feel like i would spend more in potions then just getting that early.
