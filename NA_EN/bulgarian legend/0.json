I'd like to help you get this figured out to prevent further penalties and keep you in game.  The issue you're having may be due to both bad game files as well as outdated drivers, so I recommend using the [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide for the resolution.
