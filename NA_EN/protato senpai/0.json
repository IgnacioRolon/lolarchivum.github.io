It would let us play if the servers were having issues (i.e. really heavy lag), and it would help to reduce some of the load on the Riot servers. \r\nIt wouldn't have to be dedicated server software, it could be something built into the client where we could click offline mode and it would have you host the game.\r\nAdditionally, we could get the option for custom gameplay options (i.e. base cooldown reduction, damage multipliers, movement speed multiplier, etc.) on those custom servers as well.\r\nEither way, I think that it would be nice to have.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-12-29T00:55:20.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good idea!","replies":[]}]}
