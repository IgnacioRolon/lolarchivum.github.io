And when I look at the Ranked system I feel as if there is room for improvement. What I&#039;m talking about is giving Solo Queue an individual league and then giving Duo/Trio Queue a League, (5&#039;s unchanged)\r\n\r\nI ask this because I like playing with friends (in Duo) and I also like playing solo. But I don&#039;t want to have those to seep into one another (so I can gauge my skill levels).\r\n\r\nI may be overlooking something, but it seems like a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"imonly4noobcakes","date":"2015-07-23T13:41:31.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it kinda sux that you either have to have a full on team of 5's or just you and one other. No room to add friends. If people could add friends ELO HELL wouldn't be as bad as it is.","replies":[]}]}
