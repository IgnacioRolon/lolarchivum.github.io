But I figured this is were I post my suggestions for general stuff (please redirect me if there is another place).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m still newer to the game but I do like Zac, I like his skill set, his general look, and his playstyle. However, as I&#039;ve been told, he is just not as good as other junglers. So I took some time to think about how exactly he could be changed in a way that&#039;s not overpowered. I began to look at the engagements I would be in and what would happen in them.  The issue I find is that his early game ganking potential is weak. When it comes to the mid and late game everything is fine, though the issue is getting to the mid/late game. \r\n\r\nThe reason I&#039;ve been led to believe that his (early) ganking potential is poor is that many times I gank they escape with below 50 health. Not just one or two times, its the same story in about 70% of my ganks they live with miniscule health. Now if they flash I cna be more lenient towards such a narrow escape, but many champs just kinda walk it off. So I figured, what can be done? \r\n\r\nMy idea is that Zac&#039;s W is buffed. The buff would be that the Base Damage of his W is Pure and the percent health part of it is still Magic Damage. This would basically mean with a level 5 W Zac would do about 20-40 more damage per W.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think this is overpowered, I just think that it&#039;s enough to give him a stronger presence during the early game.\r\n\r\nTell me what you think, and if you think you could close that 50 health gap a different way (not ignite) tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"SS Enforcer","date":"2015-07-15T20:21:43.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Step 1: Max E instead of W or Q\n\nStep 2: Kill everyone with your easy early ganking\n\nStep 3: ???\n\nStep 4: Win","replies":[{"poster":"Roodrak","date":"2015-07-15T22:34:52.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur actually a fucking genius thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
