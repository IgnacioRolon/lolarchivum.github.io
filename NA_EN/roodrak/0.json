I&#039;m here to argue that. (TLDR at bottom)\r\n\r\nThere are three things that are being suggested about Bard&#039;s W. The first one is simply make it stronger (whether it be Base or Scaling Amounts). The second (which I felt many people liked) is make his W scale off of Chimes. The third (which I saw earlier today) was punish players for destroying shrines. I disagree with these because simply, Bard does not need a buff.  I love the champion and I think he is one of the most fun supports, if he gets buffed he will simply be nerfed to a state that is worse than now (not to imply it is bad now).\r\n\r\nArgument 1:  Buff Caretaker&#039;s Shrine\r\nReasoning for: His W falls off late game in terms of health and speed buff. Waiting for his W to charge fully late game is not worth it. The cooldown is too long for it to be viable/spammable.\r\n\r\nCounter Argument: \r\nCaretaker&#039;s Shrine in the late game has weaknesses, this is undeniable and I understand. However, it is NOT a worthless heal, it is NOT a worthless speed buff, and it is NOT a worthless late game ability. The heal at max level provides 150 Base+20% AP, the speed buff is 50% of the total movement speed decayed over 1.5 seconds. In order to compare this we will look at two other champs that provide heals and movement speed to compare; Nami and Sona (I know her W and E are separate, but they are often used at the same time). Nami provides a 185+30% AP Heal, that bounces, whilst also apply a movement speed buff of 60+20% of AP. Sona provides 110+20% AP+%HP Missing+ A Temporary shield (155+20% at lvl 18), her movement speed buff provides 20%+3.5% Per 100AP at lvl 18. To compare, Bard&#039;s shrine is weaker compared to these two supports. Nami is designed to be an aggressive healer (as due to the bounce mechanic), and Sona to be a defensive healer (as due to the shield and %Missing HP mechanic) while Sona may not be played defensively her heal is not an offensive spell. So, where does this place Bard? Many would argue whether he is Aggresive/Defensive but in honesty his W fills a utility role more than Nami/Sona&#039;s abilities. His W falls off late game for the same reason Talisman/Locket do, utility falls off. This shouldn&#039;t be changed because he shouldn&#039;t be able to compete with a Nami or Sona, they SHOULD beat him in terms of heals when late game arrives.\r\n\r\nAs to address the two other complaint of Shrines... To wait for his W to charge is the same as placing wards, it exemplifies you and your teams desire to fight there. You need setup and you will do more in that fight if you simply predicted where it will be. The shrine should be a band-aid for your bruise or tape for your shoes, not a doctor waiting for you or a racecar level speed buff. The weakness and the strength is the waiting, you are rewarded for using the shrines (that have been pre-placed) correctly, and you are punished by only having 1 instant shrine if ganked. They shouldn&#039;t be spammable either because you shouldn&#039;t be able to be a medic in a fight, you should use your three other abilities too account for your lack of shrines. \r\n\r\n\r\nArgument 2: Caretaker&#039;s Shrine should scale via Chimes NOT via AP.\r\n\r\nCounter Argument:\r\nI really like this idea. If riot could create some type of system that would be heavily observed on release then improved on it could be good. This idea brings a lot of good to Bard&#039;s play-style, it promotes roaming (Bard&#039;s big thing), and it promotes healing. Though the issue is similar to first argument&#039;s issue, it could make Bard&#039;s W too strong. This issue would be done by having a flat scaling that doesn&#039;t change over time (EX: After the 50th Chime all chimes after now increase healing by 0.5 instead of 1). Bard shouldn&#039;t be able to be in full utility items and then have his heal be on par with a Nami/Sona solely because he walked around. He already provided bonuses for his team (ganks, map presence) by gathering Chimes, he shouldn&#039;t be able to overcome the enemy&#039;s support on top of this. He needs to make a trade, Gank/Help other lanes OR Stay/Help Your ADC/Stop their Bot Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nArgument 3: Punish Enemy Players for Destroying Shrines.\r\n\r\nCounter Argument:\r\nThe idea here is to stop players from just destroying Bard&#039;s hard pre-planned work. The suggested idea/penalty was provide vision/slow the enemy. I will talk about the slow first, then the vision, and then the overall effects of creating any form of penalty. To make Bard&#039;s W be a slow would give Bard a choice, heal or slow. And the answer should always be heal, the peel/chase that is given from the W is too much too ignore. Adding this slow would be allowing Bard players to slow with Meeps, and Q, effectively forcing the enemy team to buy Boots of Swiftness if they wanna move. In terms of Vision, it&#039;s the same reason that Skarner Spires don&#039;t give vision. It&#039;s not needed. If it is taken, you can see even if it&#039;s in fog of war, you know someone is there. This also would promote using the Shrine as a Ward, and this already exists through Teemo, Nidalee, and Caitlyn, this would lead to players not using it to heal. And overall this would only mean that Bard players would actually think about W&#039;ing an Enemy rather than an Ally, when it would be more beneficial 9/10 times for the ally to be healed and given a speed buff.\r\n\r\n\r\nYeah I&#039;m sorry if it&#039;s long read but I really like stretching things out. My only regret is not replacing the Champion names with icons.\r\n\r\nTL;DR- Bard&#039;s W shouldn&#039;t be buffed on the account of it being counter-intuitive to Bard&#039;s overall playstyle.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading all this.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2015-09-22T21:41:22.606+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Utility doesn't fall off.\nLook at {{champion:117}} or {{champion:25}} for example.

Thank you for showing that mistake. Lulu and Morg, Naut and Shen are strong late game not because of their Shields/Heals/Movement (Excluding Morg's Shield, which is unique to her character), they are strong because of their disables. \n\nPersonally I find the active of Locket to be negligible at 45min+ games. I normally go banner at that point (selling locket) so I can keep Legion. But that's how I see locket.\n\nIn terms of healing, I think it's wrong to compare LF/Regen/SpellVamp to a healer. Yeah anybody with Warmogs can outheal a healer. That's the point, healers aren't meant for late game. Soraka is the only champ that could contest that title, and not a single support holds a dime to her.\nPersonally I think Sona and Bard have the same level of healing since they only heal 1 person. Considering she always heals herself it's a bit skewed to look at stats.\n\nSorry, my fault for using the word Utility too narrowly.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthSpectrum","date":"2015-09-22T23:10:58.453+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3190}} does fall off on supports eventually since support champions don't usually stack straight health.

A Sona heal will do a maximum of 165 HP+20% AP (110+(110*(0.5*0.99))) (Please Correct me if wrong). Health wise it's a tad higher than an instant shrine, but the target must be 1% HP. \nNami's Bounces, Sona's Shield, and Bard's Medkit-Esque Heal are all secondary functions to their heals. In the secondary function I think Bard's has a weakness, in his numerical amount i don't think he does. His weakness is that it doesn't charge fast enough. And I like your Idea of causing Chimes to increase the build-up, I think that's a good change if there were to be one.\n\nPersonally i think it's not reasonable to complain about the mana cost when talking about Bard, it's stance right now is that it costs a lot. But I have never been in a scenario where i was below 40% mana as a Bard. I think this issue is overcame through choosing when i get Chimes (as they restore 12% max mana). This heal's mana cost would 100% be a problem if there wasn't a method of getting mana, in the champs kit.\n\nAnd talking about Vayne, I don't think that many people could stop her damage through Shields/Heals. I think in this scenario Bard is weak. And I think he shouldn't be enabled to stop a vayne's damage via Instant Shrine.\n\nI wish he didn't have a weak W late game, I don't think it's strong. And it shouldn't be, his W shouldn't save someone reliably because of the health. It's hard, for a Nami and Sona just to negate damage late game. His W's lategame is weak because heals are weak.\n\nI want to say this again, I REALLY like the idea of changing the charge-up time, make it scale off of chimes or cooldown reduction I'm not sure. But if there was going to be a buff to his W, this would be one that wouldn't break it (omitting that it takes at LEAST above 3 seconds)\n\nSide Note; I like that we just don't say shut up ur stupid.

Thanks for that.\n\nYeah XD.\nMy intent was never to directly buff Bard, because frankly he doesn't need it.\nHowever, I rather have him be slightly OP than to have an ability that becomes increasingly obsolete late game. \n\nThe proper way to view this predicament as I explained earlier is that a Shrine isn't necessarily healing too little health points, but rather it is not healing enough to make a difference.\nFor example full build enemy {{champion:222}} with her passive MS buff chases your full build AD carry. But your AD carry is at ~400 or 500 health (roughly 1/4 of the bar). You can heal your carry, but in the late game, champions do so much damage that even if you heal your carry, Jinx is still going to one shot him/her with a critical rocket.\nIt doesn't make a difference if you heal or not, and in many scenarios 1.5 seconds of 50% decaying MS isn't enough to escape.\n\nI know it isn't Bard's job to make LCS plays and save his carry as they 2 v 5, but right now his Shrine makes close to no impact in most fights.\nThis is quite a unique problem to Bard.\n{{champion:37}} and {{champion:267}} 's heals don't fall off that much, and they can serve a powerful secondary purpose. Nami AOE speeds up her entire team, and Sona gives everyone a shield and exhausts the next person she autos.\n\nThese two, along with {{champion:44}} (he surprisingly has a very powerful heal, it is 10 less base than a bloomed shrine + 5% of his bonus health), and {{champion:40}} can all heal enough to save someone from one attack or spell and their healing abilities may come with special effects.\n\nBard's Shrine has the unique advantage of being placed before hand. It can help a Jungler or an ADC sustain through lane.\nHowever, as I mentioned before 10 seconds is just not possible when everyone is grouped up.\n\nIf the Shrine charge time is reduced to, say around max 3 seconds as you suggested, Bard would be able to set up 2 or 3 Shrines in a row, which will provide a good chunk of health for an injured ally.\n\nEither way, my stance on the issue is that Bard's Shrine should be given some sort of change so it stays relevant late game.\nCurrently, Nami (with 2 bounces), and Sona (with shield) can prevent and restore close to twice the health of an instant shrine.\nA Sona or Nami would have been able to leave your ADC with a silver of health in the end, while a Bard would have been powerless to do much.\n\nHeals in this game are weak, but I don't feel comfortable with Bard healing less than 1/2 of what other supports can heal late game. I don't disagree that Bard doesn't need buffs, so perhaps his Chime damage can be toned down a bit to lessen his poke in order to compensate for the potential buff to W.\n\nBut then again that's just me. Perhaps other people, or the majority of people are fine with how Bard's heal is currently. It just bugs me that one needs to question whether to use a 90 mana ability late game because it might potentially have no practical use.","replies":[{"poster":"Roodrak","date":"2015-09-23T02:33:17.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W does it's job.

I agree, that would be a much better alternative.

You mention that Bards heal is not as great as Nami or Sona's but that he has so much utility to his kit that it makes up for it but it doesn't considering that half the game he is roaming the map. Bard's shrine's are so weak that half the time I hesitate to roam in case I have to run back to lane to help my ADC. Sona and Nami don't have to worry about these things so they can just sit on top of their ADC and heal them for as long as their mana lasts. Also, Sona and even Nami to an extent get free poke, Nami with her heal and Sona with her Q cause all she has to do is be in the vicinity for it to target the enemy. Bard has to work hard for any poke he can get which is BS cause he doesn't get any damage and his Q is a skillshot slow with a maybe stun that works more like Lux's double snare but it's short range and hella slow and telegraphed. \n\nBard is weak. Granted I love him but frankly you only have two types of supps in game. 1.) Enough damage in their kit that they can burst the enemy down and let their adc get the kill. 2.) Tanky with a ton of CC so they can just freaking dive the enemy and put them in CC prison and their ADC can get the kill. \n\nWhat's Bard? He has a skill shot slow/stun and his auto's slow....that's it.\nWhat are we going to do? Buff his E? how? Buff his ult? How?\nHis W and his Q are the only things we can buff and if you buff his Q then he would become too good in lane to be a roamer. If you make his shrines have a heal at least comparable to Sona's or Nami's at full charge then it would encourage roaming.

He has the ability to roam due to his passive and mobility provided from his E. His stun is essential to lanning. And his ult, if you just stop and put all of your attention into an ult (in a teamfight that is), you can end the game there. Most games with a Bard will end with Bard hitting a good ultimate. He isn't even bad when played like a conventional support. Others can do the conventional support job better than Bard (Janna and Thresh are fan favorites), but only Bard can roam effectively.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-09-23T01:45:03.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only have 1 question:\n\nBot Support or Jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Roodrak","date":"2015-09-23T01:51:40.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blade of Justic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rYJ2JAsT,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-09-23T01:45:03.083+0000)\n>\n> I only have 1 question:\n> \n> Bot Support or Jungle?\n\nBottom Support, he isn't conventional.
