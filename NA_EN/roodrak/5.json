At random times (I cannot detect a pattern at all) the screen will flash white, for a 1/60 of a second (a frame). When i first started experiencing it I thought it was just a random issue that would go away soon. However. it has persisted, I have never experienced this in any other scenario (3k hours of other computer usage) expect for when inside of a LoL game. It happens once a game (random times) and sometimes more (worst was 6 in one game spaced out every 3-4 minutes). \r\n\r\nI know I didn&#039;t provide everything needed for a full Bug Report, but I was hoping this issue has been encountered before and is known how to fix.","replies":[]}
