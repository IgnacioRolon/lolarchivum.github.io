You'd think that at the very least, they'd let you have access to the old builder from the new client while they work their magic.\n\n -- The following instructions work for Windows 7 --\nTO RUN THE OLD CLIENT: \n 1) When you're on the login screen of the new client press \"Launch Legacy Client\" at the bottom right of the screen, directly under the login boxes. \n\nTO ALWAYS RUN THE OLD CLIENT:\n 1) Navigate to your original install directory. If you can't remember, open up your start menu > search for \"League of Legends\" > right click on League of Legends > click \"properties\" > the \"target\" or filepath should be displayed.\n 2) Either click a drag the \"lol.launcher\" file to your desktop to create a new shortcut, or right click \"lol.launcher\" > click \"Create Shortcut\" > create a shortcut to the original launcher wherever!\n\nIF YOUR NEW CLIENT IS BUGGY AND DOESN'T LET YOU DO THIS:\n -- First try the instructions at this link: \nhttp://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/fr/c/bug-reports-eu/ZEVZVZVN-solution-to-use-your-old-client-without-reinstall\n\n-- If this doesn't work, try reinstalling League of Legends altogether. (Go to leagueoflegends.com and re-download the installer).\n(Feel free to uninstall the old one!)\n\nI would **_REALLY LOVE_** to see the old item set creator put back into the game - I use it for theory crafting quite often.
