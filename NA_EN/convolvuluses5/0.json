Comcast mocks them for their ability to satisfy upset customers. I have had 2 accounts hacked because riot will gladly charge me 5 dollars for a champ but not use proper protection of their servers. A humongous company that has no phone support, no live chat, and you have to wait days to get a fucking email response. The only problem with this game is the incompetent morons running it. Fuck you riot seriously fuck you. I want my hundreds of dollars and fucking time back you useless shitheads. Thanks have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-06T00:38:08.897+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey convolvuluses5!\n\nIf you had an account stolen from you, we want to help recover it as quickly as possible!  I went ahead and searched for any tickets you might have had open, but I was only able to find one ticket from 2013.  In this ticket, we responded to you within 24 hours asking for some information regarding the account that got hacked, but you never responded with any information :(\n\nIf you had an account stolen, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) once more and include as much information regarding the account as you can.  We may ask some fairly in-depth information, but this is to ensure that we are recovering the account back to the original owner.\n\nAdditionally, remember to [verify your email](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751744-Email-Verification-FAQ) with your League of Legends account!

At their best, they give you a copy pasted answer that answers your question. At their worst, they give you copy pasted answers that completely don't answer your question at all as a result of them misreading it or not caring enough to look into it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"katacura","date":"2015-02-06T03:36:35.052+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"DONT LIKE IT PLAY FUUUCKING DOTAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!ðŸ’€ðŸ’•","replies":[]},{"poster":"katacura","date":"2015-02-06T03:30:13.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Dude chill the fuck out riot works hard for their players and and employee's!
