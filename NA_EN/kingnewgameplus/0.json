Sometimes when I get into games, I'll have way higher than normal ping, like a good triple. When this happens, I can't access chat at all. Plus, I can only ping the danger/caution/OMW/missing pings, so I cant ping cooldowns or anything like that. Plus, randomly, when I click, my client will tab out. This has cost me my life a lot. Whenever I win/lose a game when this happens, when I click continue to go to results, the screen freezes and I can't tab out of it. And if at any point while this is happening I try to manually tab out of the game, the screen freezes. I've tried uninstalling league and reinstalling but it doesn't do anything. Any advice would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-14T01:49:35.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like something is forcing your pc to change the focus of the screen, so when you click you're actually clicking on another window making you switch views. Let's try using alt+enter to switch to windowed mode, and let me know if that makes a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingnewgameplus","date":"2017-05-14T02:34:01.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did just that.
