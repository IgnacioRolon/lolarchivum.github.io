But recently (beginning of the new client beta) I play a few games, about 3 or 4, and then I get lag spikes that shoot my ping from 30 to 2000. I've managed to deal with that but then after a few more games I get a lag spike that brings me up to like 4000 ping (my highest ever has been 18000 but i'm pretty sure this was a one time thing) and it doesn't go down for the rest of the game. It also gives me the reconnecting message after the game has already ended and it lasts until I either quit the game, close the client, or restart my computer. This has resulted in many leaver busters and a lot of reporting from my teammates. At this point league is unplayable and I want to find a solution to fix this.\r\n\r\nWhat I've already tried: reverting to the legacy client, running hextech repair tool, running as an admin, and also running in compatibility with Windows 7 and 8. I've also attempted to change settings on my computer such as turning off the thing that allows other computers to download off of your computer or something (didn't fully understand it). I also should not be lagging due to my internet since my current internet is not terrible (fiber optic).\r\n\r\nPlease help I feel like I've tried everything and while these fixes may have worked, they have only been temporary fixes that in the end do not work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-06T22:25:26.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like an unstable or degrading connection that's not kicking you off entirely, but still giving issues like packet loss.  Reverting to the legacy client wouldn't really solve it because this is specific to the game server and not the client.  I know you've done a lot of stuff already, but we need to take steps that specifically work towards improving your connection to the game server.
