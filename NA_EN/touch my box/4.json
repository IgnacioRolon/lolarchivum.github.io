TOO BAD, BECAUSE UNTIL ITS YOUR TURN TO PICK YOU HAVE TO STARE AT SOME SHITTY SPLASH ART.\r\n\r\nDo you like using all 30 seconds of your allocated time to think about your pick? TOO BAD CAUSE NOW YOU DODGED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid Riot recently go on a massive job cut and fire anyone with an IQ above 26?\r\nDid they have to meet some strange diversity requirement and hire a bunch of uneducated folk?\r\n\r\n\r\nWho in their right mind would rather look at a blank space or splash art over the champion pool? I&#039;d elaborate the point but I don&#039;t think it gets much simpler than that.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re also told to select a champion you&#039;d like to play, so after failing to lock in, why not give us either A. The champion we have selected in our 30 seconds. or B.The champion we selected that we are planning on playing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, your recent changes are just mind numbingly idiotic. Fire whoever made them.","replies":[]}
