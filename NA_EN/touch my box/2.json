You get 500 returned from thornmail alone.\n\nThe obvious solution 99% of you will post is \"just dont hit him\". So what, just let him do his thing? Let him take towers willy-nilly, let him beat you to death?\n\nHe should at least have to land one of his skills for him to kill you that fast, because currently he can press defensive curl, go afk to bio, finish wiping his ass and laugh at your dead body.\n\nLord Dominik's lets you penetrate 100 of his bonus 250, leaving him with 250 armor. (I'm being generous here, he can easily get more than 350.) \n\nIn his current state he is just flat out an anti-fun champ. Thornmail is bad enough, but when he reflects an additional 110 there isn't much an ADC can do without losing out on a lot of damage.\n\n\nEDIT: Veigar recently got his stun nerfed because there wasn't enough counterplay, or room to outplay him. At least Veigar had to use his kit to kill you. If you dodged/baited/he missed his stun, you could kill him. Rammus can't miss his self buff. You fire you gun, he presses W, you die. Simple as that.

You should never be auto-ing him, and your team should never let you be in a position where he's right up in your face. Your tank or your support should be peeling for you, or your mage should burst him down since he's probably stacking armor with very little MR.\n\nIf he's getting to you, or forcing you to back off, he's doing his job and someone on your team is not doing theirs.

Tanks tend to counter burst champions by virtue of being more durable and having the kit to hold down their opponent long enough to outlast them in a forced fight. Their greatest weakness is being outnumbered or outmaneuvered. Where sheer numbers fail, tanks fall the fastest when exposed to artillery fire, AKA mages, who more often than not have the range and crowd control to stop any slow-approaching champions like Rammus from locking them into a fight, as well as the excessive firepower that doesn't proc the reflect (which only procs on basic attacks, both it and Thornmail).\n\nSo he has to be stupid enough to sit around while someone whales on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2015-11-20T21:05:09.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the artillery comes pouring in, he, like anyone else, has to make the call on whether or not to go all in, attempt to lock down the mage and outlast them, or back off and wait for another attempt. If he's trying to take a turret, he's not going to move much, since he has no range and has to hunker down (literally) right next to the turret to do anything substantial. That makes him an easy target to hit. When he's trying to take a turret, the top goal is to keep him off of it. Unless he's ulting, he can't attack it from range, and if he can't attack it, then you're doing your job right. If he decides to brace the turret damage and attack YOU, he doesn't have any real way of snapping to you outside of a flash (and few Rammuses do that as an engage), so you have a lead up to him closing the gap to respond accordingly (fall back, lay down crowd control, take refuge behind a wall of minions, etc).\n\nMy point is magic damage is going to hurt him more than anything else you could think to throw at him, and mage damage is going to be much more effective than trying to basic attack him to oblivion. You build accordingly for ADCs not to outlast him, but to minimize the effect he'll have on you long enough for you to survive and get away. Trying to counter what is a direct counter is ridiculous and counter-productive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Touch My Box","date":"2015-11-20T20:25:46.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The examples you mentioned, yasuo  and velkoz, zed v veigar, teemo v garen... the second person CAN counterplay and beat the first person because their kit has room for counterplay.
