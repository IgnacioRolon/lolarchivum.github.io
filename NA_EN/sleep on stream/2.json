You could go glacial augment and approach velocity and have nearly the same result, possibly better when you get rylais later with near constant uptime. You dont even have to sacrifice the only usefull runes like null-orb/manaflow with this path.\n\nI agree though that it doesn't need another damage keystone for the ~~move speed~~ sorcery tree, thats why I suggested an ability damage Lament passive or adaptive defense to encourage more sustained trades.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
