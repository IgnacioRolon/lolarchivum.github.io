If it takes a day to respond to you, waiting 3 days to submit a ticket means you won't get a response until 4 days from now.\n\nI've submitted multiple tickets over the past few years, and have always gotten a response within a day.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-11-11T06:36:28.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did u last log in?","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-10T04:10:24.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah.\nSeason reset came early?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-11-10T03:42:54.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's the honor reset point for after the season ends...
