I moved out of my parents place recently and moved about an hour away in order to find work bc where I used to live was a desert. Literally. \r\n\r\nI moved because of a job offer with Wells Fargo, guaranteed 6 week pay temp job. But unfortunately didn't last any more than 2 weeks. Ive been living off of it for about 3 weeks now but rent is due soon, so I went out in a suit/tie looking for work.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere I went to treated me like shit or with 0 interest. Save 1 but they told me to come back in 2 weeks...)\r\n\r\nThen I came upon a local Honda dealership. I filled out the app, hoping maybe theyd see something special about me there.\r\n\r\nThe guy I interviewed with told me af ter 3 minutes of talking\r\n\r\n\"You play a lot of video games dont you?\"\r\n\r\n>>Waitwut.\r\n\r\nMe: \"Uhh... yeah. I do.\"\r\n\r\nGuy: \"What games do you play\"\r\n\r\n\"LoL. Do you know about it?\"\r\n*pull out LoL RP+ AMEX card*\r\n\r\nGuy: \"Hang on a sec\"\r\n\r\nHe then pulls out his phone takes a picture and sends it to someone. All I could think of was \"waitwtfrudoinm8\" then realized I had no $ in there anyways so it didnt matter. \r\n\r\nWell it turns out that someone was the store manager and after he saw the card he instantly hired me. Then I figure out interviewer and the manager were both huge league and WoW nerds, we talked about video games for 15 minutes and they decided to give me a shot when no one else would.\r\n\r\nThanks Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"1 7 8 8  L","date":"2014-10-25T00:42:26.632+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question tho. \n\nThey said they wanna duo Q eventually.\n\nIf I feed do I get fired?","replies":[{"poster":"ZombeezyJeezy","date":"2014-10-25T00:44:20.031+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Quick question tho. \n> \n> They said they wanna duo Q eventually.\n> \n> If I feed do I get fired?\n\nYes and they tell you \"Get gud scrub\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2014-10-25T04:49:10.762+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make Rammus their mascot\ngotta go fast","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-25T01:27:03.016+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Haha, that's awesome!
