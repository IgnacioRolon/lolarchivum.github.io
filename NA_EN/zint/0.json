I mean, the skin itself from an aesthetic and thematic point of view is also spot on, but let&#039;s be real here: you guys NAILED it here on the facial consistency on Lux. If you look at Lux&#039;s default skin (and commando skin), Lux&#039;s facial proportions and facial structure is the EXACT same as those on her new Star Guardian skin. That&#039;s great because it&#039;s showing that she&#039;s the same champion despite being in a different theme, costume, etc. \r\n\r\n http://i.imgur.com/9otURYh.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QQRMqjx.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D23qCAK.jpg\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not 100% sure if this was intentional, but it definitely makes the skin just THAT much better and I hope you do this with the vast majority with all your other skins. I mean, sometimes I understand if a champion&#039;s facial structure and physical appearance needs to change to match certain skin themes (ex: Warring Kingdoms Tryndamere, etc.), but some of the skins - while good aesthetically - fail to be consistent in champion facial structure such as Headhunter Caitlyn and Woad Scout Quinn: \r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tuAomLZ.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Unl2At3.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kiy57MA.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jIuwGfi.jpg\r\n\r\nBut looking at the positive side, some other skins you guys have also kept the facial consistency really well too:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FNk0B73.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/y7ND0vf.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8MDtS7h.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3q1UL9z.jpg\r\n\r\nBut the Lux facial consistency for her new Star Guardian skin is really great and I know that both me and the rest of the community really appreciate this new artistic direction of maintaining each champion&#039;s unique facial proportions! :3","replies":[{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2015-05-09T17:24:42.869+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Good observation.  Although with Vayne, her boobjob in her SKT T1 skin kinda irked me.  Actually, Quinn's size increase in the splash art of her Woad Scout skin did kind of the same thing.  But when you look at Lux, she's amazingly consistent.  With an exception to her imperial skin, which could probably use an update to the splash, Lux's face and body are extremely consistent throughout all of her skins.  \n\nAnother great example of this is Miss Fortune (at least between her classic and arcade skins, she has a ton so I'll let them slide on that.)  Everything from the texture of her skin, to her nose shape, to her body proportions, to her sexy little pout is consistent.  Of course, with an extremely talented artist such as Michelle Hoefener on their art team, it's no surprise that the splash arts are amazing lately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Motajo","date":"2015-05-09T21:32:17.988+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.

Sure, Riot's magnificently-elaborated JoH TF had his boots prettied up compared to the model but, hey, TF's VU was long ago. The boots in the splash are really nice. JoH TF looks like a boss.\n> \n> The million-dollar-question is why the Chinese have their own splashes (and even themes, going by the wiki). Karthus' case is the exception, but really, why? (inb4 Tencent)\n\nWell during olden times, before Riot became large as it is today, they really didnt think it all the way trough in how they artwork and models would be looked upon in other countries (examples being the obvious pop reference skins). China was the worst situation since they dont actually have any copyright law in their country, and also they dont allow the showing of skulls in media (something about bringing bad luck). While cultural differences are fine, the fact remains that the game was primarily made for western audiences, but the chinese wanted the game so they edited some aspects of it that werent allowed and also adding what they felt was cool to their audience (even if some were not following copyright laws).\n\nTo my knowledge, Chinas servers arent even aknowledged as part of the many servers that Riot mantains. Not sure why, if somebody knows this info better, feel free to add it, I would really like to know why.\n\nToday, Riot is more wary of this cultural and age factor, which is why Karthus is not a skeleton and is why Graves doesnt have a cigar in his splash art. Artworks are direct links to the game visually and champions are up close and personal, they are probably the first things you will see of the game so Riot has to follow the rules (even if Graves cigar is shown in other skin splashes and in the cinematic).\n\nIn the end, because China has no copyright law in their country, they can do what the hell they want and buther someone elses ideas if they want to. The worst was some MOBA that had numerous characters from animes, dreamworks movies, and so on...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQHgfmwPccc","replies":[{"poster":"Angel Violét","date":"2015-05-09T21:19:54.850+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Chinese myself my personal understanding is this:\n1. Quality. When Riot first released League of Legends , many of the skins are really low-quality, so Tencent(The Chinse publisher for LoL) probably wanted to changed it to make it look better. Some of the early skins are terrible, just look at the old red riding annie skin.. http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/July_2011/2011_07_20_skin_sale/Annie_RedRiding.jpg\n(I'm glad Riot replaced it with the Chinese version , looks very adorable)\n2. Cultural differences. Western culture and Eastern culture is very different, and there's a huge difference in aesthetic taste.  Therefore it's necessary for Tencent to make some changes in order for it to look good to Chinese people.\n3. Money. Tencent, like any other Chinese game publishers, is a very greedy company. Since the majority of the game's profit come from the skins, it will be beneficial to make the female skins as \"sexy\" as possible and the male skins as \"swag\" as possible so that people would buy them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-09T15:59:34.807+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Now I look at Star Guardian Lux's splash art, \n\nIt's totally a cross between\n\nHoukago no Pleiades\nhttp://data1.whicdn.com/images/97770584/superthumb.jpg\n\nand \n\nFate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya\nhttp://www.emptyblue.it/data/wallpaper/FateKaleidLiner/illya_stick_c.jpg\n\nWith the touch of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura.\n\nClassy Riot, classy.\n\nhttp://media.giphy.com/media/6TvzcVLRLDNZu/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Threnodjin","date":"2015-05-10T02:08:06.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or any other generic anime female with superpowers and cutesy clothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2015-05-09T17:16:40.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really thought that too lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Leu07","date":"2015-05-09T20:14:27.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you missed miss fortune classic and arcade miss fortune <3 its the same face","replies":[]},{"poster":"VERY LOUD GOOSE","date":"2015-05-11T21:21:36.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sorry, but I completely disagree.
