To make a long story short, the Jinx on our team fired her ultimate towards a Lissandra that was around 600-800 units in front of her. I believe the Lissandra had just used her Ice Claw but had already come out of it. It would have been a direct hit, but the rocket went directly through her. I'm not sure what happened there. Even though this is a bug report, it wasn't about me but the Jinx. I was on Nami but I doubt that I was a part of the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2014-10-04T18:13:35.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened a few times there is video of it.","replies":[]}]}
