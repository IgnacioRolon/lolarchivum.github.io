This has happened a few times before, otherwise I wouldn&#039;t bother writing this. xD\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone could tell me if it&#039;s possible for me to get banned for getting false reported, and is it possible for someone who is false reporting to get banned for doing so, and encouraging other people to report me for no proper reason.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-02T17:29:57.348+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"first of all, this was a normal game, and I feel that reports in a normal game should be evaluated differently than ranked. Is this what happens in reality, no idea, but probably not.\n\nSo \"asking the enemy team to report me\" is and should be punished, because it violates logic that the enemy team would ever know enough to even file such a report, unless of course, they are in communication with/or in control of players on your own team.\n\n\n\n> so I basically said there is no reason to report someone if they have a bad game it is not an actual option in the report menu, as the closest to that is under \"Intentionally Feeding\" and I was not feeding on purpose\n\npersonally, I see nothing wrong with this, however, in bizarro land, you're not supposed to not say anything apparently.\n\nanyway, I would have voted maybe since you do get punished from time to time after false reports, and I assume it would eventually earn a ban, and is why I've adopted things like micro-sizing my chat window so that I can't even see it and muting my pings, because the best strategy for people who are human beings is to not engage in chat at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-10-02T18:08:36.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to pretend people get punished just for speaking. People get punished for consistently being jerks. If you are unable to speak to a player doing poorly (or trolling) without insulting them and causing more drama, yes, do whatever it takes to keep yourself from speaking to them. Most people are a little more mature with handling it, though, and occasionally muting a negative player is all they need.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Savage Cábbage","date":"2016-10-02T17:44:04.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advise, I will make my chat window smaller and just try ignore anyone like that in the future :)","replies":[{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-10-02T17:52:50.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"....and even though it's a valid strategy, it's still sad that you have to do this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2016-10-02T22:22:56.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This question should not be a poll. It's not an opinion based thing. If you did nothing wrong, you will not be punished no matter how many times or how many people report you.\nJust a heads up, don't ever call for reports either, that is punishable itself. Riot's policy for being flamed is ignore, report, move on. Never engage with trolls or people flaming you because it could start a huge chat war in the middle of a game. Just letting ya know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-02T17:29:50.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like polls in general, so I wont vote in it.\n\nThat being said, no you will not be punished for things you did not do no matter how many times you were reported in them. You may be punished for things you don't think \"are that bad\", but it is very rare for mistakes to happen and Riot has been open about removing the punishments in those cases.\n\nIt doesn't really matter who sided with whom, as being reported in a game one time is the same as being reported in a game nine times, its counted as one game you were reported in. In cases like this I would just mute everybody harassing you without telling them and report after the game, as arguing with you can lead to saying punishable things at times as things get heated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morality Coach","date":"2016-10-04T07:22:38.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible if you say several lines of key banned words while arguing with the toxic people.

Riot does not care about you or what others say to you. They have clearly proven this throughout the way they have handled the reporting system in the past 18 months. Guess having a bot that bans you for saying the words Fuck, shit, piss, bitch, (words that riot thinks are worse than killing someone F***** and N***** Wonder what i'm censoring) wasnt injustice enough, they had to go ahead and brainwash the community to think that saying one of these is toxic. Just uninstall. This game is nothing but a waste of time and money. I would recommend playing a group game with friends. You will have a lot more fun. I recommend something like borderlands, don't starve, terraria, and even minecraft (yes i know). those games will not stress and rage induce you to the point where you want to rip someones throat out.","replies":[]}]}
