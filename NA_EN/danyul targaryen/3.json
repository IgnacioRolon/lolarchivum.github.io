Even before that, in 2013 they weren't that great.\n\nThe last champ I fell in love with on release was Elise way back in 2012. Before Elise I often enjoyed new champion releases. Champions with kits I found fun were released with a fairly high frequency. I loved Syndra and Zyra especially. \n\nSo here's the question, where's the champions for people like me? People who don't want excessively complex champions like the ones who have been released since Vel'koz and Braum. It feels like you're overly catering to one portion of the community while completely ignoring another. \n\nEven Jihn doesn't look like what I'm talking about to be honest. He's better than most recent champs but he's still actually very complex when compared to the likes of the champs I was mentioning. He has 4 passives for example.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is if we can expect to see more champions who derive their power and interest from how their abilities interact rather than just quantity of abilities and passives or raw power in individual abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-01-13T13:23:47.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed, I want to see more champions with Garen's level of complexity.

If you can, okay do that, but you can also be useful without focusing to carries. But imagine it as Ekko, if you don't focus on carries, you're useless as fuck.\n\nLissandra is about crowd controling and creating an easier way to destory enemy. You make your team's mission easier.

Let's go through them:\n\nEkko: Ekko's a melee assassin. He does have one ability that feels like midlane mage (Q), but the rest of him is so positioning-reliant and he has to put his body on the line to get pay off so much, he really doesn't feel like a traditional mage.\n\nAzir: One of the goals with Azir was specifically not to make a traditional mage. We wanted to make something new and halfway through we decided he might live somewhere between a mage and a marksman, and that's cool and unique, but again does not satisfy the desire for a new traditional mage.\n\nVel'Koz: Professor Eyebeam comes closest to traditional midlane mage in terms of his spells (they all feel VERY magey) and overall damage profile, but thanks to his passive and his generous base damages (and less than stellar scalings), he doesn't need to go mid and is perfectly happy as a support.

Making an old-school champ is actually quite hard.\n\nThat's because you use Thresh as a gold standard for what a champ should be like. Take a step back and look at older champions and what makes their kits unique.\n\nI think Syndra is one of the best examples of champion design in the game. You should take a look at what it is that makes her work.\n\nHer abilities are individually very weak, amongst the weakest in the game. In a game mode where you could only skill one ability Syndra would be one of the weakest champs regardless of which one she skilled. Syndra's strength comes entirely from her combos and the interaction of her abilities. It gives her kit a sense of flow and levels of mastery that have been lacking in recent champions even though her kit is very simple when you break it down spell for spell.\n\nThe problem with your recent champions (at least as a traditional mage) is that you too much power into single spells now. Recent champs don't have a spell which individually does very little but which interacts with their other spells in such a way as to create more interesting gameplay for them like a Dark Sphere, Command: Attack or Rampant Growth because all their spells have so much power that doing so would absolutely break the champion.\n\nIf you want to design a good traditional mage you have to be willing to give them weak spells which interact with each other in order to create the champions gameplay. You have to be willing to give up the \"Every spell is impactfull\" philosophy that seems to have evolved since Thresh. I'd actually say Azir is one of the better 'recent' champs at this but as you said, the goal wasn't really to create a traditional mage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Danyul Targaryen","date":"2016-01-13T02:56:09.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epjest,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GecXKdrU,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-01-13T02:52:02.303+0000)\n>\n> Ekko?

It doesn't matter. Ekko is created as an assassin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
