I don't have any form of update for you, but it doesn't seem like a small subset of players have been experiencing this, and it doesn't appear to be hardware related. Hoping to know more tomorrow (I'm going to talk to the teams that were investigating).\n\nUPDATE: So as it turns out, the nature of this issue is rather finicky and hard to track down. We're going to be sending out instructions to everyone that playtests daily so that in the event they experience the fps drop, they can just use a command to spit out a performance dump and our engineers can look at the trace file. Given the occurrences of this, I'd expect that we could \"hopefully\" repro it soon and figure out a fix!","replies":[{"poster":"Maxxston","date":"2017-11-13T18:25:22.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an issue where I lose all new frames for about ~1 second every once in a while, but my FPS doesn't change radically (UI reports a drop of maybe 5-10 right after the lost frames, but then goes back to normal). \n\nIs that likely to be the same issue that you're investigating?

A decent portion of the time I've been playing with a duo partner on the same internet connection and I will intermittently have a FPS drop as you're describing where all frames are lost for about a second, but when it's over I see my MS spike and then immediately return to normal; yet my duo partner on the exact same connection does not experience this at all. It leads me to believe that it is either something computer specific or possibly something related to the game that is affecting my computer and not my duo's.\n\nDon't know if this is a more common issue or if we're just an anomaly; regardless it would be great to have this addressed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-11-13T18:02:04.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nightblue3 complained about this stuff on his steam, he tried messing with his settings and all manners of stuff but was not able to fix it as far as i know.\n\nBut the situation was the he would randomly have large FPS drops for no apparent reason, he could just be on his way to jungle from base and it would suddenly start.\n\nI am fairly sure his PC is good, at least compared to the average toaster we commoners use. \n\nI myself have been lucky enough to avoid it though x)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-11-13T14:01:51.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the issue is definitely there.

My usual normal ping is 240-250ms (it's not bad internet, I live in the opposite side of the world from U.S), but now it has been hanging around 260-270ms ( I know it's not much, but hear me out ), usually it shouldn't make much difference but instead the game itself felt like 500ms. Spells and sounds were occasionally delayed (about 2 or 3 seconds later, and everything plays all at once like BOOM), sometimes movement is sliding instead of playing the walking animation, and I do get \"attempting to reconnect\" message every 2 games or so. \n\nUsually if I get the \"attempting to reconnect\" message, I wait for a couple of seconds until the message disappears (I reconnected), I can clearly see my ping jumped to 1000+ms, so I know that's my internet's fault. But these past few days my ping doesn't change at all, it stays on 260-270ms even after \"attempting to reconnect\" messages.\n\nSo far I haven't seen anyone else with the same issue as mine so I'm actually believing that it's my internet's fault.
