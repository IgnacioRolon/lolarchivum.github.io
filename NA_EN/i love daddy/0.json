Like abilities will cast 2 seconds later and movement will not turn for a few movements after clicking. I closed almost all background programs except what windows needs to run and made sure no one else was using the internet at the time. I called my cable company and they said everything is fine on their end. What do you guys think? Help please? :(","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-14T19:36:17.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having input delays which can happen from network problems like packet loss.
