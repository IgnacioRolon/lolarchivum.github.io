Should I go for the lottery with how crazy this has been? I don't do bad in most of them and yeah it's URF but it seems like Riot really wants me to gravitate me to the holy .500 by overloading me with 1 sided stomps where we can't even enjoy urf. Had a mumu who was 0-14 8 minutes in and I'm guessing he was the one saying no to our ff vote. Never seen a losing streak as bad as this one since I started URF, it happens in ARAM and Norms Draft as well but I thought this was a \"truly random\" mode","replies":[{"poster":"Gíratína","date":"2020-02-11T22:20:35.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why are you reposting this from yesterday?","replies":[{"poster":"Tranney Hunter","date":"2020-02-11T22:40:38.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wasn't even on here yesterday?
