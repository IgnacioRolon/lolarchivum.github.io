I truly hope there&#039;s more of those audio stories in the future. As an audio aficionada, I always find it fascinating when you have to tell a story only with sounds, voices and performance, making the listener imagine everything like old stories being told by an elder or as an experience.\n\nWith that said, I made a YouTube comment where I regretted the current lack of love that Bandle City has gone with for a very long time now. As my name (and amount of Mastery points on Trist) may tell you, I&#039;m a yordle fan. I made my own character a while ago and have always appreciated the little bits of lore we had, back in the day with The Journal of Justice and with the Trist written story a while ago, but as I read the comments replying to my original, I realized most of them were quite sad to say the least. Some people stating it didn&#039;t even exist anymore, other saying it wasn&#039;t canon, and others mocking the city, saying stuff like _&quot;What are they gonna say? It&#039;s where Yordles come from? That&#039;s not compelling story telling&quot;_ and it really kinda hit me how abandoned yordles and Bandle City have become in the new lore.\n\nWe got that one amazing video about Noxus culture, we got some Ionia and Demacia stuff, and now Bilgewater once again like when Gangplank was reworked. And what do we get as yordle fans? A Pentakill video with a very questionable look (I don&#039;t intend to be mean but I **hated** so much the look they gave yordles in that video, not going for looks similar to either splash art or in game models) where they&#039;re mocked and treated like punching bags. Yordles are rarely featured on big videos like Worlds last year or MSI a couple weeks ago. Sometimes I&#039;ve even wondered if Riot just flat out hates em, which is probably not true but I sometimes get the impression. Were we always just meant to be the laughing stock of Runeterra? Must I settle with my favorite character being beat up by Warwick in an instructional video about dodgy sites that give free RP?\n\nMost of the current yordle lore has been pieced together by fans from a couple clues left by Riot, and I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s the intention but we&#039;ve been left in the dust for sure.\n\nAnd like I said on YouTube: If only you gave Bandle City and Yordle lore a **fraction** of the all love these other cities and cultures have received in the new lore.\n\nBandle City event hype? :D\n\nThanks for reading!\n{{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-06-01T22:51:35.113+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bandle City is definitely one of the top most requested region/faction updates, from players worldwide.\n\nI thought it'd be cool to cover in future, so I decided to do some research, maybe take some photos... but I couldn't find any mention of how I was supposed to get there.

(Not the kidney...)\n\nSeeing people on this thread suggesting we should strip yordles away from Bandle and draft them into other cities only makes it more clear how much in need of love the race/city is. We don't want our favorite characters to be thrown out of Bandle and fit elsewhere for the sake of simplicity. We want our own Bandle stories. Stories of magic, mystery, heroism, mischief and so much more. I'm personally super interested in yordle culture as a whole. How's their government? Is is still this kind of impossible utopia somewhat talked about in old lore? What's their gastronomy like? What's their music like? I always thought Bandle music would be reminiscing of European folk-styled music. Melodic tunes that make you think of the forest. What about their military? Do they operate as a large unit or more in small skirmish-oriented groups? Maybe because I tend to be a History Buff and always find these things about cultures interesting, but when I think of magic playing a part in all these stories it just makes me so excited for the future of Bandle City and the Yordle Race, no matter how long it may take.\n\nAfter all: Good things take time!\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"POMA","date":"2018-06-01T22:59:11.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"You're bad at narrating, better go get us some juicy inside info about future lore updates.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-01T23:03:54.469+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=POMA,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=c06Wq8Jr,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2018-06-01T22:59:11.715+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re bad at narrating, better go get us some juicy inside info about future lore updates.\n\nYou're bad at insults.

Shadow Isles as the land of the undead, Piltover and Zaun as the science cities, Noxus as the conquering army and so on.\nLooking at the roster of Yordle champions, there are even more Yordles attached to another faction primarily than Bandle City directly.\n\nBandle City Yordles:\n{{champion:42}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:45}} \n\nNon-Bandle City Yordles:\n{{champion:32}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:115}} \n\nAnd looking at these champions....

I just don't want the majority of the characters thrown out of the city for the sake of making things simpler.\nIf there's one team in Riot (other than the music team) that I trust, is the lore team. They've proven themselves capable of writing all these amazing stories within a single city/faction that continue to make the world an amazing place. The last thing I'd want would be for Bandle to become less than any other of the factions.\n\nAnd while I believe there's stories that could be told about human-yordle interaction, I also believe there's plenty to learn about yordle-only stories.

Yordles are what really made me fall in love with this game in the first place. The first champ I played with any regularity was Tris, because she was free and she was cute. Shortly after I started playing the game was when she got her VGU, and my interest in the lore, and Bandle City in particular, was piqued. I fell in love with the cute, quirky land where these little fuzzballs munched on cupcakes, worshiped a spaceship, and (for whatever reason) had a standing military. \n\nI love how yordles seem to be embodiments of virtues now, and I love the concept of \"patron yordles\" for the factions, but some of them just don't belong anywhere but good ol' Bandle. Trist is actually a a shining example of this, it'd be a _huge_ stretch to imagine her as anything but a Bandle City champ. She's a Bandle Gunner, after all, and proud of it.\n\nThere's interesting dynamics to be explored in the new lore: why these fae-like creatures would need a conventional military, and the reason behind their forays into human territory; exploring Rumble's character as a yordle who outright rejects humanity despite possibly being intrinsically linked to them; the wacky magical misadventures of Veigar and Lulu, including how they are received by other Yordles due to being even more, ah, _eccentric_ than the usual Yordle; and so on. All of this would be hard to do if Bandle City was essentially written out and made a footnote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Space Cowboy","date":"2018-06-02T00:43:07.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This thread makes me think of Canada.

The new theme they're going with for Yordles is 'nature spirits'. I guess it doesn't leave as good of an impact upon Bandle City as a whole as Yordles just being another species concentrated in a specific area of the world would, but since plenty of Yordles are still non-major city-state/nation affiliated (and in the case of Teemo and Tristana, I honestly feel like they wouldn't fit anywhere else but in Bandle City), I wouldn't give up hope on Bandle City just yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2018-06-01T23:42:19.701+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why did this need to be dramatized.

There has to be a region/faction that ends up being the last to be updated, even a last few to be updated. So if that circumstance happens to fall upon Yordles and Bandel City, then it happens. \n\nWe all know that LUs are dictated by VGUs and/or new champions, and circumstance just hasn't held an opportunity for Yordles yet. And there wont be an opportunity until that unpredictable circumstance smiles in Yordle favour. \n\nAlso I dont think Yordles are being neglected in League's promotional conent, they've had their equal share in a few things.

With a game about other worldly gods and men fighting to the death and promotional videos such as New Dawn or the Project skins videos, how do you 'promote' a Yordle? Answer for them, you don't and ignore them, hope they go away. Like Bandle City was like Marvel's 90s writing (characters, plots and teams etc), they were fine at the time and mentioned now sometimes but a bit embarressing.\n\nThe Ziggs comic helped a little but also created questions, it was nothing like Heimer's and Ziggs previous lore. Glamour was mentioned to be different and people saw through it easily. Heimer seemed afraid of being discovered instead of being comfortable in his surroundings and I didn't like that.\n\nI want Yordle lore but in a way I don't want too many things 'explained'. The don't need to have glamour explained, just say it exists and Yordle's have it innate, make sure Bandle City is a real place, don't take from what we already know just expand and define it.\n\nWe'll see I guess but it'll be a while off, lore team can be great but slow, sometimes.","replies":[]}]}
