I&#039;ve been playing since September 2012, and have never though about quitting, not even now. Yet, ever since Worlds 2018 was done and the post-season patches started rolling out, I just don&#039;t feel like playing anymore. I haven&#039;t had fun ever since the ADC massacre and Riot introducing that fake _diversity_ they talk about, but I really wanted to get Gold (I did) even if I wasn&#039;t having that much fun getting it.\n\nIt&#039;s not a lie that Crit ADC have never been in a worse state, and I&#039;ve been playing either Karthus Bot or Zoe Mid (if I can get it) in the games I&#039;ve played, but I&#039;m just not having fun. I&#039;d make a comment about damage but I think my distaste for the game stems more from overall **game flow**.\n\nHere&#039;s a realistic scenario: You&#039;re taking Drake with Jungle, AD and Mid at 21 mins. Support is warding up Baron and their Blue Jungle. Friendly Top is pushing but has no TP. Even though their Top Laner is holding back yours, you suddenly get engaged 4v3 at Drake and die. They take Drake, then summon Shelly (Herald) and push as 4. They go take two (sometimes even three) towers with that single push, while the Supp and recalling Top can&#039;t realistically defend against 4 people and Shelly. Also, since Top lane recalled to try to stop the push with Shelly, their Top now takes the plateless Top tower. Now, this isn&#039;t gonna happen every game, but it&#039;s a realistic situation and it feels HORRIBLE when something like that happens. It&#039;s just a sign of how bad the game flow can be.\n\nLeague has been one of my favorite games for a very long time. One of my favorite things to do in my free time was start up League and play Normals while listening to Audio Books or Podcasts, but lately not even that I can do. I really hate the game flow right now. I don&#039;t know why make the game faster. I don&#039;t know why try to compete directly with faster paced games (Yeah, _that_ one Battle Royale game) that are designed to be faster and be a completely different experience.\n\nI&#039;m not quitting the game, but I would be lying if I didn&#039;t say that because of what Meddler and his team have been doing, I suddenly find myself with time I didn&#039;t have before to do art, writting and music projects. I&#039;m not trying to enforce a meme, this is actually what&#039;s happening: The ones in charge of game balance/design managed to break my addiction to the game, but I don&#039;t know if making people quit is what drives the balancing process. Or maybe people aren&#039;t quitting. Dunno, Riot hasn&#039;t released player stats in a while. Google Graphs show YouTube searches for the game are lower than they were for August 2010, which means people are consuming much less content about the game than just a couple years ago, and I don't know how that translates to actual active players, but that's that I guess.\n\nFor months now I&#039;ve been an advocate to **NOT** buff Crit ADCs and instead nerf stuff around them, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s happening. I&#039;m not holding my breath for the future. I&#039;ll continue to play, but my addiction has been heavily tamed by the current state of the game. And just to end: People complaining is a sign that we care for the game and the direction it&#039;s going. The day complaints stop is the day nobody cares anymore, and then the game will truly be dead.\n\nRant over.

It was too good too early.\n\nThe only way they know how to \"help\" a class is to make sure they have a one (or at most two) item super power spike. They're falling into a trap they've set for themselves with this game pace. They don't care about late game characters or their archetype really in League of Legends. It's all about making sure everyone is as strong as early as possible.\n\nGet your first item, now go fight so the game can end before 25 - 30 mins.\n\nAs I stated in my original post: I've been an advocate for months for things around Crit ADC to be nerfed across the board instead of us doing Crit items being strong at 15 mins all over again. Instead we're going back to Trist, Xayah, Cait, etc. being super strong through Crit in the early game.

That defeats the purpose of a forum.\n\nI don't know that? They're making Crit Items feel better earlier. That's **EXACTLY** why IE was nerfed in the first place. Covering your ears and pretending reality isn't there doesn't make it less real.\n\nCritical Strike is inherently an amazing late game damage source. That's the nature of the stat. Crit **right now** is good if you reach 35 - 40 mins and 3 or 4 items, except games rarely go that late. **The only way to change this within the current game flow, is to make the stats kick in earlier**... which is exactly why IE was nerfed in the first place, and yet we're going back into that concept.\n\nI'll lay it down for you one more time:\n\n- Crit is inherently great in Late Game, **even right now**.\n- Games aren't reaching late game because of game pace.\n- To make it feel better in this game pace, you need to have those Late Game stats kick in earlier.\n- Then Crit can compete with Duskblade, Ludden, Trinity Force, etc. in terms of damage.\n- This was the reason IE was nerfed/reworked in the first place.\n- Crit shouldn't be made stronger. Stuff around it should be nerfed, slowing down game pace and having Late Game be a frequent thing.\n- They won't do that. They've stated many times they want (for some reason) to make games faster.\n\nI'm not being pessimistic. These are facts anyone can double check. And now for the big one:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KV0O1Be8b6Q?t=206\n\n_\"We've also buffed Crit items like Brawler's Gloves and Stormrazor. And in 8.15 we're doing more work **TO SHIFT THEIR POWER UP FROM LATE GAME TO EARLY AND MID GAME**\"_\n\nYou think I make stuff up or that I built my post based only on personal opinions?? No, I'm just stating known facts. If you can't accept facts, here's my answer:\n\nhttps://media.tenor.com/images/49fac996058270f42a5a77b9c7cff960/tenor.gif\n\nNow, If you think posting bad experiences in one of your favorite games _\"defeats the purpose of a forum\"_ then you probably shouldn't be here. Also, go check my topics history. I don't make topics to \"_earn up votes\"_ or anything as trivial as that. I'll always make honest topics, using facts to back my points and then complementing with personal takes, but I'm always honest and I never spam a repeated topic for the sake of up votes. I wrote this specific post pointing out that I'm not going for a meme. If they surprise me and turns out they were thinking about slowing the game down and not make Crit strong early again, then I'll be happy to be wrong with my assessment of the situation. However, as of today, reality is that game balance has tamed my addiction to the game. It's not a meme, it's what really happened. And sure, I'm being more productive in my life now, but that's besides the point. Seeing a game I love so much become this arms race of heavy early damage and no space for late game strategies just makes me sad. I'm sorry that you can't understand that.\n\nIf you want respect you first have to give it yourself. Assuming things about the motivations for someone to post a rant is not how you do that.

Why don't we discuss the future instead of dwelling on the past? \n\nDid you watch [Beyond the Rift with qtpie where Rioters talked about the state of Marksmen and had charts of their scaling to backup their claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNjxg4UwAyc)? Because it certainly doesn't look like to me you have the most recent information, you're not talking like you know what Riot's planning for the S9.\n\nI also don't care about your posting history so far.\nI don't know you and i, as much as anyone, only care about the first impressions.

Their original iterations in the game were built around a certain standard. Let's call that standard Blue. Everyone who was an original 40 champion was built under the Blue standard, in shades like Teal, Navy, Baby, and so forth.\nHowever, as the game evolved and people took it different directions and developers innovated certain aspects and designs, other colors got mixed in. The Blue suddenly became Green, and Purple, and eventually the Yellow and Red standards emerged when the Blue was finally discarded from the Green and Purple. Those two standards now have merged to become the Orange standard, and so in this day and age of the game, Blue standard designs and characters cannot be viable when compared to characters of the Orange standard. Blue is now obsolete, and if their designs are not refitted into the Orange standard, there is no way those characters can feasibly operate in the modern game without getting utterly destroyed and overpowered. \nThis is why reworks are necessary, and why it's pointless to get zealously attached to old, aging kit designs to the point where you can't play the game when they finally get replaced. It's like getting overly attached to rusty axel on your car - it's going to have to be replaced eventually, so you're investing your devotion into something with a more than limited life span.","replies":[{"poster":"Tundra Hunter","date":"2019-01-08T08:57:17.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, lol^^ \nI just can't help it =) \nI can't wait for Shaco rework though................

That's not how league is meant to be played, but that's how it is and it feels like shit. I've had games where i take the tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 and inhib at like 14 mins in one push and it genuinely isn't fun at all. It feels like shit to win off of one fight and to lose off of one fight. If your bot lane gets killed and they lose 3 towers and an inhib for it, it wasn't \"out strategized\" it's that the game has too much damage and the towers are too weak so you lose off of one minor fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2019-01-05T12:55:07.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"It was 21 minutes in, that's mid game, champs are at the point where towers are weak.

Then they lost the teamfight as is to be expected.\n\nThey didnt just minor fuck up.\n\nThey exposed themself to a 3v4 fight against the enemy team who already had an advantage on them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2019-01-05T14:30:14.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I think that there's a clear disconnect with the players who don't really know how to strategize, they just expect that they can screw up in a crucial moment and think they should still get plenty of chances to make it right again.\n\nThere's a clear reward when winning fights: your team or you get stronger with more gold and time to do what you intend to do, which translates to more downtime for your enemy. What would be the point of early fights if no amount of screwups mattered and the team that gets these kills isn't properly rewarded? This only sets a bad example of making fights feel pretty pointless when you should instead be focused on farming for a lot of minutes first.\n\nThen this further translates into champions having their first fights in mid-game, where the effect of first deaths can translate into multiple objectives lost, which can make it feel like one fight costs you half of your base or giving the enemy a big advantage you can't come from easily. This doesn't happen in the early game now - especially when turret plating is still up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SirHydro","date":"2019-01-05T14:34:44.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Terozu,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bccOpE24,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-01-05T11:25:11.151+0000)\n>\n> so....\n> what im readingis that the team out strategized you, and won a team fight, so it feels shitty they were rewarded for it?\n\nYou miss out on alot of jokes don't you?
