I have done some research and this seems to be a recurring issue with Comcast customers that also play League. These random ping spikes make it incredibly tough to play League at my full capacity as these ping spikes happen quite frequently. I am hoping that maybe someone that has found a way to resolve this issue will arise to help me or perhaps a Riot employee can assist me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-21T16:03:29.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rineyy provided a great reply that touches the basic steps to take. Additionally, I wanted to mention that irregular latency (ping) and spiking is often caused by ISP routing changes or problems with your local or ISP's network hardware. The connection guide Rineyy linked will take you through the basic troubleshooting levels of how to solve this issue.
