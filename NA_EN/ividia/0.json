It sucks to be the bearer of bad news here, but we don't support account gifting or trading so I don't think there's much we can do,  Contact us through an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and we see if there are any options to help.  We'll reply back as soon as we can!","replies":[]}]}
