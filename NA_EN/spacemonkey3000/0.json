If, as Riot says, they eventually, after many years, go back and rework already reworked and updated champions, and they do so to Fiora, then there will be the exact same backlash as there is today.\n\nHere's the thing, and the actual most important thing with that:\n\nYou pull stuff like this, and you continue to do so, you annoy your PAYING customers.  \n\nWhen you sell a product to someone, who trusts you as a company enough to spend money on a product that isn't even physical, and they KNOW they don't \"own\", then turn around and change it with no feedback (when nothing was wrong with it to begin with) and turn your nose when it annoys them, they aren't going to just keep paying you for products in the future. \n\nIt has nothing to do with attachment, it has nothing to do with ownership, it has nothing to do with \"hating change\", it has to do with treating people paying for your product with respect and earning and keeping trust. If you continuously change, and swap, and remove features a person pays for, they eventually start to lose trust. \n\nIt might be one person liking the previous Fiora skin because they bought it for whatever reason, and it changes, and now they don't like it. They might be looking at a new skin and going \"hm, I can buy rp, but if I buy this now, will they just change it later?\" and put their card away, or go spend that money elsewhere. that is one instance and one example, but there are examples of it all over the place you could make, different people, different skins/champions, etc etc. \n\nSure you can't please everyone, but what's the point of pissing someone off because of this fact? Sure 1 person might not seem like a lot, but one loud voice can catch the attention of 10 people, then 10 loud voices can catch the attention of 10 each, and so on. One person with an instance like this can get the attention of others and then they say \"yeah, that is shitty. What if they did that to what I like?\".\n\nYou might be fine to argue and defend Riot's shifty actions, but there are an equal amount that are more than happy to keep their hard earned money, and eventually the lost trust will build up until they never pull their wallet out again (like with me not buying rp in over a year and a half).\n\n----\n\nAlso the OP wasn't having an issue with Fiora's rework, that wasn't and isn't an issue. The issue was the skin, which realistically made no sense to update or change, because her skins (especially in game model wise) were pretty good, especially compared to a large portion of the terrible ones they still haven't fixed like pizza feet Taric/Morde who they could have spent time fixing, instead of annoying people messing with Fiora, who was perfectly fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2015-08-01T21:53:16.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Riot, and not you, own the content, and as such, can do with it as they please.\"\n\nWhile they _can_, as is technically their right given the EULA, it is not necessarily a good thing doing it.\nIf Riot pisses off - or rather, pisses _on_ - enough people, who then will provide monetary support to them, which I can only assume is what's paying their bills?\n\nAny company wishing to be in the business should know they can only line their own pockets at the expense of their customerbase for so long before it's all over (is exploit too strong a word?).

All champions and skins are subject to change (older are more likely of course), so be aware of that before you make a purchase.\n---\n> http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4572524\nHey all,\n>\nOver the past two years we've been ramping up our ability to steadily modernize champions' art, background and gameplay, to the point where champion updates have become an integral part of the overall evolution of League of Legends. When we first began making these updates we were mindful of the fact that we were altering content to which players might be very attached, and with that in mind we agreed to the handful of refund requests from the passionate players who owned updated champions and who sent a ticket to Player Support. \n>\nBack then we could do these individual gestures of goodwill because the number of refund requests was pretty low. Requests came largely from players who mained the champ. Once the policy was made public, there was a 10,000%+ spike in requests. We looked at the data and found that a very large majority of requests were from players who werent actively invested in the champion pre-update, but were trying to get back RP or IP without using a refund token.\n>\nTo give you an idea of the impact, every recent champion update has resulted in a storm of support tickets larger than what we typically see from a full day of major server instability. Combine this with the fact that we're on pace to double our annual number of champion updates (6 in 2013, already 7 in first half of 2014) and it begins to significantly impact Player Support's ability to handle critical issues like account recoveries and tech support.\n>\nAs a result of these factors, we've decided that beginning with the Karthus champion update, we will stop processing refund requests for updated champions. It would be awesome to have a process that specifically targets those players significantly impacted by an update and doesn't interfere with Player Support's ability to quickly solve vital support issues, but we are far off from a good solution to this.\n>\nWe know this may be disappointing for some players, particularly those actively playing and invested in updated champions. To help address this issue, the champion update team is working on increased transparency (http://community.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/champions-skins/txxQETbY-champion-updateupdate ) when it comes to which champions they're working on. Additionally, the Player Support team has created a central hub (https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/40116190-Champion-Rework-Schedule ) with info on past, present, and future champion updates. These efforts should both help you plan your purchases and use of refund tokens and give you better places to voice your feedback and help us fine-tune updates. \n>\nIf you have any questions about this change, please leave them below and we'll do our best to address them.\n\n---\n\nBasically, only a small fraction of players that request a refund for updates/reworks actually use that champion or skin. The rest are people that already regretted their choice and are using the change as an opportunity to avoid the consequences of buyer's remorse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-08-01T05:23:07.390+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I asked this already and I was told the same.  If I buy something, I expect to get what I paid for.  If I purchase something from an artist because I like it... and a year later the artist dislikes his old style... he doesn't get to come into my house, rip up my art and draw me a new one in the new style that he now prefers to use.  That isn't what I paid for!  What's more... I don't LIKE the new style.  I would never have paid for it!  I don't want it.\n\nYou took my money for something, then swapped it out for a turd and said \"Oh, lol... our policy is not to give refunds\".  The compassion shown for their playerbase is staggering here.  And the worst part is, riot is big enough now to just... not care.  They don't need to.  As little as it would take to refund a handful of people for a skin... they won't.  Because they don't need to.  The anger over this won't affect their income in the least.  And that's what it's about... income.  They're either concerned that enough people would ask for refunds that it would actually be a problem for them... a blip on the radar of their profits.  In which case... maybe realize what this means about the quality of the product you're forcing down our throats and fix it!  \n\nAlternately, they just don't want their players to think that they can call them on their products.  EVER.  This is... slightly more understandable, since people will gripe and demand refunds over every stupid thing... but so what?  If enough people dislike the skin that you're changing... either don't change it or give them back their money!  Don't flip the bird to the players who bought the skin in the first place.  Show your fans you give a crap about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-08-01T05:36:10.780+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deitrix,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EK9EFG9B,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-01T05:23:07.390+0000)\n>\n>  I don't LIKE the new style.  I would never have paid for it!  I don't want it.\n\nThis sums up a lot right here. There are plenty of instance where if the current style was the style at the time of purchase, people never would have spent the money on it. \n\nChanging something that is already fine, makes no sense, and refusing to refund someone even in rp for a change they didn't want for a purchase, is ridiculous. \n\nIf I was to buy DJ Sona today, and tomorrow they decided to change all of her songs to country music and change her head to Yi (random example), I would be pissed. I like the current skin, and that is what I paid for and why I paid for it. You can't charge for something then change it and go \"meh, too bad I already have your money\". That is yet again a quick way to make that person roll their eyes the next time there is something to buy, because they likely will remember the lost trust from the last incident, and don't want to be burned a second time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2015-08-01T05:01:50.513+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just hope you don't like a skin for a champ that is getting a rework.

Hi-Rez is automatically refunding all Gems (RP) and Favor (IP) to every player who's bought a Loki skin in the past. After the VU, if players like how the newly designed skins look, they can just purchase them again with what they were refunded, and if they don't, they can use it on other skins for other champs.
