Login, queue, champ select all fine.  On my  PBE account game play sound is fine.  This began a couple of days ago, seemingly right after registering my pbe account and playing on it for the first time.  \r\n\r\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled regular league, made sure other apps not running, and checked setting both in game and on computer.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?  This is very frustrating....

Sometimes your settings get a little wonky server side, and no matter how you adjust them they will keep reverting to the server saved settings. If this doesn't help, there's also a really weird bug our techs have been tracking, and they requested a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with some game logs if the reset doesn't help!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
