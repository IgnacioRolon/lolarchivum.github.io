The upated client is still in testing so I don't have any information on its availability there.  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nSelect the clubs (middle) chat tab to find a section for Clubs and Public Chat.  There will be an option at the bottom to join a chat room.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
