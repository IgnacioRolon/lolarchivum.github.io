This is why all disconnections are treated equally and why penalties cannot be removed or modified.\n\nYour freezing issue during champ select is likely caused by your client having a poor connection to the matchmaking servers. I strongly recommend you work through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to prevent this from happening in the future.\n\nLet me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kagepaladin","date":"2016-10-02T15:31:11.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I joined a game bought items went mid asked the riven to go top after she said no i went top and she got killed by the syndra at level 1-2, we got offered to /remake and it passed with 2 votes for and 3 votes against and I lost LP. their is definitely some major issues with their /remake system if they even looked at chat logs for the match they would see that I wasnt dced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DÃªcoy","date":"2016-10-02T07:23:40.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you were the reason your team could start Remake vote, game treated your account as Leaver.
