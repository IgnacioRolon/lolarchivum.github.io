Whenever she stunned me against terrain, I would be unable to move away from the terrain afterwards. If she would have left, I may have been stuck permanently. This also occurred to the Miss Fortune on our team. \r\nStep 1: Have Poppy stun you against Natural Terrain\r\nStep 2: Remain stuck there\r\nI am sorry if this was random, but it happened twice to me in the exact same match. I also didn&#039;t have video of it, because I don&#039;t normally record my matches. If anyone can confirm or deny this, please do.\r\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"DaddyAvo","date":"2015-10-29T20:30:44.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
