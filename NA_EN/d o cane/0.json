League has become an absolute s***tfest, for what concerns Crowd Control abilities. This was less of a problem until a few seasons ago, when you actually had to decide to build damage over utility (CDR) or viceversa. Reaching that sweet 40% cdr and mindlessly chain CCing anything on sight, without even actually TRY  to CHAIN it counting seconds or whatever , is now WAY too simple.  Trying to exploit a window of opportunity in any teamfight, against almost any team comp has become simply impossible. If you are a bruiser or a tank, you just go in TO DIE. You can't peel, you can't land a full combo. \n\nYou can manage to dodge a few enemies' skillshots, sure, but they can cycle them indefinitely and eventually you'll get hit by something. Everybody has some sort of hard CC nowadays. And if you get hit, you are done. Your resistances count nothing. True damage is now almost everywhere, MR has had its effects reduced for a long time now. \n\nThis is now aknowledged by everybody, but there are still just 2 items and 1 rune that give tenacity. And don't forget that tenacity has multiplicative stacking, so if you eventually reach that \"90%\" you have actually thrown your moneay in an effective 60% tenacity. But hey, that doesn't count against knockups, displacements etc. You get pinned down and bounced around like a roadkill dog until you get greyscreen.\n\nA few champs now have abilities with built in tenacity now (Urgot, Rammus, Garen). Thanks for nothing mama Riot. Most of these abilities reduce duration of foresaid cc (excluding knockups) but they have inheritly affect you with slows (WTF!). \n\nAnd then there's Ornn. With his Bellow's Breath. Oh boy. It was good when you could actually deny some bulls***t CC and tank its damage with A SHIELD. Which got removed. Making you a slow walking suicide marionette burping useless low range flames.\n\nWhen will riot actually address this problem and give some kind of wide spread counter that's not a 2 seconds item active that, by the way, can't be built on any kind of champ without having its money wasted? The damage with champ design has been done. Rules have been broken, champs that are bruisersmageassassins with invisibility mobility utility and boggling damage have been created. It's too late to go back in an acceptable ETA on that. There's a need for an actual solution to this gameplay toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Cavemantero","date":"2019-01-23T02:32:26.917+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":5,"body":"The damage is what is out of control.

Beeing CCed for 2 sec as a tank ins S2 was like 'meh, whatever', now it's basically a death sentence later on in the game.\n\nAnd as you said, this leads to melees hardly doing anything in a teamfight unless they can take down a target befor it really responds and windows of opportunity barly exist anymore.\n\nWith damage lower, it would be much less of a problem, though the overall uptime of CC in most teamcomps still needs to be adressed regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serge THE GREAT","date":"2019-01-23T13:34:37.110+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't forget that a few years ago Riot nerfed Mercury Treads and (IIRC) changed the way Tenacity ratios work.","replies":[{"poster":"D O Cane","date":"2019-01-23T13:44:39.740+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just like they reduced or totally removed bonus movement speed from bruiser items, just to make it even harder..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2019-01-23T11:41:21.185+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"remember when anivia was considered high CC?\n\n*laughs in slow resistance tenacity and bad scaling with CDR*","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Bad Touch","date":"2019-01-23T14:36:56.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
