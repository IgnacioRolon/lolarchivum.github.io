I have an issue with my League games where on random occasions, some days more than others, I will enter a game and my ability keys will not work. I am unable to recall, smart cast abilities, or use actives on my items. If I want to use an ability, I have to click on the ability with my mouse and click on the target, mouse click the recall button, etc. \r\n\r\nSo far, if I restart the client (sometimes several times), the issue resolves itself and I can continue with my game. However, I am concerned that at some point it won't work and I'll either be unable to reconnect and be subject to LeaverBuster, or I'll be super behind in the game and still unable to use my ability keys. Could someone help me fix this? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"D4rkWolf10","date":"2016-09-13T18:06:30.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Porocles, I will try this when I get home. Thank you for trying to help so quickly!\n\nI will say that unless configuring smart cast counts as modifying my game files, I don't think I ever have. I'm not a super technically savvy person with computers. I just download the game and play. Lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T17:57:21.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you made any modifications to your game files?  It sounds like your configuration folder may have messed up.  Let's reset it to default to see if that will do the trick:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nTest it out in a custom game to prevent any penalties!  Let me know if you still have any issues!","replies":[]}]}
