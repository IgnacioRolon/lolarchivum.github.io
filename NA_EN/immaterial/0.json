I think the reason for that is because everything in her kit is just too balanced and shows very little strength/weakness or ability to counter-play. She doesnt do enough damage to snowball like champions in the current meta, but she also has the ability to get out of most situations so its almost impossible to catch an out of place Ahri without landing a point and click stun or setting an ambush. Shes the epitome of a SAFE pick. Riot developers did TOO good of a job balancing her to the point where she is so balanced she cant tilt the game one way or the other on her own (think a balancing scale that is perfectly flat).\r\n\r\nThat being said I had a few ideas for a rework on Ahri as small tweeks to her current abilities doesnt seem like it could get anything done in terms of changing her hyper balanced nature. She needs incentive to dash into fights as well as some warning/tell that ahri is coming in to fuck up your day.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s my ideas for Ahri:\r\nStarting with R as its the largest change:\r\n\r\n&bull;** R**: Ahri absorbs her essence orb transforming her into a nine tailed fox temporarily. She retains her range however auto attacks come out of a glow on the end of her tails instead of her essence orb. While she is transformed her abilities becomes augmented slightly and her ult is replaced by a dash ability. There is a brief animation where she transforms and then is able to use the dashes. (Think when riven ults where she pauses as her sword reforges and is then able to use her ult again after the sword is reforged.)\r\n\r\n&bull;** R Dash**: Ahri dashes in a chosen direction and refreshes her W&#039;s CD. If Ahri dashes closer to an enemy champion she gains a magic damage shield that grants her flat ability power as long as the shield persists. If Ahri dashes away from enemy champions the dash range is reduced. \r\n\r\nDashing towards enemies takes priority of dashing away, so dashing from one enemy at another still grants the shield.\r\n\r\n&bull;** Passive**: After dealing ability damage twice to enemy champions or large monsters, Ahri will mark them for a set time. Damaging marked enemies with ability damage deals a small bonus flat magic damage per hit. Killing marked enemies heals ahri for a flat amount with an ap ratio (doubled vs champions) as well as granting a portion of her abilities&#039; CDs.\r\n\r\n&bull;** Q**: Ahri throws a ball of essence at a circle ground target location dealing magic damage while traveling then explodes at the ground target location, revealing the area, and dealing the same damage pre-mitigation again as true damage. If the ground target explosion hits an enemy unit she gains a flat amount of HP/5 based on the number of enemy units hit. \r\n\r\n&bull;** Q augmented**: The explosion causes a DOT burn over 2 seconds dealing true damage equal to half of the damage dealt by the explosion.\r\n\r\n&bull;** W**: Ahri spawns 3 fox fire orbs around her for a duration. Ahri&#039;s next auto attack will send the fox fire orbs at the target dealing bonus magic damage. Each orb deals damage separately but spell shielding the first orb will shield from every later orb (think syndra ult). Only the first orb counts towards marking the enemy, however each orb deals the bonus damage from her passive if attacking a marked target. Blind causes the orbs to miss.\r\n\r\n&bull;** W augmented**: 4,5,6 fox fire orbs spawn instead of 3 increasing the damage based on number of orbs. Number of orbs increases with ult rank.\r\n\r\n&bull;** E**: Ahri sends out a ball of essence that stops on the first enemy unit hit. The unit hit is damaged, charmed for a short duration, and slowed for the duration of the charm.\r\n\r\n&bull;** E augmented**: The charm duration is extended.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-13T23:06:34.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too late.","replies":[{"poster":"Immaterial","date":"2018-03-13T23:13:03.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realize its too late. It was just my idea. I like to get the ideas out there in hopes it inspires later champions and to get feedback about what others think. They've also pretty much guaranteed that its only going to be a numbers tweak for her W or Ult. ","replies":[]}]}]}
