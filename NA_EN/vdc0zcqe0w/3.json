He doesn't even have a presence in the game till level 6 with his ultimate. His only form of gap closure as a jungler which is fairly weak. If a champion like Warwick has such a high win rate than why isn't he played in pro play? Because he is trash in terms of competitive and that anything can work in soloq. Hell you can win games with soraka top, jungle alister, and adc rengar if you know what your doing with a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaceUp23","date":"2015-08-07T23:50:07.037+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'm pretty sure only Ahri mains are saying she is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Ancestor007","date":"2015-08-08T11:25:42.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're wrong then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bronzoid","date":"2015-08-09T00:14:55.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, I'm gonna say this again:\n\nLow pick rate and high win rate = generally doesn't mean much\nHigh pick rate and high win rate = champ is op\n\nIt's really that simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2015-08-08T22:54:14.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Finally, someone with a brain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaykalos","date":"2015-08-08T20:59:18.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Combination of numbers means something, one alone number nop, u need popularity/competitive wr/popularity solo q, if all numbers agree u cant say winrates don't mean shit .\n At competitive popularity is more important than win ratio,  but i dont know how more important (2 times 1.2 times 1.5......), , because if a champion get picked as counterpick only 6 times u cant say OP 5/6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-08-08T20:26:25.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that win rates can be deceptive, but when a champion has one of the highest win rates thru multiple metas, that champion needs nerfing for sure.","replies":[]}]}
