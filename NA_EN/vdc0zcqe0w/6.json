People complain because they're not having fun playing against the champion, and win percentages are only a small part of it. To quote Dyrus, \"I just want to play some League of Legends\". Meaning going through the game of laning/trading/dueling, skirmishing/ganking, teamfighting, and _feeling useful while doing it_.\n\nLet's go through some hated champs quickly:\n\n* Yasuo/Fizz: dodge all your skillshots by zooming around. another skill makes you invulnerable. Yasuo even has an extra passive shield\n\n* Vayne (also Fiora): build whatever resists you want, Vayne can still kill you in a certain number of autos.\n\n* Soraka (also Darius): you tried to trade. the enemy took no net damage\n\n* Kalista: have no gap closer? can't touch her at all while she kills you\n\n\nIn general, mages:\n\n* _don't have excessive mobility / self-peel_. Would you rather try to hit Veigar with a skill shot, or Yasuo/LeBlanc zooming and blinking all over the place.\n\n* _have avoidable skillshots_. Lux can be 20-0-10, but you can still sidestep her spells. Ahri has high win and pick rates too, but she has to work to land her charm. Orianna's been relevant forever, but when she lands a 5-man shockwave, it's _your team's fault_ for not only clumping against an Orianna, but also not reacting in the massive amounts of time before the ball was in place.\n\n* _can be suppressed even when fed_. Related to the first point, but also includes sustain / duel potential. Your mid lane fed Lux? She'll still die if you dive her. Mages aren't just good at teamfighting, they're reliant on it.\n\nAll of which are fun to play _against_.\n\nWhich mages do people hate? Annie of the \"I stun and burst you and you can't do anything about it\" doesn't let you respond. A fed Swain becomes impossible to kill and is hated. LeBlanc gets plenty of hate for the mobility, but she's more of an assassin anyways.\n\nAs for Blitzcrank/Janna, I've seen plenty of hate for Blitzcrank and protests at the Janna nerfs, so I don't really agree with OP's premise. Thresh is probably the most hated support and he falls on the tanky side too.","replies":[{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-09-28T23:55:36.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Everything you just described about mages could be loosely applied to Morgana, and people fucking HATED her for years.","replies":[{"poster":"o9y9pcvBhd","date":"2015-09-29T04:38:50.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh, they hated one skill on her","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Autrah Fang","date":"2015-09-28T18:53:42.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2015-09-28T19:01:33.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"wait... its fun playing against zed? lane against him and once he hits 9 he can R > q > ignite and you die while he goes back to safery. i dont know about you but that isnt fun to me at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-09-28T19:32:49.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Voluug13,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MTWuM9c1,comment-id=000200030000,timestamp=2015-09-28T19:01:33.085+0000)\n>\n> wait... its fun playing against zed? lane against him and once he hits 9 he can R > q > ignite and you die while he goes back to safery. i dont know about you but that isnt fun to me at all.\n\nWhat?

Also people don't like blitzcrank either.\n\nIn what world ? Like what game are you playing ?\n\nVayne and Yasuo have massive weaknesses that can be exploited, mid to late game they become extremely powerful and less fun to play against ( I am tired of both of them also, but to suggest they are more unfun to play against than viegar and lux is straight crazy).\n\n Viegar and Lux sit under tower all day throwing cc at you and when one finally hits **YOU DIE**. Lux is almost impossible to punish for the mistakes she makes in lane due to her massive range and being able to hide under turret all day. Lux cannot be interacted with without Jungle help and even then you have to be damn careful not to get double killed. The recent buffs did not make Lux good, she was already good and already enjoyed a high win rate. The recent buffs got Lux noticed by the people and now she is in every game. Lux is far to safe of a champion for her current power level, bordering on op even. Viegar on the other hand is very op, but a little less safe than Lux and honestly needs immediate adjustment.","replies":[{"poster":"Wyrmblade","date":"2015-09-29T03:02:38.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne and Yasuo don't have massive weaknesses, they have weaknesses, but they're covered up by other parts of their kit/role.\n\nVayne has a weak early game, but she'll almost always have a support that will help her stop you from bullying her out of lane. She has no poke, but she does enough damage that she never needs it. She has average range for an ADC, but she has a dash, a knockback, and invisibilty to get out of danger. She's weak to siege, but the threat of her damage can often keep people off the tower.\n\nYasuo is melee, but he has a shield, a shield that blocks projectiles, and the second best combat mobility in the game to prevent poke. Yasuo needs a knock up to ult, but that knock up can be from any player in the game, including things you can't dodge like a lee sin kick or a vayne condemn. His E sends him at a fixed distance, but he can often use it again before your spell can get there, meaning you need to predict two or even three dodges ahead when trying to land poke against him, and he can often use that time to go a different route.\n\nVayne is unfun to play against because she has very little counterplay. \nShe can beat pretty much any other champion in the game in a 1v1 duel when played decently, so unless you have extremely long range and lots of safety, like Cait or Xerath, you can't risk poking her most of the time because she has her passive and a low CD dash that makes her invisible to get to you. \nThere is not a single ability in her kit that can be dodged aside from the stun on her E, so if she has better stats than you, she wins the fight pretty much every time. This means if she gets ahead, she snowballs hard, and she does percent health true damage, making building against her impossible (No, Frozen Heart and Randuins barely help and it's ludicrous that you'd have to build both every time a vayne is in the game.) \nFrom a non-gameplay standpoint, she attacks in an infuriatingly smug, non-nonchalant way, her model is pretty bad, and her auto attack sound effects are loud and obnoxious.\n\nYasuo is unfun to play against because (guess) he has very little counterplay.\nHis Q and E deal instant damage, meaning there's no way to flash out of them, shield yourself, or stun him before he can get it off, you have to predict when he'll use them instead. His W comes out instantly and can block any projectile in the game, with no limits on what it can block or how much it can block. \nThe third charge of his Q can be dodged, but Yasuo can hold it for ten seconds to pressure, and if he uses E, you can't dodge it. Yasuo's ultimate is instant lockdown extends existing lockdown and deals damage, and dodging it means dodging every form of knock up or back in the game.\nFrom a non-gameplay standpoint, getting killed by an edgy anime guy feels kind of shitty.\n\nYasuo and Vayne's kit make it easy for them to outplay people, meanwhile, most champions have almost no way to outplay them.\n\nMeanwhile, every ability Lux has is a skillshot. When you trade against Lux, you can come out ahead as long as you're skilled enough to dodge her abilities (Yes, her E and Ult can be dodged.) If Lux has higher stats than you, you can OUTPLAY her and still have a chance. Lux can't farm from under tower forever because she has mana. \nIf she tries to harass you then she'll push the wave, meaning she can't just sit under her tower, which leaves her vulnerable because she has no mobility. Her lack of mobility also means that if you can dodge her abilities, she has no way to escape from you, so you can kill her without having to keep her locked/poked down 100-0.\n\nALL of the above paragraph applies to Veigar, except that you can't dodge his ultimate, but it's okay because he's squishy and has no mobility to get near you with its low range. You have to make a mistake and stand in his E first, unlike Vayne and Yasuo, who if they have better numbers than you, can kill you without landing any hard skillshots beforehand.\n\nHaving ways to play against other champions is fun because it makes you feel like you're better than them when you beat them, you didn't win because they made a mistake, you won because you made no mistakes, and that feels good.\nWinning with skill is more fun than winning with stats, and I'm sure most people can agree with that.\n\nThis is earth, and I'm playing League of Legends.
