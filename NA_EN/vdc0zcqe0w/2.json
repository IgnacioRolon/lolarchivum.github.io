Nothing can be done about it short of reworking the champions.\n\nZyra is also very weak against assassins, which are meta right now. This means that Zyra is not being played mid also to her getting shit on by all Meta picks.\n\nNot all of the champions in this game that are not being played are \"weak\". They are just A: Very team reliant or B: countered by meta champions.\n\nNow, logic dictates that if Champion A is popular, and champion B is a counter to champion A, B champions will also become popular. A champions will fall out of favor, and B will be the new meta. This is the healthy meta cycle.\n\nChampions that would be outclassed in every aspect (Or are so toxic that Riot keeps them shit on purpose), are the champions that are underpowered and need buffs / reworks.\n\nZyra is a great supp in this meta, but is not a good midlaner atm. However, she should theoretically become popular midlane at some point if the cycle progresses without Riot nerfing champions who dont need to be nerfed, or adding an OP item, etc etc. (Sona OP, If Graves gets nerfed imma /ff)\n\nMidlane is going to become very diverse after these upcoming pbe nerfs. Zyra mid might become a thing very very soon.\n\nIf Lee ever gets balanced, then ALOT of immobile champs could be played. I swear the amount of champions that are stupid risky to play simply because of Lee Sin is... bad design.

But that also brings me back to my original statement, not much can be done short of reworking her in some way. She is at best a niche midlaner.\n\nSimple damage increases would make her OP, as she has a large amount of cc, utility, and lockdown. These buffs would also very likely just cause her to be played as  a supp even more.\n\nNow I know she isnt god tier Thresh level popularity, but she is not as underplayed or underpowered as... lets say... Taric.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-01-27T09:20:27.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no dude EVERY champ HAS GOT TO be played competitively, because it mirrors its strenght and influences your soloQ performance (if the champ is strong you're gonna do good)\n\nZyra is unpopular both in competitive and in soloq, i never see her unless i'm the one playing her, just watch statistics\n\nactually Thresh is not that good now, and that's completely fine to me because he's a terrible champ to play against so it's ok\n\nto clarify, i STILL play her in soloq, because she's my main, because i like to play her and because i get good results with her, but i still can't deny the fact that she's bad, so i'm going to play a bad champion KNOWING that she's bad\n\ni know Taric is shit tier, they are gonna rework him in fact, but apparently Zyra being bad too is completely legit lol","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-01-27T11:46:07.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude that is not how it works at all.\n\nI even gave an example.\n\nNot every champion is viable competitively. The lcs meta is different AND there are some champions that thrive on enemy mistakes (Shaco, Fiora) who are non existent in lcs/lks, but VERY strong in solo q. Another example is Yi. Yet another example is Riven.\n\nSolo q and lcs are not the same thing on any level.\n\nThe sooner you understand this the better.\n\nThis game should not be balanced soley because of either. Season one Eve and Olaf are testament to this. \n\nAlso, Thresh is not and never will be bad. You are making statistics up now. He is one of, if not the, most popular support in the game.\n\nThe dude is hella picked in both competitive and yolo q.

Mid Zyra isn't suffering from meta problems; she's just weak against almost all mid lane candidates.\n\nI'm having a hard time thinking of any mid laner she has a plus matchup against.  Maybe Yasuo.  If Annie ever goes mid, that's one.  It's certainly a short list though.","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-01-27T00:04:59.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at this point i think they should just force her into a role, i'm quite tired about this situation tbh :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rockman","date":"2015-01-26T15:59:03.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-01-26T16:29:36.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so apparently it's intended for her to suck :/, but somehow Xerath having 340 MS it's intended too :/\n\nLux can do both...man i can't take you seriously if you say so...\n\nlike, statistics don't lie...never picked competitively in 7 months or so","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"balbraaksel","date":"2015-01-26T16:31:37.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why do you need AP ratio's when you have {{item:3151}} ?\nI certainly don't care when I support with her.\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3135}} \nIs all you need to be APC.","replies":[]}]}
