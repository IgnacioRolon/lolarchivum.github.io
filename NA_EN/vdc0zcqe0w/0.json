But you've already made towers so weak that now you can just tower dive and kill their entire team without punishment. Or buff your minion wave with something like {{item:3060}} or baron buff. At this point, poke is just an annoyance that doesn't add that much fun or strategy to the game, especially when cooldowns and mana costs are basically nonexistent. \n\nIt's much more satisfying to hit a long-range poke if it cost like 200 mana and had a 20 second cooldown, for example. When poke is essentially free it feels dull to use and frustrating to be used against you.\n\nPoke is like the definition of non-interactive gameplay. \"I'm just going to keep pressing 'Q' over and over until I win\" as is the entire premise behind {{champion:115}} champion design.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2015-08-14T13:36:50.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-_- and ended up with sona's \"rework\" *cough* gutting * cough cough *even though everyone on the pbe said it was shit :|","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2015-08-13T13:55:13.125+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a janna player, I'd rather play against Sona, Soraka, and Nami than Thresh, Leona and Blitz.

Honestly, I'm not smart with this game. Everything I'm saying is opinionated and probably inaccurate, however this is what I believe is the issue. \n\nLulu probably has the most CC out of virtually every support in the entire game. But in exchange, what does she lose? Mana. A LOT of it. I don't know about you, but I absolutely hate using Lulu for that one reason. She's like... a hybrid of all-in and poke, and only because she uses so much mana with her abilities. She NEEDS to go all in and get kills fast, because if she doesn't, she kinda just... sits there, manaless. I even have mana regen runes specifically for her as well as Nami, and with Nami I don't have a problem at all mana wise, but Lulu, my god. This brings up the question \"Why don't we often see Nami either?\" Once again, this is majorly due to the fact that she doesn't support the same way Thresh does. Thresh can become safe, or aggressive, and all at the same time, ensure his ADC never ever dies. Nami? She has to go aggressive! What is the point if you don't ult, then land a bubble, then use Ebb and Flow, then use Tidecallers Blessing on your ADC to just go all in aggressive and destroy! But... what am I supposed to do against a Thresh? He can prevent his ADC from EVER dying to my FULL COMBO as both Nami and Lulu just because of his overloaded kit. Do I hate Thresh? No, because if I do actually manage a victory against him in lane, it feels overwhelmingly good. But the problem? This is very very difficult to do. Thresh is the exact opposite of Lulu. Lulu is very situational, requiring not only a very reactive and preferably mobile ADC, but to also be against people she can exploit. Same with Nami. Nami gets hooked once, and she dies. Lulu won't instantly die... unless she has no mana! Thresh? Thresh can fit into anything. Any team composition. Any laning composition. Tell me, with what ADC does he NOT synergize with? Exactly. And against who does he struggle against? Exactly. He's low risk, high reward, and I find it completely unfair. \n\nBack to Karma. Karma has two major issues. \n\n1. She has no technical ultimate. I mean, think about it. It enhances her abilities, yes. However, when that shit is on CD, what is she? Nothing. She sits, waiting for her ultimate to come back to either, inflict massive amount of damage, provide her AOE miniature Sivir ultimate, or steal HP from the enemy and CC them for longer. Otherwise, all she can do is poke with a Q that, provided still does quite a lot of damage, is not anywhere near enough to counter tanky people like Thresh or Blitzcrank or Leona who can go all in on her ADC. I mean, what happens in Leona goes all in on your ADC? You can use your ultimate to AOE shield him hm? But then you sacrifice longer CC from her W, which keep in mind, takes so long to ACTUALLY CC the opponent that you most likely won't even be able to save your ADC from an all-in. So then you think \"So I can use my ultimate on my tether so I can stun them for longer?\" Alright. But then you are forced to sit relatively close to the enemy to not break the tether, which can be already broken relatively easily by just walking away and going back in. So you're putting yourself in danger, which can then cause them to go all in on YOU. Now, you've just miserably failed stunning one enemy, and even if you did manage to stun them, that all in support will just switch focus to you. So now, your shield is on CD because you just used it on your ADC for THEM to run away, now what do you do? So then you're thinking \"Well then how about a counter-engage with a Mantra'd Q?\" This is what I often do, but here's the cache/catch (fuck me Idk which one it is lol): This requires you're ADC to be INCREDIBLY tactical. He needs to dodge the enemy all-in supports CC (which is more difficult then it sounds). He needs to focus the ADC, which is hard when the enemy support has a shit ton of CC. And last but not least... KARMA DOES NOT DO AS MUCH DAMAGE AS YOU'D THINK IN LANE BEFORE SHE'S BOUGHT AP ITEMS. Focus on her Q, fine. Still not incredibly strong, although it does do quite a lot of damage. \n\n\n2. She can't go all-in. Most ADC's as of late are designed to synergize with supports that go all in, such as Jinx or Vayne. Karma can ult-w and sure, gets quite a bunch of CC, but in exchange has to put herself in harms way, which she can't because she's squishy until late game. Like, I remember once, there was a Thresh Kalista bot lane, and I thought \"Praise god i chose Karma; now I can destroy Kalista with targeted CC!\" Oh wait. She uses her passive, still gets stunned but jumps close enough to her turret that Thresh then grabs me, flay's me, ULTS ME, and I'm virtually stuck, after having just used my shield to enhance my ADC, hoping he would come in as well and focus on Kalista. Oh wait just kidding, not like he would do that ANYWAYS. So there, now Kalista has a kill, and now I have to play safely because my ADC didn't follow up, and literally I'm behind the rest of the game, unable to go all-in because I can't trust my ADC to follow up.\n\nI get it; bronze idiotic scrub here. This is simply my opinion. Do I still main Karma? Yes because she's so much fun!! But do I hope to win games? Nope. Too many people are focused on using supports that can go all-in, get their ADC the most kills, etc. You know, I used to call this game the \"League of Bare Minimum Effort\" due to having seen so so many people seemingly using the easiest champs, or the ones who could snowball the hardest, etc. But now I look back and regret that. This isn't the League of Bare Minimum Effort. No no, this is the League of \"There are 50 champs who are strongest, and the rest aren't quite as strong, much harder to use, and you can't win as easily with them and they desperately need buffs to keep up with the most recently released champions.\" People want to reign victorious, right? No problem. Why use a champion that's much harder to do that with? Why? I only do it to have fun because I genuinely enjoy Karma's kit, but honestly if I was concerned with winning, I'd be a disphit to use her and expect a win. Just use Blitzcrank. Just use Thresh. People aren't even doing it for the sake of bare minimum effort, they just want to win. \n\nrant over (;-; )","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moulin Rouge","date":"2015-08-13T17:05:06.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma has trouble poking down tanks who can take her whole mana bar before they're poked out of lane unless her runepage is full AP.
