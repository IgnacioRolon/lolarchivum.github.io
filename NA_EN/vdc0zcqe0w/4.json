This is definitely an advantage for Sej, but it's not big enough to justify the shear difference in damage output.\n\n>Sejuani's CC is harder than Amumu's and includes a knockup.\n\nThe knock up has a shorter duration than the stun on Bandage Toss. When you're talking about CCs of less than 1 second knock-up VS stun simply becomes a question of which lasts longer.

You might even seen more Jarvans with the armor buff and his synergy with Warrior enchant. Evelynn and Ekko are seeing quite a bit of play as assassins that can be built quite tanky.
