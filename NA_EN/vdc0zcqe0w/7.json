If you just drop it anywhere, you won't have a pink for when you see the \"!\", as the true vision sweeping lens and yellow trinket no longer work. \n\"Bringing a peel champ with you\" is also not viable counterplay, just a countermeasure. Even if you have Leona by your side, on the best possible situation she's gonna save you when your HP is down to 50, as her E and Q combo (or ultimate) cast time is long enough for Rengar to delete someone, literally. But yeah, let's force everyone in the game to have a point and click instant stun champion in their team, that's great for the game's fluidity and diversity. \n\nZhonya is great, GA is not. Zhonya still provides damage, along with a reasonably low cooldown active. GA is 300 seconds, 5 minutes, 1/6 of an average 30 minutes game. So unless you're an AP based champion or a tank, you're being really hurt by being forced to buy GA, as you will respawn with low HP just to be killed again. Don't even use the \"noob ADCs don't buy anything but damage, gg\", as there are many other items that are much better defensive options to squishy adcs.\n\nAs someone has already stated on another thread, the ''counterplay'' to Rengar is not really counterplay, just countermeasures. And it's not even a bandwagon, it's a recurring issue that's been around for so long that people have even resorted to buying Zhonyas as ADCs at some time.\n\nOH, before I forget, if you already finish your sentence with \"who listens to me I'm a Silver scrub\", that's not gonna help your case at all.
