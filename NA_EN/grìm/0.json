Everything is okay on another computer. When I make a lobby and invite someone, I don't see any sign that I have invited that person, nor can I see if the have joined my lobby. I also can't see any invites I receive. There is no notification, be it visual or audio. I have attempted a full client repair to no avail.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T22:04:07.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like we were having some issues with invites not working properly and then games being unable to start a bit earlier today, but it does look like it should be cleared up now.
