I have talked to the IT guys here and they said that the thing that they need is the ip addresses of the NA severs. I could be saying that wrong because I don't know a lot about this stuff. But if I could get help so I and many other people on campus can play on the school wifi it would be very appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-07T20:58:30.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically your IT is requesting the IP addresses for the NA servers so they can whitelist them in their firewall and network. They'll need to reach out to our specialists in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and request the IP addresses. Please ask that they submit the ticket using the email address of the network admin so we can confirm who they are.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"IZZYNATION","date":"2016-09-07T22:59:10.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could I request it myself and then give that to them? The only reason I'm asking is because they have been super busy, and they told me if I can find the NA servers IP addresses it would help them out because they can't stop all the things they are doing around school to worry about one game right now. If not that's okay just would like to play sooner if I can.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-08T17:16:29.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, no. The IP addresses we provide are sensitive information, so we have to ensure we're providing it to Network professionals for the strict purpose of whitelisting them on their network.\n\nThere have been a few others players from other universities and colleges reporting connection issues, so I hope the network admin team prioritizes this where they can.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"IZZYNATION","date":"2016-09-09T19:32:58.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thats fine. I did at least click the link and looked at it myself and it looked like you could only request something if you had a league account. Does that mean the people in IT will have to make a league account with the admins email?
