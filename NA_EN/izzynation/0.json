I had to re-download to even get the old client. I really don't know what else to do. I've played at school before but after the update me and other friends I have on campus cannot login.

They're pretty helpful with this stuff, so hopefully they can lend a hand.  You can also use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in case of any local possibilities that are preventing access.
