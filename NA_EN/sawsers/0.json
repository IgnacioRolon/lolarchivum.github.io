He really just seemed to 1-up me in everything.  He had way longer range, seemed to have way more damage, and he'd often just dive tower, kill me, then zip back like 3000 units.  I could never hit him because he never got close enough for me to W him (except when he was diving tower), and his ranged attack moved too fast for me to dodge (especially with the wonky unit collision) so he'd always harass me down hard\r\nAm I just bad?  Well, yes I am, but what does a bad player like me do against a Zed in a situation like that","replies":[]}
