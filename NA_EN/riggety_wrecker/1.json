But how far is too far?  I wish I had screencapped it.  I didn't escalate, but it devolved into threats of shooting me, castrating me, and raping and mutilating my mother, in detail.

That's why people are always dicks in pre and post game screen. You have to screenshot and send a ticket-but, good news, they treat those tickets with more weight than normal reports because they will assume that the toxic player is doing it a lot more than they can see.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2014-09-17T12:25:32.050+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not true. Pre and post-game chat is saved as well; they are toxic there in the false belief that it isn't. I will try to find the Riot post that confirmed this but I don't think I'll be able to.\n\nThe belief that Riot can't see it is due to the Tribunal. In there, players voting couldn't see it, they only see the in-game chat. Riot is not limited by this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wullf","date":"2014-09-17T13:31:24.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I also read that statement.

However, I think the public would like to see what they said. Would you mind censoring the names that aren't yours (or preferably typing \"Summoner 1, 2, 3, etc. over them) and adding it to this thread? Public name-and-shaming is against the Forum rules, so the names have to be hidden.\n---\nBehavior like this is unacceptable, just ignore them and report them with slight details in the description.
