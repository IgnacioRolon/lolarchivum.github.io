The experience alone those players have over us leveling is game breaking but then to toss in tier 3 runes and all the masteries and it's pretty much GG every time!\n\n Would there be a way to disallow matching up those under level 20 with anyone over 20? At 20 you get tier 3 runes and 2 quints ... 20- 30 is a little more balanced (still not making up for the exp difference) but at least you can have a more balanced game. Us under lvl20 99.99% of the time have no runes due to not being able to use tier 3 under 30 and from the get go were vs players that no matter what will have stats much higher than us due to the runes and masteries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2014-12-29T14:09:44.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> everyone on my team (including me) is bronze and half the enemy team is gold, if not plat.\n\nits **Boosted**!\n\nSorry, had to, just for the joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaFifer","date":"2014-12-29T08:47:39.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been years since it happened, but I had a game where two individuals on the enemy team each had more wins than our entire team combined. \n\nThey've got to have a way for noobs to play with their high level friends, so sometimes these kinds of things happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oliver Hartt","date":"2014-12-29T05:20:34.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stopped playing team builder for this reason ; I either completely dominate or completely get destroyed.
