Now coming back from a deployment I tried to update my client and the patcher shows the League of Legends symbol on my desktop with the bar underneath it, it fills up to about 10-15% and then just cuts off. I've tried to just keep opening it and hoping it fixes, done that about 15 times, no such luck there. I've made sure it's allowed access, didnt do anything. And now I just completely removed it from my computer, and tried to redownload it, still goes up to the 10-15% and disappears. Doesn't give me an error or anything, just disappears. Any helpful suggestions?\n\nI've also run it as admin and still nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-07-26T13:24:44.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is probably due to network instability.\n\n[Troubleshoot your connectivity issues.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Moustached Lion","date":"2016-07-26T13:49:47.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, I tried all the options there and nothing worked.
