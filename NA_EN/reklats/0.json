In the patch notes it says, &quot;If Rumble overheats using Electro Harpoon, he&rsquo;ll always be able to fire while silence as long as he has 1 charge (same as live).&quot; That&#039;s correct, but I found that if you overheat with just one charge you can still use the harpoon even if you didn&#039;t overheat using the harpoon. I was at two charges, and I shot one. Then I used the scrap shield and flamespitter to overheat, but was still able to shoot one harpoon a one charge. I was not able to shoot the harpoon when it was at 2 charges however. I am not sure if this is the intended reaction.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I tried buying CDR, and it did not affect the harpoons. I think this was intentional, but I just wanted to check.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-02-25T17:58:17.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the report.

Could you look into that too please?\n\nSuper Galaxy Rumble skin has a bunch of quirky things with it. I think there is also a collision detection/pathing issue with it that I don't see with the other skins when trying to walk through/around minions. I often get stuck in place doing a crazy breakdance when trying to walk out until the minions move around me.","replies":[{"poster":"Erdamon","date":"2016-02-26T16:17:20.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my point of view that's a thing with all of the Rumble skins, looks like that collision radius reduction didn't help much in the end.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MANWOLFAXEBOSS","date":"2016-02-25T17:59:43.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All intended :)","replies":[]}]}
