I'd still like to investigate it further, others understandably concerned about the amount of power it might add. That makes it a better candidate for a high disruption time of the year (preseason possibly), rather than right now.\n\nWe do have other plans we're going to investigate for Zyra though, she could do with a bit of help. First step's going to be looking at her plant AI, see what improvements we can make there to determine how much of her struggling a little is raw power versus ability to consistently apply that power. That exploration will likely happen during the next patch or so, though too early to say yet if it'll hit the mark and be shipped or if we'll need to look at something else instead (or in addition).","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-08-20T11:52:00.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Meddler, pls tell me Jungle Zyra is also being looked at.

She clears at a reasonable speed even with only QW and has some really good sustain by letting her plants tank the jungle monsters for her (especially against Gromp, where a single plant will tank 6 auto attacks and deal its maximum possible damage), and because she doesn't have to use E too often she has a pretty good safety net in case she gets invaded.\n\nHer biggest problems are mana (which isn't relevant on her first clear and when she has blue buff) and a lack of synergy with Runeglaive because she can't afford to use the Sheen proc frequently enough to make Runeglaive good.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-08-20T16:19:33.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it's not bad once you have plants, but that first camp is murder without a good leash.

If you do it right, you will take aggro from the big Krug, but the little krug will not damage you because you take aggro from it, but then the krug is not in range of you to auto attack.\n\nIf you leash and de-leash both krugs, then you moved too far into the brush. Move too close, and both will attack you. \n\nIt takes a little bit of time to get it down, but the improvements are amazing. What I found is that this essentially simulates close to the sustain of a leash without the clear speed of the leash. You clear a lot slower, but you are as healthy as if you had a leash.\n\nIt's not practical to do it on most champions when you get a leash because your allies might take aggro from one of the krugs and might mess up your aggro, but if you don't get a leash you find that there is a massive difference on your first clear.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLastBaron88","date":"2015-08-21T01:07:01.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this man, that could really come in handy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-08-20T20:58:05.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you're here, I'd like to make some suggestions:\n\n1) Mana costs:  Q and E cost, base damage, effect duration, and scaling appear to be budgeted to account for plant spawns. Put a mana cost on W, and re-allocate the budget for Q to be cheaper with better scaling and for E to have +.25 root duration at every level. Refund the mana cost if the seed is destroyed or expires without germinating.\n\n2) Zyra's base damages are decent, but AP scaling is very poor unless plants can consistently attack. Also, Zyra (especially mid) is extremely item dependent and has a very long ramp-up time. So her scalings are poor and takes a long time to build, but she still falls off pretty hard late game. \n\nI think this is easily addressed by adding to her max seed storage with each rank in ulti or each time she hits 5 points in a basic skill. \n\n3) Most Zyras rush Q first in mid, and E in bot. I personally max W first in either lane to be able to spam plants, lane safer, and zone harder. I think this \"summoner\" Zyra should be recognized through the plant AI improvements. For example, each rank in W causes the plant to prioritize champions for its first X attacks where X is the number of points in W.\n\nThis is mostly a mid-late QoL improvement for the current mage Zyra where plants are essentially rendered useless by the presence of a single enemy minion. It also gives support Zyras more interesting choices between safe aoe (Q), better kill setup/peel (E), and stronger zoning and gank safety (W).\n\nThis would also give mid Zyra a viable means of laning against assassins who can kill her with virtually zero counterplay {{champion:238}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:91}}  and super long range mages {{champion:99}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:101}} .  Maxing W in mid isn't going to get you a lot of kills, but it would at least let you poke enough to better balance matchups that are currently one-sided bloodbaths.\n\n4)  Clearly I have tons of (I think) reasonable, choice-based buff ideas for Zyra. I get that they're probably not going to happen. So looking at the passive only, there are a few easy buffs:\n\n     A)  Increase missile range to mapwide and add AP scaling, % max hp, or scaling based on Zyra's max hp.\n\n     B)  Completely redesign ulti to the following:  Upon death, Zyra unleashes a final empowered ability:  Q a flurry of barbs shooting outward from point of death dealing small damage and slowing targets, W plants a dangerous enraged plant and enrages all other active plants, E an aoe root, R an instant knock-up\n\nThe point here is that Zyra is slow, squishy, and often focused to remove her cc from teamfights. A versatile cc-based passive should make her a less appealing KOS target and emphasizes her role as an engage/disengage mage and support.\n\n     C)  Instead of shooting a single thorn, let us continue to attack as a plant for the entire passive duration via AA and using the same damage, scaling, and item effects as a Q plant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orisi","date":"2015-08-20T10:34:43.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I randomly noticed the other day that does bug me; as a Mage revolving around her plant damage and with mostly short ranged abilities, came up against a Heimerdinger in ARAM,  and his turrets absolutely annihilate yours at all stages of the game.
