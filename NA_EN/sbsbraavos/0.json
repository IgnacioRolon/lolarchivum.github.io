Mediocre early, mediocre midgame, medicore lategame, lowest base AS, no longer longest range, Jinxs pushes towers faster, jinx has more range, jinx has better early mid and lategame, jinx has similar resets, jinx has more lane presence. Yes , I used to be a Tristana Main, but now Im a jinx main, because she is what comes closest to her, and I actually want to climb in ranked. Tristana is really a huge victim of this ohhh it was played in lcs, its op stuff. Remember, you gave her very small buffs in early season 4, when her lategame potential was still huge. She was considered completely fine, actually rather weak. Then people started banning her, eventough she only had like 52% winrate. Jinx had 55% and no one ever said a word.  And then this happened:\nv4.13\nTristana&#039;s W slows less at early ranks but more at max rank. E does less damage (especially at early levels).\n W - Rocket Jump\nSLOW DURATION: 2.5 seconds at all levels &rArr; 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds\n E - Explosive Shot\nACTIVE MAGIC DAMAGE: 110/150/190/230/270 &rArr; 80/125/170/215/260\nv4.17\n R - Buster Shot\nCOOLDOWN: 60 seconds at all ranks &rArr; 100/85/70 seconds\nv4.18\nGeneral\nATTACK SPEED PER LEVEL: +4% per level &rArr; +2.5% per level\nQ: DURATION: 7 seconds &rArr; 5 seconds\nBONUS ATTACK SPEED: Now gives 30/45/60/75/90% attack speed &rArr; 30/50/70/90/110% attack speed\n\nThen the rework:\nAttackspeed per Level nerfed even more to 1.5%\nRange per Level nerfed. (just why, its her identity)\nRemoved her Grevious wounds on e which is actually great in botlane all ins.\n\nGave her some Towerpushing abilities and added a mechanic to her w which actually says you should jump into the fight. Who does that on a adc???\n\nSo do all those nerfs really feel justified? To me it&#039;s like the biggest pack of nerfs I&#039;ve ever seen to a champion who has been considered balanced for a long long time. You literally nerfed EVERY SINGLE SPELL INCLUDING PASSIVE AND BASE STATS.!!! You said in some context to the jinx nerfs, that a champion like jinx, which is good in teamfights and towerdestruction should have a winrate of 50% or higher. To me Tristana is very similar to jinx, she should be a more mobile version, with less aoe and weaker early game, but she should be very strong late. Right now Trist has the lowest winrate of all ADCs, even though her mechanics are very simple, and she should actually do well in this tank meta, because old trist used to be a tank shredder with the huge range and attackspeed, which is now gone. Please give her more Attackspeed and the revert the Range changes, it feels so slow motion AAing with her...\n\nYour former Tristana Main.","replies":[{"poster":"Darth Pixy Misa","date":"2015-05-02T18:14:47.057+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":4,"body":"In this meta Tristana needs her As back so she can shread towers and tanks.

That's the most ridiculous argument i've ever heard. I had 224 Trist Games last Season with 54% winrate, 312 Jinx Games with 59.3%. Yet Tristana was cried about and nerfed? Her Midgame damage was one of the lowest of any adc, and again her jump had plenty of counterplay. All her damage is single target, and usually the only person she can focus is the tank, so until the tank dies she has no reset, and even a simple snare could get her back to ground mid air. Her jump is nothing compared to for example Ezreals e. Now they took away all her damage so she will never be able to kill that tank and get the resets to clean up the fight. I don't know why people always think something, that jumps around is op, when statistics clearly say it's not. Trists highest winrate that she ever had was like 53%. There are plenty of champions right now, that have more than that. I just wish patch 4.10 never happeneded and she never became popular.
