I'm a new player, I started 2 weeks ago. Tonight, at around 10PM(Right Now its 1:13 AM here) I was really excited to acheive LVL 10 to finally play normal draft pick. To my suprise, I have not been able to play a single game yet due to the time queue. It says estimated time 3m46 seconds, but its been already 15 minutes now and I have restarded a few times already. Im just wondering if its a common thing or Im just beeing unlucky or there's a bug related to this right now???","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-14T01:49:38.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the Rift!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nSometimes it _can_ take a few minutes to find a match, but typically it's only because the system is trying to find other players that are around the same skill level that you are!

I tried to play many times since im LVL 10 and I managed to play 1 game 5 vs 5 draft. It was in the afternoon. Even tonight I cant find a match after 10 minutes. What are the options if I want to lvl up to get to 30? Or its a problem related to my computer?\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S0NA","date":"2017-04-14T02:10:48.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probly cuz it's 1 AM and most people don't play normal draft at your level.","replies":[]}]}
