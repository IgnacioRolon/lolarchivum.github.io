They say it is trash because it is entirely dependent on your laners. If you are the JG on the other end of the equation, you are 100% useless because of just how far ahead the other jungler gets upon successful ganks, ad thus by extension, how far ahead laners get.\n\nSince farming is essentially a waste of time because of the lack of XP, the other JG has no recourse beyond a miracle to get back into the game because ganking losing lanes usually ends in disaster, and the lanes you need to gank the other JG is also camping them, except he's a level higher than you are(at a minimum) and probably an item which means you are, yet again, asking for the grey screen.\n\nIt's a frustrating play experience for most junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2019-11-11T03:17:22.095+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even to mention that you're basically forced to play hyper aggressive every game.

In Solo your Top will most likely cry at you if they get camped, even if you use that presence to focus drake and the Bot-side; in 5-man the Top usually recognises the advantage keeping the enemy jungler near them gives and plays around it.\n\nBasically, it's the fact that if something more supportive is really viable in SoloQ, it is truly oppressive in 5-man (see Sejuani, Galio at his low points, Kalista, most other tank Junglers); to keep things that require coordination balanced in 5-man they basically HAVE to suck to play Solo.

So is he the same problematic champion in soloQ or is the OP only complaining about the \"boring\" 3 games he watched during Worlds?\n\nIf Riot's guilty of \"forcing\" flashy champions into the meta, why is also the Boards so adamant and complaining to Riot when Sejuani was viable? So they wanted to remove a champion from the meta, because they're tired seeing her in every game. But i guess that is only OK when the Boards demand it, not when Riot decides to put a champion in.\n\nI'd really like to know where this golden middle of balance is, how much champions are allowed to assist or farm and yet, not stomp on someone's toes too hard and be actually \"boards' balance approved\". Because my belief is that no such middle exists.\n\nYou can't have champions who are in the exact middle because they end up being jack of all trades and masters of none. Champions who have a little bit of everything in their kit in order to have an option to respond to different situations and end up being problems for balance because they have too much stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"IainG10","date":"2019-11-11T04:54:37.518+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee is THE example of where Riot have gone severely wrong; because his plays are so flashy, they are willing to let him sit far above the bar in terms of balance.

I've always been fine with Zhonya's because you have to dedicate your build to it. But when everyone on the enemy team has one, it can be such a game changing item for a mere 600 gold (or for free if you have the rune). I can't think of any other item in the game that can potentially have such a massive impact, such as turning a critical teamfight (i.e. AD carry getting caught out of position) or causing a dive to go horribly wrong.\n\nI'm on the fence with having it as a shop item since unless you are building toward a Zhonya's, you are setting yourself behind in your build. However, I always thought that runes were meant to be minor/moderate enhancements to your champ, but not something that should make or break the outcome of a game. It's not even a keystone so you aren't really sacrificing much to have it.\n\nI think stopwatch as an item (or at the very lease, the rune) needs to be removed. What scares me is the chance that Riot decides to just give one to everyone. They did that with gold generation several seasons ago... when everyone was buying phil stone and heart of gold (and in some cases avrice blade), they just removed the items and increased gold generation across the board. In a way they did that with wards by giving everyone trinkets.\n\nGranted that a lot of people don't always use it optimally, kinda like how someone burns their flash when they are guaranteed to die anyways. However, it does kinda reward poor play by letting people get caught out of position and not get aptly punished for it as well as not rewarding well-planned plays like ganks/dives simply because someone got a free item for doing but play for 10 minutes.\n\nMaybe I am just overreacting to seeing it being used at games where the highest level of play is on display, but for something that potentially powerful to cost 600/free just doesn't sit well with me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JRT Smurf","date":"2019-11-11T12:07:18.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i remember old times when i started playing league . season 6 i think . if  u were jungle u had to choose to farm and get powerful urself or choose to gank and make ur teammates powerful but put ur self behind from enemy jungler who is focused on farming. u couldnt have both. but now u can camp one lane dont farm at all . making enemy top laner completly useless and make him hate his life and still be ahead from farmer enemy jungler both in exp and in gold. and this is just one of the things that fucked the game","replies":[{"poster":"Play from work","date":"2019-11-15T07:55:01.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You literally can't powerfarm as a jungler these days.

It was fine when almost no one could kill the monsters early on but ever since Riot started forcing the game out of double roaming supportive characters with jungle and summoner spell changes SR has been trash. Removing jungle aside from large monsters, making duo lane gold shared, and getting rid of all of the items created to supplement the existence of flawed systems for support and jungle is how you make the game fun to play again. \n\nRito doesn't care about fun to play though they want those 1v3 ganks for their tv show. They don't care that the complete inability to have real coordination in regular matches makes this game design a horrible experience. It is why teleport is the only macro play summoner spell left because people use it for big counter gank plays for the tv show.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colte","date":"2019-11-12T10:38:27.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i miss sejuani and nidalee jungle, im sick of the leesin meta","replies":[{"poster":"GilxeN","date":"2019-11-12T12:20:37.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Colte,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=KTPAGngX,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2019-11-12T10:38:27.400+0000)\n>\n> i miss sejuani and nidalee jungle, im sick of the leesin meta\n\nLee Sin META, what I see only Kayns, Rengars, Kha'Zix, Vi's in my games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Intocabille","date":"2019-11-12T00:55:56.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that the generally accepted view on 1-1-2 meta is that is was created (by accident by rito) because Dragons became too important.\nI still remember when it was Marskmen on mid... in the olden times... when Ashe was designated as ADC/Support (yeah that's right, Senna, you so called \"first\" adc/support). \nWhy marskmen don't go mid anymore aside from few exceptions? Not sure. In my opinion it was safety issue at first? They are too squishy and usually didn't have many peeling options that worked that well. So getting bursted by mages and jungler was too obvious.
