Not all hacking is software hacking after all. However it isn't my (or your) job to determine if he is speaking the truth or not. That is a job for Riot people and OP has been guided to Riot support already so we can let the case to rest. \n\nI just wanted to remind people, that software hacking isn't the only way to 'hack' to gain unauthorized access to program/location/information and that is why I replied to this 11 hours old comment. I hope I am not too much of a necromancer for these boards. ;) \n\nWhen looking at this from perspective of Riot Games, I find this ban very unlikely to be undone; if they undo this ban, they open up a way for pretty much every ban to get undone.
