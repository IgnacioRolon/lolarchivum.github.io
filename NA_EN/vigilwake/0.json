In one of my most recent matches of AI. Three of my teammate queued into the match with smite and no keystones which I didn't care people are learning. Or they didn't have a high level to unlock keystones. But then I saw the path for clear the jungle that they were taking and it was the same down to placing wards at each camp. The nid on my also noticed it as well and we reported them. I'm posting this so riot will see this and ban them. Cause violates the terms of service. They are most likely selling this account as level 30 accounts for people who do not wish to grind accounts. I will be posting this to reddit as well. The account names are Godgeinna, Hygynualters, Segnolaf. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T22:39:19.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to report those bots is to actually hit that report button. That will flag the people as well as the game you just played so that we have the chance to investigate what happened. Remember to use that report button in post-game in the future!","replies":[]}]}
