If you're just insulting the other team and trying to sell it as \"trash talk,\" that's likely not gonna fly.

Riots pretty strict with their chat moderation, so honestly, in this game, I would just avoid it. Do it at your own risk, but just know you may get chat restricted and have your honor stripped unexpectedly. I usually just stick to built-in trash talk, as they cant ban you for using things they implemented into the game. (You know, the ctrl 1-4 stuff. Well timed taunts can be pretty tilting)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eroticat Nimar","date":"2019-11-04T21:08:17.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I often find myself inviting my teammates to my funeral, so they can let me down one Last time.\n\nOr asking enemys If i should put on some nice Music and Maybe light some candles before fucking me to death.\n\n\nOr paraphrasing linkin Park: One Thing, i dont know why, it doesnt even matter how hard you try..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2019-11-04T20:51:37.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, you shouldn't trash talk people you don't know. A more important rule: don't trash talk your own teammates. It's counter productive.\n\nIf you are just trying to gently tilt the other team, call out the \"wonderful\" plays they have made. Like if a point blank ult was missed: \"Nice Shot!\". Maybe after a team fight you just won: \"Oh man, you got me to half HP, I was worried\". If you get an 5 for 0 ace, you could say something like \"Flawless\", or maybe a good trade would be \"Worth\".\n\nBe aware, this can backfire, and once you say something, the other team ~~may~~ will be inclined to return the favor if/when you slip up.\n\nBiggest rule: don't trash talk to just to say \"you're bad\". It's boring, not creative, and tedious. Put some effort behind those words.","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Mouse","date":"2019-11-04T20:58:30.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fun part is coming up with good insults that will make your team mates laugh and the enemy salty.
