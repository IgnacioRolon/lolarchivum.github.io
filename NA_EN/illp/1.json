And I've also been the guy who refused to surrender and carried behind teammates to a victory.  definitely a game by game thing so throwing out blanket statements will usually be inaccurate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-01-31T18:58:36.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the nature of the voting system, no one person can force anyone to give up or continue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-01-31T19:22:25.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do personally believe that you shouldn't surrender, for the reason that any game is winnable, and even if the enemy is at our nexus, and you just got aced, it is simply better to let them finish the game, I wholeheartedly disagree with AFking if the surrender vote fails.

You are saying to not force it on the team to not give up. But then here you are saying that they should FF because they are down.
