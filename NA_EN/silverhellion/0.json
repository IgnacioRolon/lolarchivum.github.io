I started playing him heavily when I used to watch Guardsmanbob stream way back when, and have mained him as AP mid, hybrid top, AS jungle, every build and path you can imagine I have played many Warwick games as. Constantly dealing with abuse throughout, whenever I win lane and do well the enemy team trashes for playing such an \"easy\" character, if I do poorly or start losing, team would trash me for playing Warwick a \"useless\" jungle or \"weak\" top lane. He has always been one of my favorite characters, next to Cho'Gath, I love the tankiness he offers, how he literally pounces on the enemy carry and forces people to fight him since running will do no good. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Warwick has become a common pick and strong just because of items, and this is not how Riot should play it with just nerfing him. The first being with the new FF before it was nerfed heavily, it made many jungles a problem, with Warwick being at the brunt of it. FF was nerfed, and was needed to be nerfed, and as the other jungle items came up on par Warwick slowly dropped back into a state of anonymity, which I was very happy with, I got my main back without bans or other people picking him as the FOTM.\r\n\r\n\r\n I am not sure the way Riot is going with the new smite and items, but nerfing Warwick because of them is not the way to go. This has been done multiple times with multiple characters whenever an item comes along that seems tailored specifically to that play style, and it has NEVER worked. Balancing a character around an item will make that character useless without it, you are stagnating build paths, making it so that the only way to play Warwick is the way that the item allows. Nerfing base ult damage and W duration hurts tank Warwick, not building damage and just using W to beef up your team's ADC while locking down the other teams. Warwick now exceeds with one build path, while every other is the same as it has ever been. A way should be found to make that build at the same strength as the others, rather then collectively bringing them all down until his strongest build has the power that Riot feels it should.\r\n\r\nFirst post on the new boards, and I have not even seen a Warwick since the changes, so I can offer no constructive ideas as to how to make the appropriate changes to not murder all build paths but one, so let's see if we can start a discussion up on how to do this.","replies":[{"poster":"BakugoBestBoy","date":"2014-12-11T21:58:34.164+0000","up_votes":50,"down_votes":10,"body":"Nah WW needed a nerf, I mean now his ult only does 350 base damage at max rank, that's a little over half of a Lee Sin Kick, I think they should nerf him again so Lee Sin doesn't get insecure or anything.

You realize if ANYONE on your team cc's him during his less-than-a-morg-or-fiddle-or-skarner-or-ashe stun, he stops right? Or if you remove suppression through the various items, you are free (while HE is still trapped in it)? And you also realize he has no other forms of cc besides his ult (which is on an 80 second cd). He was never an issue even with wit's end and botrk until the new jungle came out. I have over 700 games played on him and have had under 10 complaints about him, mostly by people I dumpstered on.

WW can be CC'ed out of his ult. This makes his ultimate only really deadly mid game. Turning this into an execute removes his teamfight initiations completely.

Yes, in some ways he was very simple.  But in other ways he was not - he could be built a lot of different ways, and do a lot of different things.  He could be a bruiser, he could be really tanky, he could be a quasi mage, he could be an assassin.  This made him interesting as a champion.\n\nBecause of how Riot decided to nerf him, he is no longer interesting.  He can only realistically do 1 thing without sucking - be an assassin ult bot that relies completely on a very simple smite/ult combo that abuses certain items.  That's not interesting even to old school WW players.\n\nSurely there were more thoughtful ways of nerfing him (I find that Riot often seems to put little thoughts into a lot of these nerfs).  My first thought would have been to take away the 5 free hits property on his ult, while increasing the base damage.  That way you reduce the effectiveness of on-hit cheese builds that have come up with season 5, but still keep the damage of other builds about the same.

Combined with WW's increased move speed from Blood scent so you can't get away. \n\nCombine that with one Q swipe and you have a guaranteed kill on any champ except the main tank, oh and it's a 700 range flash if that wasn't enough. \n\n\nThis champ forces 4 of the 5 enemies to rush Quicksilver Sash which puts the other team behind 4.5k gold. \n\n\nExplain to me how this is not OP? \n\n\nMaybe reduce the flash range or at least make is slower so the other team has some time to CC the WW. \n\nHonestly, almost every game this week there has been an extremely fed WW. All the WW player can't be that good. \n\nSeriously.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoScout","date":"2014-12-12T04:00:13.117+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just afraid of his rework, I love him as is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grunt666","date":"2014-12-12T03:47:11.686+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wasting your time Riot is stupid and bad at balancing.

I hate how he gets nerfed from that 1 item that also gets nerfed.\n\nI miss the my champion who could have any item on him and make a grand use of it. They could have at least attempted to compensate for these changes. Like reverse the cooldown nerf on his ult, maybe less damage but we get to use it as often as before.\n\nThey either need to make some temporary solution for him til his rework, or they better high tale that rework that was brought up by riot back in January.\n\nPeople are mistaking good sustain for good clearing. Warwick can clear the jungle and leave full health, but he clears it slowly, by the time you finish your clear the enemy has gone back upgraded there machete, cleared more camps or ganked. You just end up behind.\n\nAnyone who can't counter Warwicks ult is either stupid or wanders alone when they are against a warwick, He REALLY isn't hard to stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"doubleguac","date":"2014-12-12T17:04:29.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW was, in my opinion, overpowered in solo queue before S5 started.
