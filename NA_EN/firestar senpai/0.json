I won a game and then had 870 IP and I just got on and now I have 775 IP this is the second time today that I've just lost IP. I'm not spending it on anything either. So I'd like to know why I'm just randomly losing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-28T21:50:43.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you might be having an IP display issue, but a relog usually fixes it up.  I've tried to refresh your account personally to make sure everything is in order, just relog first!  It looks like you also made some purchases, so your balance is pretty low at the moment.  Hope that helps clears things up.","replies":[]}]}
