Been playing LoL for quite some years now.. and up until recently never had issues with the game.. however playing on monday i noticed that my M4B wasnt working in game... I have this button bound to self cast the Champs E if it can be self casted.. so champs like Morg Shield, Karma shield and Nami's auto attack slows..  now the abilities work when using the Alt+e but i sometime need to cast these abilities quick so thats why i use the M4B.. \r\n\r\nI have updated my drivers for the mouse. I have run a repair on the client... i have done everything short of reinstalling the entire game.. in which i dont really want to do cause it will take sometime to reinstall..  any ideas and where im going wrong??","replies":[{"poster":"BOOMSTICK89","date":"2017-09-05T04:03:06.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem MB5 not working as well.
