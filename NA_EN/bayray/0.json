Then I thought what if there was a way to categorize them on your league account instead of creating a google doc or a note on your computer. I think it would be a great idea if you could create a tab that shows up in champion select (kinda like the skins and champion tab) that would have your favorite champions to play, instead of looking through the 100 or something champs you have getting distracted by them. You could label different tabs for like jungle, mid, top etc.... Then you could be more encouraged to play them. It would be a fast and easy way to play the champs you like and practice the ones you want to get better at. I hope Riot sees this because this is a pretty good idea, what does everyone else think???","replies":[{"poster":"nairn","date":"2015-05-04T06:13:23.618+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito pls notice this. {{item:2050}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Idroold","date":"2015-05-04T09:51:59.870+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"upvoted","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aelvr","date":"2015-05-04T07:44:10.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shut up and take my upvote.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-04T08:02:40.065+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually have only 22  champs, and I'm in Plat 2, I reach with a very poorly cham-pool, I know how to use all my 22 champs I'm don't know how, but I manage a small champ-pool and have a succed \"fact\" on ranked games.\n\nSo Why I only have 22 champs ? Simple because I only buy champs that I know to use. I don't waste my IP in things that I don't need. \n\nNow talking about your idea I can say That Idea can help me a lot personally, I have like 30000 RP and 8 runes pages, and I never waste in champs by the same reason, I HATE SEARCH MY CHAMPS IN THAT HUGE CHAMP-POOL (I know that the GUI have a search buttom but sometimes I don't have a concrete champ to play) . Now with the tab-idea I can create a tab name \"Poorly Skill\" and add all my champs that I don't know how to use/build properly, and I can start waste all my IP on champs that I can learn in a future.\n\n UPVOTED! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Shockforce","date":"2015-05-04T18:39:04.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You do not need more than ~5 champions (or 2-3 less popular champions) to get high in ranked.

With another 12 champs in back line that rarely used but I know how to use at well (like Leona Swain Warwick Ashe Graves Wukong Malphite J4 Diana Taric Kassadin and Ryze). Warwick was my best champ in the last season (I reach plat2 too and ww with 79% win ratio) But after 4.21 patch when Riot overnerf him, I play him lesser. I have a nearly 60% win ratio this season with only 10 champs used at the moment but I always feel some weird reach nearly diamond with the same 10 champs, and withoy know how play properly in some roles like mid or adc. So I agree with your comment, a small pool can work if you know how \"manage\" it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninjaboy1409","date":"2015-05-05T01:29:52.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if you have no main and just plays other champs cuz almost every1 suits me","replies":[{"poster":"nairn","date":"2015-05-05T01:31:06.969+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then dont use it m8","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Diananmen Square","date":"2015-05-05T11:42:02.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could also be applied to a specific role in general.
