If yas can 1v4 your team, you either played really poorly, someone fed him but yknow that doesnt happen with any other champ {{champion:11}}, or he played impossibly well. Good yas players are insane to watch, and almost impossible to beat, but every moderately high skill cap champ can be insane to play against in the right hands. I&#039;m an amazing katarina, and I&#039;ve got like a 75% win rate with her in ranked over like 40 games, but that doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not hard to do, its not like i havent dedicated time to being great at that champ, and there are other champs that just single-handedly win the game with 5+ kills. {{champion:67}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:23}} Sure there&#039;s counter play, but usually that counter play is dont feed them. It&#039;s fairly similar to yas. He&#039;s a lane bully sometimes, but if you&#039;ve ever picked him into darius, you&#039;d know he&#039;s not actually that insane as a champ. his early damage is fairly shit, and his abilities do almost nothing to help improve that damage except giving him an auto attack reset. He&#039;s just a champion, like everyone else. He&#039;s fun-ish to play, he&#039;s not impossible to beat, and the games you have with him can be extremely interactive. I remember one game I flash to the right of him as he win wall&#039;d to hit my full combo as lux and that was so fucking satisfying that it hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-05-30T14:35:47.514+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't enjoy having him on the enemy team and I don't enjoy having him on my team, so I just ban him (assuming another champion doesn't take priority).\n\nKnowing how to handle him and how to play with/around him doesn't mean I enjoy having to do so.  As such, I'm just happier when he isn't in the game.  \n---------------------------\nWhile other champions may just as or more annoying to handle, the vast majority of them are far less likely to actually be picked.\n\nHis popularity is one of the main reasons I find him annoying; if he isn't banned, I have to deal with him quite frequently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-05-30T15:35:14.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why nobody likes Yasuo?

Because you are gold 5 you think you can talk shit to silvers? Grow up.\nFYI rank means nothing about if you understand the game and how to play. Does the best NFL or NBA coach also prove to be the best player? No. Do the best analysts or casters or pro league of legends coaches hold the top ranks of solo queue? No. You are implying THEY know nothing with your flawed logic. Pretty sure most of the boards would say making the claim that top analysts and coaches of pro teams \"know nothing\" is stupidity.\nFurthermore, I was in silver 5 for the longest time this season. I climbed to silver 3, then got a 2 week 90% guaranteed losses losing streak and a chat restriction. I have worked to improve my attitude - I'm not perfect, but better than I was - and I hit gold 5. So I guess since I'm gold 5 I can shit talk you as much as you are trying to do to some silver. For all you know - he/she could be gold+ material and just hasn't had a long enough streak of decent matches to climb. Cut the toxic bs acting like you are better than everyone of lower elo and know so much more than them.","replies":[{"poster":"Nomad Sol","date":"2017-05-30T23:23:51.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know you have a small epeen and have to compensate by shouting like a fool, but I'm not the one bragging about having a good katarina and then spouting nonsense about yasuo when i'm a fucking silver.\n\nI know you're 11 but a ton of coaches use to be old players, and the rest that aren't normally have expertise in some other field, that analogy is ass but analogies are for people with no ground to stand on in the first place so I guess they're fitting for you.  Most of league's coaches are a fucking joke, an attempt by Riot to try and pretend we real sports guys and it's laughable you think their existence justifies the pride you have in your mediocrity\n\nBtw i'm only gold 5 cause I'm dicking around, i finished placements in gold 4 so clearly your tiny epeen is still too tiny to be talking to me.  Is it really this NA only thing, where the most mediocre cry the loudest about how they totally need to be taken seriously they totally know what they're talking about metrics are a conspiracy meant to keep the silver bronze golds and plats down.

I do not have an epeen to my knowledge and I am hardly shouting. I am far from 11 years old. Coaches do help teams - as to psychologists, etc. in a number of ways. And you just compared me to an ass - an analogy of sorts - so by your very own argument, you would also have no ground to stand on since that is what you claim of people using analogies.\n\nBut if you want to compare intelligence, then offer something of actual wit. I've had plats tell me I knew nothing because I wasn't gold - back when i was silver. I've played with plats and made better shotcalls. Yes, clearly you must know the solutions to the origins of the earth, you 1v1 Faker and win every time, and you killed the dinosaurs. Everyone else should just shut up since they cannot possibly have any clue about anything. But since you will undoubtedly reply with another inflammatory post, I will simply list some highlights of my league intelligence and leave this conversation at that.\nAs a silver:\nbrought morgana to the support role patches BEFORE she was THE META support; regularly carried games while being camped 3v2 by enemy jungler if provided a DECENT adc - no smurf from higher elo required\n\nmorgana and others were still the meta supports?

They can build properly as a tank, but they still lose 1v1 - made even worse if the enemy jungler camps early game to help yasuo out and their jungler doesn't lift a finger to help them. Losing 1/6 your hp every time he goes in to harass you and being able to return literally 0 damage to him is frustrating to many players. I'm not saying that is true in all situations; however a yas with equal or better skill than his opponent and 1 decent pre-lvl 6 gank can reach that point or worse easily enough. And it only gets worse as the game goes on. And you cannot just counter-pick him all the time as sometimes people have to blind pick or pick not knowing which lane yas is going to. I have played against yasuo's who were better than me, got 1 good gank, and just completely controlled the lane from there because my jungler refused to gank. I have played games where I took tp and the yasuo took exhaust or ignite, got an early kill thanks to a flash gank from their jungler, and I still demolished him in lane despite getting no help and the enemy jungler continuing to try to snowball him. I believe his kit has too many tools and stats to punish many toplaners early beyond what they should reasonably have to deal with if given any sort of meaningful advantage. He should be reworked to either be a midlaner or a toplaner, but not both. His crit doubling plus his shield and invulnerability while using ult are a bit much for many champs to handle - especially for opponents of lower skill or who have never faced a yasuo before. Changing his crit-doubling passive to something more reasonable would also allow some strength to be put into the rest of his kit; which many yasuo players have also said they would be fine with.\nIs yasuo broken? No. Can he be beaten? Yes. Does he need a less annoying kit for others to play against? I think so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-05-30T14:33:19.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where the hell do you find your hours","replies":[]},{"poster":"JhomasTefferson","date":"2017-05-30T14:43:11.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, i care about him because i enjoy his current kit and don't like how he's being nerfed into the ground / possibly being reworked.
