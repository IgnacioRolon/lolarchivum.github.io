I recommend using our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to make sure your drivers are updated and correct, and working properly.  It's also important to go through each step carefully, to rule out any other possibilities that could cause fps issues like this.

This should fix your problem, Goodluck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Preymster","date":"2016-03-21T01:54:27.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are running Nvidia here is the fix that worked for me.\n\n-Right click your screen and go into Nvidia control panel.\n-go to \"Manage 3D settings\"\n-Click on \"Add\" and search for the LoL client or use the dropdown menu to select league of legends launcher (Leagueoflegends.exe.) To make this easier check the box that is marked \"Show only programs found on this computer\".\n-on dropdown box under #2 select HIGH PERFORMANCE NVIDIA PROCESSOR. do NOT use \"global settings\" as it will still for some stupid reason choose to run it on integrated graphics.\n- click APPLY on the lower right hand corner.\n-boot up a custom game and hopefully your FPS will boost back up to 60fps or higher if you have it uncapped. I run mine capped, im a pleb.\n\nthe last updates between microsoft and 8.1 from Nvidia for some stupid reason caused league to decide to run off of integrated graphics. no clue why but it was infuriating for something like this to occur. if you know how to turn off integrated graphics then i would even suggest going as far as that. i run my game borderless windowed as well, but this also fixed it for fullscreen as well. honestly i dont know why i bothered looking as it shouldnt have made a difference.\n\nhope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
