I usually have around 28-32 ping but since Saturday, I have 130 ping constantly. I would get brief moments where I would have my normal ping. It is very frustrating to play. Any help?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-22T04:32:33.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of our players, especially those on Verizon, have been having these ping spikes due to major ISP outages and EU ISP issues here and there. We're doing our best to get the word out, but it can be rather hard to troubleshoot ping spikes when your own ISP is having routing problems. \n\nRun a traceroute to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1 using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) so I can get an idea of what your connection looks like after it leaves your network. This should give me a good idea of what's going on and what kind of solutions may help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fireface","date":"2018-01-22T01:34:08.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, in northern VA getting 130ish ping, used be 30-32 at all times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosineee","date":"2018-01-21T20:03:23.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here, I live in East, Virginia and use Fios internet 100/100, did all the ping test, came out all good. ping averages 130-133 in game. unplayable.
