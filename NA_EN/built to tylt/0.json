I'm not sure what's going on with Ornn as a champion or the Recap function. I do know that Recap tends to error and bug out a *lot*, so maybe that's where the problems lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2017-10-29T11:54:54.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has nothing to do with Ornn, it has to do with the Death Recap. That thing has been a thorn in Riot's side for years, and it has *NEVER* been reliable. Really, the only info you can get from the death recap is who landed the killing blow on you, and even then, it isn't at 100% (sometimes, you'll get nothing but Minion auto damage on it).\n\nDo not trust that thing. Trust the advice coming from the people who actually made the game. Ornn does primarily magic damage, even if the the extremely unreliable Death Recap says otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-10-29T13:18:49.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death recap shows you the last 3 things of damage from the source.\n\nSo for Ornn, if he hits you in this order: W (magic), Ult (magic), Q (physical), E (physical), AA twice, it should show the last 3 things that did damage to you, which is physical damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2017-10-29T07:03:26.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, Shaco is bugged or so I think, his boxes only trigger rylais but no lyandries or ludens echo and I think none other spell triggered item or effect.\n\nBut on the other hand zyra plants and tibbers trigger them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2017-10-29T06:56:35.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be mostly magical unless you sit there letting him auto you.  His W does percent MAX HEALTH magic damage, which is where a lot of his trading power comes from when he pops the brittle.  His ultimate and brittle proc are also magical.  The only physical in his kit would be his E and Q, but he doesn't build AD and his E's scaling is poor with armor.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Baron Barian","date":"2017-10-29T06:25:07.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Few months ago, people complained that he was the weakest top laner in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Minjo Master","date":"2017-10-29T23:34:07.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For what it's worth, he's gotten several pretty extensive suites of buffs since then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-10-29T09:10:21.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And not so long they complained about urgot being pretty much unplayable.\n\nNow that champions are more tricky to figure out, it has became a standard that players cry about new champs beng weak, Riot buffs them a little and then they turn out mighty strong, because they were perfecctly good in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}
