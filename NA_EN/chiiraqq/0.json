I'd suggest playing with some friends and getting the hang of things like CSing (killing minions) and then find a champion you like the look of. Some good ones are Ashe, Janna, Master Yi, and Volibear. Once you find a champion you're comfortable with, work with your teammates to coordinate a kill or focus one person in a big teamfight. \n\n Also, remember that League isn't all about kills! You can win a game and have a good time without ever killing someone. Good luck, and if you have any questions feel free to ask here or your teammates in game!","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2018-12-26T22:59:15.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Some good ones are Ashe, Janna, Master Yi, and _**Volibear**_.\n\nLol wait what.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-26T23:01:54.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrHaZeYo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cr65PEKL,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-12-26T22:59:15.676+0000)\n>\n> Lol wait what.\n\n I mean, they're all relatively straight forward champs. I know there's more to Volibear than meets the eye, but his kit and passive make him a decent champion for new players to pick up.","replies":[{"poster":"MrHaZeYo","date":"2018-12-26T23:07:42.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always tell my new friends \n\nTop: Garen/Renek\nJG: Jax/Shyv\nMid: Ziggs/Annie\nADC: Cait/Trist\nSupp: Janna/Lulu","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chiiraqq","date":"2018-12-26T22:47:45.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-26T22:49:27.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chiiraqq,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cr65PEKL,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-26T22:47:45.527+0000)\n>\n> thank you\n\n No sweat! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2018-12-27T05:32:57.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao. This takes me back. I remember having the same exact problem when I started in season 5. The first time I killed a bot I felt like a fuckin pro. I can't believe killing a bot was once damn near impossible for me at one point.\n\nI think it took me about a week or two before I could actually kill something in League. In hindsight, you need to reach a point where playing a champion is like walking. You don't need to think about how to walk, you just walk. You just need to keep playing. It'll come to you eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"chiiraqq","date":"2018-12-28T23:27:01.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you","replies":[{"poster":"chiiraqq","date":"2018-12-28T23:29:01.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but it´s hard i feel useless when playing because everyone in my team does kills and im the only one who doesn´t :////","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2018-12-29T06:25:27.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've all been there.
