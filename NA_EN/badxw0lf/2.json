Success! Many thanks to you and the tech dudes (:\n\n(was wondering if you should maybe sticky this fix? Who knows how many people have a combination of MSI + Nhamic and alpha client and come here to quickly scan to see if there issue has a post?\n\nEDIT 2:\nOkay this is really off topic, but Targon what you just provided is a godsend.\n\nHere's the story: \n\nI absolutely love this game series called \"Heroes of might and magic\" it was the game way back that started my PC gaming career. Anyways the new one in the series (Heroes of might and magic VII) has this incredible editor that allows you to use part of the unreal engine to create maps, add new heroes and enemies, items, etc. So of course I wanted to create content using this as it's an incredible feature, so when I first got the game (a year ago) I open the editor and no dice ): the thing wont load... I tried everything to get it working (uninstalls/ reinstalls, reinstalling windows, re downloading all the c libraries required, antivirus, drivers, the list goes on). I probably spent about 20+ hours trying to fix this thing in total over the past year and no dice every time. However one consistent piece of information I kept getting was that it was a certain key thread was hanging at the same point every time (got this by using wait chain in task manager), and from there I found out that it was some kind of memory error. So I though I had some faulty RAM and did some tests, but again no luck.    \n\nSo last week I get an email saying I got alpha client (yay!) open it and bam memory error, my immediate thought \"damn this is gunna happen all over again )': \". So I tried some trouble shooting and some other stuff to of course no avail, thus I sent in a help ticket and decided to check the boards when suddenly I find this amazing post. so i uninstall Nhemic and it fixes the alpha client. I play some league when I realize \"maybe, just maybe this heroes will work now??!?!?1?!?!!/11111111\". I quickly open steam and download the editor, hit that first time setup button and launch it... Intensely I stare at the monitor for a few minutes when it hits the same loading part it gets stuck on and it kinda hangs, but then, oh but then, a little window pops up and the editor continues to load!!!!!!! I think \"Is this it, has RITO just done it? have they both fixed alpha client and one my favorite game series of all times in a single swoop by uninstalling this useless bloatware I never used anyway???\" The answer is Yes. Yes Riot had done it. \n\nSo please take my thanks and give my thanks to the tech gods over there! :D I would be you all skins if I could but I don't know if that's possible. \n\nTl;dr:\nRito saved the day by both fixing alpha client, and on the side fixing the editor of a game series that I absolutely love. A problem I had been trying to solve for a year with the games support people unable to help me resolve it.  \n","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T22:19:21.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm glad to hear this not only resolved your issue with League but also your favourite game and its editing feature as well! \n\nI haven't played Heroes of Might and Magic before, but I think I'll give it a look just because you brought it up. Thanks for confirming this worked for you and for sharing your story. I hope to catch you in a game sometime. ^.^\n\n{{champion:44}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iHateFabian","date":"2016-11-16T12:46:46.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I do NOT have MSI / Nahimic / Sonic Studio on my computer, but I still get this issue with the new client. \nI've tried disabling REALTEK, and it's now off, but yet I get the same error. \nAnd as I've been googling I've seen this issue has been around for a while, but does anyone have any idea what I should do to fix my problem?\nSame error message, but no MSI and Realtek is disabled.","replies":[]}]}
