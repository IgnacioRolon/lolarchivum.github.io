After attempting to start a game of League, my computer crashes on the loading screeIn.  When I played with some friends, I got into loading screen and my computer crashed again.  I had to do a hard reset as it just freezes on loading screen.  Can't alt+tab, ctrl+alt+delete, nothin.  Really frustrating.  Is it something to do with my League not cooperating with the new update?  I attempted to do a repair, but that did nothing to fix the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Millburgo","date":"2016-08-26T00:54:59.381+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked for me.\n\nDisabling Xbox GameBar\n1.

Some players have reported similiar occurnces after a Windows 10 update, and it turns out that the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) bar was causing the problem.  Disabling that could help!  \n\nSome third party programs that interact with league have been causing issues as well.  If you have any apps running like Play.tv or Overwolf, remove them.\n\nAlso make sure to update any drivers, which is especially important after an update.
