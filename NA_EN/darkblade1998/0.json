I go to play league get into a queue go through champ select and then it takes me to what is suppose to be the loading screen. My screen goes black for a few minutes and then a notification pings and says I cannot connect to the severs please reconnect and try again.\r\nI have done this probably 50 times and nothing happens. I checked my settings and nothing has changed,I have restarted my router 5 times without any change. I have attached an Ethernet cable to my router and still the same thing. I am now being penalized because this has happened 3 times in a row now when trying to play a normal draft game but I can for some reason get into customs just not a real game. What do I do?!! I love this game but this is getting to the point where I am just going to quit and I dont want to. If anyone has any suggestons please tell me!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-24T02:14:57.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This certainly sounds like your connection to the gameservers is unstable and causing you to be unable to connect.
