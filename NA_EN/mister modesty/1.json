I recently bought Maokai and his Saplings disappointed me with their duration. Definitely a great patch there! I also want to see how Zz'rot will affect gameplay: creating a new objective, and new gameplay around the objective. (Zz'rot is easier to destroy AND easier to save- making it a nice little base of operations). And- Aurelion Sol! Yes- I am buying him once this patch is done downloading. I can't wait to test him out!!\r\nThis patch is pretty great!\r\n\r\nBut- I'm still more excited about Taric! lol.\r\nSo- now that Aurelion Sol is out...\r\nPlease Riot!\r\nWhen is Taric's rework
