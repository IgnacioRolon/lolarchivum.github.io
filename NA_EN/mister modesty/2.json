Of course- vampiric sceptre is too expensive for a boots build, but why not just make 3rd tier boots??

If you simply add more options on top of boot upgrades it heavily devalues other options in items.  Making movespeed a mandatory buy because it gives speed and every other stat you want/need doesn't feel good, especially when you run a champion that should not need that speed.","replies":[{"poster":"Mister Modesty","date":"2017-06-22T21:51:50.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does it devalue other items?\nYou're buying boots regardless.\nYou will still always have the other 5 item slots. \nIf anything, allowing more to build only compliments other items- allowing for a more refined item build path.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-06-26T23:45:02.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may, lets prove this point just from the items suggested in the OP.\n\nHP and Mobi boots?  {{item:3742}}  But the boots would be less expensive\n\nAttack speed and lifesteal?  {{item:3153}}  The boots would also be less expensive\n\nArmor, Attack reduction, MR and Tenacity?  There would be no better option to build.  It would be must build on everyone, every game without exception.\n\nI understand what you are suggesting, but I feel its not the correct direction to go with boots.  I personally feel that boots should get 50ish HP, cost 50 more gold and get the Doran's tag like it should have a long time ago to cement it as an early game defensive item.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-06-12T15:54:55.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i loved the old tier 3 boots... 470 perma speed on Kat made my life amazing... but they just decided to nerf her base movement speed and remove the tiet 3 green enchant :(","replies":[]}]}
