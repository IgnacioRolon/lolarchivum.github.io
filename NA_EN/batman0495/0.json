Her kit and design is what inspired me to become a game designer! From day one her lore depicts her as one of the most powerful beings in Runeterra, but her game play is lacking. She has this style that is all about going in hard and surviving and she really needs a passive to help support that. Her passive currently is just unhelpful and completely useless late game! A little while ago a Rioter was talking about a possible passive rework that would give her some kind of ice shield that would scale based on the number of enemies CC'ed. This idea would be perfect for her! It would help support her game play and theme really well! I understand Riots been crazy busy lately and trust me you guys are doing an amazing job, but champs like Lissandra who are not the most popular could still use a little love .:) Thanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2014-11-21T22:22:26.180+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of my biggest issues with her is her passive.

I like the CC scale shield idea, or maybe increase the slow depending on how many enemies have been slowed by her in a brief period of time. I only say that because she already has a great escape mechanic and I feel like a shield might put her a bit over the top. But then again we have Riven and company.. I dunno. Up to Riot in the end.

She could actually have her passive entirely removed and her mana regen / mana costs buffed and she would be exactly as strong as she is now. Her passive is 100% negated by stat weaknesses. That's bad design.\n\n>she has skill to root, chase, escape, stun, cone aoe and slow\n\nYou can't just list kit elements and call that an argument. You can do that for any champion in the game. \"Urgot has a slow, poke damage, damage reduction, long range targeted damage, massive resistances and a suppression that initiates. Holy wtf op.\"\n\nI don't think she needs a straight buff (although I don't think giving her one would in any way make her \"the strongest hero in the game\"). I think she needs a redesign because she has the most pointless passive in the game. It could literally be deleted and nothing would happen to her if her mana regen and costs got adjusted to those of a normal champion. That is shitty design and should be fixed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Babyon9","date":"2015-05-11T00:13:45.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a pain when low elo players don't recognize champion's strength.\nnow the board is over flood with these kinda of posts in gamplay and balance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-09T13:11:27.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ice shield to make a plenty of risky plays.. sounds goods to LC$","replies":[]},{"poster":"NUT IN ME PLEASE","date":"2015-01-09T09:15:46.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/ghVoABuc-lissandra-passive-rework?comment=0002\n\nI made a new passive for her, check it out if you would like and hopefully if it gets enough attention, Riot might change her current one!","replies":[]},{"poster":"mike the pike","date":"2014-11-23T00:14:07.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets see now, maybe its because lissandra is seen as either a poke champion (long range spells for some damage, which 18 seconds is kinda of enough time to keep up the poke) or the champion which uses her claw to jump in, then her ult and other ability to stun, during that time you escape and don't use spells or wait for passive cd ORR you die in the middle of enemies after the stuns and stuff stop. She is meant to be a duck and dodge keep enemies away champ and/or the jump in give allies lots of time to kill and die gloriously champion.
