League isn't like a game of basketball or something where it can be a healthy experience or an impossible feat to recover from. There isn't outside variables that tie in to games becoming impossibly harder to handle. The surrender button is there to save time, because casual people also play the game. Some times people can chill out, play normals, feed and not surrender because their learning. Other times, people need to realize that their not only being too prideful, but also down right annoying with their arrogance.\n\n\"We can win. keep trying. Don't give up.\" Yet, you're down 20 kills, have 0 towers, 0 map pressures and all of you are behind. This is a state of defeat that's only going to take awhile to catch up to you, and eventually fail. You have to know when it's worth your time and effort to try and make a come back and when a come back is actually impossible. I admit, listening to my ff vote, even when I'm ahead and my team is just doing badly, would make me lose a couple more games than I normally would. I tend to throw up that surrender vote haphazardly, mostly because it shows my team that I'm willing to throw in the towel if their not willing to cooperate. Most times people get it and strap up over when I don't throw it up. I don't have that sense of pride you never surrender people have. I take my defeats and walk away with my head held high. I take my lesson from that game and move onto the next one. That's my pride. Knowing when to call it quits. Saving time and frustration of an overly long game that you're bound to lose can have more benefits than not. The kind of pride the never surrender attitude gives is that sore loser type of pride. \"I haven't lost yet. It's not over!\" It is over, stop trying, get over it and move on.\n\nThis isn't to say you can't learn anything from losing, you can. This isn't to say that you should surrender every time a situation looks grim, you don't. But not knowing when to throw in the towel when you're beaten makes you look bad. Imagine if some coaches never threw in the towel for their boxers when the one in the ring thinks they can win, but have a serious threat of injury that could jeopardize their whole career. They would've regret not throwing in the towel earlier. It's like when you know a game is over 25minutes into the game, but you just sit around in base and let your enemies screw around for 25+ more minutes, only to realize they were simply having too much fun to want to end the game, and you could've spared 25minutes of your precious time and been in another, maybe more promising game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2016-12-24T22:25:47.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One is someone cries FF@20 after dying once a couple of minutes into the game and proceeds to butthurt the rest of the game.\n\nThe other is the entire team deciding that they're done and choosing as a team to Surrender.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-24T22:25:13.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not what it means, but go ahead.\n\nJust be aware your reports will do nothing, and eventually be completely ignored if you spam enough false reports. This is why salty brats tend to think reports do nothing - their personal ones are, in fact, utterly useless. Riot cant deal with the volume of false reports from tilted brats.","replies":[]}]}
