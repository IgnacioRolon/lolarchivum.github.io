As explained in the email you received in response to your suspension, the following actions have been taken on your account:\r\n\r\n-A two-week suspension has been issued to your account.\r\n-All previous Season rewards (Victorious skins, borders, season icons, season ward skins) have been stripped from your account.\r\n-You are ineligible for any 2016 Season rewards\r\n\r\nWhile you may feel that this punishment is too harsh, please realize that having accounts boosted, for whatever reason, ruins the spirit of League of Legends competitive play. While you are ineligible for any rewards in the 2016 Season, this does not disqualify you for anything pertaining to the 2017 Season. Keep in mind that if you have any future involvement in MMR boosting, your account will be permanently suspended.\r\n\r\nMore information, including the definition of Boosting can be found here:\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751834-MMR-ELO-Boosting\r\n\r\nAurelise\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\nAhri ♡\r\n\r\nIsellyn\r\nIsellyn (Riot Games Player Support)\r\nNov 12, 11:34 PST\r\n\r\nSummoner,\r\n\r\nWe have a Player Behavior team in place dedicated to working with these requests, so I need to transfer your ticket. A Player Behavior Specialist will be contacting you as soon as they can.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that we respond to tickets in the order we receive them, so ‘bumping’ your ticket by sending us additional messages will send it to the back of our queue. This might inadvertently delay our response :(\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience!\r\n\r\nIsellyn\r\n\r\nRiot Games Billing and Account Support\r\n\r\nJanS GeT R\r\nJanS GeT RiGhT\r\nNov 11, 21:32 PST\r\n\r\nI didn't play LOL for few month because there were some personal issues, and today I tried to come back to the League; however, I found that I got blocked until next month, 15th.\r\nSo I immediately changed password, and am requesting a help to you.\r\nDo I just have to wait or do i have any options to unlock this?\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nDo u even look at questions?","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2016-11-15T03:33:56.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PWNED","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bruised Ego","date":"2016-11-15T02:05:23.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at your history, looks like you were boosted in July and camped the Gold 1.
