Since she does make a point (no pun intended) of keeping her face covered, so if there were any physical changes, we wouldn't know, but her sword was apparently forged before time itself (and yet still so shiny =p ) \n\nBut the updated story just points to Cassiopeia and Sivir sooo much!  Varus even walks into a room that is guarded by a serpent-headed god.   I just can't wait for the next Darkin reveal!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-01T16:19:53.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this so much!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-11-30T20:29:55.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm thinking this probably doesn't belong in Help & Support, but I was looking over all the stuff today in the Universe.  \n\nVarus went to Shurima.  \n\nSivir, at the time of her lore rework, was sent there to retrieve a very special weapon - her crossblade.  It was found with an ancient sarcophagus, and said to be as sharp as ever, and she felt insanely drawn to the blade.  If you go back to Kayn's lore, he too was said to have been drawn to his Darkin Blade.  Shortly after she found her crossblade, she was employed by Cassiopeia to go find something.  But it was all a ruse.    \n\nCassiopeia attempts to kill her to steal the crossblade.  Now, Cassiopeia's old lore is gone, and it's very vague on the Universe site as to how she became her new form.  It says an ancient Shuriman tomb guardian changed her with venom, but I'm wondering if there isn't something a bit more special about that blade.    \n\nAnd what we can see clearly from the game is that Sivir does get her crossblade back, because she uses it.  But Sivir doesn't appear to have any sort of \"contamination\" from a Darkin, and her crossblade looks normal by the time she gets it back.  Cassiopeia on the other hand... is definitely not her normal self anymore.  And while we've seen 3 male Darkins, we've never seen a female Darkin before to know what it would look like.  I suppose it's possible that it could still be pretty.  After all, Assassin Kayn is darn pretty.  \n\nI'm still going through everybody's lore right now to see if anyone else has a Shuriman weapon, but my bet is that if you're correct and they are pushing for a Darkin team, it's a mid lane Cassiopeia.","replies":[]}]}
