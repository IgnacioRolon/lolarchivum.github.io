As my team and I closed in to baron, me ult-jumping on it with around 1000 HP, 3 of us had a brief, yet serious disconnect issue in which we couldn't move. This lost us the game and I know that it can't be blamed on my internet or anyone else's because it was three separate people. Things like this can really ruin the competitiveness of a game and make you just want to stop playing. I don't feel like my team deserved the loss since we had been rotating together on towers and dragons properly. I wish I could ask for at least my LP to be returned although 25 LP in Bronze 1 really isn't a big deal. I love you Riot and I hope my voice will be heard.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-02T22:42:08.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your voice has **definitely** been heard. It really sucks when you're fighting tooth and nail for a win only to have something happen to take that moment from you. In these situations, it's hard to judge what exactly happened. When multiple players disconnect from a match, it could be caused by a local/region ISP issue, a continental backbone issue, or a hiccup in the server. \n\nEvents like this are extremely rare, but I can definitely see how they can negatively impact competitive spirit. Unfortunately, LP cannot be modified after the match has been recorded by the server. I feel that your positive attitude that this is only a minor setback is the exact spirit that will carry you through your promo series into Silver! :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
