Building Death's Dance will also inrease the frequency of this happening. \n\nI would have an interesting suggestion though that would make Kayn more unique but also overpowered. When he ults and infests a champion just let him pass all debuffs, CC or DoT's to the infested target. So if you build deaths dance, the target you ult starts bleeding. If you get ignited, exhausted, slowed, blinded it also affects your ult target instead of you while you are inside them. I think this would make him hilarious and create a lot of rants on the board. The amount of rants is usually a good indicator for champion being good . lel\n\nThey would definitely have to tune down Rhaasts ult heal though, or just give it to Shadow Assassin whos ult isn't that loaded already.","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2017-07-20T13:42:16.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i completely forgot about DD.
