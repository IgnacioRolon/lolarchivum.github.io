The games are really inconsistent as far as team work and people knowing what to do. Some players feel like they know exactly what to do and lane / last hit really well and I'm surprised they're in silver, and then there's others that I'm shocked have even made it this far. \n\nPeople feed out of control here. In Diamond if someone loses lane they die at most 2 times, and that's still a lot. In Silver, people don't seem to understand that if they died fighting once, it only gets harder to win and keep trying, and its not uncommon to see 7-9 deaths coming out of laning phase. Having players on the enemy team fed that much makes carrying hard, even if I win my lane every time or have a ton of successful ganks jungling. There also seems to be a disproportionate amount of AFKs here. \n\nIt feels like the best way to win here is to just stomp your lane and split push. Team fighting is a crap shoot, people are uncoordinated, don't follow up, and engaging is a huge risk because you may engage and only have 1-2 people follow up, or attack the wrong targets. If I don't HARD carry, IE 10+ kills before 20 minutes, and things go to the late game team fighting phase, I get a little nervous because its kind of a dice roll on how the fights will go. Its different in Diamond because you can make smart plays and expect people to be on board but here you really can't trust your team to follow up on things, so doing things like going full tank seems like a bad idea because a lot of the time you gotta do all the work yourself. Its a completely different meta than higher up. \n\nI was a little embarassed about the struggle here so I mentioned it in a group and a bunch of other Diamond / Master level players were having the same issues. I felt a little relieved to find that out but at the same time, it makes me wonder about skill in this game when players that have consistently proven themselves to be able to play at a high level struggle at this low of an elo. \n\nSo for all the players grinding out of Silver that are frustrated with the climb. Don't feel bad. It really does suck down here. Take it from a Diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-05-08T02:15:48.452+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":151,"body":"I'm locking this thread.

I've played through several Bronze accounts through to Gold and above and I initially had the same troubles as well. The problem is that every rank plays differently. What works in Plat+ (teamwork, ganks, sustain lanes, etc.) may not work in Silver simply due to how everyone plays. It's an entirely different meta that you have to shift to. Once you learn that Silver is a one man snowball game based upon winning the 30 minutes of nonstop 1v1 fights (cuz teamfights hardly exist) and then somehow enticing your allies into following your commands it becomes extremely simple and you'll never lose games besides leaves and legit trolls... which... are unfortunately surprisingly common in Silver. I know, I've been there.\n\n{{item:3340}} {{item:3361}} {{item:3364}} {{item:2043}} Wards. These things and clearing their things is so powerful it's ridiculous. Most Silvers won't use their trinkets let alone upgrade them. Sadly this is still true more often than not in Gold and Plat as well. Simply being able to see them and spam ping the hell out of them to get your allies attention to ambush or take caution not only saves their butts or nets you a kill, but also serves to further their trust in your leadership.\n\nLearning objective control and taking a huge active part in it gives your team an insane advantage. Being able to lead your team where you want (knowledgeably ofc) is a huge asset not to be taken lightly. But they won't listen right? That's because you aren't listening either... to yourself. Just take a moment to listen to yourself. Imagine yourself as an egotistical know it all. Now you just got killed and it's obviously not your fault cuz ur the best afterall. Then your ignorant ally tells you \"play more safe\" or \"build this instead\". Instantly muted. Either literally or mentally muted. You just removed this ally from the game. Instead of offering help or guidance, toss those ideas out the window cuz noone wants to hear it from you you know-it-all high-level player. Instead, stroke the hell out of their ego. \"Damn I saw that so lucky\" or \"You're fine she just got a lucky play\". U blame things on things other than that player and just watch the magic. That ally is instantly healed. Boom.\n\nKnow why positive players win more games? Cuz we all circle jerk each other so much we just win through a lack of negativity. But it's not because we're positive--it's because the enemy is negative! 9 times out of 10 the enemy team has some kind of internal conflict going on. The best ones are when they /all chat it. That's basically instant victory. Read the situation and chime in with some juicy provocation. Enemy: \"GG my jungler never ganks\" -> You: \"Lmao right\" OR \"Try warding? Stop blaming your jungler\". The butthurt you have instilled into the target player will cause a rectal implosion so devastating it can crash their connection. Always aim for the most vulnerable link. Is it verbal abuse? Idk, is \"Lmao right?\" or \"Stop blaming your teammates\" verbally abusive? I wouldn't think so ;)   Also people like to work with friends. When the team is positive, you become their temporary (or permanent) friend and they will more than likely listen to calls.\n\nTL;DR - Play carries that don't require allies. Ward. Stroke your allies' egos to maintain team positivity while the enemy destroys itself. Then just watch your winrate skyrocket. These factors remain true for all levels of play (other than the carry not requiring team play, that changes with rank meta).","replies":[{"poster":"OprahWlNfree","date":"2015-11-04T15:08:14.285+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else feel like the ranking system could be optimized to help with AFKs and other issues?","replies":[{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2015-11-04T16:36:32.965+0000","up_votes":66,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I think you shouldn't lose LP if there's an AFK from the start, seems like it would be easy to detect and possibly even have the game not start if someone fails to connect.

Picking the wrong target in that kind of a situation is literally the difference between getting a kill and wasting your hook and not having anything to do for 15 seconds while they get to be super-aggressive.\n\nThat's the reason I'm actually playing more Nautilus of late as a support. He has a hook (with a knockup, even), and it has a much shorter cooldown than Blitz grab. The only difference being that Nautilus can't grab over walls... but the number of times I've seen that happen on a consistent basis I could probably count on one hand. More often than not, wall-grabs with Blitz are just pure luck - shooting your fist off into Fog of War and hoping you connect with something that you can kill.\n\nNautilus has more utility that Blitz, too. Naut's R has more range, and also has single and multi-target affects. His W can help him survive in a close fight, and his E is ridiculous strong, even with no AP to augment it.\n\nI'll be honest, Blitz might be good in Silver, but Nautilus is probably a stronger Silver support, because his utility is much more USABLE than simply as a threat.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zarg","date":"2015-11-04T15:12:35.351+0000","up_votes":88,"down_votes":3,"body":"When a diamond says it, it's the biggest revelation ever and everyone goes nuts.

It highlights some of the biggest problems that most League players face. Namely, it mentions that in silver (the median rank for Ranked players) things are more... out of control. Players don't feel like they control when they win or improve in rank.\n\nSometimes a single player will AFK or troll all game, and relative to that the impact of the other 9 players on the game is insignificant. i.e. the outcome of the game was not controlled by the 9 legit players, but by the one AFK. However, this doesn't happen nearly as often as it used to.\n\nMore importantly, even when both teams are putting thier best foot forward, players feel like their team is holding them back or throwing the game. As the OP said, even with diamond-level skill he feels it's hard to carry a game or make enough of an impact to win despite the mistakes of his team.\n\nIn essence, when playing League especially in lower ELOs, it doesn't feel like your efforts have much effect at all over the game. Perhaps putting this way makes it easier to understand the frustration: How can we even know when we are playing well if we seem to win/lose randomly despite giving 100% effort every game.\n\nNow I think everyone gets that. That's why this thread is at 400 upvotes. But I want to explore a little deeper. Why do people feel like they are stuck in ELO hell? Why does it feel like we don't have control over the outcome of our matches? And what can Riot do to improve that feeling? What can WE do to improve that?\n\nI don't want this comment to be even more giant, so I'll just leave y'all with one of those answers (two technically):\n\nNow this is common knowledge but it's a good starting point, LoL is a team game. Every game has 10 players in it, and thus every player should only have 1/10 control over the outcome of a match. That much is unavoidable. So one of the best things WE can do to have a better time playing, is just to keep that in mind, that we are playing with a team. Try to alter the way you think after a game (or during, if you have thought cycles to spare). Don't just think about yourself:\n* Don't just think, \"[insert prefered curse words], I lost again. Still trapped in ELO hell...\"\n* Even worse, don't think, \"[more cursing], my team sucked again. Thanks for the loss guys.\"\n* Instead, how about, \"[expletives], WE didn't have what it takes to win that game. Teammate 1 didn't use his ult like he should. And Teammate 2 got caught. I thought I permored well actually, but maybe I could have help out Teammate 1 or spammed pings for Teammate 2.\"\n\nTo be perfectly clear, the last example was better because it didn't feel like you lost for no reason. It may not have been your fault, and indeed in this example your team totally threw the game, BUT at least you identified why your team lost. If you think about the details of how you and your team played, you keep your mind busy rather than just stewing about how far behind everyone was. You also kept in mind that you are a part of that team, rather than being isolated, like it's just you vs. the game. As a bonus, you may even be able to learn from your teammates mistakes. (And if you are learning from 5 people's mistakes rather than just your own, then you should improve very quickly.) And as a final shoot-for-the-stars goal, you could even think about what the enemy team did right to win the game, or what mistakes they made that your team didn't capitalize on.\n\nSo sure, League can be really frustrating sometimes, for many reasons. But it helps to think about those reasons, and sometimes you have to change HOW you think about your frustrations. And besides, League is still really fun most of the time :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-11-04T17:38:33.275+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Coming from a primarily unranked player in high gold, getting out of silver has very little to do with your mechanical ability. It has a LOT to do with your *leadership* ability.\n\nWorking in champ select to make sure everyone's on a role they feel comfortable with,  keeping the team focused and positive  throughout, even when there's a losing lane. These are the essential skills of climbing out of silver. That's why you see players who are mechanically skilled and have good game knowledge who can't climb. They think they can't control their teammates, but the that just isn't the truth.\n\n---\n\nCan you do an experiment for me? On your smurf start every game with these three lines:\n\n>Good [time of day], everybody.\n>My prefs are [X, Y, Z]\n>Is anyone a good [least preferred role for carrying]?\n\nThen work to make sure everyone gets one of their top two roles.
