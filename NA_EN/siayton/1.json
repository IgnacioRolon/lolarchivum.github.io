Do whatever the hell you want. Stuff a joint up your anus light it up and try to smoke via your butthole for all I care. It's your personal right and you do whatever you want. As long as you don't mess with people that is. \n\nPerpetuating and justifying weed culture is wrong. Smoking weed(among doing other things) is a right, not a privilege, thus shoving it in people's faces is completely uncalled for. AND wrong. Smoke all the weed, drink all you want, good for you. That's your right. Boasting about it while playing League or doing anything for that matter is stupid, uneccesary and redundant. Nobody cares, nobody asked you.\n\n A couple of days ago I played a game with a premade duo who spent 6 minutes chatting to eachother about how freaking drunk they were, barely capable of typing not in english, but in their own freaking native language. Wanna know why that's wrong? Because being drunk is their right, busting everyone's balls over how drunk they were isn't. Doing stupid things and then typing \"yik yik ey'm so drunk lel\" crosses the line, and moves from exercising your rights to shoving your self proclaimed privilige to your teammate's faces. \n\nWe are all here to enjoy a good game, if you're here because smoking weed makes you want to play LoL instead of eating icecream that's good, but don't give us blue balls about it. Sure, I don't mind about people letting me know they are kinda drunk or high so they might play a bit wobbly or be not so focused as usual, it's actually helpfull because I can then addapt my playstyle accordingly, but going all \"dude i'm so high right now lelel- I know right? weed's love weed's life I'm so damn high right know i can't even see clearly- oh shiet im 0/7 guess playing yasuo while being drunk as fuk was a bad idea lol- look at those stupid tryhards 3v1 me lol to kill me im so drunk lel\" is completely stupid. Because it ruins the experience for everyone else. because we're here to have fun, not indulge in the meaning of life after the percentage on alcohol in one's blood exceeds a certain level, nor how great the quality of weed you bought from your albanian friend was and how you should call your bros to smoke it all \"togetha\"\n\nBecause ruining the game for your teammates and possibly the enemy team is griefing, and griefing is a reportable and potentially a bannable offense. Because we're here to enjoy a good game of League, not start a drug cartel or run over a poor pedestrian with our car while intoxicated to the point of disgust.\n\n*RANT OVER*","replies":[{"poster":"Rubber Jesus","date":"2015-03-30T19:18:11.523+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play League high, and I don't smoke weed anymore since I have a family now and a kid in the house.

Maybe it's because you obviously have never smoked, but I can understand a fellow smoker and can deal with them a bit better.\n\nI don't smoke. Not because I don't like it, hate it or critisize it. I don't smoke because I feel like I don't really need it in my life as a person. Weed right? Not cigarettes, cigarettes can get you cancer, they can kill you. Weed is proven to even have curative effects. Same with **PURE** cocaine, which actually \"boosts\" your body and mind without causing you addiction, compared to the poisoned  proccesed toxic crap they sell to people unfortunate enough to come across them, thus destroying their lives. Sames goes for drinking: red wine actually has rejuvinating effects if you drink like a wine glass a day.\n\nI drink whenever I feel like it, on amounts that will satisfy me. I don't find satisfaction in losing myself, in puking and losing my mind, in suffering from headaches, in commiting acts that might endanger people close to me or even strangers. But that's just me. That's how I personaly see it.\n\nIn my country we have a saying: you smoke it, it doesn't smoke you- and: you drink it, it doesn't drink you. I'm not talking about smoking or drinking in moderation simply to fullfill your needs. Getting intoxicated from alcohol and weed is what's really the problem. I don't mean alcohol and weed should be illegal and people that do them are abominations, on the contrary, I've met and knew people that smoke weed regularly and are actually really open minded talkative and intelligent individuals with very interesting things to talk and share. Same goes for systematic drinkers. I also knew a girl that weed almost destroyed her life, I also know some friends that drinking almost destroyed their lives.\n\nThe problem isn't weed and alcohol. The problem is perpetuating weed(drugs too) and alcohol culture as a whole. Making being stupidly drunk seem like something cool to do. Say that to the guy that ran over that that teenager on the bus station. Say that to the young child who their mother's got abused by their drunk father daily. Say that to the multiple cases of drunk rapists at parties etc etc. Say that to the dude that got so high that shot his family. Say that to the families that suffer from addicted members, say that to the junkies that lay dead in the corner. You get where I'm going.\n\nWe should be facilitating responsibility and freedom, instead of abuse and demonization. We should also agnowledge where the problem lies and try to fix it, not remove it. Being high and playing League isn't the problem, it's your god damn right. The problem is thinking AND sharing with everyone that drinking and smoking the fuck out of yourself is a cool thing to do you know? Whether that's a sideeffect of being intoxicated or perpetuation is something that's for the individual to decide. Ofcourse a smoker or drinker knows better for themselves compared to an outsider like me, but that doesn't invalidate my opinions and anyone else's for that matter.\n\nPersonally I deal with this problem by saying to them \"do you think that  being high(or drunk) as fuck and playing games is cool? nobody cares\" and then muting them or muting them in the first place without saying anything, and I generally try to avoid playing the time I know I'm most likely to run into them. I don't have a problem with them. I have a problem with them thinking and sharing that being drunk and high out of your mind is cool if you know what I mean. \n\nI failed to properly convey what I think as well as understand what exactly you ment, and that propably lead to a small missunderstanding. I hope I made myself clear this time. I don't mean to hate, but I do have my issues with this matter. It's just how I personally see it within those parameters, not generalization and bigotry.

I specificaly differenciated my points for that exact reason. I SPECIFICALY differenciated between my points, and I NEVER and I repeat NEVER mentioned nor even implied tried or whatever that I'm here to battle the worlds problems. I intentionally mentioned what I did to make myself more clear. I don't give a fuck about the world because the world will never give a fuck about me, I believe in taking responsibility in one's choices since you made them yourself.\n\nA blanket of blame around the whole?! I SPECIFICALY mentioned and differenciated between drunks and stonets/junkies and what they cause to themselves and those around them. I never said burn the stoners and the junkies alike, because they get high, I never said drunks should be executed and shit(overexaggeration but you get my point). \n\nWhat do you know about my beliefs, and what do they have to do with USA history? I don't know about fear mongering and whatever they did with black men having rights to white women or whatever. You can't expect me to know same way I'm not expecting you to know about my country's history. Nor weed's history and culture in general, since I'm not familiar with it at all. I don't talk about that.\n\n Weed doesn't make you kill your family. I never said it does. I said I know people that WEED almost made them destroy THEMSELVES, I said I know people ALCOHOL almost made them destroy themselves. Just because weed is not the same as drugs thus junkies =/= stoners doesn't mean weed can't ruin your life. Abuse of EVERY SINGLE SUBSTANCE can harm you. Hell you can die from WATER INTOXICATION. WATER, not freaken weed, WATER. That's why there exist the concept of **MODERATION**, so you can enjoy yourself without going overboard and potentialy harming yourself and others. Let's say I decide to get high; will I turn to that russian drug that destroyes your skin? Would you? Isn't that going overboard and harming yourself? No, you smoke weed instead or try something alternative. Drug addicts have done horrible things to themselves and people around them. Maybe not the junky that lives in my neighborhood, but the junky that killed her husband is. You get my point? However,  you can go overboard all you want as long as you think about people around you.\n\nBecause I don't directly experience those things, it doesn't mean I don't have the right and form my own personal opinion. I believe to be myself a smart individual with an open mind, that's why I specificaly DIFFERENCIATED my points and gave SPECIFIC examples and didn't throw everything into the pot. I will mention time and again, boasting about what substance you abuse is to me personally NOT COOL AND RESPECTFULL TO OTHERS AT ALL. I believe in your right to excersise substance abuse. It's your freaking birth right, but not your privilege, you don't get to wave it into my face. I could possibly like doing the helicopter dick, you don't see me going to playgrounds to do it. Instead I do it in my bathroom. Why? Because I do it for myself while being respectfull to the fact that others might not want to look at a dude doing the helicopter dick in the middle of the street. You don't get to judge me the same way I don't judge you. Who the hell do you think you are?\n\nYou took it personal and kinda lost yourself in the moment? Fine.\n\nYou and your friends. Have you met every single stoner on the planet? How can you then generalize and speak for everyone? Because you and your friends were thinking that way? I can guarantee you there are people that think being high as fuck from weed is cool, and some of the play LoL, and some of them boast about it in chat, and I've ran into some of them. Does that mean everyone does so? Do you think I'm fucking retarted? Do you think I'm a 13 year old teenage keyboard warrior? Ofcourse not everyone's the same. That's would be the stupidest thing to say and think. That doesn't instantly make every stoner a narcissistic dumbass that feels the need to satisfy his lack of attention via LoL in game chat and whatnot. I told you I've personally met STONERS that were really good people, one of them was a very-very good friend of mine back in senior high-school. I also knew a girl that weed almost made her lose herself and destroy her future. WEED, not drugs. My cousin almost destroyed his life from WEED and ALCOHOL. It DOES happen wether you like it or not. That doesn't instantly demonize weed, it's god damn substance abuse that's a whole different matter that needs to be adressed, but we're not the ones to do it in a LoL thread. Same goes for alcohol, there've been times when I'd drink a glass  of a soft drink a day. At the moment I haven't drank for 2 months.\nI also used to drink energy drinks, I'm talking about 1-2 every single damn day. Eventually my stomach started to hurt and I felt sick for days. I stopped. You know why? Because I took something I enjoyed and loved, and abused it so much it backfired at me. Perhaps 1 energy drink once a week or maybe 5 days would be enough, but I took it steps further and payed for it(thankfully not severly). That doesn't mean energy drinks should be banned from the planet. That's irresponsible and arrogant. Perhaps I should've known, no, it was my responsibility to know, that drinking something like an energy drink so freaking frequently WILL harm me.\n\n\"Respond arrogantly?\" The fuck? Don't I have the right to express myself? It's not like I told them to commit suicide or that they are lifeless shame of human beings junkies for crying out loud. Do you seriously think think that's arrogant? Come on, we live on the same planet, right? We both know what real arrogance is like, and it doesn't lie in my distaste for this particular act. But that's your own personal opinion, as responding the way I do is mine.\n\nAlso, that part about videogames, come on, seriously now? Now you're just being cynical. On a sidenote, those seem pretty interesting articles to read, I've bookmarked them all and will read them, you've picked my curiosity and I'd like to enlighten myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Rubber Jesus","date":"2015-03-31T13:56:13.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ironhold,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iNb24df1,comment-id=000c0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-30T22:09:04.505+0000)\n>\n> Say that to the dude that got so high that shot his family. \n> \n\nJust saying, you treat it like a whole when you encounter in game.

Just pointing out the discrepancy in what you say and what you do.\n\nAnd I listed that about video games because *anything can be an addiction*. *** Anything can make you lose your job, beat your wife, kill your friend, neglect your kid, and fuck over your life in general.  ***  Anything can an evil, not just drugs or alcohol.  This was my point in that post, and it appears you missed it.   Just cause someone is high in a game you meet, you don't respond with, \"oh you're so cool, huh?\"  Wouldn't you think it was strange if you said you were a gamer to someone, and they were like, \"oh yeah, a gamer huh? what makes you think you're so cool? get the fuck out of here.\"  You'd be like, wtf, because you *aren't one of the ones who abuse it and you wouldn't like being grouped in with those assholes I listed*.  You can't generalize everything you see in League, it's a small proportion of the users you are targeting your rage at.  Just like only 10% of gamers in Korea have a problem.  The other 90% are fine, they have a balance of work, family, and games.  But someone shouldn't read those articles and automatically judge all gamers are bad, because these articles are where a lot of video gamers get a bad reputation from.  But you wouldn't include yourself in the addicted portion, and probably 90% of the people you encounter in League wouldn't include themselves in the addicted portion of that population either.  Just giving you some perspective, dude, trying to get you walk in someone's else shoes for once.  Multiple outlooks enrich lives, just saying. \n\nEdit: So instead of immediately responding to everyone by bashing them for saying that, and then muting them, try to just ignore and kindly remind them to keep on track of playing League.  If they get out of hand sure, but I've never come across someone so drunk or high it was mentioned more than one or two times.\n\nAnother edit showing, yes, whether or not you think you generalize the whole population of people who smoke and drink, you really do group them all into one big addicted scourge of the world. 'Hey look, this guy got high one time on the weekend and played League, he's damaging his loved ones and I have the right to call him out because since he talked about it in chat, he must be addicted.' <- That is what I got from you, all the while arguing that some people can do it in moderation, and you completely agree it is fine to do in moderation.  Yet your examples, like the one below, show otherwise.  Just chill out okay?  It's probably just someone who does it 1-2 times a week, no need to get all pissy on them for it. Just politely ask them to get back on track to playing League, and 9/10 they will.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Ironhold,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iNb24df1,comment-id=000c0002000000010000,timestamp=2015-03-30T22:19:38.992+0000)\n>\n> Something little?
