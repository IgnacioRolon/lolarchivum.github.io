I have a high end machine and can run the game smoothly at 144fps. It will drop to ~120 FPS every couple of seconds when I'm moving my champion but if I hold still, there aren't any stutters. I tried dropping it to 60 FPS to see if it was a performance issue but even at 60 FPS it drops to 50 FPS or so every couple of seconds while moving. \r\n\r\nAny idea what could be causing these stutters?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T16:00:46.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your pc is too good, it can actually run into snags, see if this [high spec pc guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs) can help.
