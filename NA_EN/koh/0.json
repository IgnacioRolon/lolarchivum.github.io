Grab our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and run it with the options reinstall and clean uninstall turned on to make sure you get a fresh copy of the game installed.

Tried solving it with Hextech Repair Tool from r/leagueoflegends. Did a repatch with the tool and nothing came out of it. Problem persisted. Did a fresh reinstall and still got the bugsplat. Funny thing, I was playing League just fine before this Urgot update. What went wrong?\n\nEdit: Ran with administrator, deleted temp files (windows and appdata) and ran in compatibility mode with Windows XP (service 3) both \"lol.launcher\" and \"lol.launcher.admin\". Didn't work.\n\nEdit2: Updated my graphics/audio drivers. Did not work.\n\nEdit3: Went to play CSGO. The problem is on Riot's end, bug splat came after Urgot update. Fucking thing sucks.","replies":[]}]}
