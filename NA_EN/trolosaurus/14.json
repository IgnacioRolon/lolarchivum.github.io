Them forcing the whole Darkin thing's been a gripe for a while, I've never really seen the reason why so many people want to know about the whole 5 Darkin thing when by doing that it just undermines the uniqueness of the first guy.

Its a reminder of his race. Turns out Darkin were more civilised creatures than we thought, and this one is no different than \"old, human\" Varus. He misses his darkin family from centuries ago and the necklace is a memory of them.\n\nI am hoping so so much. I refuse to let go old Varus honestly, erasing a whole character is wrong, plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkhan","date":"2017-12-01T22:05:57.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ACTUALLY!!!! \n\nThe Locket could be his sister? \nAt the end of the Varus lore, Varus (the darkin) asked in the air, 'Sister, where are you?'\n\nFemale Darkin inbound.
