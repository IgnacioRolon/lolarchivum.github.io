If his parents were alive, then \"YAY! NONE EDGINESS!\" Congrats. His parents will be under siege every Saturday morning cause a certain Chem-baron knows they still live in Zaun.\n\nWhy don't they just leave Zaun!?!?!?\n\nThen, Zac...won't be in Zaun. And now people will be like \"Wait, why are you taking Zac out of Zaun?\"\n\nBut...the parents just letting this happen would be...bad writing.

Instead of having his parents die in the Chem-Baron attack like Riot did, have them survive and realize how dangerous Zaun is. They begin packing up their life and their work, to move somewhere far away and remote so they can continue their research in peace. Except Zac has seen the evilness of the chem-barons, and how they terrorize the people of Zaun, and he makes a decision to stay in Zaun to protect the people and make right the wrongs that the Barons are committing there and so he can make it safe again for his parents to return home. His parents give him their blessing, understanding that they need to let their chick fly from the nest some day, and leave Zaun. \n\nBoom. Problems solved. Parents live. Zac stays in Zaun. Zac makes sense being plucky and happy since his parents are alive and he's doing good in the world. Zac ALSO achieves the superhero sub-theme that he has going for him by making the noble, pure decision to stay in his troubled city and clean up the crime there. It actually does a helluva lot more for Zac's characterization too because it crystalizes the life lessons his parents have taught him, and develops them into strong character traits like a sense of justice and a desire to make the world better and makes them more human and personal to him because _he_ makes the choice to stay and do good for the people of Zaun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Phhase","date":"2018-10-26T07:05:06.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, Zac's new lore is a bit edgy (Parents ded now).
