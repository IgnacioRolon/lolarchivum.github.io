The issue was we had overloaded champ select with too many sound effects, making it hard to tell when key things were actually going on - like when it was your turn to pick. You'll still hear your own champ when you lock them in.\n> The upside of this is that since the recent patch we're seeing some of the lowest dodge rates ever.\n\nAnd then to follow up on that,\n\n[RiotBoourns](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4a0gum/riot_confirms_champion_select_quotes_not_being/d0wochm):\n> Right, and the problem is that the champion quotes can be pretty long and would actually stomp the \"your turn to pick\" sound. A further refinement could be muting the champion quote if you're picking next or fading it out when your turn starts. That was more complicated and we had some high priority fixes that we were working on so we kept it simple.\n> I do hear you, though, we all loved the champion quotes and thought they were a great way to add more flavor to the experience.\n\nSo it sounds like that team does love the champ select quotes, but in the interest of haste and getting a fix out, turned them off because they were stomping the 'your turn to pick' sound effect.

If that was the case, then having those things be in conflict is probably something they're wrestling with right now.  Until they can devote programming time to the issue, a quick 'fix' is all they could do.  (Obviously one man's fix is another man's loss of characterization in this case.)\n\nI don't think (though again, not on that team) anyone thinks it's an ideal solution, or even a permanent solution.  Adding a toggle isn't something that can be done as quickly as just turning off a bunch of sounds, alas.  It's possible it'd be most efficient to add it to the new client - but I haven't used it myself and don't know.\n\nAs for Rioters posting in other locations - Rioters are where players are.  Some players are here, some are on Twitter, Facebook, AskFM, Reddit, and other places.

There used to be a chime when it was your turn, just, champion selection quotes would play over it.\n\nI think a visual cue could be a potential solution. If you're tabbed out, have the client pop up to the forefront of your screen. And make something significant about the window change. Instead of a blue background, for example, have it change to a brighter green background. Or just have it say, \"It's your turn.\" in large, bold letters at the top, as opposed to just, \"Lock in your champion.\" Maybe make the letters a standout color.\n\nWe can come up with an easy, simple solution that can please mostly everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solerian","date":"2016-03-12T23:48:16.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm by no means looking for a fight, just trying to make a case!\n\nI understand how the issue with notifying whenever it was a given person's turn caused an problem for Rioters, but I'd like to point out this could have been something that was addressed prior to the Champion Select even being released. It's not real cool of Riot to give us a feature like this and take it away without asking us if it was a distraction (maybe through a poll of sorts?) or finding better alternatives (such as removing some of the other, less interesting and more irritating sounds).\n\nThe primary issue on Riot's behalf here, which I hope you can at the very least agree with (if not publically because you are a member of the company) is that there was a terrible execution with the change. For starters, it wasn't even included in the \"Champion Select\" section of the Patch Notes, and there's no evidence anywhere that states this feature will be re-added in the future as solutions are found. While you say you don't think anyone thinks this feature could be gone for good, we really have nothing to base any hopes on here as it was so quietly removed. \n\nI've yet to see a solid argument for its removal other than theoretical statements. We're not really seeing a solid connection between this data that Socrates supposedly has \"proving\" the champion select quote was a huge issue. Perhaps it was the clarification of the other sounds that ended up causing this instead. It would be better to have all of these sounds and work down rather than pull one out and add more in. \n\nI see no reason, ultimately, for them to leave this feature out. The majority of us seem to be suffering for a small minority that can't pay attention to champion select. Perhaps for now until they develop some fixes, but we'd like to see some transparency here about whether or not it will return. \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2016-03-12T23:07:04.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Solerian,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=uEP9aU9P,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-03-12T23:02:18.042+0000)\n>\n> I would like to show you to multiple threads where there is an immense amount of support for this feature:\n> \n> [HUGE Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4a0gum/riot_confirms_champion_select_quotes_not_being/)\n> [Original Reddit Thread w/ Socrates' Quote](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/49ykh1/what_happened_to_the_champion_select_quotes)\n> [Tobias Brackner&#039;s Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/1pHAuXYG-why-is-there-no-more-dialogue-w-the-champs-in-ranked-select)\n>  [VaynexVladOTP&#039;s Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/3Wk7G1A2-i-want-to-hear-all-10-selection-quotes-again)\n> [Nameless Voice&#039;s Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/NHGbqhdu-no-champion-selection-quotes-in-champion-select)\n> [That Evelynn&#039;s Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/weJzEjtq-why-did-they-remove-champion-quotes-from-new-champ-select?)\n> [My Personal Thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/s9aaY4Q6-my-thoughts-on-riots-decision-to-remove-other-champions-select-quotes)\n> \n> While I respect Riot for their good intentions, what we the community have come to say is that, no, Riot, it wasn't the champion select quotes.

The issue was we had overloaded champ select with too many sound effects, making it hard to tell when key things were actually going on - like when it was your turn to pick. You'll still hear your own champ when you lock them in.\n>The upside of this is that since the recent patch we're seeing some of the lowest dodge rates ever.\n\nMind you the one said it was a bug is not on the team responsible & was just assuming.An honest mistake,I mean I assumed it was a bug too since it wasn't in the patch notes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2016-03-12T20:27:59.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really hope they add it back, or add an option for it.
