Both have only one representative in the forms of {{champion:1}} and {{champion:62}} respectively.

They just need to finish their retcon with all the places and regions within Runeterra. They have plenty of room to release a couple to half a dozen of champions per faction. As you said, Plague Jungles and Kumungu could have 2 or 3 more champions. \nWe could have another one from Shurima. \nThere is still an old sage trope spot that needs to be filled. \nReworked champions could become more amazing champions. \nThere are subfactions within faction such as the Houses in Demacia which all should have at least a champion (House Spiritmight doesn't). \nYou never know what's lurking within Noxus and Zaun. \nPiltover could use more champs. \nDoesn't hurt to release another yordle champ. \nAnd a few more factionless champs cand be released. \nCould get one of Zed's students. \n\nOr a released demon from one of Thresh's artifacts (when he was alive). \n\nI think we've got at least another year and a half's worth of spots in Runeterra which can be easily filled with new champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-11-01T20:00:19.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can bring {{champion:10}}  and {{champion:25}} into this world as a new faction because as of right now they are some off world being summoned by summoner who does't exist anymore.
