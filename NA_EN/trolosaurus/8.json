He's Piltovian, but he wasn't necessarily tied down to any specific locale. And now that he has some interesting depth as to _why_ he might be doing these things and be the way he is, it will be interesting to see him grow beyond those reasons and maybe find new ones. \n\nEveryone needs to remember, we already have a setup from Ryze's video where he's missing a Rune. Ya know, the artifacts that are basically super powers? Artifacts that need to be found, or possibly...have already been found? Remember that Ryze is looking for an apprentice?

I love new Ezreal, mostly because it addresses some of the issues I had with old Ezreal - namely that he was just too good at everything to be a compelling or interesting character. \n\nHe was always a little arrogant, but it never reached Jayce levels of \"clear character flaw,\" so he never really felt believable. Otherwise, he was the perfect guy. Good-looking, highly intelligent, athletic, cool, with an awesome magical gauntlet. New Ezreal seems like they were aware of the issue, and are writing him much more like a young, naive screw-up who, while talented and everything, also regularly makes silly mistakes (Forgetting to bring food during his spelunking? Bringing a single rope that he doesn't even know the length of? Carelessly leaving that artifact where civilians could touch it?), gets too wrapped up in himself to think about other people, leaps before looking, and tries way too hard to make himself look cool, only to come across as a huge dork. Instead of playing the \"perfect and untouchable flawless genius\" character type straight as they did with old Ezreal, they're deconstructing it and even making fun of it to an extent. I find much more compelling, especially with the addition of him wanting to be cool so that his parents come back to him giving it a sad edge. He's meant to come off as a little obnoxious, because he's trying too hard to impress. \n\nHe is a greatly flawed kid, and I love it. He's reckless, self-absorbed, and dishonest, and I can get behind that. He's a prodigal teenager who didn't have a strong authority figure in his life, and his role models were a bunch of devil-may-care explorers. His reputation and what other people think of him is all he really has to define himself. He has lots of room to grow and improve, and with clear character flaws this time it's easier for Riot to use him in other stories, so that he can have compelling conflicts and grow as a person. I look forward to seeing them explore the emotions that he's most definitely repressing in favor of his facade. Hopefully Riot comes through.","replies":[{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2018-09-26T20:43:39.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look back through my comments, you'll find that I've been very open about my intense hatred of Ezreal because he always felt too mary-sueish. He was naturally good at everything and was cocky and arrogant, but at the same time he saw his legions of fans as annoying? Yet at the same time lets books be written about him? He just annoyed me so much, I couldn't stand him. His gameplay looked fun but I just couldn't like him because he felt like an arrogant jerk who they tried to make not an arrogant jerk who everyone loved. \n\nI love new Ezreal so much. He's funny, hes dorky, he's awkward, I still don't really support Luxreal but it's more believable now and his reactions around her make him feel so much more human (except in SG Ez, I really dislike his SG lux interactions), and he's just so fun now.
