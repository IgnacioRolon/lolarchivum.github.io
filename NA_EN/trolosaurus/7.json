Going back over a place that we&#039;ve already updated and had an event for may seem redundant to some, but to me it just breathes life even further into an already interesting character.\nYou didn't need to do it, but you did, and it's made the entire area more interesting as a result. \nI love the new Kench, Fizz, and Nautilus lore, and Pyke is an extremely interesting character as well.\n\nAll this passion that you put into this lore clearly shows, and it just makes this world feel so much more alive. I don&#039;t play League much anymore, but I still follow the lore, and this makes me very, very pleased for all the effort you put into it.\n\nWe&#039;re more than halfway done now with updating every champion, and the effort is paying off.

I have written stories with fantasy characters and not a single time did i use midgets or gnomes/dwarves in them as they almost always serve as comic relief.
