I don&#039;t know why, but it tilts me so hard and I can&#039;t play straight because I&#039;m too busy getting mad at them.\nMy bud thinks its cause I've been a bit of a punching bag all my life so my tolerance for people's BS is really low. \nGenerally speaking, any insult at all sets me off. I've been getting angrier a lot more recently and I'm worried I'll get a warning or banned if it continues. \n\nAny tips beyond mute them all?","replies":[{"poster":"EatCrayons","date":"2016-11-14T21:05:48.351+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some good suggestions in here. There's some bad ones too, but lucky for everyone they're pretty easy to spot.\n\nI can't tell you for sure how to manage your temper or tendency to tilt but here's something that works for me as a gamer.\n\nOne angle I take is that the great thing about the internet is that you can be anyone you want to be. Ever done some role playing? Time to go nuts.\n\nImagine the player that you want to be and how that player acts when they're winning, losing, catching flack or receiving praise. Now write that shit down. This is your character sheet. The action of writing it down will help you to actively commit it to memory, too. Maybe you write down \"Humble in victory. Cool under pressure. Listens for the useful parts of everything said and refuses to acknowledge negativity. Also a secret agent.\"\n\nNow, your goal is to be that person every game.\n\nIf it helps, write a checklist out:\nHumble in victory. \nCool under pressure. \nListened for the useful parts of everything said.\nRefused to acknowledge negativity.\nSecret agent.\n\nAt the end of each game, regardless of which nexus exploded, check off the boxes for what you accomplished and circle what you didn't. Don't make excuses for yourself but don't beat yourself up either. If you end up with 5 items like above, 7/10 is a passing score but 9/10 is better. You get an experience point every time you check a box. Track them.\n\nSet the goal as a positive statement. Make it achievable in every game. Write it down. Track your progress. Have some fun with it.\n\nStay classy.","replies":[{"poster":"ShinkoMinori","date":"2016-11-15T15:56:23.699+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"How many crayons have you eaten? and why?","replies":[{"poster":"EatCrayons","date":"2016-11-15T22:49:48.472+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about aspiration than accomplishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Breaku","date":"2016-11-15T23:07:05.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EatCrayons,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TdFHzaod,comment-id=001000010000,timestamp=2016-11-15T22:49:48.472+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s more about aspiration than accomplishment.\n\nHow many years did you serve as an 03?","replies":[{"poster":"EatCrayons","date":"2016-11-15T23:30:28.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a civilian and never served in the Marine Corps.","replies":[{"poster":"Piltover Customs","date":"2016-11-15T23:32:06.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EatCrayons,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=TdFHzaod,comment-id=00100001000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-15T23:30:28.175+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m a civilian and never served in the Marine Corps.\n\nThat still leaves more branches that you COULD have :O","replies":[{"poster":"EatCrayons","date":"2016-11-16T02:05:42.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.

I mean, it sucks having a short temper, but acknowledging the problem is still something to congratulate... considering how so many people out there still refuse to acknowledge any faults at all beginning with them.\n\nI have been a bit of a punching bag most of my life as well, was bullied and ostracized most of my time in public school--yeah yeah, toughen up, I hear ya trolls. What keeps me from flaming out when I get insulted, or mocked, or what have you... is remembering all the times in the past, and even in the moment, it hurts me. I don't want to be treated like that... and that's exactly why I try to avoid treating anyone else like that. I'm in the unique position of knowing what it's like being on the side being put down. I know how horrible it makes a person feel... I know how bad it can make me perform in game, too. So, that's my largest motivator.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've had a message all ready to go. Angry caps, angry words, my blood is boiling, but somehow, every time, I manage to stop myself. Read what I wrote, shake my head, \"it's not worth it. It is not worth it. Just play the damned game.\" And, let me tell you one of the best methods I've had for disarming the flamers and ragers and trolls... acknowledge what they say as fact, but play it off at the same time. \"I know, Sona, I'm not doing great, but hey, you're playing with me!\" \"I dunno, Gragas, they seem to be camping me an awful lot... could just be that I need to ward more before i push out.\" But, really, the best thing to do is to... just not say anything. Shout at the air, scream and rant to your accepting friends, kick and flail in your chair like a petulant two-year old(I have done it, it helps sometimes...). If it's in the comfort of your own privacy, you're allowed to vent your rage and/or frustration in any way that is healthy to you. Don't let anyone else tell you what you can't do to vent, as long as it doesn't directly impact your game.\n\nHell, I've spent games talking back to people in my game, by just... talking at my screen. They can't hear me, I'm not streaming, no one else can really hear me--other than me. And it usually helps keep me cool. Because i'm getting it off my chest, in the most positive way I can manage to do it.\n\nSo yes, you can mute everyone and band-aid the problem... or you can try and find personal ways of dealing with it. What works for me, won't work for everyone, and what works for you, might not work for everyone. gg wp at the end of every game, _even if you don't feel like it was a good game, or well played_ ... Humble in defeat, humble in victory. I shake my head everytime I see a \"gg ez\". Every. Single. Time. And yes, I report them for it. But that's my opinion, and no one can tell me otherwise. :3\n\nAnd, sometimes, the best thing to do... is take a break. Play ARAM instead of SR for a few weeks(or SR instead of ARAM if you're an ARAM'er like I usually am). Try out a different game, maybe pick up a slower calmer game. Play two matches, then play your calmer game for 30 minutes or an hour. Then play another two matches of league, or three if you feel like you can handle it.\n\nIf you really feel like your temper is starting to become a problem, not just in League... there are therapists out there for this sort of thing. There is no shame in seeking professional help. Even I've seen a couple in my lifetime for a variety of reasons. And I don't doubt that someday in the future, I might have to see one again. (I am, unfortunately, becoming more and more anxious with each passing day, go figure.)\n\nWell, this was a wall... hopefully I at least put something helpful in there. Flamers...

I've never been reported (i think) or at least ive never had any suspensions/bans/punishments. You may disagree with my methods, but hey im just trying to offer some tips.
