Teammates have already remade so I get a leaver penalty.\nI assume its a weird coincidence so I try again. Loud sound, computer freezes, forced restart. Remake and leaver penalty AGAIN.\nFinally, I try a custom. Guess what? Loud sound, computer freezes, forced restart. \nI have no idea why this is happening but I literally cannot play the game. I used to be able to play it fine at 60+ FPS and have had no issues prior to this. I suspect it may be the new Windows Updates or a patch however, and I'm loathe to reinstall as the process is long and cumbersome.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-12T02:28:07.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like the known issue with the Windows Game Bar after it was updated to include *Game DVR*.
