The game changes significantly based on the level of play you're at. It can take years to fully understand aspects of this game and Riot making huge changes every season doesn't help either.\n\nHell, itemization alone takes at least a season or two to fully understand, especially for champions that have to balance damage and defense. There are so many things you have to take into account, all of which change almost every season.
