Our Leaverbuster system works on a sort of level system.  Everyone starts off at Level 0,  and if you do leave a game, no punishments are given to you because we know that shit happens sometimes.  However, if you continue to leave games, your level can increase higher and higher.  If it gets to a certain point, even a single leave will levy penalties against your account.\n\nThis doesn't mean you are stuck here forever.  The longer you play without leaving any games, your Leaver Level will eventually start to decay, and will eventually  hit zero once more.\n\nThe best advice I can offer is to keep playing without leaving, and you shouldn't experience immediate penalties in the future if something out of your control happens.","replies":[{"poster":"INCEN5","date":"2016-05-17T22:04:06.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/LkUffFnp-permabanned-randomly-after-ranked-match-with-no-email-details","replies":[]}]}]}
