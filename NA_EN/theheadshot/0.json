We all play it for a reason, so what's yours? Climbing the ladder, watching worlds or just getting excited about a new skin for your main, this game gives us a lot to appreciate. \n\nMy favourite thing about League is the law, I got into this game just as jhin was released and even though I suck with him, his law, character design and part in \"awaken\" got me amped to find a match and start 4th shotting enemies left and right. \n\nWhatever it is that makes you \"find match\" day after day, please, share it. And some good vibes to the community.","replies":[]}
