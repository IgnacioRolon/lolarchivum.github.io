Her Q just got nerfed and is on a longer cooldown, poke won't really be a thing. At least not enough to do anything. She has no way of stopping the enemy from engaging, if you are laning with Sona you should expect to stay near your turret until you are both 6 because before that you will be extremely vulnerable. \n\nBefore the nerfs she did damage and was able to heal enough. She could get off good enough poke to keep the enemy from engaging on their own. \n\nNow she'll be extremely weak in lane and she won't be able to do much. Everything got nerfed. It doesn't matter who her lane partner is, she will have no way to prevent the enemy from engaging now because she can't really poke them enough anymore. \n\n\nI'm not making this up...I've played Sona for a long time, I know how she works and how her laning goes.

I do agree that her lack of cc before 6 is an issue...but...I don't see how nerfing everything she has for a late game buff fixes that. Sona imo is probably one of the strongest supports damage wise with her Q and augmented Q autos. She can do a good chunk of damage quickly, which I guess is in place of her cc....now they are really nerfing that and the cooldown so she can't effectively poke anymore. She has no cc, no poke, her heals are weaker, to be honest I expect more mages to be taken bot if people want to play damaging supports, seeing as Sona won't be one of them anymore. \n\nI feel like if they actually just reworked her abilities in general it would be so much better than this mess of an update. Like, everything just got hard nerfed and did nothing to fix anything.\n\nI guess she has a bit of CC in her augmented E if you think about it, because of the slow, but still. I feel like she was better off before these changes, even if she wasn't the best. \n\nI feel like now she will become obsolete because there are other supports who will heal and poke better than her and overall have better laning phases.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuzuki Yukarin","date":"2016-06-17T02:20:42.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Charyzard,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z65LoArv,comment-id=0008000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-17T01:10:45.659+0000)\n>\n> Sona imo is probably one of the strongest supports damage wise with her Q and augmented Q autos.

She has no cc, no poke, her heals are weaker, to be honest I expect more mages to be taken bot if people want to play damaging supports, seeing as Sona won&#x27;t be one of them anymore. \n\nYour opinion is exactly as you say, just an opinion.  One which the math does not support.  Firstly, Sona has the weakest basic attacks of all supports: she is tied with Soraka for lowest AD, with the exceptions of Lulu and Thresh who both have on-hit passives to compensate.  Secondly and most importantly, Sona only has a single damage spell, 1 of very few supports that does AND it has the unmatched LOWEST base damage of THE ENTIRE SUPPORT CLASS.  It is literally the ONLY spell amongst all supports with only 40 base damage.  Thirdly are the auto augments: Hymn's secondary active is an unremarkable 20 damage, while Staccato is even lower at 18 damage for a grand total of 78 damage for her FULL COMBO.  Numerous supports have 80-damage on a singular spell base that are either easier/safer/both than Sona's full combo, a few of which include: Annie, Morgana, Lulu(both spells,) Karma, Zilean and more, all of whom also have higher AD to boot(save Lulu.)\n\nRemember that her top-played items are artificial numbers(Lich Bane, Luden's Echo) and this is half of the reason why: Sona factually has the lowest damage output of the whole support class.  The second half is Sona's lack of utility: poor mobility, poor CC, poor mitigation; she literally has to buy a kit in items because she herself doesn't have a kit, she may as well be a caster minion.  Worse, the upcoming nerfs just further emphasize this problem both in the SEVERE nerfs to her damage and the brand new demand for mana items IN ADDITION to artificial numbers, it'll take even farther into lategame and even larger gold investments for Sona to hit her relevancy point, which is both unremarkably unimpressive when it happens and literally forces your own team into a 4v5 until you reach that point.\n\n> I feel like if they actually just reworked her abilities in general it would be so much better than this mess of an update. Like, everything just got hard nerfed and did nothing to fix anything.\n> \n> I guess she has a bit of CC in her augmented E if you think about it, because of the slow, but still. I feel like she was better off before these changes, even if she wasn&#x27;t the best. \n\nYes Sona has Tempo as a form of pre-6 CC, but it's not hard CC, which literally every other support has.  Even worse, it's not a basic spell, but requires both: 1) building up 3 charges to activate her passive and 2) casting Celerity as your most recent spell, which usually means requiring it to be off cooldown.  Meanwhile, even off-supports like Kayle and Nunu have access to slows on a basic spell making them better support picks over Sona as well.  Sona is not only outclassed by all meta supports, but also most off-meta supports too.\n\n> I feel like now she will become obsolete because there are other supports who will heal and poke better than her and overall have better laning phases.\n\nIn truth, Sona has been obsolete long before Fearless gutted her.  Matter-of-fact it was the support class gutting all the way back in patch 3.14 that removed Sona from the meta when Rito pushed her behind Nami.  Comparatively, Nami has an improved version of all 3 of Sona's basic abilities combined just on her W-Ebb & Flow alone, has an improved version of Sona's Tempo on her E-Tidecaller's Blessing and yet still manages to have a 3rd ability in addition to all this, which also happens to be hard CC to boot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deneviel","date":"2016-06-16T17:00:44.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile bliz deal more damage than any adc till level 13 with a full tank build","replies":[{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-06-16T18:57:48.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deneviel,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z65LoArv,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-06-16T17:00:44.098+0000)\n>\n> Meanwhile bliz deal more damage than any adc till level 13 with a full tank build\n\nI believe they are nerfing Blitz's ult cooldown though and giving it a higher cooldown at first for a lower cooldown at rank 3 so at least at the beginning of the game he won't be able to pull knockup and ult you as much\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Deneviel","date":"2016-06-16T19:05:32.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Y but hitting his CD won't solve the problem .... they should've hit his skill base dmg","replies":[{"poster":"Çhåryzård","date":"2016-06-16T19:07:31.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deneviel,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=z65LoArv,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-16T19:05:32.832+0000)\n>\n> Y but hitting his CD won&#x27;t solve the problem .... they should&#x27;ve hit his skill base dmg\n\nThat's true...but it's a start I guess","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gaheite","date":"2016-06-16T17:45:30.925+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best thing they can do for supports right now is make it so you won't have the highest mmr on your team.
