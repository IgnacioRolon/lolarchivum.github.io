We litterally open mid if the enemy gets a triple and 1st blood (tower) even if the score is 1-3 lul in mid diamond and i dont even wanna know how it is in masters/chal anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-02-08T21:14:21.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this is why ranked is a joke this season.
