This topic has been posted over, and over, and over\n2. URF is a polarizing game mode. There may be many vocal supporters of URF, but it is not universally liked.\n\nPersonally, I liked URF (pre-all-random) but I do agree with some of the dissenting opinions. URF is pretty stale after about a day. Once it gets played, everyone finds out which is the most OP, and those 6 get perma banned. The next 8 get picked and are in nearly every game. Lastly, there are two pocket picks, that are just a player's personal preference. In essenc, 14 champs are seen (picked or banned) in nearly every game, causing the same variety problems we see in the pros. It gets boring to play, just as much as it gets boring watch (when the teams play safe and have 2-4 kill games until the very end).\n\nAt least, with ARURF, you get enforced variety. Do some people get shafted by the RNG? Of course! Just because  a small number of people don't see their favorite champions (and become very vocal about that fact) does not mean that it is bad.\n\nI would like to see more variety in the queue options for these game types. I know it won't likely happen until the new client is out of beta, but I would love to see All-Random Ascension, One-For-All Poro King, Mirror Mode OFA Hexakill, and Nemesis Draft URF (and any other combination of queues & game modes). I hope they do come along, though. There would be significant variety available, and they could rotate the queue AND the game mode, giving us a hell of a lot more to play (and, for some, a hell of a lot more to complain about).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-02-22T05:39:00.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Better yet make it permanent game mode. \n\nApparently, you did not learned anything from Dominion's removal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-22T00:37:10.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No matter how unbalanced it seems I don't mind losing urf because you can sometimes solo carry it","replies":[{"poster":"I make dem flash","date":"2017-02-22T00:38:31.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can solo carry in ranked, bronze V. kek","replies":[{"poster":"JÃºstic","date":"2017-02-22T01:38:01.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol thats the funniest thing ive heard today, great joke fam","replies":[]}]}]}]}
