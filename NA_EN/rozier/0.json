I'm using a router + ethernet combo.\n\n\nDid you do anything to try and fix it Alumini? hell yeah.\n- re-installed league\n- checked for memory issues - ALL GOOD\n- checked for driver errors - ALL GOOD\n- followed riots' possible solutions - DIDN'T WORK\n- tried the option where you can scan file in league for issues - DIDNT WORK\n- reinstalled league again - NO BINGO\n\nWhat's your observation during this freeze Alumini? \n Well, my screen freezes when everyone spawns and then I have to force restart. \n- My computer makes an odd humming noise.\n\nHumming noise? Then something is wrong internally. Get your computer checked out.\n- Yea but this isn't some permanent thing, this only occurs when I spawn in league. So something is causing it to do this... right? I can play other game fine.\n\n\nHaven't played league since last Saturday, itching to play :(\n\ngod bless and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-18T15:56:29.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for everything you've tried so far!  The detailed information helps a lot and gives me a few ideas.  You mentioned that your OS was updated, and I'm assuming it may have been the Windows 10 anniversary update.  Some players were freezing due to an issue with the[ Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).  Can you try disabling it, and let me know if that gets you fixed up?
