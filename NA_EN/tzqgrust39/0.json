And those you can classify as villains usually have incredibly broad goals that aren&#039;t realistic for them to accomplish. Jihn seems to have one goals, kill someone that he deems &quot;worthy&quot;, and he seems extremely competent at achieving that goal time and time again if we go his VO. It&#039;s pretty eerie to think that a man like that is in Runeterra right now planning to kill one of your favorite champions. He serves as a nice wildcard.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-17T01:07:04.367+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's bad, but not a myth. We knew we wanted to do a new villian and from a place under-represented for badguys.  With the intention of showing a different side of that society, while giving our characters an antagonist.   Internally alotta people like his lore.  I hope guys like it when it is released (soon).","replies":[{"poster":"TzQGRUST39","date":"2016-01-17T01:41:37.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what makes it better is that he gives off that Amon (Legend of Korra)/Slade (Teen Titans) vibe.

To be fair, there could be multiple demons like the one that possessed Tahm Kench, but Tahm Kench isn't multiple demons. I was hoping they would have Tahm Kench be the one who saved GP. This would have a cool doomed character dynamic, knowing that GP would never be the King of Bilgewater ever again (at least for long).\n","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-01-16T15:33:36.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is more on a case-to-case-basis of how long his actions need to show their effect.\nIn the case of the gambler it took years,because the gambler basically had to start from nothing to escape from his debts,so Tahm had to wait until the gambler had something that he did not want to loose again.\nIn other cases Tahm might be able to collect his debt a few days/weeks later.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2016-01-20T02:07:08.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's another champion who could easily fit in with lore containing the Institute of War.","replies":[]}]}
