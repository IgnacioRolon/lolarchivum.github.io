FWIW I believe what Meddler was talking about in his post of not knowing the cause is a validation of player frustrations (aka, players **suspect** the snowball is coming from runes, but can we confirm that?). Thats why insightful feedback is super useful because it gives us a lead that we can hunt down and hopefully directs us to the root problem. Sometimes it is exactly what players say is the cause, and other times it is something completely different, but we have to do that discovery otherwise we risk doing more harm than good. However, completely agree it can be hard sometimes because the language potentially feels ignorant of community sentiment. \n\nAlso, from a communication POV it can just be hard to talk on a public forum. There are times (and I speak from personal experience) where we share those \"totally hear you and you're right to feel that way\" posts, and we get smacked down with a flood of hate speech and negative comments. If you can imagine, it makes it tough to come back and do it all over again. That being said I personally want to try, hence why I'm here :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-06-11T06:01:12.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct.\n that was just  a joke on my part","replies":[{"poster":"Bazerka","date":"2018-06-11T06:03:06.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Satire & irony are hard to detect via text x).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SetInMotion","date":"2018-06-11T06:49:08.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried that now, its good now.
