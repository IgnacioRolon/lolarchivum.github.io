I waited after reading that sometimes it can take some time to appear, but it still has not shown up. After the game ended the window saying that I received it appeared, but at the same time the windows for completing some missions appeared. I'm not sure if that had something to do with it or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-15T22:31:28.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've been working hard to level up, and that kind of uncertainty would be distressing to me!  \n\nI looked at each of your levels including level 35 which occurred on 2017-12-09.   You received a capsule for this level which included a shard for Leblanc, Amumu, and 90 BE.  \n\nLevel 36 rewarded a capsule containing Ziliean and Galio.  \n\n37 contained Teemo, Evelynn, Singed, and 270 BE.  \n\nYour most recent contained Sion, Jax, Singed, and 270 BE.  Grats on leveling up today.  :D\n\nEverything looks okay!","replies":[{"poster":"Ronin2112","date":"2017-12-15T22:44:56.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh cool!
