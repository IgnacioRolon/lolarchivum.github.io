Balancing around it has gone well enough.\r\nAnd smite has great strategic value so giving up your summoner was worth it. Especially for dualers and red smite.\r\nA support Oriented Summoner spell (low cooldown clairvoyance maybe?) attached to items that don&#039;t add offensive power would work I think.\r\n\r\nPerhaps add a method of trading roles in the lobby for autofill, and actually lock smite and this summoner to where you are locked in on.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2017-03-06T15:17:12.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has a difficult Summoner competitor in Exhaust.\n\nIt's such a powerful dueling tool to help save your ADC that anything that would make it more enticing will likely have other lanes guarantee to use it, or it'll be too niche and no one will actually want it.\n\nLove the idea, and I wish they could have something.  However, I think that the reason they have not came out with anything before now is because of how difficult of a design space it is.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2017-03-06T23:50:30.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well put; my thoughts exactly (though likely better phrased).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nalisai","date":"2017-03-06T16:08:25.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Itemization isn't really a problem as a support. The problem is more that you're expected to build certain items, and if you don't you're either trolling or don't know how to build.\n\nA support specific item like the jungle knives might make the role more appealing to some, but there are easier fixes.\n\nFirst off, dis-assign lane roles. The idea that you need a ranged champ and support bot Lane is not nearly as important as team comp. If the last several weeks haven't pointed that out hard to everyone with AP carries and support mages, I don't know what will.\nA marksman mid has worked just fine in the past, and if you were to put Zed or Kat  or Talon bot with a support (especially an aggressive one like Syndra or Annie), how fast would a team win? It just requires your team being on the same page.\n\nSecondly, it takes a certain mentality to really play support. An attitude of 'the team comes first' versus 'i suck I haven't gotten any kills and I've died 5 times'.  Supports job is not to get kills, it's to set up your partner/team for kills.\n\nThirdly, get everyone else educated about the support role. The entire last paragraph applies in reverse to teammates of supports. Know that their role is to set you up or save your backside, not to nuke the other team. Yes, there are some champs who can occasionally scale that way, but they're few and far between, and largely depend on the skill levels of everyone in the game.\n\nFourth, grading system needs an overhaul. It's next to impossible for a support to get an S these days, mostly because when you play the role properly, it's not worth an S unless you never die. I've had games in support go 3/6/36 and gotten an A, when I'd call that a damned good support score. This is the major reason why supports won't die for their team and it needs to be fixed.\n\nThere's more but I'm out of time to type.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2017-03-07T00:02:51.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incorrect.

The trick is that you have to understand what actually applies to the rating. It's not all just about KDA. Also, if you get 6 deaths the odds are that you probably aren't getting an S. You'll have spent too much time off the field during death timers to have accomplished all you'll need to do. Only die when there's no way to not die, be all up in your enemies busines, ward the hell out of everything, be at every tower kill you can realistically get to, and learn how to last hit with supports so you can farm when you're alone.

If I die for my team, I sacrifice my S, but my job, specifically, is to do everything I can so that my TEAM gets fed and doesn't feed. If that means dying to save my ADC/APC, then I should, but because of the grading system that's in place, it also means I have to sacrifice my 'score' to help my team.","replies":[{"poster":"cuddlykitten4","date":"2017-03-07T19:31:05.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not necessarily true. I still make sacrificial plays when I deem them necessary. Sometimes you can get the whole team out without dying though if you get creative. Also, if you make sure to not die for no reason early then you can afford to sac yourself out a few times later without losing your S in the deal. I've learned to abuse those plants that send you flying. They make a huge difference in how many people on your team can survive if you can get your enemies to step on the right spots. There are other tricks you can use too. That's just the one I'm currently working on myself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"venomous frost","date":"2017-03-06T15:38:47.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sometimes I wish riot would just quit their delusional idea of \"not enforcing meta\" and make class specific items.","replies":[{"poster":"coeurloyal","date":"2017-03-06T23:52:32.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, as time goes on it feels more and more like this is the only solution.
