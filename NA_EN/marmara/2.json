I'm talking about Janna.\n\nShe's very strong at protecting your carries against assassins, but she gets a huge nerf before all those other toxic assassins get their rightfully deserved nerfs. You know how much of a big difference 180 width and 150 width is? Pretty big. If you don't land your tornado on spot, you're dead, and Janna is already a very difficult champion to play. If your anti-assassin champion gets the nerf bat, guess what? The assassins become even stronger.\n\nAnd on top of that, Sona gets a nerf as well, even though the consensus is that she's a weak support who is outclassed almost completely by Nami.\n\nPoor Sona and Janna.

At least she can't hit the adc with one skillshot and end the laning phase.
