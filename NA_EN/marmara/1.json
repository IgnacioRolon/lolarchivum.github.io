I'm new to the boards but with the practical removal of one of my favorite champs, I felt I needed to speak out.\n\nAshe is no longer the poke sniping frost archer she once was. Though there is nothing specifically stated that she is/was a sniper, her kit(long range scouting, focus for one shot, long range shot ult) as well as being an archer(archers are accurate single target marksmen) always painted her that way to me. She has since been transformed into a frost machine gun. And while her new kit works fine, it ruined what was a thematically sound champ, and I will miss the cool, calm, and collected ice sniper of original champion pool.\n\nAfter reading through some of the boards, I noticed a common complaint about Ashe's passive being ineffective which i do not agree with at all. Ashe's passive gave her several advantages. Of of which being the advantage of guaranteed critical strikes at level 1! No other champs have built in crit available at level one except Draven and Trynd (If more, sorry) my point is there are few). Even at later levels the passive regenerates so quickly that you can easily use it multiple times in the team poke dances and really help follow the engage or make the enemy think twice about coming in. (nothin' makes em think twice like a sudden, guaranteed static shiv + infinity edge crit pop to the face).\n\nAshe's passive rewarded you for successfully executing a certain adc skill; freezing the lane. The issue with this is that most other adc's are practically full autoing minion waves forcing you to either farm under tower (a useful skill to develop for both adc and support btw) or keep up with the enemy adc's autofest. If the Ashe player attempts to keep up, suddenly the passive is available less and less and whaddya-know, less and less effective.\n\nIf the Ashe player is forced under turret and cannot effectively farm (on their own or with support help), then her hawkshot passive kept the gold gap from becoming too wide and allowed the possibility of catching up if you found some free farm. In addition to that, the gold income gave the experienced Ashe player the means to gain item power spikes slightly ahead of her more mobile enemies which would allow her to become a competing or even dominating force in lane. I also felt the gold income passive worked very well with her kit thematically in that one surviving out in the glaciers would have to squeeze the most use out of any found resource.\n\nShe no longer puts, \"All the world on one arrow.\" either. I always felt that was referring to mare than her ult. Being able to collect one's self and focus to perform under pressure is a hallmark of a great sniper. Trees (and hence, arrows) are Porobably rare in the Freljord which is all the more reason Ashe would need to focus to make each arrow count. Now Ashe must fire at least 2 to critically strike her targets, hardly the mark of a sniper.\n\nNow we can start to see how much Ashe has changed thematically, begging the question; If you're going to change the champion so dramatically, why not just make a new one? The frost flurry and cone of cold could easily have been put on a new ap auto attacker a'la Kayle.\n\nThe nature of her passives, in addition to her lack of a hard escape mechanic (no dash) required her to be played with patience and discipline in order to be effective. She was difficult and different and now forever gone.\n\nI would have to guess that the original designer of Ashe no longer works with riot or didn't realize how perfect they made her on the first time around.\n\nJust a few thoughts\n\nTL/DR:\nAshe went from long range thematically unique poke sniper adc to short range machine gun mish-mash and I don't approve \n\n(P.S. Rito plz leave the original champs alone, just put the new abilities on new champs or make small tweaks to current abilities at the most(like veiger's skill shot change))","replies":[]},{"poster":"RSE ChippTheFox","date":"2015-05-15T00:37:54.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For people posting dumb champions that have AoE stuns/Slows/Movment speed buffs... please stop\n\nThe only two people without real escapes are Kog and Urgot.
