(I&#039;ve been playing Akali for a long time now and I feel that her burst damage is insane, which needs to be changed, but what makes her unique is that her ult can stick on to people really easily.  Just an opinion from an Akali main\n\n2)  What is going to be changed on Katarina?  (For this one, I&#039;m hoping a near full blown rework since her kit is just extremely, I don&#039;t know how to describe it.)\n\n3)Are you going to tamper with Diana if at all?  (Right now to me she seems like she&#039;s in quite a good spot right now and is pretty balanced, because in order to go in, you need to land your q, or be punished with doing basically no damage.  Maybe change her ult and how it works with her q but I think that&#039;s all she needs.)\n\n4)  How are you going to touch Zed if at all?  (While I don&#039;t play much Zed, I think he&#039;s in a good spot right now, with a decent amount of counterplay, without being an underpowered snoozefest)\n\n@Meddler and the community please respond\n\nThanks:)","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-02-17T02:06:49.379+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Our current focus is immobile mages for the middle of the year.

Akali is the unhealthy version of Diana balance wise and needs to be reworked to be different to Diana, while Diana can maintain her current state of balance. \n\nI don't understand why you call Diana OP, she's a melee assassin.

I'll try to remember that.\n\nPretty obvious from your comments that you don't understand how balance works. When Akali is ahead in items and levels she has no counterplay; spam R and E until somebody dies, use W to escape, rinse and repeat. Meanwhile if Diana is ahead you still have the opportunity to dodge her Q and if she jumps you with just R she has no means of escape and can be collapsed on.\n\n\"press R twice instead of three times\" does not make two champions identical and Diana's laning phase is not good. She can't escape ganks like Akali can with her W and she is gated by her mana costs while Akali can free farm from range with Q. And meanwhile tank Akali...\n\nAt least back up your points instead of trying to sound edgy and dismissive.","replies":[{"poster":"k1ngpie","date":"2016-08-10T10:55:56.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just accept diana is op","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DevlinCrow","date":"2016-02-17T08:51:15.764+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zed: \"with a decent amount of counterplay\" \n\nxD\n\nThe amount of times, as Nautilus, I've used everything (ult+summoners included) to lock him down and he still gets away.\n\nFuck Zed.","replies":[{"poster":"TimeSaint","date":"2016-08-30T09:27:14.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":l used ghost flash and mobies was by the dragon pit zed jus shadows far asf in the river flashes ults and then i got this weird grey screen glitch","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"La Bello","date":"2016-02-17T00:15:40.948+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"I consider Diana more of a fighter.\n\nKatarina is absolutely awful.

If he could only go back if his target got killed, it would be cool (of course, he would need some buffs to compensate on his R, like a faster proc).\n\nRight now, Zed is just anti-fun in most matches in midlane, with near to no weakness (can easely farm undertower, can easely waveclear minions, lots of safety when ganked and when assassinating, plenty of poke and harass in lane)\n\nHe's not broken, he just needs some tuning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerokx","date":"2016-02-17T14:19:20.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina shouldn't be drastically changed. Let me explain:\n\nAs a Kat main, I particularly enjoy playing her. She's fast-paced, funny, and reliant on godlike reflexes if you want to be good with her. The problem with Kat is that her kit works very differently based on who are you playing against. \n\nIf you play against a newbie team, it's EXTREMELY EASY to carry with katarina. Smash all buttons, get da' pentakills! But if you play against good people, then it becomes EXTREMELY HARD. \n\nThis happens because Kat has two huge advantage points, and two huge disadvantage points. The multi-objective, high-damage R, along with the resets, are her best things, but her extreme weakness at early game and the fact that more than aproximatedly 2/3 of the champs of the game can stop her ult, are her biggest killers.\n\nIMHO, kat needs more a buffing rework than a nerfing one. She has many abilities that shouldn't change after all, as they are her W and E. I'd change the Q to be a skillshot though, and to have a higher pop damage. Also, I'd slightly rework her R in a way you can focus somebody (you must have the mouse on them to make them more dmg), or being able to shunpo while in R to dodge skillshots.\n\nSo, I think you should have an eye in making the R more skillful, but also, more rewarding. Her Q could change a lot IMHO, in a way she can use it for better early farming and deal damage by going all-in, more than just throwing the Q away to poke like we Kats currently do.\n\nI think another interesting thing to change, is to buff her W passive thingy, the MS speedup that you receive when using it on an enemy champion. But all the important is already said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-02-26T18:13:45.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Diana doesn't need to be reworked.

That is why she has been at 46-47 percent win rate for the last year, has disappeared from LCS play and has (for her) a low play rate. Anybody with a 75 gold pink ward can nullify her shroud and the range nerfs on her R as well as making e no longer proc her q have made her clunky. For every game that akali has 30 kills and can instaburst every champ, there are 2 or 3 games where she is getting beat down in lane and can't combo fast enough in her current state to pick up kills and get back into it.
