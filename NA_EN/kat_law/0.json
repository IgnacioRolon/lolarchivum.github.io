I haven't acquired any chests with the champs I'm playing and at least one of my teammates has gotten S-, S or S+ after winning a match. Still not dropping chests. Can some1 explain to me maybe Riot changed something for acquiring chests that I'm not aware of.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-06T20:15:10.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your teammate will need to be in your premade party before joining the game.  Meaning a random teammate getting an S would not award a chest.  More info is also available in our [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide as well, sorry for the confusion!","replies":[{"poster":"Kat Law","date":"2017-10-06T20:20:51.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok thanks I had no idea it had to be a premade teammate.","replies":[]}]}]}
