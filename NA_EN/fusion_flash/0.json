I had the graphics set to the highest quality and was getting around 50-60 FPS. However, right when I started my fourth game, I suddenly couldn't get any higher than 15 FPS, and teamfights dropped my FPS to 1 FPS and below (it was essentially a very fancy PowerPoint presentation). It wasn't until I set my graphics to the absolute lowest quality in the next game that I was able to get around 60 FPS again. I also now notice that the entire client runs a lot slower for me, even after restarting my computer multiple times and running a disk cleanup. I can ensure you all that I didn't (knowingly) install anything, change any settings, or relaunch the client between the fast and slow games.\r\n\r\nHaving the client open now slows my computer drastically. For example, if I try to browse Google Chrome while the client is open, webpages load super slowly or stall completely. Upon closing the client, my browser's performance returns to normal. I don't think I'm experiencing any memory issues; I have 16 GB of ram, and task manager was telling me that my CPU usage when I alt-tabbed out of the slow game (though maybe alt-tabbing decreased CPU usage temporarily). Having to turn graphics down is something I can put up with, but I would rather not have my entire computer run like a toaster every time I open League.\r\n\r\nHas anyone had a similar experience? Or does anyone know a potential fix to this problem? Any suggestions would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-24T23:57:04.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, this is the first time I've heard these symptoms all mixed together. There could potentially be a ton of reasons as to why you're experiencing these symptoms. The first steps I'd like you to try are as follows:\n\n**1.** First, I'd recommend rebooting your modem/router, in case there's something going wrong from your local network end. You can reboot by temporarily unplugging power from your modem/router and plugging it back in after about 60 seconds.\n\n**2.** If step 1 didn't resolve this, you may also have one or more background applications exacerbating or directly causing your issues. To address this, I recommend [**performing a clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to prevent your background apps from loading at startup.\n\nPlease let me know if these steps caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
