Players aren&#039;t afraid of it because they never get dealt with and they just continue their toxic behavior unrestricted. This is the reason I personally have slowed down and am about ready to stop playing league all together. I&#039;ve played this game for +5 years and have given you guys almost $2000 in support for the awesome game but this toxic community have had such a bad impact that I can&#039;t do this anymore. Even through the muting and the reporting, I feel like I have no power and that you guys don&#039;t care anymore. so I hope that in the future you guys can help curve the community back to what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nsincerely shadowfighter28","replies":[{"poster":"SmokedAlmonds","date":"2016-06-21T20:54:41.348+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look around this section of the boards, people get punished all the time.\n\nThey are most likely just saying that to get you not to report them.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr  Caine","date":"2016-06-21T20:57:55.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that on here but never see it in my games or feel the impact in my community of players.

There are 9 other people in a game with you, and it only takes a single person having an off game to ruin your experience. That game, which is completely out of character for them, will likely not punish them. We understand that people have off games and a competitive experience can cause emotions to run high so we aren't going to ban a player for a a single off game (except in extreme cases). \n\nWe do however, rapidly  (within minutes) punish people who make a habit of unsportsmanlike behavior. As you can see by browsing this section of the boards, people are punished all the time and the system is very accurate. The majority of players who receive a single punishment realize their behavior is not acceptable by the community and never receive another.","replies":[{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-06-22T06:46:30.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the system gives no feedback though.

So right now the system is tuned so you will not be spammed with notifications -- you only get a notification if your report was the final report that caused the punishment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-06-22T14:01:00.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TO BE HONEST, if I didn't frequent the forums I wouldn't think Riot actually had systems in place to monitor and deal with toxicity. Riot is **_barely_** transparent when it comes to dealing with toxic players, boosters and bots. At best they write the odd \"we're testing a new behavior moderation system\" or reply to the occasional \"OMG RIOT WHY WAS I BANNED?!?\". So I can easily understand it when people cry to Riot about how they 'don't do anything about toxicity' and that 'people do what they want because they know they can't get banned'. I've have absolute scumbags on Ally and Enemy teams alike that have genuinely thought that Riot doesn't ban players.\n\nOn the other hand, I've played games where the company has things like 'The Wall of Shame' with a nice long list of banned/suspended players, the date of the ban/suspension, the duration of the suspension, and a description of the offence for which they were punished. Independent community-run groups even had access to the database so that you could look up suspicious players and flag them to be kicked from the game if they had dodgy stats or a record of hacking/toxicity.\n\nAs a forumer, I know that you do in fact punish deserving players. But the system fails, to at least somewhat of a degree, simply because there's very little transparency and therefore very little faith in the systems that are in place and therefore people don't bother utilizing said systems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-06-22T03:19:03.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda feel like if someone decides to afk (declares in chat that they're not going to play anymore) or intentionally feed they should be punished immediately, whether they've done it before or not.

I quit ranked because of 12 games in a row with someone intentionally feeding / afk or both. Some of them even played normally for 13 min then decided to walk into the enemy and stand there 4 times before they afk. The system sees it as a bad game because they got some cs in the laning phase, warded, and played normally for a while. Somewhere along the line something in them snapped and they decided to feed and then afk. We ff@20 and they aren't flagged by the feeder detection because they didn't feed long enough, it just looks like they got picked off a couple times, they dont get flagged by leaver buster because they only left for the last two min or so, and they walk away unpunished because they dont do it every game. This behavior was remarkably common in my ranked experience. Maybe they were having a bad day or whatever but when you encounter streaks like that it doesn't matter if its a habitual problem these players are having or not. The fact that they can do it 1 in 30 games (or whatever) means that the rate at which games are being ruined are much higher than you think. Your system may not flag those players or games because everyone has bad games so it cant detect the problem, but the problem is there. \n\nHabitual trolls get punished, but occasional trolls do not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr  Caine","date":"2016-06-21T21:39:51.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot I love your game. its been 5 years of play time and i'm still learning to master the game.

This is only true to an extent. They care about their brand and reputation as to how it relates to their potential consumers as well as the consumers and their intent to remain a customer. That is as far as Riot goes. \n\nYou will see posts by people high up the chain like Marc Merrill and \"how he cares so much\". Mark does not give a shit past the reputation of his company and that the player base is still here. \n\nEverything Riot does just like every other large for profit company, is 100% focused around revenue. The report system was engineered to punish people who are so bad that their negativity would of eventually caused more people to leave and thus it is a net gain to ban them. Riot does not send anymore customers away than it has too. All the PR talk about \"how they want to reform people\" has nothing to do with the company having high moral values and has everything to do with not sending customers (profits) away.","replies":[]}]}
