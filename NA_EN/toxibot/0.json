I was on my last strike and I got tilted by a troll. I procceded to call him trash...I regret it so much. Now I play on my second account. I control my tilt now. I usually just meme in the chat or not say anything at all. I even climbed up to S3. Wow who knew I would be a better player if I controlled my tilt...oh wait Rito did. Im completly changed now. Ima higher rank and honor level 2 step 2. Im thinking about asking rito one last time to reconsider and to maybe lift the ban when the new season starts. Ofc after I give them a true apology that comes from the heart. Ill even somehow prove to them that I have changed. Heck Ill do 40 hours of community service and somehow prove it to them. I think itll be nice to start again in season 9 to start a new slate. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-12-15T00:55:19.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot never unbans permanently banned players","replies":[{"poster":"ToxiBot","date":"2018-12-15T00:57:51.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arcade Lulu,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ph9FHepA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-15T00:55:19.556+0000)\n>\n> Riot never unbans permanently banned players\n\nLet us get on our hands and knees child and pray to Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-12-15T01:01:39.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToxiBot,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ph9FHepA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-15T00:57:51.770+0000)\n>\n> Let us get on our hands and knees child and pray to Rito.\n\nNot gonna happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2018-12-15T01:11:41.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToxiBot,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ph9FHepA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-12-15T00:57:51.770+0000)\n>\n> Let us get on our hands and knees child and pray to Rito.\n\nNot gonna happen tho\n\nAnd please don't send a ticket to riot support or anything.
