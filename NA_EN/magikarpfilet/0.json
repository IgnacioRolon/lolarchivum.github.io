This way you could try out new champs not in the rotation without Riot losing out on money and you being able to use champions you don't have. \n\nSo:\n-Pay 50-300 ip depending on champion value\n-Rented for  3 games max (for normal games only)\n-Must be rented in main menu so that they can still be banned in draft games\n-Expire after 48 hours if unused to prevent hording/system abuse\n-Maximum of 3 rented champions at any time\n-Rented champions do not count towards your minimum required champions for draft mode games\n-Brand new champions would not be rent-able (max rent-able value of champ should be 6300 ip-to prevent new champs for being used as freebies and keep bringing in maximum value for them)\n-OR, new champions could be rented once when they come out for 1 game only and then not rent-able until they are down to the 6300 ip value\n\nAlso, please up vote this if you like the idea so that Riot and other members can see it. I'm not sure how often Riot read new suggestions so yeah haha","replies":[{"poster":"Kat  Head","date":"2015-02-04T19:59:00.037+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not for ranked.
