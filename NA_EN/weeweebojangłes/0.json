I have no problem with everyone having a say on whether or not the game should go on, but not if the only person that wants to keep playing is the person that&#039;s feeding, being completely useless, and ruining the game. \r\nTypically you&#039;d think, that if they thought there was a chance at winning that they&#039;d start playing better. This is **never** the case, they make the same mistakes repeatedly and continue to increase the gold gap throughout the game. Basically wasting the entire teams time in an unfun match.\r\nI don&#039;t literally mean **the worst player**, because the entire team can be doing nearly as bad. I mean the player with less than a 15-20% kill/objective participation.\r\nThese players should not be allowed to vote at all. It should be the teams decision to continue, based on if they think they can carry that person or not.\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be an option to report for unskilled/not skilled enough, It&#039;s a really good way of placing players that belong in lower brackets where they belong. {{champion:17}}","replies":[]}
