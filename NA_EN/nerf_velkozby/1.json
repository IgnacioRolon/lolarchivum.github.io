Not to say I never have bad days. I do have bad days, I flame, I get frustrated, but I know to not keep playing when I've already got a few bad games under my belt. I just go and dick around on ARAM, or play Smite, or Stardew Valley, or plan for my next DnD meet, relaxing stuff.

So since it's one game it's obviously pretty severe. The only exception is ZT language, slurs, hate speech, sexism, racism, homo and trans phobia, ableism, etc. That only takes one instance in one game, but that's for a two week, if you used it enough it's a full jump to perma, but that's pretty rare from my understanding.\n\nPlus by your own admission it was a chat restrict. You can still play, you weren't banned. Your language is intentionally misleading.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bondage Bunnyboy","date":"2018-12-16T08:17:20.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need hugs.

I haven't been toxic in months and actually try my hardest to win games whether they are ranked or normals ( in fact I've been most honored 3 games in a row now ) plus your lucky it was just a restriction - do you know what it's like to load into a game like an unranked player when you worked so hard to reach D3 bruh I was so tilted I just played varus jungle to get myself in Bronze and plan on climbing back up next season in 9{{sticker:sg-poppy}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2018-12-16T14:42:35.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because when you see that IFS popup, you get soo happy.
