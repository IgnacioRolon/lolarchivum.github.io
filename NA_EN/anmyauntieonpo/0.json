Toxic behavior is rarely reported on a winning team, yet loads of unnecessary reports get downright contrived out of thin air from losing teams. Reporting is overbearing in this game, it doesn&#039;t demolish toxic behavior, it feeds it. Its really an endless cycle of high tension and frustration that boils over time and time again because of the domineering presence it has. Please show me the math on the .006%, because I&#039;d love to bet any amount that is basically an alternative fact situation.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueThingamajig","date":"2017-12-10T22:20:17.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem isn't reporting.

They know that they can't get rid of all negativity. But they can tamper it down to a tolerable level. Reports are the tool to do that. Can they do better? Yes. Personally, I think they should force a video making it abundantly clear how the system works and how to react to toxicity (i.e. mute, report, move on).
