You can then launch into the replay with the new button that replaced the download button and record any snippet with the *record* button at the bottom of the navigation bar in-game during the replay. Once you finish recording the replay, a message will pop up with the exact location of where it's saved.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
