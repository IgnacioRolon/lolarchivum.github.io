We need to be able to impact bad player LP.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"We have the honor initiative.  Great.  But we have nothing in place to impact players who flame the team for the 20-40 minutes you have to play with them.\n\nWe need a Negativity Initiative that allows team mates to impact a players LP from the match.  Give the 4 team mates the ability to control 1/4 of their team mates LP from the match if they vote them as being negative. if you have a flamer you give 4/4 votes against them, they win but get nothing. Period.\n\nSo my feedback form this thread is to mute have no communication with team and hope you win and possibly support bad behavior by leading them to a win.  It's essentially what we have in society turning a blind eye to crime or our equivalent, negativity.  Its sad to me that we are continually learning to ignore problems and assuming someone else will solve them down the road.","replies":[{"poster":"Laughing Fish","date":"2018-05-06T20:23:03.521+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GreedKnight","date":"2018-05-06T20:28:47.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I have to believe there are more fair minded idividuals in league than that.  but it would stop people from verbally retaliating or leaving because of the.

Riot is pretty opposed to giving players the ability to use in-game functionality to blame or punish teammates without oversight. This is why reports are no longer weighted, for example. Additionally, players would simply end up using this to punish people for having a bad game or not playing the way they wanted, possibly even as an in-game threat. While in an ideal world where players only used it against flamers or intentional feeders it *might* work, the fact of the matter is it gives players a tool to simply bully, threaten, or doubly punish the worst player on their team, or anyone they happen to dislike.","replies":[{"poster":"GreedKnight","date":"2018-05-06T20:29:52.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"All i know is i was punished within minutes for being attacked verbally by 2 team mates and not taking it.  and then all i was left to get feed back from was a bot.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-05-06T20:31:17.021+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"My suspicion then is that your account was already close to a punishment, and your retaliation took a form that was more toxic than you intended.","replies":[{"poster":"GreedKnight","date":"2018-05-06T20:35:43.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You may be right but i have a zero tolerance policy for assholes in my life.  and I dot believe my actions were not worth punishment but they were equal to the abuse and negativity that was put on me.

I know that's a bit blunt, but if your desire to punish assholes extends to causing issues for innocent players, you're not really on any higher a moral ground.\n\n>but they were equal to the abuse and negativity that was put on me. \n\nThen they are likely abusive and negative themselves, and that is, quite simply, not okay as per *League's* behavioral rules. Again, you may not *personally* agree, but *League* will not make an exemption to the rules of respectful behavior just because someone else violated them first.","replies":[{"poster":"GreedKnight","date":"2018-05-06T20:44:29.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im in full admission that my actions were not OK but the fact the lense was not even turned the other way before i was suspended for 14 games is the problem.\n\n\"So my feedback form this thread is to mute have no communication with team and hope you win and possibly support bad behavior by leading them to a win.
