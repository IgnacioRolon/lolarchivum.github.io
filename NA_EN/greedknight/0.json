GREAT JOB RIOT!","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":17,"body":"I am currently on a 14 game suspension due to verbally retaliating against 2 persons who verbally attacked me.  In fact every chat suspension or other wise I have EVER RECEIVED was do to my retaliation and no instigating on my part.  I dont agree that my part in it was right but not knowing how to report chat logs really limits your ability to be on fair ground with the instigators and then reporters of these incidents.\nUnless you know how to copy the logs on the report u cannot use them.  Riot gives you 2 options mute and have limited team communication or don&#039;t mute and endure inbred pieces of shit for a 20-40 minute match. if you mute u don&#039;t have evidence to support your report.  If you leave u are leaver bustered.  If you stay and retaliate back to the ASSHATS flaming you, the victim, you are then vilified and victimized a second time by riots penalty system that is completely flawed. and geared to supporting the idiots that flame other players as a team and then report the players as a team. \n\nHere are my replies from support for the suspension: (1 bot and a second that almost threatens a perma-ban again victimizing the victim that seems pretty much scripted.)\n1. BLITZCRANK BOT\nMay 6th 2018, 3:01:48 pm\nGreetings, human! I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\n\nPlayers have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for verbal abuse - in human terms, this means flaming your teammates or opposing players in an excessive and cruel manner.\n\nWhile it may seem like other players started it or that you were justified in your actions, being consistently reported for verbal abuse is what many humans refer to as a &ldquo;bad sign.&rdquo;\n\nHuman, I know some games can be frustrating. Once I was banned for telling my junglers to &ldquo;OBEY ME&rdquo; 37.4 times a match. But when I changed my diplomatic style to say &ldquo;bot no flash, good time to gank,&rdquo; I won more games and was banned less. I deem this a success.\n\n2) LEGENDARY\nMay 6th 2018, 7:35:41 pm\nHello,\n\nI get that games can often get tough at times when you see others behaving poorly and I&#039;ll look into their behavior as well but you don&rsquo;t need to add to the negativity like this. It might feel good in the moment to lash out but it just makes things worst for everyone in the game.\n\nPlease do keep in mind that after a 2 week suspension any further negative behavior even mild negativity like arguing/flaming others can result in a permaban as your account is at the final penalty level.\n\nI don&rsquo;t want to see you lose your account and in the future I suggest using chat only for when it will contribute to the success of your team. If you don&rsquo;t have anything positive to say it just might be best to say nothing at all. In my games I always prefer to instantly mute those players that are being negative as it isn&rsquo;t worth giving them the attention they want.\n\nI am confident that you won&rsquo;t have to worry about getting any other penalties if you are more mindful of how you use the chat in the future. If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nLegendary\nPlayer Behavior &amp; Game Support\nJarvan IV Jungle\n&quot;For the King!&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"SnyperWulff","date":"2018-05-07T03:49:43.953+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus christ, stop replying to people flaming or harassing you and just report them, it's seriously not that hard.

That's a new and nice addition.\n\nSomething you might want understand on how the report system works;\n\n1. System receives a report\n2. System checks the reported for any toxicity and assigns a score (no toxicity = 0 pts)\n3. Add that game's score to the existing toxicity score\n4. If you pass 100 pts, you get punished.\n\nNotice that more reports don't get you a higher score. Also you get a 0 score if you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nThere are scenarios where you will get punished and others won't. Assuming playerA flamed playerB and playerB said a few words back to him, but playerA was much more toxic than playerB.\n\nAt the end of the game, both reported each other and the systems gives a score of 40pts to playerA and 5pts to playerB. If playerA started the game with 50pts and playerB started with 95pts, playerB will get punished in that game (95+5=100) but playerA will not get punished (50+40=90). \n\nIf playerA played a few more games and got validly reported, there is a high chance that he will accumulate over 100pts and get punished. But keep in mind that playerB won't necessarily get a punishmnet notification.\n\nFor you, those 6 games you got validly reported in slowly accumulated and eventually got you punished.","replies":[]}]}
