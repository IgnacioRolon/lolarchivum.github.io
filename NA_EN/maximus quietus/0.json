At the top of that page, below the picture, it says, \"Ranked 5v5 teams are available during scheduled windows per region. Servers with Ranked 3v3 enabled will also be available during that time. Click here to view the schedule.\"  When I click on the link to view the schedule it brings up the login page.  After logging in it says, \"OOPS You're not authorized to access this page\"  Is this a glitch/bug?  If not, why do I need authorization to access the schedule for when the option to create ranked 5v5 teams is available, and how do I get this authorization?","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-12-18T22:59:19.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The page has been deleted because it's outdated, it just hasn't been removed from the list of results yet.\n\nRanked Teams are no more.
