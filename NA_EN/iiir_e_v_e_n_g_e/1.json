The W is too similar to old Heimerdinger W, The E makes no sense, and the R is very similar to blitz ulti.  Overall the concept isn't that bad, but it has  alot of flaws as it only can be run in a duo lane, so people are gonna have issues similar to what occurred when Riot first reworked Morde","replies":[{"poster":"IIIR e v e n g e","date":"2016-05-02T16:25:39.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats the point of this..\n> **\n> THIS IS THE FIRST ADAM AND EVE CHAMPION TO ever be created, PLEASE UPVOTE\n> \n> simple, rewarding, tactical, and most important\n> \n> A SUPPORT CHAMPION LIKE WE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n> **\n>","replies":[{"poster":"jmaishere","date":"2016-05-03T05:32:08.577+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IIIR e v e n g e,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=O2K1UMQF,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-05-02T16:25:39.425+0000)\n>\n> thats the point of this..\n\nit's one thing to be unique, it's another to pigeonhole a champion","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"H e L L ii s H","date":"2016-05-02T14:58:35.561+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Post how well they work with Syn-energy champions\n-How does this meet Riot's criteria in objectives and positioning in the game?","replies":[{"poster":"IIIR e v e n g e","date":"2016-05-02T20:12:21.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey ok","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Full Metal Griip","date":"2016-05-02T14:39:59.034+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I say get rid of the 15% current health thing in ultimate, then you got a deal","replies":[]},{"poster":"iiiiR A G E","date":"2016-05-02T14:49:51.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"this champion sucks, GG","replies":[]},{"poster":"H e L L ii s H","date":"2016-06-26T15:20:03.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rebirth","replies":[]},{"poster":"HISSSSSSSS","date":"2016-05-06T08:47:06.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Stop thinking your own creation is special and better than that of others, it's not, it's just one champion concept of many.\n2. Passive: Is this a sort of active or does it randomly activate? If it's random then i'd go ahead and say that it's wayyy too clunky. You don't want to ward completely random bushes, especially considering that some may already be warded. We can't see the cooldown either.\n3. Q: So basically just another way to snowball harder? What is this ability supposed to do when you're not ahead? Kill yourself?\n4. W: In what way does this synergize with this otherwise supporty kit though?\n5. E: This is stupid. You shouldn't add toxic and unfun gameplay elements just because you consider for it to be unique. You really need to reconsider the concept of this ability entirely.\n6. R: So the shield value stays the same throughout the game? What kind of use would this thing have lategame?\n7. R: Reduces their mana and health regen by 200%? So you mean they lose health based on their health regen? AND the lose mana? First of all, the health regen thing should really be replaced with a DoT instead, because all this does is tell your opponents \"don't build this\". Second, affecting your opponents' mana is extraordinarily toxic to play against, this can by no means be in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IIIR e v e n g e","date":"2016-05-03T06:08:31.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"huh went from 10 likes to 2, godbless the NA community...","replies":[{"poster":"HISSSSSSSS","date":"2016-05-06T08:33:37.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have got 10 likes in the first place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2016-05-02T16:45:51.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you ever rank up your E?
