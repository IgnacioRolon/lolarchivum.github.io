Item sets are a huge and important part of the game for virtually anyone who actually bothers giving a crap about any match. They not only save massive amounts of time when going back to buy, but they allow for significantly greater efficiency and just a lot better gameplay. Without item sets, you're stuck just fumbling through the store's entire available inventory.\n\nIf item sets are being removed as an option, you've handily removed a huge amount of customizability and playability from your game. Not cool. And certainly not an incentive to keep playing with that kind of disregard given to players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gman1647","date":"2016-11-18T12:47:52.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=eUAbu7Qo,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-17T21:11:20.131+0000)\n>\n> Item Sets aren&#x27;t built into the new client.

I was searching everywhere for this. Hoping this makes it into the final release! It's especially helpful for newer players who don't know all of the items very well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RamminRigsby","date":"2016-11-25T11:03:39.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You (or at least I) can edit item sets in the legacy client, but don't see any changes in-game if I launch the game via the new Beta client. Is that intentional? Are we therefore forced to use the legacy client for everything if we want to use item sets?\n\nThis is ultra confusing as well since the items sets *have* been changed, but appear in-game (when launched via the Beta client) as they were before changing them.","replies":[{"poster":"RamminRigsby","date":"2016-11-25T11:14:46.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird. It works now I went into a custom game from the legacy client, exited and then went into one on the new client.\n\nI suspect that you have to actually play a game with the revised item sets (via the legacy client) to get them to 'register' for games in the Beta client (which seems very strange since they're stored server-side but there you go... That would seem a definite bug.). Any insight Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"RamminRigsby","date":"2016-11-25T11:41:53.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even worse actually. You have to actually play a champion that uses the edited item set in the legacy client before those item set changes are registered in games on the Beta client. I tested it: edited item sets for two champs, played one in custom game on legacy client. Opened up beta client, played custom game with second champ: no item set changes registered. :-(","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Le Chat Musqu√©e","date":"2016-11-17T20:09:45.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same pb, what did they do to item sets ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoLimitGoku","date":"2016-11-17T15:06:49.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This","replies":[]}]}
