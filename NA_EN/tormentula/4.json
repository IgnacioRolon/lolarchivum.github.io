It&#039;s odd how he has been touched and buffed in numerous patches, but still is overlooked by the bug testers.\n\nFirst off, awhile back a patch was made that reduced the model size of some champions, I don&#039;t know what the reasoning was, but Kha&#039;zix was one of them. Since then, Kha&#039;zix has a Model Bug with his passive, This is especially noticable with his Mecha Kha&#039;zix skin, when his passive is up, his claws will glow with an outline... however since his model was reduced in size, it seems his passive didn&#039;t adjust to his model, and you can see the outline out of place on his claws. \n\nSteps to reproduce glitch: Pick Kha&#039;zix, Go Mecha Kha&#039;zix (most noticable), Apply your passive/basically look at him, zoom in on claws and there it is. 100% replicatable. \n\n(THIS IS NOT MY IMAGE, INFACT SOMEBODY IN THE FORUMS HERE POSTED THIS BEFORE)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/e8CBnLJ.png\n(Notice the \"outline\" on his claws? That's the passive out of place on him. \n\nThe other issue is one more recent, his audio is bugged. Kha&#039;zix used to say different lines depending on his evolution, ex. If you evolved your R, he&#039;ll say lines like &quot;In the Shadows&quot;, if you evolve your E, he&#039;ll say, &quot;I&#039;ll soar over them&quot;.. but now he&#039;s saying these lines all the time.. even if you haven&#039;t evolved anything, they became regular audio lines for any of his actions. \n\nSteps to reproduce glitch: Play kha&#039;zix... really that&#039;s it the lines are just there, you may not notice them at first but if you play him a whole match you may hear a line he should not have said. \n\nThat being said, my question is when will this be fixed because as I mentioned, these have been problems for AWHILE, I think he got atleast 5 different buffs in seperate patches and has been overlooked with these issues in all of them.. and next patch he&#039;s getting a skin. Is this skin going to have the same issue? I imagine the passive model glitch won&#039;t be as bad, but what about the audio? It&#039;d be nice if riot would soon fix kha&#039;zix&#039;s problems right now... it seems he&#039;s getting love with buffs and a skin but he&#039;s being ignored with his glitchy issues. \n\nThank you for reading, and I&#039;d appreciate if riot would take a look and try to fix him before his new skin arrives.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-02T18:43:15.278+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey EliteMantis17! \n\n> The other issue is one more recent, his audio is bugged.

All evolved lines were actually broken and not playing - so we just put all evolved lines in his default attack and move. So, the way you're hearing the VO is actually working as intended. \n\n> First off, awhile back a patch was made that reduced the model size of some champions, I don't know what the reasoning was, but Kha'zix was one of them.

We're aware of this, and are working on a fix. \n\n> That being said, my question is when will this be fixed because as I mentioned, these have been problems for AWHILE, I think he got atleast 5 different buffs in seperate patches and has been overlooked with these issues in all of them.. and next patch he's getting a skin. Is this skin going to have the same issue?\n\nThe claws on Mecha Kha'Zix are on the radar to be fixed. In comparison to other bugs, this isn't considered major, as it's not affecting gameplay. That said, it's also part of a skin players purchased, which is why it's on the list to be resolved. \n\nI'm actually working on the new Kha'Zix skin. Lemme poke the VFX artist to see if we have the bandwidth to get this fixed for next patch. :D\n\nBecause Death Blossom Kha'Zix was created **after** the resizing, this issue should not occur on the new skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2016-03-02T19:14:05.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome thank you!\n\n> I'm actually working on the new Kha'Zix skin.
