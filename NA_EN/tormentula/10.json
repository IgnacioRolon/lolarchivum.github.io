I guess that means it benefits Support Morgana a lot and Mid Morgana less, which might be the intention. Also, Morellonomicon applies Grievous Wounds on her other abilities and for a longer time, so buying it isn't any less effective on Mid Morgana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-03-07T23:49:56.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think there will be more GW abilities incoming with the addition of the new resolve keystone","replies":[]}]}
