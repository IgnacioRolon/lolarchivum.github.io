I've never done this in months.\n\nI check the message, it told me I sent:\n\n> This is a follow-up to your previous request #[ticket number] \"There is something wrong wi...\"\n> \n> Hello!\n> \n> Just take a look at that amazing and wonderful stuff, you're going to love it for sure! More info here [malicious URL] \n> \n> All best, [My real first and last name]\n\nFirst of all, riot games does not know my own personal information, they would not know my full name (I wouldn't think so anyway) and I would never send an email like this. To player support, I never had the need to except when I was giving a personal opinion about something, and when I wanted to bug report something major with my main that was ignored on the boards. I did not click the link, cause that's obviously something malicious even by how the URL looks.\n\nI don't see any harm done, but something in your system is really unsecure. I don't want banned because through my email somebody sent a message I never sent providing a malicious link.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T03:23:50.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That email was not sent by us at Player Support, nor from anyone from Riot.
