He's been denied skin love since launch, for reasons real and imagined, and his fans deserved Riot's best efforts in terms of both concept AND execution.\n\nI was hoping for something truly epic and jaw-dropping, something that said \"We're sorry for the wait, here's something awesome.\"  Instead, it's a below average concept  (stolen from a fan on Reddit or these boards) with really good execution.  Still, it's like polishing a dirt clod, sorry to say.\n\nIf Arclight Yorick had been his fourth skin, delivered sometime in 2019, it would have been fine and I might have purchased it.  I don't plan on purchasing this skin, however, because of the above reasoning.\n\nWhat I'm most afraid of, however, is the future.  Now that Yorick has his first skin since launch, how long are we going to wait for his next one?  Are we going to have another 6 year wait, with lots of hemming and hawing from the skins team and players incorrectly saying that making a Yorick skin isn't worth Riot's time and energy?  Are we going to have Rioters claim that making money isn't the most important thing, yet the only skins the company seems interested in producing are for \"popular\" champs like Ahri, Nidalee and Janna?  Is it going to become business as usual until the memes pop back up?\n\nI hope that clarifies my feelings and I hope you share this with the rest of the team.   While nothing I have ever said to the Skins team matters at all to them, I would like to know that my feedback is being heard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2017-09-11T19:23:32.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good job, now i just cross finger for the music when the maiden is alive to be change to something with divine vibes and the skin will be a perfect new fantasy for Yorick (see angel instead of dead poeple)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Zimberfly","date":"2017-09-12T17:40:46.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Flemman,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=EvBrtefx,comment-id=00020007,timestamp=2017-09-11T19:23:32.470+0000)\n>\n> good job, now i just cross finger for the music when the maiden is alive to be change to something with divine vibes and the skin will be a perfect new fantasy for Yorick (see angel instead of dead poeple)\n\nHi there.
