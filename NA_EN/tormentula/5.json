They just give the impression that they dont care one bit bout their game.\nIts ok tho, as soon as I get my I7 CPU i'll fuck off to heroes of the storm. Where things are fresh, lots of content , and is more balanced than this one shot bullshit, champ favoritism, 1 main map game.  While also it sucks because im used to LoL but the game is worse than the most radioactive toxic waste right now\nIf this is riot's way to destroy their game, so be it. Its their game after all , but its pretty incredible how they want to fuck it up even more.\nYou're just another guy that defends  , which I assume u dont know crap about this game's history, where it was actually fun.  I play since beta and trust me, Riot was more focused on the actual game and the 99,9999% of the players, not in their LC$ cancerou$ play$ and dumb memes&games that arent even funny, at all.\nI understand that spamming {{champion:202}} {{champion:202}}  or 444444, upvote to 4, downvote to 4 , is WAY MORE IMPORTANT  than seeing the incredible, atrocious game balance\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbRiYV5SBAI   Yeah, riot said they removed the laser towers because u coudlnt last hit under turret. That was the dumbest thing said ever, a gaming company has said in all the history of the games. And this is just one big flaw of the game alongside thousands , despite thousands of threads about \" make the turrets better\" , instead, riot replies just a thread below this one , which is obviously memes&games, containing a shit joke made from a 12 year old.  Its so disheartening with all my honesty .\nAnyways\nPeace\nPs.
