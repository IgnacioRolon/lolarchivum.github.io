Now I played around with some settings atempting to fix (basically just optimized via GeForce Experience) and I'm at 135 usually consistently. \n\nI'm not quite sure why in the first place I got such a huge dip in FPS, is it LoL that dipped or is it my computer?\n\nSpecs: \nIntel(R) Core i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz 3.19 GHz\n16.0 GB (RAM)\n64-bit Operating System\nWindows 10\n1920 x 1080, 60Hz Monitor\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 950\n\nAny ideas for why or how to fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T21:48:17.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question which might solve all of this without too many troubles, are you using NVidia's G-Sync at the same time as League's V-Sync option in-game? If so, turn off g-sync and only use v-sync and test that out for me. If that doesn't help we can dig a little further!","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-10-05T03:34:02.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I opened up my NVidia Control Panel and there doesn't seem to be a g-sync at all. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9anCBnC.jpg\n\nHowever, one thing I noticed was for some reason the FPS was set to be capped at 144, uncapped it, and now it's hovering in the 160-180 range (with the game starting at 200-220 by the time minions spawn). This probably explains why it dropped to 135 and its likely the setting that got changed when I tried optimizing it via GeForce Experience. So, hey that's a step forward!\n\nI looked and V-sync was disabled, however when I enabled it, my FPS immediately locked at 60 and didn't move.\n\nEDIT: Also just because I found out: Monitor is NOC (Model: M2060SW) 1920 x 1080 16:9 Aspect, in case that info was needed.
