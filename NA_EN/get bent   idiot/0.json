I couldn't log back in, as the client would just be stuck on \"authenticating\" indefinitely. I tried restarting my router, my comp, and nothing would work. I know this isnt on my end because everything else was working normally. So I asked a friend to try logging on my account to finish my game, and surprise surprise, he couldnt log in either. \r\n\r\nI'd like to know why it is that a billion dollar company would rather spend their time and efforts in making new useless flairs like emotes (that cost almost $4 a piece btw) than to ensure that at least their servers are stable for the users that are playing from their respective regions. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I'm not really expecting anything to come out of this because I honestly don't think riot gives half a rats fuck about the playerbase. \r\n\r\nIt's disgusting to watch a company that used to be so genuine turn into such a massive pile of garbage because of their success. Get your shit together.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T22:14:53.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't been having any NA server issues in the recent days, and it kinda sounds like your network is having connection/ISP routing issues if you can't get past those authenticating login steps. It's pretty widely known that your connection can sometimes have troubles reaching certain gaming servers while still being able to reach servers like discord or youtube, simply due to how Internet routing works. \n\nYour ISP sends your connection along a route to these servers, and if it takes a weird route to our servers or hits a damaged node along the way it can cause issues with connecting to us (but you could still reach places like Google just fine). When you understand how this routing works, you can find ways of fixing it or making it take an entirely different route. \n\nFirst, make sure you update your **Port Forwarding and DNS Settings**, if you aren't sure how check out the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for those steps. If that doesn't help you get logged in, let's take it a step further and see if using a VPN helps.","replies":[]}]}
