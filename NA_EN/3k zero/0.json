Shes basically a pretween girl with alot of flashy lights. She&#039;s a Targonian? This is what Aurilion Sol was afraid of? Pfftf.\r\n2) her kit is alright, but given the difficulty of trying to play pong mid-combat, there&#039;s no real benefit to bouncing her shot, it literally does no extra damage. Alot of extra trouble for basically nothing\r\n3) her ability to use copies of summoner spells i feel is a little OP \r\n4)ANOTHER &quot;human-looking&quot; champion in the game. Yay cuz we all wanna be humans playing humans in a game right? \r\n5) it feels oddly repulsive and somewhat discomforting that a young girl charachter that obviously looks like an underaged girl enters this combat on the rift and fights to the death\r\n6)she feels like a project that spent 1 day in the art department and about 20 minutes in development before release. Lack of depth in everything, kit, lore, gameplay\r\n\r\njust some complaints i wanted to vent that nobody has to listen to\r\n\r\ngg","replies":[{"poster":"JackMcSnipeyz","date":"2017-12-11T13:45:33.283+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am i missing something?

I do not blame Riot for Zoe's weird situation though, because I'm so glad to see that they finally started thinking outside of their comfort zone (and by that I mean tanks  and supports). Finally there is something different in the mid lane (not just Syndra pressing Qs for an eternity then pressing R or Yasuo and Zed abusing you because they are Riot's favorite champions), and this difference is in the kit of a burst mage and not a tank or a support. Riot tends to fill their new champions with unique kits when there is no big risk that the champion will be useless. For example, giving Ornn the passive that lets him buy items anywhere and (almost) anytime on the map is not risky because if the passive gets useless, it is not a big deal at all since he is \"just a tank\". Rakan's passive is similar to this. No time to come up with a unique passive for a support? No problem, give him a periodic shield. No idea what Taliyah's passive should be? Give him a small amount of movement speed here and there. But Riot took a risky step towards more complex champions and this step was Zoe herself. The idea of her kit is perfect, it makes her feel unique and cool and fun. There are some balance problems with her being a little bit too weak though, and like many other burst mages, she is struggling against tanks. \nAnd there is her desing... I really do not like Zoe's preteen girly design, what's more, I simply hate it. I do not care if she is a demi-god or not, she looks like, talks like and acts like a child from elementary school. I want to play  the mightiest mages like Lissandra, the banished ice witch, legendary creatures like Tahm Kench, the demon king of the rivers, and dark, scary beings like Thresh, the collector of souls. Aaaaand there is Zoe, the little girl who jumps and hops around the lane, throwing bubbles with butterflies at her enemies and using random active items and summoner spells now and then. Ugh. Simply ugh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cerbari","date":"2017-12-11T13:40:10.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i dont really get all the hate zoe gets.\nI mean i also dont find her that appealing of a Champion but that happens every once in a while.\nEventhough i have to agree that they could have done more with her lore wise, like targon is such an interesting faction and especially her Special interactions ingame were more than disappointing. \n\nI believe if riot had put more emphasis on her relation to aurelion sol she would have been a much better Champion. Waaarghbobo said that Aurelion Sol does not hate her (which is quite the feat considering her to be from targon) and i would have liked to see more of this love-hate relationship.\nI Picture it somewhat like Thor and Loki (Marvel) \n\nto get to your Points:\n\n1) well aurelion is not really afraid of the targonians, they tricked him into servitude and he wants to destroy them now once he gets free. Also she is just a host for the real aspect of twilight.\n\n2) well ok dont really know what to say to this\n\n3) i don think the copying is op, rather the free active items you receive during laning phase (which was already nerfed)\n\n4) personally i like playing champs that are appealing to me. so i like playing a dog headed demigod, but also a brutal pirate. i really wouldnt say a Champion is lame just because he is human. Also consider this if no Champions would be human, the animal/ Monster Champions would become less Special\n\n5) well honestly i would have this Problem rather with Annie. like we have a lot of Young Champions like ekko, lux taliyah and a lot more. since they dont really die ingame and the game not being Canon makes it ok for me.\n\n6) like i said especially lore i think was more a lack of communication rather than being plane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2017-12-12T15:47:28.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion Sol isn't afraid of Targonians.

Only that the Twilight parasite lets her do stuff with her power. The power is ridiculous and destructive. The most terrifying thing Riot has ever written. The scale of change that could be done with this power is staggering. Almost outside of human comprehension. \n\nHell there’s a reason why most fictions have portals used very limited: must be shot out of a gun onto a specific surface. Must have both sides of the portal built meaning you have to travel to those locations physically before establishing these pathways.

When that is blatantly not true if you think of creative ways on how to use portals.  \n\nThe fun thing is. She in theory can create stars with only the power set of gravity manipultion and portals. All you need is to form a dense enough matter of hydrogen which can be created through gravity manipulation on any large enough planet and then opening a portal to the center of a very hot nearby star. And done. Star. \n\nThe thing is Sol’s power sounds amazingly impressive. Because it is. But he does 1 thing.

The sequence thus far presented do not show her getting tired at any time.  The artwork released with Zoe, specifically to give a reference to what type of power we're talking about here has her playing jump-rope with star powers and ensnaring Sol in a bunch of magic energy.  \n\nYou can find them here: http://www.lol-wallpapers.com/champions/zoe-official-artwork/\n\nThat's the official work for her.  That's her power.  I don't know how she does it, so I try to avoid talking about it directly.  My assumption is gravity wells strung out to create a pathway for light to follow.  But, that's only because I know she can affect gravity in some way and I'm trying not to give her new powers out of the blue.\n\nBut even if she can only create 1 portal (which she can't, in lore we see her create about 3 at the same time with no sign of effort) that alone is enough to make Sol's contributions fairly unnecessary.  Again, Starlight laser beam of doom.  It's awesome and only requires 1 portal.  She can at any time bring out a nuke.\n\nGoing forward if Zoe is expected to not have the solution for everything in her back pocket she does need limitations.  So far the only one explicitly given by Riot is that she's an idiot.  Because she is.  That's pretty much not arguable at this point.  She has no grasp on what the hell she's doing or what's going on and doesn't seem to understand cause and effect at a basic level that is frightening. \n\nBut in terms of arguing about power, we don't get to make up evidence to suggest limitation when the writing and visuals give no such indication.  She may have a limit on how many portals she can have open at any time.  So far we know it's above 3, probably far above 3 because she has 3 open and still has the power to summon a meteor.  But to perform most of the meaningful tricks that make her so powerful only requires one or two.\n\nTake, Twisted Fate and the Bilgewater event.  That explicitly gives the reader his limitations and power, it even becomes a plot point.  It's amazing, easily the best story Riot's written in my opinion.  Because it has rules, and the consequences of those rules allow the plot to flow from them.\n\nThe Aspects and Zoe, in particular, have no explained rules.  They just do things.  So if ever there comes a point where their abilities presented so far could quite easily solve the plot, then them not doing so makes them look like idiots.  The writers may then say that they couldn't because of some limitation or another.  But if that limitation is not expressed beforehand then it's just bad writing.","replies":[{"poster":"cerbari","date":"2017-12-12T15:03:32.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay you mention some good Points.\n\nAnd while you could call it bad writing that her limitations are not explained and i have to agree to some Point.\nOverall limitations are just common sense in my opinion. \nI mean just because a Telepath can make himself fly i wouldnt automatically assume that he can lift a mountain with his Telepathie just because the Story didnt tell me about his limitations yet.\nIn her colour Story, zoe had struggle with her Portals and was only transporting herself. \n\nI think we have different understandings about Portals, for me not only the creation of a Portal takes energy but also to Keep it up and to let stuff go through the Portal. and i can tell you why, otherwise you could simply create a perpetual motion machine and thats just not possible in physics.\nso a simple explaination would be, that you Need energy in order to let energy/matter go through a Portal.\n\nAlso i saw the art work you are refering to. This artwork was just that though art, it was used to tease zoe on Twitter. on one Picture we can see a shopkeeper of summoners rift. And summoners rift and the game in General are not Canon they are not part of the actual lore. These Pictures are also not on the universe page so i dont Count them as Canon and neither should you.\n\nAnd while maybe someone said zoe was on Sols Level.

She clearly is also teleporting whatever clothes and items she's wearing, and since the first line is that she maintains momentum as she travels from one area to another clearly energy itself transfers through the portals.  So far death laser is still a go.\n\nThere is no talk about energy or even urgency with Zoe's creation of portals.  The only thing stopping her is that some outside force, likely Twilight itself, is causing her to remain in the area until her message is complete.  Which apparently happens when she blows up some guards.  \n\nAs to the artwork, Rioters commented that they added details to her art and design to give the players an idea of what kind of power she's working with.  She also comments in her lore that Sol does not like to be petted, but she can force him to be petted without accidentally harming him.  So she does some of that power in the artwork to at least get Sol to stay still, whether it's the magic chain or not.\n\nYou see now we come to the main difference between our understanding of the lore.  You're taking the notes from Sol's lore at face value and trying to match it to what power Zoe has shown.  So, in order to make them fit together, you have decided that she must be a lot weaker than her lore story makes her out to be, because otherwise, Sol's lore doesn't really make sense.  You are disregarding the quotes from Rioters that claim they are on even footing, to fit this notion.\n\nThat's all fair.\n\nMy point is, taking everything that is in Zoe's lore at face value, adding nothing, taking nothing away.  Then Sol's lore and Zoe's lore do not make sense together.  Zoe's power is ridiculous in scope and scale.  Her existence does make all those points you listed not make sense. I agree.  But the power as described by Rioters and as written in her story is what has created that rift.
