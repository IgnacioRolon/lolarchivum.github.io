Soon to be six years ago I was ecstatic when I learned a game I'd been watching for sometime left Closed Beta and I could finally jump in. My first match I played Master Yi, I had no clue what I was doing, I fed the enemy team. Then I picked up a lovely little evil Yordle who has been my first \"Main\" since those dark days. Who I've played and loved this entire time. I've been around since Twisted Fate's Ultimate was once a global map reveal and slow and his gate was his E. I've seen mechanics added I've seen them removed. I've seen many wonderful items (rest in peace dfgesus) removed  for the sake of \"Game Balance\" or no one is using them except when the situation arises or in the rare case they use them only on certain champions. I saw the AP ratio removed on Veigar's ult and saw it changed into percent of maximum mana with a mana restoration if it dealt a killing blow which while Akali and Katarina existed it perplexed me and pigeon holed me into playing him mostly against champions like Ryze if I wanted success.\n\nI've adapted to every single change in the meta and with the current \"Highly Mobile\" Meta that Yasuo, Nidalee, Katarina, Akali, Zed, Kalista and others like them have heralded in I can say one thing with extreme confidence. 1.25 seconds to deploy my only defensive maneuver against several champions who can deplete my health pool nigh instantaneously has basically told me \"You are not to play or enjoy this champion ever again.\" I won't lie to you I picked Veigar into Katarina, I picked him into Fizz, I even picked him into Zed and I have won all of these match ups with prudent usage and application of my E and adapting my build order to the situation. I will not lie and say that I never warded the bushes next to mid lane's river bushes so I knew to position myself so as to successfully survive a gank and maybe get a kill as a sweet treat. This was simply what I learned when it came to playing my champion.\n\nHis Q is a change that sure, it allows me to last hit two minions or last hit a minion and harass but honestly if I wanted to play Ziggs or Orianna I'd play Ziggs or Orianna. Veigar when played well has very little counter play which honestly should be a reward not only for your skill but for playing a champion whose entire usefulness to a team hinges on his pre-level six laning phase which will be non-existent now that you've taken away his only defensive ability.\n\nHis passive in Season 5 is useless. I go out of mana even with mana pots and crystalline flask in laning phase. Swaine's passive pre-clarity changes was better than what I am shackled with as Veigar. You said you \"Lowered his Q's cooldown\" in early materials regarding his changes which was insulting to my intelligence since at max rank it's only four seconds previously where as now it's five.\n\nI do not know whom all was in charge of this change, but I would hope with the death of an identity and the destruction of an entire champion's play style over the course of three patches, destroying a beloved champion for the few proud who actually mained him and played him well...\nI hope your resignation is on your boss' desk by the end of this season. \n\nIf I had the option I would refund Final Boss Veigar, Bad Santa Veigar, Curling Veigar, White Mage Veigar, Baron Von Veigar, Leprechaun Veigar, Superb Villain Veigar and Veigar the Gray simply because the fact I will **never** play this champion again means I wasted all of the Riot Points  I spent on the skins.\n\nSincerely,\n Season 4 Gold Veigar Main, Pre-Season 1 Veigar Main and an **extremely unhappy** League of Legends Player, ASC Jabberwocky (Formerly Black Eis)\n\nEDIT: http://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend&roleSort=Middle\nChampion win rates post 5.4\nVeigar has the third lowest win rate, only Kassadin and Azir have lower win rates. Zilean mid beats Veigar Mid's win rate now even post 5.4.","replies":[{"poster":"DerJabberwocky","date":"2015-02-27T00:26:37.489+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, it seems unless Riot's QA team makes a thread they don't even bother to read or reply.
