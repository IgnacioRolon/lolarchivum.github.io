Joined right after closed beta ended.\nMy girlfriend who I taught how to play, who I live with, who I have bought many, many skins and champions for to help her excel at this game got falsely banned by your &quot;Flawless&quot; Detection service.\nLet&#039;s be honest, AVG is a darn good anti-virus but for a long time was falsely flagging your program as a virus. As did AVAST and Norton. Those programs STILL have issues with your coding.\nWhat makes you think you can claim a program you created cobbled together by bribing the people who make the same programs you&#039;re hunting is flawless?\nIt took you how long to fix certain game breaking bugs that should have never hit launch?\nYou&#039;re right, the code is different. Your detection software isn&#039;t the same as the code used in the game.\nHowever, it&#039;s likely made to detect a code being injected into the game to change how it runs. A code that changes sound files while they&#039;re read and output could theoretically cause a false flag detection but your two employees who read her request replied with your copy pasted bureaucratically wrote and designed cookie cutter email instead of treating a customer as a person.\nThis is me attempting to form a dialogue and not insult you, hell I love your game, I defend your company a lot but all I&#039;m asking for is a little decency.\nSo, et tu, Riot?\nEdit: For clarification despite the fact no one who is down voting or calling me an a-hole or telling me to have her open a ticket has actually read this or any other post fully.\nShe opened a ticket, they said no. We still have an open ticket despite that.\nEvidence? You want a picture of the email saying she was permanently banned? You want a link to the program that she was using the replace voice overs? Why? You're not going to help me get a rioter here. You're just going to be derisive. If you're not going to be helpful, leave. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Shac Norris","date":"2015-11-16T08:05:14.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They usually dont remove bans, since there's usually no way to prove anything of what you've said, unless they try it themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"DerJabberwocky","date":"2015-11-16T08:06:51.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"They actually do.
