Ain&#039;t Riot&#039;s fault people still wanna play sona and champs with under a 50% win rate.\r\n\r\nHonestly i&#039;m loving this meta i&#039;ve never been able to move up so quick.\r\n\r\nADC has been my weakest role for like 4 years but now i&#039;m dominating cause I pick champs like {{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:67}} and for top {{champion:75}} {{champion:83}} and jungle {{champion:33}} \r\n\r\nJust stop complaining and adapt. The meta has changed throughout the years and will continue to do so. It&#039;s never the same 10 champs in a game because with each new patch other champs make it into the roster. But I bet none of you read the patches. You just jump straight into ranked. I literally spend a good amount of time reading the patch notes and playing some normals to get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep losing lp, keep playing your favorite.\r\n\r\nOr better yet, if you want to play your favorite champ, go into normals. Nobody is holding a gun to your head telling you to pick a shity 47% win rate champ in ranked.\r\n\r\nI went through silver in a week on this account. Time to do the same with gold. My win rate doesn&#039;t lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2018-01-05T21:36:57.542+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, lemme be honest here, saying that people should only play meta is not a good idea, I mean by that logic we need to learn EVERY CHAMP so we can keep up with meta, and who in their right mind would do that?\n\nHonestly, your whining about others whining is counter productive, I mean especially F bombing earlier makes your argument seem weak, the more you cuss out people, the weaker and weaker your argument looks, so might wanna think about soap on the tongue there, anyway, the point is, a meta where only a handful of champs is good is honestly quite boring, I mean not everyone wants to play/see the same 10 champs every game, that would get stale as hell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lukáš Mrákošlap","date":"2018-01-05T21:08:59.642+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just maybe people do not like being  forced to play meta.
