But Jhin is so egotistical he sees everyone around him as objects to be murdered for his art, which in itself is just an extension of his ego. In truth he's just a petty thug, but he fails to see himself as anything but an artistic genius. And if he has anything brought to shatter that view of his own genius he excuses it in a way to make him appear more important than he is. If people don't like getting murdered? They are too dull to understand his genius. People are sent to capture him?

He's a smart petty thug, but he still has no plan or goals beyond continuing his deplorable actions.\n\nThough thug may not be the best term.  But he is undoubtedly a lowlife serial killer too weak to stop being driven by his own base urges.  That he can dress it up pretending to himself that makes it better than it is doesn't really matter.  It's just more excuses in his deranged mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Keepe","date":"2016-09-05T16:05:29.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why so serious?\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/4090915784c3d7bf0fd8edcb2825781a.gif?noredirect","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Trolosaurus","date":"2016-09-05T00:47:05.766+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:119}} no contest.

With how he is now and that his current condition grew less from personal ego, more for a lust of freedom which was acquired through power, and the fact he actually showed a tinge of regret for having to finish the process (because I'm going to assume that at the point it was at, if he didn't continue, he'd die with everyone else), I would say his egotistical phrasing developed from him needing to validate his reason for being the way he is.\n\nDraven doesn't need to validate his \"awesomeness\" to himself.  He just wants others to know how great of a Draven that he thinks he is.\n\nAurelion Sol is at an existential level that the only reason he talks to us the way he does is because we're a bunch of random cats, dogs, raccoons, etc. that can audibly communicate in a language he understands. (I can equate us to insects, honestly. It's the same deal)\n\n\nSo, yeah.
