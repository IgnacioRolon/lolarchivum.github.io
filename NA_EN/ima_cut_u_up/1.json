Obviously riot thinks they know what they&#039;re doing, but they are far from it. Then I get my account 14 day suspended for going afk after literally all 4 of my teammates trash the shit out of me and take the side of the guy who isn&#039;t healing me because he talked shit to me, who is my support. Right... I can&#039;t get over how ridiculous the punishment system is. You guys actually think that suspending somebody for refusing to play with an entire team of shit talking entitled children is the right answer. Get back into the tribunal or something. I assume somebody reviews my case before they suspend me... so I guess they must be a bunch of retards who can&#039;t read text and be reasonable. Sounds about right though from what I&#039;ve seen from Riot. This game has gone downhill so far. It's so offensive I called somebody a retard, but not a big deal that they were talking all sorts of underhanded passive aggressive shit to me before that, and they stopped healing me or something in game... but ohhh I called him a retard or said a few lines of really mean text to him after that so I'm the one who should be punished or banned. Riot thinks they're the fucking internet police  now and they are horrible at it.\n\nRiot thinks it&#039;s cool to ban and suspend accounts based on defense of one&#039;s character too. If somebody talks shit to you and you put them in their place or even say something your other teammates considers wrong and they say so you&#039;ll get suspended... you are in the wrong and they are not because one riot employee thinks so. This is definitely riot&#039;s stance as their &#039;punishments&#039; reflect it. \n\nWay to go riot, you&#039;re pros at regulating speech on the internet... fucking morons, watch your player base dwindle more and more as you pretend to do good. Bring the tribunal back or just give up on this punishment system, you clearly suck ass at it.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-04-17T04:23:54.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy cow, stop with the reply spamming. Gather your thoughts and make one reply, editing it if you need to. It's impossible to form a conversation when you're jumping all over the place.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a situation where you win 8/10 games against Bronze 5 players, but loose to Bronze 2/3 players every time the system tries to pit you against harder foes, resulting in being placed Bronze 4. Short of having to play more placement games there's not really a good way around the bias that a match or two can have on you. Additionally, past season ranks weigh into where you get placed, so if you were Bronze/Silver last season you'll have a higher chance at being Bronze this season.\n\n> You guys actually think that suspending somebody for refusing to play with an entire team of shit talking entitled children is the right answer.\n\nThe right answer is to mute them and play the game the best you can. If you got a 14 day ban it wasn't for going AFK in that single game (I don't even think they give 14 day bans for going AFK, it's 20 minute Low Priority Queue).\n\n> Riot thinks it's cool to ban and suspend accounts based on defense of one's character too. \n\nYou can't defend your character by demonstrating you're worse than people already think you are. Man up and be better than them, don't fall to the same level as them. \n\n> Way to go riot, you're pros at regulating speech on the internet\n\nThey're enforcing common decency on the servers they own, which isn't too high of a standard to maintain. They couldn't care less about what you do on the rest of the internet (hence why no one gets banned for what they do/say on Twitch or Youtube).","replies":[{"poster":"Ima Cut U Up","date":"2017-04-17T05:46:01.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"When did I demonstrate I'm worse than people think I am?
