The problem is you are so far behind that ganking is nearly impossible.  I mean when you are lvl 6 ... and the bot lvl is 7.  and your mid / top are 8 or 9.

Sure, you don't have to get the skuttle, if you know your opponent will be getting it, you can avoid him and gank on the opposite side. The issue is, if there is no gank that can happen especially if you're playing someone like fiddle, you practically just get set behind\n\nI had a few jungle games today just to try it out. I purposely playing Xin and I was constantly ahead of my enemy jungler. His ganks were pitiful because once I was able to obtain 1-2 skuttle over him, i was constantly invading or getting skuttle. I never got a kill on him but he was at one point the same level as the support. \n\n\nI cant imagine playing something like Amumu into Xin/WW/Lee","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BestPudgeNA","date":"2018-05-21T15:14:41.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xJLx MCHammer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1cEP7Nbo,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-20T23:32:45.005+0000)\n>\n> Pretty pathetic when you consider the fact the following\n> 1.

The other jungler who got his lead would once again be 2-3 lvl above everyone else with an increase in exp and the  jungler who got behind still couldn't keep up with the game.\n\nWe don't need a straight up increase, but a neutral change that makes none fall behind that much or even the other way: none should be too far ahead just because he got some rng based jungle camp.","replies":[]}]}
