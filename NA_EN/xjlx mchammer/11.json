Try it, try being a Renekton main. You'll have the life kited out of you by champions like Gnar or Kennen, who not only have a ranged advantage, but also have high mobility and spammable cc. Then you move into teamfights and get kited out by entire teams.\nWhat people don't understand is that things like Irelia and Camille aren't overpowered, they've become the new bar - because if melee champions don't have hypermobility and lockdown in abundance, or extremely high split second burst, then they're frustrating to play and useless against anyone who plays properly.","replies":[{"poster":"FutureCreator","date":"2018-06-15T20:03:27.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You'll have the life kited out of you by champions like Gnar or Kennen, who not only have a ranged advantage, but also have high mobility and spammable cc. \n\nSo a single speed boost is considered high mobility now?

It feels satisfying to land E and since it’s an AOE CC the delay is ok. The delay on his E is what separates a good Vel player from a bad one. I just don’t think it’s very helpful right now given how short the knockup duration lasts. Landing a full combo with E on a highly mobile champion won’t guarantee you enough safety to ult and get a kill, only other immobiles or squishies","replies":[{"poster":"Vanic998","date":"2018-06-17T05:13:22.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That’s what I hate.

Try playing a game using a Vel Koz mid laner. This isn&amp;rsquo;t exclusive to just Vel koz, many immobile champions are in horrible state right now. You can mostly see this with Mages and some ADC champions as well\n> \n> It&amp;rsquo;s neither fun, nor rewarding. No! VelKoz&amp;rsquo;s damage is not much higher due to his immobility. Does he has true damage? Yes, but true damage is also freely given now. \n> \n> Have you guys tried playing Ashe in this meta? It&amp;rsquo;s not fun! Have you tried playing a Karthus ? \n> \n> You can&amp;rsquo;t keep doing this to immobile champions. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a meta thing! They are just weak in general. Why is Leblanc considered harder to play in mid laner than Vel Koz, Zigs..etc.  \n> \n> They are becoming more and more unreliable because you constantly decrease their damage and cools down. Yet you continue to increase or give more mobility to new champions. You&amp;rsquo;re forcing these immobile champions to constantly land abilities to have a chance. \n> \n> \n> Start buffing or reworking some of these champions because they aren&amp;rsquo;t worth playing now in a game where Irelia, LB, Camille, Yi, and Lucian, J4..etc are not only extremely viable but overbearing\n> \n> \n> You can&amp;rsquo;t lane against these champions or be in a game with them. Why does it feel like your thrown at the end of one spectrum of viability when picking some of these immobile champion. Picking a Vel Koz is basically telling players, I need to play like a ^***^ and 2 screens away.\n\nMobile champions used to have counters like Malzahar. They dicked him so much he does fuck all now so his counters are no longer viable.\n\nIf you want to see these hypermobile hyper carries stop being played and winning almost every position then riot need to concentrate on their counters (malzahar, Lissandra etc).\n\nOnce they do this your vel koz can go back to countering malz again xD","replies":[{"poster":"Nubulas","date":"2018-07-04T12:28:06.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The balance to lack of mobility is supposed to be utility or damage.\n\nWhen you take away the damage of an immobile and delicate champ, it becomes worthless.\n\nTake away Yasou's E and his passive and see how much noise they make.","replies":[]}]}]}
