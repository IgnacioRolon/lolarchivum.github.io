What about a return of Deathfire Grasp, but instead of increasing your up front damage instead applies a 3 second debuff that makes them take an additional 20% damage as a bleed for all the magic damage they took FROM JUST THAT CHAMPION over say 10 seconds, on an item that gives 120 AP with 10% CDR just as spitballed numbers.\n\nThis makes it have the same overall impact as the old DFG, but backloads it's damage so that it is actually possible to react to the incoming damage rather than just go \"Welp I got DFG-ulted, I'm now at a grey screen.\"   It gives you and your team the chance to try and shield and heal you up to negate the DoT.  Second, it removes the \"abuse\" case of where one person DFGs an enemy and everyone else gets their magic damage increased on them (Hidden impact increasing it's power).   Finally, it's following the idea of allowing more counterplay to the mage, as it's an expensive item where most of the power/gold effeciency can be tied up in the active, and yet feel good to have in the inventory slot even lategame unlike a lot of other actives even on CD.

The passive means you want to build other AP items first and then get Deathcap to increase its efficiency. But then you find yourself without room for three items losing up on AP and it takes a long time to get the gold for the combined cost. So getting Deathcap is a lose-lose situation.
