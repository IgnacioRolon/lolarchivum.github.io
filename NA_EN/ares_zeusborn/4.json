It is merely the product of destiny and willpower. You see humans can only use a percentage of thier minds. Which means they cant understand how I achieved such greatness. How I ascended to such heights. Being human limits you to think in a limited number of ways. You are incapable of this truth due to your undeveloped minds\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UAh12ObLqY\n\n\nHowever when you see the light, when you experience the power of life, you will understand that only a select few humans can break this barrier between man and god. A lot of humans ponder can it really even be done? Do we actually have that capability?  Winston Churchhill says that, &quot;I_t is not enough that we do our best; sometimes we must do what is required_&quot;. I have simply became a god where man has failed.  Now you get it. Being the best was something that I was required to do. Humans. They are fragile creatures who exist for gratification from others.  meaning they are interdependent of external feelings from other humans to justify their existence.  Solitude is something humans fear the most. When their actions go unnoticed and  all those empty feelings amass in a multitude. Although it begins as an interlude you soon find yourself alone Everyone in the end is alone. Everyone is empty. People no longer have need of others. You can always find a spare for any replacement. Any relationship can be replaced. I had gotten bored of a world like that. \n\nWhich is why as the________I will free you humans from the solitude you can not handle and guide you into the true path. The path that enriches your very purpose of living. And structures your foundation less lives.","replies":[]}
