But it would not execute the minion.\r\n\r\nI was using this: [Mastery Page](http://www.lolpro.com/season-4/1506-mastery-calculator#cGvBQjzTtAv)\r\nI was using these: [Runes](http://mullinator.com/tools/runepage/1oZx91qax91pIx91qDx3)\r\nI bought these: [Items](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1550666027/50691977)\r\n\r\n- I noticed this bug was persistent through out the match.\r\n- I only bought up to Targon's Brace so I am unsure if this happens with Face of the Mountain.\r\n- I only played Thresh so I am unsure if this is apparent in other champions.\r\n\r\nThat is all the information I can provide that I believe is relevant to gameplay mechanics.\r\nAlso can the community please do some more testing with this so that the Developers can expedite a fix for this?
