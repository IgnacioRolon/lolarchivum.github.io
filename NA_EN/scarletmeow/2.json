While I personally love it, Im sure it can quickly become confusing and irritating for team-mates.\n\nHow to produce:\n1.) you and your pals go into a custom or a normal game (doesn&#039;t matter what type from what I&#039;ve tested).\n2.) somebody goes the furry ball of doom with a pistol (super galaxy gnar).\n3.) Everyone go to lane or just send the gnar far enough away where you normally wouldn&#039;t hear the backing sounds.\n4.) Gnar backs, everyone hears the cuteness and is confused, mesmerized or annoyed.\n\nI&#039;ve had this bug happen every game I have played this skin, I&#039;ve asked if it works for the enemy teams but they always say no. Might be something to do with having vision of gnar when he backs (allies always have vision of you, I tend to back where enemies can&#039;t see me).\n\nThanks for your time, if anyone else is experiencing this please post so riot can fix this asap! \n\nEdit: Tested if bug occured on other skins, it doesn't. Can confirm this is super galaxy exclusive.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot LoveStrut","date":"2017-10-19T19:47:09.008+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! Thanks for the awesome bug report, xScarletDragonx! :D \n\nAs cute and adorable as this recall is, you're totally right--this should be fixed. You should expect a fix in for the next patch!
