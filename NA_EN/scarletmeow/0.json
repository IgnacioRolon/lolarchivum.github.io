Where she goes up in the air &gt;.&gt;) finishes. It also seems the laugh creates more waves than it did when first released.\n\n1.) Play Skt Nami\n2.) Laugh (Control+4 or /laugh in chat)\n\nI&#039;ve done this in both Ranked SR, Normal SR, and on practice tool. I will go through all the skins and see if this is happening anywhere else and edit post to update after.\n\n[Video of Bug](https://youtu.be/vbx-Na5ARME)\n[Skins Original Laugh Animation](https://youtu.be/tqvtEfzubrE?t=50s)\n\nEDIT: Blue Particle Ring does not appear on any other skin including base, and neither do the extreme waves.","replies":[{"poster":"egzonhero","date":"2018-04-07T10:13:32.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it looks kinda cool so don't remove it xD {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kilydwn","date":"2018-04-18T06:40:04.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, the animation and indicator looks remarkably similar to old fizz ult. When looked up, actually, they might just be the same.\n\nMaybe the animation from old fizz ult somehow got hooked up to skt Nami? No idea what's going on for that to happen though, but maybe worth a mention.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2018-04-05T22:54:59.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xScarletDragonx,\nThanks for the report!
