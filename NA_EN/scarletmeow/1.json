The frame loss occurs whether Sion is in your frame of view or even if he is not.\r\n\r\nSteps to repeat ze bug~\r\n\r\n1.) Be in a game with Mecha Zero Sion\r\n2.) Activate Sion&#039;s passive form\r\n3.) Kill Sion&#039;s passive, lose your frames and cry\r\n\r\n       From what I know, this bug doesn&#039;t occur for everyone (For example, the bug happens almost 100% of the time for me and my friend, where as another friend of ours noticed it for the first time today) , May have something to do with quality settings. Me and a friend will do more testing on it tomorrow, try to get a video, and post the results here. If anyone reading this has more information before then, feel free to post it in the comments. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-16T17:49:05.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xScarletDragonx - \n\nAs you've mentioned, this may not be happening to everyone (it's not something I've personally noticed on my PC). This may be due to computer specs, and like you've said, the quality settings. \n\nWould you be able to grab me your PC specs, or would you be able to tell me if you're meeting min specs for the game? \n\n* 2 GHz processor.\n* 2 GB RAM (Windows Vista and 7 users will want 2 GB of RAM or more)\n* 8 GB available hard disk space.\n* 3 GHz processor.\n* 4 GB of RAM (Windows Vista and 7 users )\n* 12 GB available hard disk space.","replies":[{"poster":"Scarletmeow","date":"2016-05-16T23:40:26.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My computer is probably not even supposed to be able to run league, here's the specs (I think, it's the right type of laptop either way) http://www.cnet.com/products/toshiba-satellite-c55d-b5319-15-6-e1-2100-4-gb-ram-500-gb-hdd-us/specs/ \n\nI play with everything low and characters on medium, with no Inking","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-20T17:48:40.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing a quick comparison, it looks like you are running on a laptop that doesn't meet min specs in some areas - for example, the min spec for a processor is 2 GHz/3 GHz, and you're running on 1 GHz, which may be affecting your gameplay. Looks like your RAM is fine - you need at least 2 GB, but more is recommended, and you have 4 GB.  Not sure about the space you have left - the laptop is 500 GB, but you'd need to make sure you have a good chunk of free space left. If you have less than mentioned above, that may be slowing you down as well.\n\nI've gone ahead and sent a test request regarding the FPS drops, so hopefully we can dig deeper and see if this is a compat issue, or something occurring across the board. \n\nThanks for your patience! <3 ","replies":[{"poster":"Expando","date":"2016-05-21T12:55:42.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely got this bug too.
