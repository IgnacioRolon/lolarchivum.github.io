Sure, it may occasionally work, but the fact is they aren&#039;t playing the meta and the adc suffers and everyone has a horrible gaming experience.  Even though everyone in the chat urges them to please not go teemo sup. \r\n\r\nInstead of having someone dodge and mess up there elo, there should be a unanimous voting tool that if 4 other players vote you out, you get kicked out and have a que penalty. Another thing i&#039;ve noticed is that if the troll makes one person dodge in the lobby, that the next lobby they continue to troll and another game dodges, and then another, and then another.  Very frustrating and the people leaving aren&#039;t really the problem, its the people not wanting to play nice with others.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps it could also be setup that  if you&#039;re in a party with someone else it takes 1 less vote to vote your or that other person out. \r\n\r\nLearning how to play and create team compositions are part of the game. And it&#039;s an ELO killer.  I think if someone gets a temporary que timer that they should be given suggestions or resources on how to pick team comp based on what their team is picking.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-15T14:07:47.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then riven/yas/vayne mains would actually never get to see a game.\n\n\nYou don't play what the team wants and you get the boot.","replies":[{"poster":"quablokot","date":"2017-10-15T16:56:44.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see the community having 4 people collaborating to boot someone just because they do not like the champion someone is playing.  \n\nThat is also why the vote would have to be unanimous and possibly even anonymous.  \n\nDo you have any suggestions that would make this idea work?","replies":[]}]}]}
