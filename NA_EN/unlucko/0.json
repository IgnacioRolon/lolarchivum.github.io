The only reason I disagree with these games is because it has been a decent amount of time between this and my 10 day chat ban, I went that whole time without flaming and being positive and getting rewards again. I think a lot of the things I said are taken out of context because obviously;\r\n\r\n1.) I swear a crazy amount, but there is a chat filter for a reason?\r\n\r\n2.) You don&#039;t get too see the game being played its self, and although you should never flame and I understand that, the blitz in one of my games was flashing in base and trying to hook my character, even though he wasn&#039;t new to the game, and  the Braum is was in game with was trolling and blaming me for things, and then I was ganged up against and had to deal with flame from three other players (Which I guarantee got no bans or chat restrictions.)  I apologise to anyone offended reading this, its childish and I have been working in real life and online with how I talk to people (I have counselling and medication to battle outbursts, which again isn&#039;t an excuse, just something I am dealing with). I am interested to see your opinions on the matter, I just figured from the way I see many other people talk and flame on this game, the two examples I&#039;ve provided are annoying and maybe a bit ignorant, but not necessarily abusive or toxic, maybe i&#039;m being blind sided by my ego.","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-04-29T21:24:46.420+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, from game 2 and 3, I'd say yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-29T21:07:11.080+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you most likely had a previous restriction, this is just an escalation instead of another lesser one. \n\nLearn from it, it only goes up from here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shukr4n","date":"2018-04-29T20:57:54.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"put in this prospective.\n\nquestion is not if \"is it really that bad?\"\nbut\n\"did i learn something by this punishment?\"\n\nbasically the question riot asked itself when created the IFS","replies":[]}]}
