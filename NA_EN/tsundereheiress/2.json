When I discovered Xayah and Rakan I knew I had to have them. The grind they were worth and the money on their skins were also worth it.\r\n\r\nNow, to the point I was making. I saw a reddit blog about a Bonnie and Clyde skin for them. After watching their interactions I felt that this had to be a thing. I feel that we need more lover skins like Dusk and Dawn. So many skin ideas go through my mind for them. Bonnie and Clyde, Light and Dark, Angel and Demon, etc.\r\n\r\nI really want riot to use one or more of these ideas. What do you guys think? Should they make more lover skins? If so what ideas do you got?","replies":[{"poster":"eleven02","date":"2017-10-14T15:03:57.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, they definitely need to take out a lot of skins for them... and i have some ideas for skins but only love skins ideas... if you want to you can check them in my discussion, and if youre interesed you can make a recomendation for a skin. thanks and yeah, i would love a bonnie and clyde skins :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-10-13T04:46:37.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure they will get tango skins eventually","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cute Poro","date":"2017-10-13T04:23:49.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heck yes.\nI think since they're the only champions like this, that have their own special recall that you can just hop into at any time and go back **together** is awesome. Even their kits were designed to work better together.\nIf anything is deserving of lover related skins, it is most definitely those two!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]}
