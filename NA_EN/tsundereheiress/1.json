This is important for my gayness. But...\r\n\r\nARE SG {{champion:99}}  AND SG {{champion:222}}  SERIOUSLY A CANON COUPLE I HEARD SOMEWHERE THEY WERE. Not just that but I found a post where someone broke down the story between the two to prove they were gay in that universe. Something along the lines that after Jinx betrayed/left/did something it gave Lux a mental break down. Not just that but they also pointed out that Jinx came back specifically for Lux. That she was indeed friends with Poppy and the others. But, the only reason she came back to the Star Guardians was for Lux. I don&#039;t know how true this is, so I&#039;m asking you guys.\r\n\r\nNow on to {{champion:51}} and {{champion:254}} . ARE THEY CONFIRMED YET. I NEED TO KNOW. Cause their relationship is completely Bandit x Princess and you know that&#039;s the best kind of pairing. I need updated info on these &quot;couples&quot;. Not shit from 2-4 years ago. UPDATE ME ON THE GAYNESS PLEASE.\r\n\r\nAlso, here is a poll just for fun. Who knows maybe (and hopefully) this poll may do a little something. If the outcome leads to confirming gayness.","replies":[]}
