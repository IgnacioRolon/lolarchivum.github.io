I can only click on Blind pick. Ranked, Draft and Flex won't let me click on it. Twisted Treeline is locked. ARAM is open for me.

A quick repair should resolve this. Simply click the cog icon in the right right of the client, then hit the *Initiate Full Repair* button. After it's done, close League out and relog.\n\nLet me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"smallbuttmean","date":"2016-12-13T23:32:23.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"On another thread someone recommended launching in Legacy Client to fix it, and that worked for a day, and then earlier today I tried this, worked until I restarted my client. Its a reoccurring bug and its frustrating to have to relaunch 3 times or do a repair, every time I open league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nëzumi","date":"2016-12-14T05:01:33.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt do anything to fix it i just logged back on later on and it was all back to normal! so hopefully it doesnt do it again. if it does ill repair the client!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HawkEye464","date":"2016-12-14T18:04:50.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also having this problem.

Can't play co-op vs Ai, twisted treeline or ranked games. Each game mode shows a lock on them.
