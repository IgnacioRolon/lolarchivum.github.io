I was confused because i thought this was normal, i thought you would earn them all if you joined the event. \n\nNote that i haven&#039;t swapped regions for this.\nI am now in EUW and i have always been here.\nIt&#039;s not a harmful bug but i still wanted to share it because it seems a little unfair. (for collectors i guess)\n\nIf this is not a bug, be sure to tell me, i&#039;ll be glad to know where they came from then. :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-07T23:46:21.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mr Squeek,\n\nThese icons were for the 2014 Lunar Revel event and were earned by playing various game types. \n\nThe first three icons in the bottom were purchasable for IP/RP after the Lunar Revel event ended.  Depending on what your region voted for during the time, you could have also received one for free! In your case, it was the \"Path of Power\" icon (third icon from the left in the bottom row - it has the special icon on the bottom left of it!)\n\nThe last two in that row were for playing two matchmade games on Summoner's Rift and playing two games with a friend on Howling Abyss. If you scroll down and have the Diana icon, that was for playing two matchmade games on Twisted Treeline or The Crystal Scar. There is also a horse icon that was for playing any matchmade game during the Lunar Revel event. \n\nHope this explains things! If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Squeek","date":"2015-12-08T10:01:15.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you, i'll be sure to explain to my friends. They thought it was impossible to have all the icons, thanks for clearing this out.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-08T18:39:14.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
