I have created a simple chart of champion power levels. The final column, \"Power\", reflects win rate after accounting for win rate deflation caused by high popularity rates. The original data is from Lolking.\n\nI can't claim that the formula for Power is completely accurate, as determining how much popularity skews win rate is rather difficult. This is simply a rough attempt at providing some numbers that are more revealing than win rate is on its own.\n\nThese rankings are not intended to reflect how frustrating a champion may be to play against. For example, most members of the community would rather play against a Jinx than a Kalista, despite the objective statistics favoring Jinx by far. The top tier results aren't necessarily the most overwhelming to play against, but they do appear to be overpowered in the sense that they crowd out competition for their respective roles. In contrast, the bottom tier results may even feel strong in certain matchups/situations, but appear to statistically fall short of their competition overall.\n\nI personally was somewhat surprised by some of the results. For example, when looking at the full chart, I noticed very little connection between champion release date and power level. This suggests that the frequent claims of \"power creep\" in league are exaggerated.\n\nAnyhow, please find your most played champion in the chart below and use the poll to share what tier they belong to.\n\nTier 1: Overpowered\n\nRank ==\tChampion ==\tPopularity ==\tWin Rate ==\tBan Rate

Katarina at least has a really inflated ban ratio, showing that players, mainly people in Bronze, don't know how to deal with her, so they ban her. There are just some hidden factors that may change these statistics that don't necessarily show up very well. I really think that Jinx shouldn't be in the top tier, personally. The most OP champions, I find, would be easier to use. Compared to another adc at the top, Graves, Jinx is really hard to play. Like, I picked her up because she was \"OP\" and I wanted to climb soloqueue, but I learned pretty quickly after a few normal games I was in over my head.

They remember that one recent game where Lee Sin felt impossible to catch.\n\nWhen you get killed by Zed, it feels like a stupid cheap trick. When you get beat by Jinx in a game, it feels like the other player worked for it and played well. Also in Jinx's favor is that she shines late game, so you feel like you had your chance to play and win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BureTheBear","date":"2015-03-31T21:26:30.521+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, according to this, Nocturne is borderline weak.

Too many of the champions with a 1.5% popularity have high winrates because the seven people who play them know what they're doing.

That's only because bottom lane is pretty much the same thing regardless of who you play, so whoever is popular and strong is just picked. No one bans adc's, so as long as you don't pick Ezreal, you're okay.
