What if Arcane Blade (5% AP On-hit) were brought back instead of adding the new Nimbus Cloak?  Mages have been asking for Arcane Blade to return since Runes Reforged.  A new iteration of Spell Weaving mastery could also be welcome (possibly as a Sorceror keystone).  By the way, Arcane Blade should not be made adaptive scaling in my opinion, but it could be given a minimum (3-5) on-hit damage floor that takes effect until enough AP is obtained to surpass it.  There are other non-adaptive masteries already, such as a magic-damage only shield that happens to disfavor AP champions in the game, so adaptive scaling isn&#039;t necessarily a rule for new runes.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2018-05-09T13:41:20.583+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":19,"body":"I loved arcane blade, but It should be made into a keytone instead and should add 15% ap instead.","replies":[{"poster":"TempName54846","date":"2018-05-09T14:16:42.144+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":1,"body":"bring back ap tryndamere, ap xin and completely break varus?  eh, i'd be surprisingly okay with that","replies":[{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-05-09T20:41:37.760+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TempName54846,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yXH7HlWk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-05-09T14:16:42.144+0000)\n>\n> bring back ap tryndamere, ap xin and completely break varus?  eh, i&#x27;d be surprisingly okay with that\n\n{{champion:145}} {{champion:96}} also","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2018-05-09T14:40:17.191+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats not a keystone, thats a legit champ skill\n\ntry facing off against a {{champion:17}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:131}} who get an additonal 15% AP ratio on top of their existing damage and can then add {{item:3115}} to make it 30%","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2018-05-09T14:57:41.642+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Varus would have a 55% AP ratio on aa's","replies":[{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-05-09T18:19:49.470+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sad Tyrant,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yXH7HlWk,comment-id=000000020000,timestamp=2018-05-09T14:57:41.642+0000)\n>\n> Varus would have a 55% AP ratio on aa&#x27;s\n\n{{champion:42}}","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-09T18:56:51.337+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't have any AP ratio on basic attacks.

The rune trees used to be stuff like +3 armor, +2 AD, and +0.5% damage; Arcane Blade reflects that kind of environment, where the effects were small and passive. Most of the current runes give much larger effects; bonuses above and beyond 10% are pretty common, or moderate flat damage amounts (+20 AD, -35% damage, ect).

So you pick something that at least not complete garbage.\n\nYou're missing the point here.\n\nThat 100 damage is if you PAUSE your rotation in order to weave in those auto attacks. Most mages can get their combo off (whether it hits or not is a different matter) in 2 seconds top, often 1 second. Said combo also tends to out range autos.\n\nWe're talking about dragging your combo out over 4+ seconds due to attack speed time which is a massive mistake as it gives people time to escape / pop defensives / be saved by allies, and ALSO means that you're going to have to wait longer before you can combo again, in order to gain... A little over 100 damage. When you're late game with 800 ap. Before resistances.\n\nYeah, no. That's an awful trade. It's an awful trade all game, because even early on when spells hurt less, you're talking losing out a portion of your combo (at least 50 damage) for.. 8 damage from autos. \n\nThe only place spell blade had any value was in CSing. But given how it was effected by resistance, it realistically added upto an extra 1-2 damage on each auto early game.\n\nArcane Blade, as it existed, was hot garbage on everyone. Every. Single. Champion. \n\nIf it were re-implemented, it would need a much beefier value (20% as I said) or to be something sort of similar to sheen / which probably stacked.
