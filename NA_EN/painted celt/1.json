{"poster":"Painted Celt","date":"2015-12-26T23:22:16.437+0000","title":"Can Manamune please be buffed?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":84,"down_votes":8,"body":"{{item:3004}} Manamune has been severely left behind by somewhat recent changes.  It was left out of the AD item revamp and passed over when {{item:3003}} Archangel&#039;s Staff was made more slot efficient.  Buffing Manamune will help several of the least popular and most underpowered champions in the game.  It will also help provide consistent itemization options since it is currently inferior to its sister item, Archangel Staff.\n\nBelow are lists of the champions most frequently building Muramana/Manamune.\n{{item:3042}} Muramana:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rL67zFt.jpg\n\n{{item:3004}} Manamune:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8GE8GHX.jpg\n\nAs you can see above, Manamune/Muramana is currently only being built by 5 out of 128 champions in the game. The number of occurrences after {{champion:6}} Urgot and {{champion:110}} Varus fall off to insignificant numbers.  Meta-breaking AD Malzahar and AD Blitzcrank builds make up most of the remaining occurences, with a few remaining Kog'Maws building it.\n\n{{champion:6}} Urgot, {{champion:110}} Varus, and {{champion:96}} Kog&#039;Maw are all within the bottom 5 least popular marksmen, even when including their play rate in other lanes/roles (AP Varus, AP Kog&#039;maw, Bruiser Urgot, etc.).  \n\n{{champion:6}} Urgot and {{champion:83}} Yorick are *the* two least popular champions in the game, and have under 50% winrates despite typically only being played by experienced players due to their small playerbase.  \n\nChampions like {{champion:80}} Pantheon and {{champion:121}} Kha'Zix really want what is offered by this item, but aren't building it often because of how weak it is in its current state.  A fully stacked Muramana is harder to obtain than most alternative items, yet doesn&#039;t currently give much of a power spike due to its poor base AD compared to other AD items.\n\nI think this item can be safely buffed for an easy victory for the Riot balance team. Here are some suggested changes:\n\n{{item:3004}} \n{{item:1037}} Pickaxe replaced by {{item:1038}} B. F. Sword in recipe.\nCombine Cost ~~775~~ &rArr; 1050 (Total Cost ~~2400~~ &rArr; 3100; This is the same total cost as Archangel&#039;s Staff)\nAD ~~25~~ &rArr; 50\nBase Mana Regen ~~25%~~ &rArr; 50%\nMana Charge: Grants ~~4~~ &rArr; 6 maximum Mana (max +750 Mana) for each basic attack, spell cast, and Mana expenditure (occurs up to 2 times every 8 seconds). **Grants 1 maximum Mana every 8 seconds.**\n\n{{item:3042}} \nAD ~~25~~ &rArr; 50\nBase Mana Regen ~~25%~~ &rArr; 50%\n\nMost of these changes help make Manamune more consistent as the AD equivalent of Archangel&#039;s Staff. I feel that Archangel&#039;s Staff was greatly improved when its recipe was updated and it became a more slot efficient item. I&#039;d like the same treatment for Manamune. \n\nWith the AD item revamp, B.F. Sword became cheaper, making it a more convenient item to build early on. I feel this would not homogenize {{item:3004}} Manamune with {{item:3508}} Essence Reaver since the AD item revamp helped distinguish Essence Reaver.  Essence Reaver would remain *the* CDR item for crit users, while Manamune would be distinguished by its early mana Tear of the Goddess build path, Awe passive, and Muramana toggle effect. This would also bring the number of B.F. Sword items ({{item:3004}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3508}}) closer in line with the number of Needlessly Large Rod items ({{item:3003}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}}).\n\nThe changes to the base mana regen and flat AD are to match Archangel&#039;s Staff and to compensate for the increased build cost. Increasing AD to 50 would make {{item:3004}} Manamune&#039;s base AD roughly 77% of the base AD of {{item:3508}} or {{item:3031}}.  For comparison, {{item:3003}} Archangel&#039;s Staff provides 80 base AP, which is exactly 80% of the base AP provided by {{item:3285}}, {{item:3157}}, or {{item:3116}}.  If Manamune were buffed to 55 base AD, that would be a little under 85% of the base AD of {{item:3508}} or {{item:3031}}.\n\nThe buff to stacking rate from 4 to 6 mana is to help {{item:3004}} Manamune users stack up a little easier. {{item:3003}} Archangel&#039;s Staff gains 8 mana per expenditure, and while Manamune also gains stacks for autoattacks, both items are limited to 2 stack gains per 8 seconds.  This means that even with this buff, Manamune would still have a lower maximum mana gain per 8 seconds (12 vs 16). \n\nThe inclusion of {{item:3070}} Tear of the Goddess&#039;s passive +1 mana stack per 8 seconds in the upgraded items would also be very helpful. It is fairly rare for an item to lose this kind of functionality when upgraded, and is somewhat annoying. Tear of the Goddess is actually able to gain a higher amount of mana than Manamune per 8 seconds (9 vs 8), which is somewhat counter-intuitive since players expect upgraded items to be completely superior to their components. This specific change could also be applied to Archangel&#039;s Staff, which would also help mana hungry mages that build Archangel&#039;s and are struggling in mid lane, such as Karthus and Cassiopeia.\n\nThanks for reading!

It rewards having heavy damage on autos, as if your first auto deals 1000 damage (including botrk) and the second hit deals like 960 damage (the target is assumed to have 2000 hp), then the enemy champion will basically have been dealt MORE damage than expected, as over those two hits the average %health damage was actually 4.5%. Essentially it is exactly what you said, a softening up mechanic that allows you to eventually kill a foe with your own damage.\n\nThe balance here comes from dealing more damage to high health targets. In essence, the botrk itself or liandries itself is not a champion killer. The items' usages would change significantly if they were able to kill champions on their own.\n\n\nAlso RIP madred's bloodrazor","replies":[{"poster":"Sire Hippington","date":"2015-12-27T21:17:40.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would all be nice and fine if those items were used with the purpose of softening up targets.\n\nBotrK is ~50% of the time used simply because it's the only item that gives AS and Lifesteal.\n~30% of the time, it is built because it offers %hp damage(no matter wether max, current or missing) and they have to deal with someone who stacks hp.\n~20% of the time it is picked for the active that improves dueling, kiteing and chaseing.\n*_estimated values_\n\nBe honest, how often did you pick up BotrK and though: 'i want to get people to ~50%hp fast and then leave it to others to finish them off, so i take the %current health item'?\nOr: 'I have execute mechaniics, so dropping them fast to ~50% might be nice'?\n\nAnd most of all, how often wouldn't you use BotrK if it was %missing or max insteat of current???\n\nIf doing **CURRENT**-health actually was the unique selling point of an item, i wouldn't have much problems with it.\nBut as it is now, it is just a mnor factor, most people couldn't care less wether it is current, missing or max health as long as the raw power is the same.\n\n>Also RIP madred's bloodrazor\n\nHe shall be remebert together with his fallen brothers...{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2015-12-27T21:47:38.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Don Pavoni,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E4nXhtkd,comment-id=00000000000100000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-27T21:17:40.200+0000)\n>\n> that would all be nice and fine if those items were used with the purpose of softening up targets.\n> \n> BotrK is ~50% of the time used simply because it's the only item that gives AS and Lifesteal.\n> ~30% of the time, it is built because it offers %hp damage(no matter wether max, current or missing) and they have to deal with someone who stacks hp.\n> ~20% of the time it is picked for the active that improves dueling, kiteing and chaseing.\n> *_estimated values_\n> \n> Be honest, how often did you pick up BotrK and though: 'i want to get people to ~50%hp fast and then leave it to others to finish them off, so i take the %current health item'?\n> Or: 'I have execute mechaniics, so dropping them fast to ~50% might be nice'?\n> \n> And most of all, how often wouldn't you use BotrK if it was %missing or max insteat of current???\n> \n> If doing **CURRENT**-health actually was the unique selling point of an item, i wouldn't have much problems with it.\n> But as it is now, it is just a mnor factor, most people couldn't care less wether it is current, missing or max health as long as the raw power is the same.\n\nYou do bring up a good point.\n\nAs a proponent of the more AD+ attack speed items movement (probably one of the few), I have to agree that botrk is used to fill up multiple different item types when in reality people want 2-3 different specialized items.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2015-12-27T01:23:49.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DracoMTA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E4nXhtkd,comment-id=000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-27T01:17:47.572+0000)\n>\n> I'm not sure why it \"needs\" a consistent damage boost.

According to the League of Legends wikia, Cassiopeia can obtain the maximum finite (as in excluding Veigar and Thresh's infinite scaling) AP with that build, her passive maxed, and all possible buffs at a total of 2528 AP. A level 18 {{champion:38}} Kassadin with {{item:3040}} and no other items gets 156 AP from it due to its 80 base AP + passive with his 2,536.6 (1,000 from Seraph's)  mana pool. \n\nThere are lots of reasons why that doesn't end up being as good as it looks on paper and why not all mages rush Archangel's. The same would be true with an equivalently powerful Manamune.\n\nIn the original post, I actually suggested a slightly lower AD than it would require to be 100% equivalent to Archangel's base stats. To be 100% equivalent, it would actually require 52 base AD in stead of 50. So, at 50 AD, it would really be a marginally worse stat stick than Archangel's is. Also, most mages have higher base mana pools than AD casters and have an easier time itemizing additional mana ({{item:3027}}), so Archangel's is actually even stronger as a stat stick than the numbers themselves suggest. I personally think that is fine since I consider the Muramana toggle somewhat more valuable than Seraph's mana shield.

This makes its active much more powerful even if numbers-wise the two seem similar; as a result, it makes sense Muramana's stats are worse gold-wise.\n* __Attack Speed as a multiplier for AD is easier to acquire than CDR as a multiplier for AP.__ Most AD champions who even build AS at all only build 1 AS item + Berserker Greaves, if that. The only champs who build more usually do so because their kit has powerful on-hit effects, and those champions typically aren't as interested in stacking AD (= this item doesn't factor in their purchase decisions). Meanwhile mages have to commit at least 2 item slots to get enough CDR to create a significant multiplier, usually more, and their 20% CDR options also focus on mana regen which has low-synergy with Seraph's Insight passive.\n* __Maximum attainable stat analysis is unrealistic at best.__ This should be obvious, but very few games make it to level 18, 6 items. Even fewer have Seraph's + triple-stacked RoA. By the time most games end, the difference in gold value between the two items is far less exaggerated.\n* ___AD itemization is not meant to directly parallel AP itemization and therefore should not be directly compared to AP itemization.___ This is the big one. Not only would this make itemization extremely bland, they are two fundamentally different stats that deserve different tools. Just because Manamune builds from Tear and Seraph's builds from Tear doesn't mean the two should be balanced against each other. Instead of comparing it to AP items which have a completely different \"audience\" to AD items, try comparing Manamune to other items its users might reasonably buy. If Manamune is weak, what are people preferring to buy over it? How can Manamune *distinguish* itself from those items, or how can its numbers be changed to play up its fantasy? I don't think Manamune's fantasy is \"highest AD item in the game,\" so why should we try to emphasize that about it? This is my opinion, but the \"stacking power\" theme and the \"big payoff\" theme of the item both seem like sound places to buff Manamune and make it more attractive than, say, Youmuu's.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SolusInCadere","date":"2015-12-28T01:09:39.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike having to say \"no Manamune is perfect\" because that is false.
