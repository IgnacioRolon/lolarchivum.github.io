And going into the config file setting 0s to most. I have disabled superfetch, tried gameDVR and windows 10 and tried disabling it. I get 2 more fps with game mode on(Go windows). I came across wooxy and windows 10 low res textures, but it seems it isin't supported anymore. I am getting a solid 20 fps. Wondering if riot has some low res textures or some other ways of increasing fps. No dedicated gpu, its an apu. Before you say go buy better stuff, that is not what im asking. Im asking if there are other ways to increase fps. I have tried disabling eye candy, and world map accents. Literally I have done everything. Thanks !?

Also, try turning on \"close client during game\" in the client settings as that should increase your performance a bit as well.\n\nIf those don't seem to help much, check out the other steps listed in this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) to cover some other general troubleshooting and let me know how that helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valeeva","date":"2017-11-06T23:50:53.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really no.\n\nIm stuck with 50 fps on a 610M on the lowest possible settings at 1080.
