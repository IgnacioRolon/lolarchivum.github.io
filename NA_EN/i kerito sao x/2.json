As far as I've been able to calculate, you can definitely get the special icon that activates the border without having to spend RP. However, you do need to purchase the Nightbringer Yasuo skin in order to have the border applied.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-16T01:39:57.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Daily missions?\" Does this mean that new missions will become available each day for the next two weeks?

Just out of curiosity, will future missions that have counterparts to each other be attainable in the Missions System?

Or will future missions permanently disable their counterpart missions?\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/LCYGjX2MdqhYQ/200.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T05:00:58.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have much info on any missions after this event, but as far as these missions are concerned: you can freely switch between repping Yasuo and Riven each say.\n\nSay today you completed missions for Yasuo.
