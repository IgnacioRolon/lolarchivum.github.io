Applied it. Game loads. Also remember having a windows update i downloaded a few nights ago that probably caused the problem in the first place.\nSeriously, windows, get your act together...\n\nI have a 100mbps internet package. I played League on it the first day using the 5G connection and it was amazing - no lag no issues nothing. I used speedtest and it said I was actually getting a 110mbps connection speed. \n\nThe next day, I tried to play league on the 5G connection again and the game crashed on me in champion select (auto dodging). I tried to load a custom game and couldn't load it at all. Same computer, same internet, same spot in the house, yet league entirely won't load. \n\nI thought I must have made a mistake, I was on the wrong connection, so I switched to the 2.4G connection. League loaded, no problems. Except I had lots of lag and ping spikes. \n\nSo after playing on that for a couple days thinking it was my ISPs fault for lowering my internet speed, I even went back to speedtest and noticed I was only getting 34mbps. Then I remembered I was on 5G before so I switched back, and sure enough I registered at 108 mbps.\n\nSo I tried to start a custom game in League and... sure enough I can't load. Not even the game, I can't even load the screen to add bots or anything. The client just completely zones out and gives me the 'loading' bar and does nothing until I hit cancel...\n\nWhat's up? Why can't I play league on my better internet connection? I know the connection works, I'm using it right now to post this (and it works wonders on speedtest...). Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T15:13:49.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matches require a constant and maintained connection to play without issues, and it can be already tough doing so over wi-fi.  Attempting to play over a cellular data connection might make things ever more difficult.  Using a wired broadband connection could help things improve drastically.  Still, you can go over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help work on your connection strength, and to make sure other settings like firewall configurations based on the specific network you're connected to aren't getting in your way.  You can also use a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for the matches with these lag spikes for an overview of what's going wrong.
