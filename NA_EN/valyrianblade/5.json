At 16 minutes in to the game, total kills were 10 to 12. Of those, I had 6 as jungle Hecarim. The other team's top lane Riven had 5. Yet everyone on my team (myself included) were deathly afraid of Riven. Why?\r\n\r\nRiven was level 13, I was level 10. Riven actually hit 14 before I hit 11 as well. Ignore that my 6 kills were spread 3/2/1 across 3 different opponents while 4 of her kills were on our top laner (who was 0/4) and the fifth was on our mid laner (who was 1/6 herself). Ignore that our mid laner had her game crash and connected 4 levels behind meaning that theoretically our team had more xp to spread across the 4 active members at the start of the game. \r\n\r\nI'm not even bothered that despite me having 6 kills and Riven only having 5 that she would have more gold (items) than me. She was CS'ing spectacularly well (at the end of the 1:15 game she had 667 cs and 36.8k gold). What bothers me is that BECAUSE I WAS JUNGLER I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT A TOP LANER WHO FOR ALL ARGUMENTS HAD DONE WORSE IN THE GAME THAN ME. \r\n\r\nWhy is it that solo laners have access to SO MUCH more experience than Junglers? That despite having an extra kill and being a farm jungler with a solidly fast clear, I was more than 3 levels behind her? \r\nRiven played well, don't get me wrong. She got her advantage in lane. Rushed a tiamat for waveclear. Cleared her waves fast and then cleared my gromp and her golems (at least that's my guess) whenever she got the chance. That's part of the problem though. I'm already behind that I couldn't go fight her 1v1 at my gromp because she's got solo lane xp and cs. I can't invade the enemies jungle because she'll kill me if I invade top jungle and obviously Kha'zix will keep bottom jungle cleared himself since she's taking his top jungle (and if I try to invade no doubt I'll run in to him and since their Fizz was winning mid lane as well I'd no doubt die 1v2). I can't go tax my laners because they all need that experience themselves.\r\n\r\nAnyways, my whole point is that this should NEVER happen. I had more kills and had played efficiently. I also had kills across 3 opponents (a few of which were shut down kills) while she basically beat up on our top laner over and over again for free kills. Despite that, she had 3+ levels on everyone else and could win any fight 1v2 (and later 1v4 as this snowballed). When teams undoubtedly have their skilled players in different roles, there shouldn't be such a large discrepancy in your ability to compete based on what role was selected. I SHOULDN'T BE BEHIND BECAUSE I WAS JUNGLING AND SHE WAS TOP, or at least I should only be a little behind. \r\n\r\n***************************\r\nSo alas, my suggestion is simple: you need to tie bonus xp to the upgraded hunter's machetes. When Riven was level 13 with 5 kills in lane, I should have been level 12, or at least level 11, from 6 kills in the jungle. I definitely should have hit 12 before she hit 14, not her hitting 14 before I hit 11. \r\n***************************\r\n\r\nAnyways, if anyone cares, this ended up being one of the most fun, exciting, etc... games I ever played. (I'm allowed to share this right?)\r\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1712535703/216460380?tab=overview\r\nTeam comps were\r\nBlue: \r\nTop: Nidalee\r\nMid: Lux\r\nJungle: Hecarim (me)\r\nADC: Ezreal\r\nSupport: Thresh\r\n\r\nRed:\r\nTop: Riven\r\nMid: Fizz\r\nJungle: Kha'zix\r\nADC: Miss Fortune\r\nSupport: Braum\r\n\r\nWe had sufficient waveclear to defend through FIVE BARONS, to deny 6 surrender votes, and to fight despite a 15K team gold deficit. I STOLE the first dragon, secured the second, Lux STOLE the third dragon, they got the 4th, and we took the 5th dragon when they took Baron (so we had a 4-1 dragon lead with 2 of them stolen, we knew we couldn't fight them at Baron) and end of game dragons were 4-4. Ultimately having that 4th dragon when they got their first Baron probably saved us because they probably could have pushed for the win once or twice but instead retreated from our base to take dragon to make sure we didn't get 5. Despite being consistently down 2 inhibitors, we took our first inhibitor after the 1 hour mark. At 1:11 we managed a pick on Riven that resulted in 3 free kills and 2 inhibitors (shortly after they took 2 of ours). At 1:13 I ulted in to the Baron pit right as they took their 5th Baron, Ezreal cleaned up a free triple kill, we rushed to their base and Thresh and I tanked the two nexus turrets (as we had no minion waves) and secured the hard-earned win at 1:14 - about 30-40 minutes after I imagine we probably would have won if I'd have been an appropriate level to take on Riven, but nonetheless it was the most exciting game I've ever had. **I REALLY wish I had a replay software.**","replies":[{"poster":"NoMonku","date":"2015-01-30T11:43:12.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Junglers have had too much impact for awhile now.  While it is unfortunate that even though you played well and that you lost, it is better overall that you were behind.  If you were actually closer in levels, it would be fine in this scenario since you would potentially be able to fight against her, but what if you were just the only one fed?  This will make the jungler have WAY too much impact on the game for having to take no to little risk besides showing up to a lane once in awhile.  This will make snowball junglers such as Rek'Sai, Kha'Zix, Lee Sin, and Rengar incredibly obnoxious as they can easily snowball out of control.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-30T14:16:04.680+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We actually won ;) it was just a lot harder than it should have been. \n\nMy problem is,  why should a laner be allowed to snowball so hard by repetitively beating up on the same player (I.e.

I will admit that I am biased against carry junglers(as I don't like playing against them) so I am fine with them not having as much carry/kill potential as they did before.  My problem with them is that before they were basically on par w/ a solo lane if they did really well.  This basically makes it impossible to make a good play laning phase wise because you know if they pop out you will lose.  At least with a fed laner, you will SEE them farming in lane, so you know you can try something where they aren't, but with a jungler this isn't as easy.  Yes, you could try to ward, but there are way too many places to do it and you also do risk death if they are fed enough.  \n\nTo me a jungler has always been an objective secure role and a secondary warder, with whatever their kit offers as secondary(CC, dmg, etc...) so as long as they are still able to do these things, I am fine with them for now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2015-01-31T14:13:27.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your point,  I really do. \n\nI don't even disagree with it entirely.  I just think that junglers sacrifice gold (since creeps are easier gold than camps) for that safety and shouldn't sacrifice a huge amount of levels too. \n\nI guess my main problem is,  right now the only thing that can deal with a solo laner is another solo laner.  If the enemy top laner gets ahead by more than 1 kill (which in solo queue you're going to get people that feed kills after their first death,  for some reason they just don't get that they should stay back), the only person on your team capable of shutting them down before the 30 min mark is your mid laner.  \n\nSo what happens when top/mid loses like this,  the other is going even,  but jungle,  adc and support are all winning pretty hard?  You still lose fights because solo lanes just matter that much more. \n\nIn my opinion,  you should never be in a role where regardless of how well you do you can't shut down another player (at least not for a considerable time). Obviously I'm biased here because I main adc/mid/jungle and don't get mid often since it's popular.  The number of games where I'm jg/adc and I have the most kills on the map (and when adc the most cs) but an enemy top/mid destroys me because of a level disadvantage is ridiculous.  \n\nBasically,  a good top/mid can recognize the other team has a good jg/adc/sp and rotate and shut them down hard to get their teammates a lead.  A good jg/adc/sp can recognize the enemy team has a good top/mid and just hope they can convince their team to turtle and defend for 30 minutes until they catch up in levels and can fight.  I just see a huge imbalance here. At least with junglers it is fixable without destroying balance (junglers never used to be so far behind in levels), it would take a lot more effort to help adcs and since they're supposed to be late game carries I'm not sure if a change is really needed there.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-01-30T04:13:27.449+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Why is it that solo laners have access to SO MUCH more experience than Junglers?

Season 5 is an attempt to make it so that the jungler isn't the deciding factor in almost all high level games.\n\nMeanwhile, top lane has had the least influence on high level victory for some time, despite having considerable personal power.  I'm sure Riot hopes that top laners have more carry potential in season 5 than season 4.\n\nNow they're going to have to figure out how to make it feel good to jungle, because right now jungling feels pretty lame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrinkMoreWhiskey","date":"2015-01-30T04:00:42.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You realize ganking a lot generally puts you behind in exp, not ahead right?

Laners have minions to soak damage.  Next,  junglers always miss out on xp when buying as they could clear camps in that time, laners can push the wave and get back without missing any xp (or maybe 1-2 minions). Finally,  if all a jungler does is farm it puts his laners at a disadvantage if the enemy jungler ganks.  It should only make sense that if a jungler sacrifices ganking he should actually out-level solo laners.  A jungler who ganks very little should match them,  and s jungler who ganks a lot should fall a bit behind. \n\nThe problem is the jungle is balanced to make junglers never have an advantage over laners regardless of what they do. \nGive xp so that if they farm non stop they can't out-level the lanes. \nDeal damage so that they can't gank early on high health And get kills easier than lanes. \nGive gold so that if they clear fast they won't have as much money as laners who suck at cs' ing (because we can't let junglers have so much more money in low quality matches).\n\nThere should be a median.

Jungling would be a lot more fun if they retuned it so that you're only stuck one level down, and while that would be a huge buff to Lee and J4 (who imo are hurt by the way exp works right now but nobody wants to mention that on this board), it would increase jungle diversity beyond who can be a threat even though they're down 3 levels (part of the reason I've been doing so well on Vi is that being a little behind doesn't change what she can do, at least until she needs to be tanky and isn't.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-01-30T06:46:49.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through the same thing actually. \n\nWas playing Pantheon in the jungle.
