It&#039;s just insane. It makes level 6 tower dives WAY too easy. I don&#039;t care if the cooldown is really long. With heals and CC, he&#039;s already over the top. I don&#039;t mind him making his team immune to champion-damage, but I think Turret damage is just a little OP (even with his other nerfs on the PBE).","replies":[{"poster":"AnonymousPoro","date":"2016-04-27T17:02:41.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Taric were to get his invulnerability to towers nerfed, then Kayle, Kindred, and Tryndamere would have to get their invulnerability nerfed as well(Hell, Trynd and Kayle's ults are better because they take effect immediate and **have no cost**).

You can't kill me in a tower dive if I can't die either.

I just played a game where taric was pretty much making his team immortal because his ult was on too low of a CDR and it just didnt have any counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2016-04-27T20:29:07.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">that if you go full CDR its like on a 50 second timer \n\n... and without any CDR, it's 160/130/100 seconds. That's pretty standard.\n\nGenerally when you build full CDR, your ultimate timer goes down. Taric's is far from unreasonable.\n\nAlso, if you take the CDR mastery, it's up to a 55 second timer btw, 60 without the mastery. And that's at max rank for the role that's usually under-leveled compared to the rest of the team...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magnum Mack","date":"2016-04-27T16:37:30.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still knock people out of his ult so they can't get it a la Trist, Gragas, Alistair, etc. You can CC them in place so they can't move a la Morg, Annie, Zyra, etc. \n\nI've personally not seen a tower dive work well at lvl 6 because once someone sees the ult charging they generally run and at lvl 6 a tower isn't going down in 2.5 seconds even with a fed jinx. When he ults against me I walk back, morg q the adc so they can't get free hits on the tower and reengage under tower when the ult is off. It's 2.5 seconds. If they stay under tower for 2 seconds of that and then leave, they will probably still take a turret shot. If they dive with minions then I just hit them for what I can and let my adc try and farm under turret. Ult is blown on a bad dive that got nothing but a little turret damage. \n\nTaric is hardly as overloaded as people say. He needs CDR to really get his stun out often, his heals are weak until about lvl 7 or 8 AND they don't do much when spammed with the 1 stack. After all those factors are taken in, he gets gated by mana pretty hard pretty early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torgal","date":"2016-04-27T15:44:08.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-04-27T15:44:03.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's too broken I haven't seen a Taric ult make a difference except when he ults in lane phase to dive, it doesn't block cc and if a lux hits a snare then they can't move for basically their whole time of invulnerability. To me kindreds ult is more annoying since it heals, prevents death, and is instant unlike Taric who has a delay so his ults need planning. I think Taric is fine and if anything his ult isn't op to me it's how low his mana costs are since I like to play Taric top it is hilarious how much damage you can do especially with iceborn and his passive.","replies":[]}]}
