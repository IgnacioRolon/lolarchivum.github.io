After a bunch of games top or bot where the enemy mid laner camps me and ruins my game (followed by my mid laner doing nothing and complaining that I&#039;m feeding his opponent...) I decided to go back to playing mid. Given that I&#039;m winning a lot more despite not playing it for so long, I feel like it&#039;s where I should be playing.\r\n\r\nProblem is the only mid champion I play right now is Ahri. I&#039;ve only ever really played Ahri mid (dating back to pre-dynamic queue where I only went mid if Ahri was still available, and post-dynamic I never queued for mid). \r\n\r\nSo I want some suggestions on who else to pick up. Most similar to Ahri would be great as it would help the learning curve. My criteria:\r\n- AP champions only, I will not be playing an AD mid laner (I just really dislike them, I feel like the mid laner is the team&#039;s consistent source of magic damage\r\n- Strong throughout the game (i.e. not someone who falls off late, and not someone who&#039;s really weak and becomes a hyper carry). I don&#039;t mind being weak pre-6. Just want to be able to exert influence on the map before the team falls too far behind and not feel useless late.\r\n- Preferably a decent roaming champion, or otherwise a way to exert map pressure.\r\n- Preferably somewhat mobile without flash\r\n- Preferably some form of CC\r\n\r\nBasically, a jack-of-all-trades master-of-none sort of deal (Ahri&#039;s identity). \r\n\r\nSome ideas I have had:\r\nKarthus - only sacrifices mobility. Ultimate is great map pressure - strong post-6. \r\nLissandra - she would double as an AP top lane pick up that I should probably be adding for when my mid laners are AD. Seems to have all of the above requirements. \r\nDiana - Seems to satisfy most, and she&#039;s always my biggest problem when playing Ahri (so she&#039;d be good to learn to play against Ahri, and playing her may help me learn to play against her). \r\nKarma - Satisfies most requirements as well.\r\nLulu - IDK why, I just feel like she may be appropriate.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"uCantGetMe1","date":"2017-05-15T22:40:33.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"syndra. she has mana problems early (dont spam low cooldown spell, similar problem with ahri)\nPretty bursty thanks to her ult, but at the same time has quite the dps mid and late game with her W, which has surprisingly long range. Sure she has to stack a lot of balls for a bit ultimate, but this often means having to set up-for syndra, balls/balls+poke, ahri can't really 100-0 that much from my experience on her. They're both good throughout the game, especially with syndra's high damage low cooldown poke from her W.\n\nFantastic E for teamfighting. The longer the siege lasts, the more balls she has, the more damage she offers and the more likely you are to land a 5-man stun. And in the cramped confines of jungle skirmishes, her Q/W impact radius is almost the size of a small jungle camp, enough to take up the entire width of a jungle path, and if you decide to throw out your stun there is NO WHERE THEY CAN FUCKING GO. Its perfect, but please dont play her jungle.\n\nShe definitely can roam, just remember to use your W to bring some balls along with you, or you can walk up, Q-E to stun, W for damage, another Q for more, and then an ult. Her E has impressive range too. Or, the usual Q-E then SPAM Q-W COMBO THEN DROP ULT IF YOU DEEM THEM LOW ENOUGH aka the syndra panic sphere spam face roll combo. This thing does incredible AOE and I once used it to 1v2 a Camille and a Yasuo when I got trapped by ultimatum.\n\nOnly thing she does not have, really, is mobility, but guranteed you dont over extend you should be all right","replies":[]},{"poster":"XGeneralMudkipX","date":"2019-01-17T00:48:28.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny thing is i was looking for another champion like Ahri but there that seems right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2016-09-19T18:45:34.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i recomend finding a champ that doenst play similar because you will try to play them like ahri when they have clearly different mechancs.  i recomend going for something completely different like viktor","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-09-19T02:01:43.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd definitely say Diana plays similarly.\n\nAkali has a lot of burst and mobility, but no reliable CC (I'm guessing AoE slow doesn't count).\nMaybe Elise? I'm not sure about recently, but she could reliably go mid lane a while ago. Has some mobility, good burst, although I think her damage falls off late.\nKassadin? Good amount of mobility, good burst, but only a slow. It's a pretty strong slow, though.\nYou said no AD, but Jayce seems to fit a lot of what you want too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunnymap","date":"2016-09-19T01:53:24.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:161}} \nHe has CC, has poke, all in burst, doesn't fall off, good waveclear, can use Q or ult to help other lanes from where the enemies can't see you (tribush or river bush), huge teamfight damage, and can even kite with his low cooldowns. He can also cs from a long range with mana refund on Q if he gets behind.\n\nOnly disadvantage I see is he's squishy and immobile like almost all mages","replies":[]},{"poster":"geya","date":"2016-09-19T01:50:18.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LUX, SYNDRA, VIKTOR, ORIANNA, XERATH, AND TALIYAH\n\n\nP.S. i main ahri, and these are my other favorite mages","replies":[]},{"poster":"WitchQueen Annie","date":"2016-09-19T01:45:07.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:99}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"71883083DEL1","date":"2016-09-19T01:39:33.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaven","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risk of Fate","date":"2016-09-19T01:31:38.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah would have been my pick, but with her recent nerf, she has trouble getting to mid game. Another pick, in a weird way, is Orianna because both are complex champions with a lot of mechanic prowess.  A fun pick is Nidalee in the mid lane which still is a very good pick after I gave it a try not too long ago. My final suggestion is Lux as her and Ahri are skillshot reliant and have decent CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Genuwhine36","date":"2016-09-19T01:22:42.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"swain pantheon lissandra varus annie","replies":[]}]}
