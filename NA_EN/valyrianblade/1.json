Around 5-8min into the game it settles down to my normal 40 ping. I've been loading practice tool before playing in order to get the \"bad ping\" out of the way before it stabilizes, but it's getting really annoying (especially when I don't have much time to play and just want to get a game in). Any idea how I can get it to just work off the start? It's so weird to me...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-14T03:01:06.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If those ping spikes are relatively random it might be caused by the way that your ISP is routing your connection to our servers. Let's try to test for packet loss by using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to scan the network logs of that game that had the ping spikes. Grab a quick screenshot of what it spits out so that I can see what was going on.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-07-15T00:42:14.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no good at uploading screenshots to these boards (even since the link option was removed). \n\nAnyways - it looks like I'm experiencing major issues throughout. I had a game last night with ping spikes to over 10000ms! Packet Loss was on average 6% and went as high as 25% (and was over 20% for a good amount of time). That game was the worst issues I've ever had. \n\nSome of my old logs are more consistently showing what I had been experiencing - e.g. average ping 82ms, highest ping 563ms, average packet loss 5.07%, with the graph showing up to nearly 10% packet loss at times. I went through a lot of logs and oddly didn't see any with max ping over 1000 except the game last night that went over 10000, which is weird because I'm 100% positive I've pinged my ping to my allies and it's told them numbers in the 1000-2500 range. Packet loss has been pretty severe on a good number of logs though, which is really odd considering last night's game was the only one where I noticed the packet loss. For most games it just seemed to be the ping causing me problems but I'm still having consistently 5% average packet loss every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T03:07:40.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm yea that little bit of packet loss can still be a pretty big deal depending on what bits of data are being lost. You might not have noticed the higher ping on the log reader if it only spiked over 2000 for a moment or two. \n\nSometimes this packet loss can be fixed by adjusting some [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but more often than not it's due to the way your ISP is routing your connection.
