He&#039;s been one of the lowest win rate champions this season, consistently at 44-47%. He&#039;s doing just as poorly as the likes of Azir or Ryze (https://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/) except he doesn&#039;t bring the 1v9 carry potential in challenger / pro play that required them to be dumpstered. \r\n\r\nWhy has this champion been ignored for so long, and relegated to such a weak state? He&#039;s DEFINITELY no more &quot;cancer&quot; than Quinn or Jayce or Kennen are as the top lane ranged champions so I&#039;d rather not hear that excuse. He&#039;s not oppressive as many are.","replies":[{"poster":"iGoogledYourMOM","date":"2017-03-13T03:29:01.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you're at it RIOT can you buff every MELEE Top Champion?

It shows his win rate back to 2014 and it looks like he hit 50.0 for one week in December 2015 but otherwise was 49% or lower the entire 2 years.","replies":[{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-03-14T02:32:41.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just really don't think that graph is accurate, I remember back when Darius/Gnar were the top 2 picks for top lane for the longest time in S6, shortly after the jugg rework\n\nAnd when Frozen Mallet + Cleaver synergized so well, Gnar players took Fervor of Battle and it was pretty broken for a bit...maybe your graph is right though, idk","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-03-13T03:09:14.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly didn't it substantially harder to win with Gnar after the past couple of nerfs, but then I have loads of games with him and don't fold like a player who bounces from one flavor of the  month to the other.\n\nThat said, I support the notion of gnar buffs, because it'll give me a reason to play him more often.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-03-13T03:12:17.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=IronwallJackson,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=JOErArqJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-03-13T03:09:14.521+0000)\n>\n> I honestly didn&#x27;t it substantially harder to win with Gnar after the past couple of nerfs, but then I have loads of games with him and don&#x27;t fold like a player who bounces from one flavor of the  month to the other.\n> \n> That said, I support the notion of gnar buffs, because it&#x27;ll give me a reason to play him more often.\n\nI've actually won every game with him this season that I've played. It doesn't change the fact that he's vastly underperforming though (and I've only picked him in to his most favourable matchups this season). \n\nWhat bugs me most is that Gnar is a tank-buster with range. The meta this season should be favouring him, and yet he's been at his weakest this entire season. He can farm safely against the range and harass heavy laners that were popular at first, and he can bust the tanks that have been popular since, and yet the whole time he's been weak. \n\nI don't even think he needs a big buff or anything. He just needs a small numbers buff.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-03-13T03:28:16.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving him back the damage he lost on his E would be a good start, I reckon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"qqpp","date":"2017-03-13T03:26:58.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar is just pretty team reliant for positioning.
