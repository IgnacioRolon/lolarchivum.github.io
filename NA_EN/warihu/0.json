A client that uses over 1gb of ram by itself? Really? Lmfao along with all of the other garbage issues that riot refuses to fix I find this halarious. To me personally I think that the games integrity and the ability to play the game properly waaaaaaaaay outranks making money off of new skins and champions yet you see all of these new skins and champions being pushed out and the client is still absolute garbage. I understand that there are 2 different departments for those things, but frankly.... The dept incharge of taking care of the client, fixing bugs, etc etc etc.... They aren't doing their job. Find someone who will. This is ridiculous. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Riot your client is garbage, fix it.

I was using an example of the fact that riot uses 2 separate executable files to use 1gb of ram roughly. There is no reason to have 2 separate executable files going at once when all you're wanting to do is play the game. Why is there 2 executable files running at all when there's supposed to be only 1 thing open?\nThis is simply 1 example of the many problems there are with the client. Not the only one. I'm not complaining about just this I'm complaining about all of the client issues as a whole. I didn't mean for everyone to read just that issue then go off telling me how I'm wrong and how I should be using a 64bit operating system the whole 9 yards. Truth be told I'm an IT technician I know all about the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit systems along with the advantages of using 64-bit over 32-bit. I don't need the lecture lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"johnsaucier","date":"2014-10-27T17:53:49.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I think your complaint is a little skewed and I'll point out why.  I'll say out of all possible complaints you sight the fact that the client uses 1GB of ram as your biggest? If this is truly the problem that drives you crazy than you have low standards my friend.\n\nSo to address this I'll say that unless you are living in 2001, most modern systems should be 64bit. This means that theoretically 2^64 bytes is the maximum amount of ram your system could address. Typical modern computers can address a fraction of that typically between 8 and 64GB. There is no reason why that a computer capable of running the game client cannot address this. Having said that, if it is 64bit it means that comparatively the 32bit client will take up more memory on a 64bit system than on a 32bit system because the pointers are doubled.\n\nThis tends to not really be an issue since the memory limitation is so high as to be virtually non-existant allowing you to simply add a maximum amount of ram to the system to support any application where more memory would be required.\n\nIt becomes more sketchy when addressing the same application in 32bit since the arbitrary limitation for an application under windows is 2GB with a maximum system limitation of 4GB of ram. But remember since those pointers are the native 32bit the application will take up half the space they would normally need. You should ask yourself why in 2014 you are using a 32bit version of windows when virtually every processor on the market supports 64bit, and there is no benefit to using it. (Or the real question might be why does Microsoft continue to release a 32bit version at all?)\n\nBasically there are a lot of issues with league of legends but its ram usage is not one of them. Yes the client has problems but are we talking about the pre-login launcher? The pre-game/post-login/chat client launcher? or the game-play client?\n\nI would agree the processes to do one thing is overkill, and that is a problem, and if that is what you are talking about I support it, but as far as complaining about ram usage in 2014 well that's just a non-issue. You have the wrong priorities.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-10-26T22:15:35.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're working on the client, but replacing a piece of software that integral to the game system won't happen overnight. :|","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-10-26T20:55:20.232+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree there client and servers are crap!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2014-10-26T21:47:22.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Serious question: How much space should it take up? How much would it take if you were to play Diablo 3? DOTA 2? Magicka? LoL pulls magic out their butts to make the game as efficient as it is. Diablo 3 and Magicka absolutely swamp my computer, but I can play League at 30fps.\n\nFurther, what specs do you run where that's even an issue? With a 4GB RAM *Mac* I'm OK as long as I close all other programs. 8GB and I only need to close Chrome. Windows is far more memory-efficient than OS X, so if it's a problem I can only conclude that you have a 2GB system. Spend $40 for a 4GB chip.","replies":[]}]}
