All chromas won't be available for BE. In the past, only chromas that are 6+ months ore more old would go on sale, and I believe that's the case here as well.  I'm catching up with our store team now regarding the messaging in the client 'cause I can see where the confusion may lie. \n\nBasically, the messaging is meant to imply 'hey, any chromas that are selected to be available for BE will be located here', as opposed to 'hey, all chromas are available for BE and you can find them here.'\n\nSorry for the confusion. ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Lorinne","date":"2017-11-09T00:20:46.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw, shucks. :<\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \n\nWell, thank you for the clarification.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-11-09T00:40:22.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. ;-; \n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-11-08T18:33:11.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they said ones that came out in the last 6 months were NOT going to be available with BE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-11-08T18:26:08.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think they meant by that was all the chromas you can get with blue essence are in this place.","replies":[]}]}
