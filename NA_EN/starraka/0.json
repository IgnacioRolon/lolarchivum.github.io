I throw my ball onto my teammates alot cause I play Ori support  =p. So i get the indicator pretty much every game. im guessing it has something to do with you dieing when your ball is on an ally cause the ghost indicator usually points towards where I had died.\r\n\r\nId post an image but idk how to take a picture of my screen nor do I have an imgur  =p","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-04-04T17:42:33.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanna take a pic of your screen, just his prnt scrn and then paste in ms paint or some equivalent.\n\nas for imgur, you don't need an account to upload an image, just drag an image from a folder to the imgur homepage, then select upload selection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-04T17:34:02.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Starraka! \n\nThanks for the report!
