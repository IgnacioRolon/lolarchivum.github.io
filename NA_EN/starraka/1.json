While we do have plans to update other splashes, they are a bit worse off in terms of quality, as compared to more current splash, which is why something like this wouldn't be prioritized at the time. \n\nFor a bit of context, it would take a bit more than an hour. :) In addition to hand editing the original PSD file, we also need to slice the image again for all loading screens, store cards, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-03-29T20:08:05.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could there ever be a time where you'd actually prioritize to go over splashes that could use very small adjustments?  Master Yi having an ENTIRELY different armor/clothes in his base splash has always been a pet peeve for me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-29T20:49:16.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a bit harder to say - I don't work directly with the team who works on updating all of the splashes. In a perfect world, yes.
