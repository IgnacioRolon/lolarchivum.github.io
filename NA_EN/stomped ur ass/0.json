I've been focusing a lot on split-pushing rather than team fighting. \r\nWhy don't I try to team fight a lot? Well, it is the luck of the draw. You either get players who know how to decently team fight or you get the players who get aced because they don't play it decently. I say the word \"decently\" because it is gold elo. It is an elo that doesn't represent a high level of play yet.\r\n\r\nI have not lost with my split-pushing strategy yet (started doing it 3 days ago). To be more specific, I have won 8 games out of 11 using this strategy. The 3 losses came from being unable to do the split pushing strategy. I'm not sure what other ways I can do to win a game at this elo. Like I said previously, it is the luck of the draw with team fights. \r\n\r\nChampions also have a lot to do with being able to win games. Cho'Gath, Sion (especially sion), Gragas, Nautilus (support), and Sejuani seem to be really OP in this elo. Those aren't my styles of game-play, so I don't like to play them. \r\n\r\nAnyway, what are other tips/strategies I can do to win games in this elo?","replies":[]}
