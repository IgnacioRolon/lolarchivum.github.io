They were a negative experience. They either fed, flamed, afk&#039;d, or a combo of the 3. I do not want, nor need that in my goddamn silver 3 games that I am trying to claw my way out of tooth and nail which is markedly difficult when every lane is 0-4 by 7 minutes every game.\r\n\r\nPlease, Riot. Make it so you have literally zero chance to be matched with blocked people. I don&#039;t care if I have to sit in queue for another 40 seconds. &#039;cos all the last two games have done is tilt me, make me flame a little (already on thin ice there), and lose me a bunch of LP I could have easily lost myself without the help of a single person just idly walking around the jungle all game and spamming people&#039;s death timers like some sort of low budget discovery channel documentary.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m trying to reform from my previous toxicity. Your system makes this very difficult when I&#039;m surrounded by it literally every match no matter how hard I try to get away from it. This includes; blocking people, reporting people, full muting entire games, and trying to positively shot call which usually leads to me being told to either kill myself, eat a bag of dicks, or any other colorful phrase you can imagine. This is **counterproductive.**","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-11T16:53:13.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People would just block \"bad players\" and abuse this system.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyr Thirku","date":"2018-07-11T16:56:51.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"This would aid in Riot's busted ass ELO system anyway. If someone plays exceptionally bad, there's no reason you should be FORCED to play with them ever again. There are millions of players.

You can't get reported for not cooperating. Ping and mute. Play music in the background and you'll be reformed from toxicity soon enough.\n\nI understand you're competitive and would love to play as if it's a team game but let's be honest, it's not a team game. People are going to play for themselves only and never coordinate as if it's LCS.\n\n\nIn shortness, hopefully the dumb block system actually works because I've played with previous blocked players as well right after the game I blocked them.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyr Thirku","date":"2018-07-11T16:54:54.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what just happened to me. :/ \n\nWorst bit is, I literally said like 3 things all game 'Sona please help' 'Sona you're not proving anything by being afk I was at least trying last game' and 'Jhin stop spamming' 'cos he and Rengar had some sort of scuffle in champ select and both were spamming insults at each other (Lovely low elo gameplay) before I ended up muting all of them and I got a 14 day suspension for it. :T\n\nThe previous game the worst thing I did was call Rammus ( The sona from that game) an idiot for never ganking bot lane despite them both being ridiculously immobile, and stealing kills from laners as a goddamn tank.","replies":[{"poster":"mærk","date":"2018-07-11T17:04:30.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... Riot will punish anyone regardless who they are if they're toxic and or show offense.\n\nMy only advice for you is to not care for people on this game. Just play for yourself, after all, you're the one behind your screen *not* theirs. Therefore just enjoy and reform by yourself, worst case if you try to cooperate at this point you'll be deem \"toxic\" because people will always hate that you're trying to communicate and orchestrate your team to maybe a victory.\n\nIf anything you should stop chatting (for your own safety) before they tilt you and get your account permanently banned.\n\n\nTrust me, League won't ever change in community but you, yourself can (considering you want to reform). Best of luck! I would also suggest you find other players to play with and start premade and or such, that way you get less toxic players. I'm sure there are tons of non-toxic players on the forums who'd love to play and help you reform.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
