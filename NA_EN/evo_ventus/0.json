I started with 2550ish, but dropped to 616ish\r\nThis is unfair as it acts as I spent double the amount of rp and i can't buy mafia jinx, another skin i wanted 2 get. I haven't used the skin yet, so if you could please refund or do something so i can get either my full amount of rp or have the amount im suppose to have","replies":[{"poster":"Hollymonster","date":"2014-12-26T18:24:14.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try relogging.  I see you were only charged for the skin once, so this is probably just a visual error.","replies":[]}]}
