Riot has in the past made changes to both colorblind more and the game as a whole to better support players with issues - but we will need to know exactly what you can’t distinguish to be able to offer advice.\n\nThe changes were specifically for Red-Green, the most common type\nAs far as blue-yellow goes, they would actually need to change skins as well as particle effects, and they aren't going to go that far\nAlso why most competitive games stick to a red/blue, green/purple, etc to make a stark enough difference that most colorblind people would be able to tell the difference\n\nWhich is weird because the guy who did a lot for Valve's art team, Moby Francke, knows how much visuals can affect gameplay\n\nIf you're wondering what he has to do with it he is a SENIOR ART DIRECTOR AT RIOT GAMES","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-12-29T02:55:50.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep in mind that they don't change things to make them \"look better\" - but they **will** change things when they have an impact on the visibility of game mechanics. As an example, health bars are changed with colorblind mode as they are potentially detrimental to the visibility of the game - in that they impact whether someone can distinguish between enemy and ally quickly using the health bar.\n\nI encourage you to make a list of the most problematic of these particle effects that are detrimental to you the most and include it in this post. It would also help discussion if you could include an example of how each would look to you - using a colorblind filter such as one online - and explain what you think you should be seeing but are unable to due to the color-blindness.\n\nKeep in mind also that as another poster said, the estimates of the number of affected people with this are around 0.01-0.02% of the population. While I'm all for accessibility to those who are abled differently, be it colorblindness, or physical or mental disability, there comes a point at which it is not feasible to implement sweeping changes for such a small proportion of the population - especially in something so *completely* unnecessary as one singular video game. Riot does their best - which is why I'm saying if you can provide logical, clear, and most importantly not too broad/sweeping changes that will assist the most, then Riot will likely consider them. They aren't going to disable/remove/completely recreate entire skin lines simply for this reason, however.","replies":[{"poster":"VonCesaw","date":"2019-12-29T04:15:37.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=rujitra,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WkGKIhhl,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-29T02:55:50.146+0000)\n>\n> Keep in mind that they don't change things to make them \"look better\" - but they **will** change things when they have an impact on the visibility of game mechanics.
