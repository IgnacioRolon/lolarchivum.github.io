Assassins are back, there are Swains and whatever else bot lane now, and in this &#039;early game early game&#039; meta, bot tower is focused much harder for that first tower bonus.\r\n\r\nPretty much more than ever, we need supports to have our back like 90% of the game. So, how do we accomplish this? Could you imagine being an ADC player where your support protects you and lets you do all your fancy plays? Amazing! ..... but How??????\r\n\r\nThe secret is.. \r\n\r\nShow them you appreciate them!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nTell her that was an epic heal. Compliment his zoning ability. Call them Madlife or some other professional support after they make an awesome play. Make your support look and feel good PUBLICLY (no emotes). You&#039;d be surprised how they stick to you like glue when you show them how much you appreciate them. Everybody needs a little love and recognition once in a while. I promise if you try this, you are going to notice a MAJOR difference with your supports, and probably your other teammates as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:leblanc-funny}}","replies":[{"poster":"Real Sexy Yoona","date":"2018-07-08T00:59:15.913+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":4,"body":"As a support main, I can function and peel my ADC without compliments- even when my ADC is being an asshole.

Adc often gets out because im sitting there and keeping myself stuck on them so the adc can get away.... but we may as well have just went through jung and went for the enemy mid laner and tower!\n\nSo i tend to leave both jerks and people who insist on just farming bott. Often times they are fed enough that they can 2v1, so i just let them be as i help out other lanes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Breezey Boy","date":"2018-07-08T02:39:19.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whenever my ADC is trash, I just roam to top and mid and support them instead, leaving my ADC alone.

You don't need to be **over the top positive** but at least treating me and my teammates like they exist and showing at least some basic amounts of support when something goes right or wrong will make life a lot more enjoyable for all of us.\n\n(I love reading that some of you leave your assigned marksman if they treat you like crap.
