If I was tackling her from scratch today the passive's the biggest thing I'd look at, I don't feel it's particularly hit the mark gameplay wise. It does have some useful power curve effects though, and I still like its thematic connection with Syndra's lore. Wouldn't want to put anything particularly complex there however, I feel Syndra's got about the right degree of difficulty/things to do in a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-09T23:37:25.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you guys were playtesting some changes to her passive before, but they got iceboxed because of the end of the season.

Would they feel cheated if they feel the need to max a spell first, but like the maxed effect of an other, or maybe they would feel compelled by the choice? Or maybe is just something that Syndra players would not like at all, but it would be interesting on another champion?\n\nI' m asking this because LoL, as well as many other mobas that allow you to rank up spells, try to sell the fantasy of being able to customize the personal character growth during the game; this however falls flat in many cases, both in LoL and in similar games: there is one spell that for your role or position is almost always optimal to max first, in some cases you are even bound to max something second. There are many obvious exceptions to this ( udyr says hi ) but is widely spread on many champions.\n\nAnd thing is, it is also widely accepted. \"What should i max first\" is an incredibly common question for starters.\nI am not sure if that a thing requires a \"fixing\" too, because it has its own merits.\nWith this idea I enforce this choice on a champion that somehow thematically fits well, but i am not quite sure if it can be considered valuable: it is, as i said, forced.\n\nThanks in any case :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-01-09T20:00:00.000+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was that during her beta test? she never had that after release.\n\n{{champion:134}} chan  would love the buffs <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sniperkaj","date":"2016-01-09T22:43:34.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about a very small knockback on her maxed W, similar to Ziggs satchel charge (but smaller OfC)?
