It made me chuckle and smile a few times. I think the video/shot choices at that part were great. \n\nOverall... I thought it was...\n\nhttp://imgur.com/M3GmJNo\n\nA couple of things to watch moving forward tho... \n\nThe text at the end goes over Jinx's face. It's a bit distracting. Bring the \"The\" down with the \"impossible\" and your golden.\n\nWatch the consistency with the fades and text. Jinx had her titles exiting and entering on a beat instantly, while Ekko's had a fade/wipe at the end (For bonus points, add an outline to text!)\n\nI would've also liked to see a bit more of Ekko as well towards the end, since the \"movie\" seemed to be about the both of them.\n\nOtherwise, neat idea! I think the songs were better this time around too ^^\n\nAlso Also, what program are you using to edit these? :3","replies":[{"poster":"obeejuan","date":"2016-01-06T09:48:51.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You for the tips!
