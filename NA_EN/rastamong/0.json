Also all stuff i had are from my NA account before being merged with Europe, which has the same creation information as this account.\r\n All my paypall stuff i did when i was still playing on NA so they are saying that it isn't associated with that account and don't know any longer what i need to do.. how can i solve this? I have about 50 heroes unlocked and feel like i am going 2 lose it all and i am not starting all over","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T22:06:50.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got your ticket pulled up, and it looks like the agent was able to help you get your account back already!
