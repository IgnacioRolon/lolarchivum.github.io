So here I am fallen victim to this elusive trappp (not that I don't like the hole Project, I love this project thingie &lt;3) but I I want to buy that Augment cache and I have the RP just on another account\r\n\r\nSooo I humbly ask that the masterminds within rito finds a way that I can gift myself an augment cache or better yet move my RP from one account to another.\r\n (if there's another place I should be posting this rather than here please do tell me)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-11T21:03:36.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No hextech content, such as hextech chests or augmented caches or fragments can be gifted. There's actually no guaranteed way to get another augmented cache fragment, as the chances are completely random as with all hextech crafting. So be aware that opening another augmented cache cannot guarantee you'll instantly get another fragment. \n\nAdditionally, RP balance cannot be transferred between accounts.\n\nCheck out our [Event Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210155266-PROJECT-DISRUPTION-FAQ) for complete deets.
