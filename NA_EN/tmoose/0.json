You take away our Institute of War, RETCON US, YOUR PLAYERS, FROM YOUR WORLD, and then give us summaries that barely describe the character and make champion bios this eyesore. Seriously, can't you make the font bigger? Reduce the page? Add silly concept drawings so it's not HERES LIKE, TWENTY WORDS AND A POT OF BLANK SPACE. Can we doodle on it at least?\n\nI get it. There's this grand design. But, take a step back from going I HAVE A PLAN I'M HANNIBAL SMITH and look at your playerbase. Look at how Lore Team's Grand Design is working.\n\nWe. Fucking. Hate. It.\n\nwe hate each champion is 3 lines of lore that does not convey the champion. \"Ammumu is a mummy. He is also very sad.\" Okay...uhm, anything else? Oh, I have to...go somewhere else to understand? What's next?\n\"Ahri is a fox turned kumiho. She eats livers.\" Because we all know someone will ignore the fact she doesn't eat livers, but eats LIFEFORCE. Why should I be worried that you'd ruin Ahri like that? \n\nKarma.\nTrundle.\nLet's throw Sejuani in there.\n\nNarrative has a track record of changing stories and ruining already great champions.

Look, many people have said just put the lore on the client while your tech issue is going on. Why is that impossible to do? Literally text is the easiest thing to do! \n\nJaredan, your way doesn't work. It is alienating your playerbase, and you're slowly eroding every ounce of fucking trust you had.

I understand people are frustrated with waiting and that they keep getting their hopes up--but let's face it. They're really just obsessed with consumer-entitlement and don't know what's going on behind the scenes so they throw huge fits because they don't see any real changes--even though the lore that has been provided in other places has been pretty significant.\n\nI think that honestly the easiest way to get these people off your guys' backs is to somehow consolidate the lore that is released with a champion's Q&A, teaser, comic, or announcement into one place because they seem to be upset that it takes a bit of time to find the information in these different places--and they would like more word fluff. \n\nFor instance, if this individual Tmoose had taken the time to look around, they would have discovered that Tahm Kench is a sort of demon-like being which feeds on the misery of others and is not particularly concerned with actual physical sustenance. He draws his energies from misery and inflicting the most that he possibly can. He also only possesses the form that he currently does because of how he has come to be viewed and understood by his victims and those that know of him. It would seem that he is an entity not unlike Pennywise from Stephen King's \"It\". They also would have found out that Tahm Kench has encountered all of the yordles in the League at some point and that they are listed as rivals--which would hint that certain elements may be revealed in the future about his interactions with them. Additionally, the sole ally listed for Tahm Kench is Aatrox which suggests that the pair are connected in some way; some have suggested that the two are connected by the pair's propensity for feeding off of energies produced by particular scenarios. It has also been confirmed that Twisted Fate is not the gypsy in question in the teaser for Tahm Kench--the teaser itself was an amazing way of delivering an understanding of what kind of persona Tahm Kench has, a valuable piece of lore in itself. \n\nIdk.
