I don't keep a word file full of things to copy and paste, as I believe everyone I respond to at least deserves to have their post read, and have their message hand written at the moment. Many of the posts here are the same things that come up frequently, so many of the potential solutions may seem a bit repeated here and there. It's quite interesting when something I've never seen before appears. Even if you give out slightly inaccurate information, you learn something new when you get corrected! You also often give them a chance to troubleshoot their issues before the poros arrive, and this gives them a better idea of what the issue may be, or even help them solve their issue sooner than expected.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2018-01-06T13:29:38.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that's not what I meant Kokua, but thank you.\n\nThe last ticket I made in October still mentioned that bumping the ticket would increase wait times, but the information above seems to change that.\n\nI am hoping they updated the first response Zenbot sends to people accordingly.\nAnd that they added that bit about not making duplicates.\n\nWas more asking about _when_ the change occurred.\n----------------------\nI noticed a while ago (many months) that you were helping to hold the fort with them, so I shifted over to Player Behaviour from here.\n\nThere are the Wardens and Mods who hang around of course, but after discussions we ultimately end up sending people to Player Support since they are the ones who actually have the power to address the issue.\n\nYou'll be seeing me a bit now since it seems some PB threads are being made here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-05T23:11:50.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, it looks like we noticed so suspicious activity on your account so we locked it as a protective measure.
