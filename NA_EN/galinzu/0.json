I have accepted everything, every rework, every f******d up meta, item or anything you could throw at me.Reworks even like Aatrox, that was literally killed after being neglected for 2-3 years.... {{champion:266}} \r\n\r\nI Would agree that Akali needed all the 49 nerfs/bugs/fixes she received since her rework.\r\nI Would happily agree if you would nerf Akali more because we know she is still very strong if in good player`s hands.\r\n\r\nBUT, HOW can you nerf her that way ??? \r\n\r\nWhat she needs is not what you want to do to her.... \r\nThe Problem with the champion right now is that at 2 items (gunblade + whatever) she can 1 Q> Auto with passive > 1 Q and still kill and adc or a squishy champion. The Changes you want to make will not fix that.\r\n\r\nHer Damage should be nerfed so she is not able to do that, but basically removing the usefullness of her W agains 100+ champions that CAN and WILL immobilize her is not the solution.\r\n\r\nAlso making her 150 second cooldown ultimate to a targeted ability considering thats the most CORE ability that makes AKALI the champion we know is just insane, making the R2 Dash Speed that slow, okay thats acceptable, but the R1 Target change should not be there.\r\n\r\nPS...\r\nI`m not an Akali main or akali onetrick or whatever, I play her from time to time and I can feel she is stronger than she should be, BUT that is not the way Dear Riot. \r\nI have never written on any board of forum ... but seeing these changes made me feel bad for all those people who have to suffer due to you`r neglect.","replies":[]}
