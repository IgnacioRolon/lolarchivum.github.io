If you aren't sure how to change your DNS, check out that step in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). \n\nIt might be worth checking through the other steps as well, or possibly switching to an ethernet cord during that install ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"MozzafiatoO","date":"2017-12-18T05:08:32.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My ISP connection score was 91/100","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2017-12-18T04:23:32.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on your connection.
