I've seen quite a few issues reported this morning for mac users, and I'm not totally sure what's going on yet.  There's a lot of good info here though!  To help troubleshoot this a bit, I'm curious if your config settings might be the cause of the screen no longer stretching.  To help rule out that possibility, try out config reset on your mac to restore your settings and in-game resolution to default:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues#mq2\n\nLet me know if this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Smexhy","date":"2017-06-30T10:18:59.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you figure out how to fix this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mpzwei","date":"2017-05-21T22:22:18.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried this and it still doesn't work, the game doesn't take up the full 1440x900 resolution screen","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnigmaticBlaze","date":"2017-05-04T04:05:11.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read this new thing you guys posted on the league league status:\nWe are aware of players experiencing crashing during game start.
