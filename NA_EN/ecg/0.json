Let me know me know at the bottom. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I liked the anime feel of the whole log in screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lil Peanut","date":"2016-10-07T22:17:24.429+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won't vote (due to clear potential bias, hehe), but I gotta say I love the screen too! I actually  animate login screens, but mostly for new champions+updates now... so it's always great seeing such an epic login screen from a skin event like this landing in my client all of a sudden!\n\nI couldn't login for about a song loop and a half...too good....{{summoner:3}} \nWe are glad you like it though! I'll pass on your praise :)\n\nPS: First time posting with red name finally, hope I am doing this right XD","replies":[{"poster":"Igotlazy","date":"2016-10-08T22:34:18.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was the Star Guardian Login made by a different team?
