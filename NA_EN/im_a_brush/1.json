I've posted several times in the last 4 months and it still hasn't changed. People have been complaining about this for at least 9 months, and this is all the advice we've been getting. Some of the people complaining have had theirs change, but mine hasn't, so hopefully you have better luck than me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-01T17:37:48.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can try to perform a re-sync request, but we can't force it through.  Meaning we can't expedite or provide an estimate for when an icon could be updated because we don't know.  I'm not a developer and not really sure why it can take longer than usual sometimes, but I believe it's something with the backend.  \n\nI've done a re-sync for you just in case, but I can't make any guarantees.  If you have any feedback, do let our boards devs know at the [Boards Feedback](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/site-feedback) section.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
