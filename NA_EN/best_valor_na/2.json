Your friend was playing Morgana in the support role, which lends itself to lower kill counts, farm, and so on. You were playing a ganking assassin with a high playrate, which means it's more difficult to achieve extraordinary performance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ruin Lance","date":"2016-05-31T05:16:04.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"it compares your score to other people's scores on the same champion in the same role","replies":[{"poster":"Paroe","date":"2016-05-31T05:17:29.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ruin Lance,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wGEn1L6u,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-31T05:16:04.912+0000)\n>\n> it compares your score to other people&#x27;s scores on the same champion in the same role\n\nthis 101%. the morgana did extremely well for a support compared to other support morganas.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2016-05-31T05:27:34.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a lot of reasons why you didn't get higher than a S-. The grade bases your score based off the average of what people in your region get with that champion, in that role. Since you are playing {{champion:76}} the average grade is generally higher since a lot of people play that champion, so usually the more popular of a champion/role you are playing, the harder it usually is (but not always).\n\nThe grade is based off a lot of things and not just your KDA. It grades also on your CS, and I think even towers destroyed, and wards placed/destroyed to. Your CS wasn't very high, which probably brought your score down quite a bit, though I can't see anything about wards/towers since you did not show or tell that information.\n\nAlso you are comparing your scores to the support. Remember that supports aren't usually getting high kills, or CS. So for this {{champion:25}} to have  the same amount of kills as the Mid and ADC probably raised it's score up quite a bit, though it's not all that matters for scores...Because I've gotten S ranks with {{champion:267}} with like 2 kills, 0 deaths and under 10 CS because my wards placed and assists were really high.\n\nAlso I think damage dealt is another factor with it, and since the Morgana was full AP, I could guess she had some really high amount of damage dealt to champions. And as for Gold earned...Morgana was also barely under you and had more gold than every else but you.\n\nSo basically for a tldr: Your damage dealt might of been low, you probably didn't clear to many wards or placed them and your cs wasn't above average but your KDA was so high that it boosted you up quite high on that alone (most likely). If you had more CS, then you might of gotten an S or S+.\n\nNot trying to sound like you did bad, because obviously you did very well but when comparing every score to the average Nidalee Jungle wasn't as high as the Morgana supports score to the average Morgana support.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-05-31T06:10:49.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it was too much work to post all the other stuff lol.

I think it's easier to get S ranks on shorter games but not to sure, at least for me personally I feel that I was more lucky with S ranks on shorter games. Probably because I'm not very good at farming (most likely because I  main'd support mostly for Season 3 and 4 and a decent part of Season 5) so I generally don't have really impressive CS scores, which might be a bit more forgiving on the grade for earlier games...though I don't know about that for sure.\n\nI feel they should reveal the general average or have an actual grading explanation to help people and make it easier to understand what exactly you need to focus mostly on to get an S rank. I guess back then they never bothered with it since S ranks didn't mean as much, because even if you don't get many S ranks you could of still gotten chests from friends..and back then you only needed 4 per month anyways for chests. But now that S ranks are really important if you want rank 6 and 7, I think we could use a better explanation or just a general guide for each champion.\n\nI guess you could just go to the champion.gg site and look at the stats for your champion in that role (for the ones that are there) and try to aim for higher than that since that is considered an average and use maybe 30 mins as a guess on average time. Though I don't know how close that is to the data Riot uses.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Emerald Fang","date":"2016-05-31T05:16:36.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. It's b/c more people play Nidalee jungle than Morgana Support.
