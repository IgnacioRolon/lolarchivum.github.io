But i've had a few games with/against rioters.\n\nRandomly played against a rioter in ascension mode. \nRandomly played against Riot Eh in a normal game a while back\nRecently played against Riot KateyKhaos in an aram not too long ago. I said \"Riot NiceBoardsLady\" but i bet over half the riot office has their all chat turned off. I remember she played leblanc, there was a bard on her team setting up some dank portals, and I was kassadin.\n\nI played in one of the one for alls that some of the rioters setup a while back. I've also randomly played with phreak because when he streams he often does games with viewers who get in his chat on league so i have it set to autojoin on startup.\n\nIt is nice to see a rioter every now and again in a random game as opposed to having a special game with them. If you think about it they must play the game a whole lot then. There are so many games going on at one time with even more players in them that the likelihood of chancing upon a rioter is very low, but it happens so i'm ok with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Valor NA","date":"2016-01-28T00:22:43.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh nice, youve played with alot of them.
