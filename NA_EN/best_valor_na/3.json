Everyone is literally pooping on Tanks right now. Have you watched LCS last night? I think it was Roccat vs Milenium, the moment when {{champion:202}}  used his ultimate, enemy {{champion:12}}  body guarded his team and he literally got chunked down to 20-30% of his HP even tho his HP bar was full before {{champion:202}} ultimate and yes, It was a single ability of an ADC. Can you imagine what would that ADC do to a 1800 HP assassin or a mage, even another ADC. I am not saying {{champion:202}}  is op, in fact, I consider him fine because he has his own pros and cons but so does {{champion:107}} , if he cant kill you or seriously cripple you once he uses his ultimate he's nothing but a melee squishy walking slice of a hairy meat and his ultimate have fairy long CD untill the very end of a game.\n\nSo, talking about tanks here, at this moment when game is all about raw damage is not something that should be considered as a valid point to prove how something is OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Bagguette","date":"2016-08-06T14:27:54.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate rengar because he burst you sooooooooooooo fast with 0 counterplay, at least kha'zix has some.","replies":[{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2016-08-06T15:18:05.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying such stupidity is unreall.

Literally the same reason bcause Talon and Akali are both in the same list with Rengar and I am kinda happy because of it.

Still, Ashe is a significant outlier in this case because she's not just \"Yolo queue weak, but coordinated strong\". She's strong in both fields. Like, CLEARLY strong in both fields, but because she doesn't do flashy solo queue montage stuff, people undermine her strength in the game. It's stupid, and GD acts like they're *so much better* than G&B.
