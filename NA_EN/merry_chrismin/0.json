I decided to do some testing to see if it wasn't on Riots side. I ping tested to Chicago and got 23 ping while simultaneously in game getting 35 ping. But I went further. I decided to ping test my router, www.google.com (because of the reliability) and play the game at the same time. I found the ping to my router wasn't affected whilst in game, ruling out it being my local connection. I found the ping to google to be unaffected by the game, ruling out it being my ISP. The only reasonable explanation left is that my connection to the server is screwy, Is this something that is known and is being worked on or am I going to have to play with shaky ping forever?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-28T01:35:20.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No records of server issues on this side! This is likely along your network routing to our servers, which is the most common cause for latency changes in-game. I recommend running a traceroute to **104.160.131.1** using the network app [WinMTR.](http://winmtr.net/) Running a trace for 5 minutes before exporting your results as text and pasting them into a reply would work best.\n\nLet me know if you have any issues completing this.","replies":[]}]}
