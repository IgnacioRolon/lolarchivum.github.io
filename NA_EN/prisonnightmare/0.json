I admit I was being toxic and there's no excuse for that, but I believe my punishment was way too severe given I had no previous punishments on this account, and I was honor level 3 before they reset me for this punishment.\r\n\r\nI was only given one game as evidence when they told me I was chat restricted.

Again, this was also the only game they showed as evidence as well, proving that this was a one time case. Shouldn't I have at least been given a warning or at most just give me a 1-3 chat restriction punishment? I don't know, maybe it was justified but I just wanted to see what you guys thought.

We just see very, _very_ few of them because permabans are almost always correctly placed. Not every time, but nearly so. The reason we see so few successful appeals is because Riot permabans almost no one for fear of false positives, so people who do manage to get banned have thoroughly earned it.

You might see three matches, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity.
