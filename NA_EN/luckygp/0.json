I'm not sure if you needed to download new client data before you played your game or not, but I don't think so. I remember the first time I booted up the new client I was able to download some replays that were played on the old client right away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-10T23:58:56.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Replays are currently being testing on the updated client, so the old client shouldn't save them.  Per the [replays ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/234965248-Replays-FAQ-Pro-Tips)guide, replays will also only work on the current patch so anything older won't be accessible.
