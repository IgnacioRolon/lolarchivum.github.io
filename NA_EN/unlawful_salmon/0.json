Ever since a patch ago(or a windows update ago) I've been suffering massive FPS dips that occur more and more as the game goes on. I usually get between 200 and 260 fps, but now it's around 130 and it drops to 40-0 constantly. Especially when the action heats up. I used to maintain 200-260 no matter how dicey things got in game. I've tried everything I've found online from using REGedit to disable game mode to messing with windows settings. Can I get perhaps a Red to help me out here? I can't play ranked anymore!
