On average she also beats Gankplank.\nOut of your list only Tryn and Nasus are actually beating her, but that's because one gets to press R and not die while 2 shotting her, and the other builds tank/lots of armor then 2 shots her. That's assuming you don't feed her early of course.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-03-20T15:24:58.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How gp can counter riven?
