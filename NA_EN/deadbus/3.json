System asked me about my experience in MOBA, and I choosed &quot;most experienced&quot;. \r\n\r\nEvery game I said to my teammates: &quot;I&#039;m smurf, we&#039;ll win!&quot; and get answers &quot;I&#039;m plat&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m smurf too&quot;. In result I get 10th level with one lose, get bored and moved my acc to EUW. I already forget how much time it needs to get 30 level. \r\n\r\nBut now I&#039;m thinking how new players feel themselves? Why system asks players about experience if I faced newbies anyway? \r\n\r\nI think there must be option to get 30 lev acc if you have one 30 lev acc already on any server. I understand there can be cheating (friend with 30 lev acc can create acc on another server, and give you login/password), and longer queies for 1-29 level players, because of lower density on this levels, but I think it more honest to know that you&#039;re facing 30 level players than face same players with 1 lev accs. And I don&#039;t think that newbies with 30 lev acc will be able to play.","replies":[{"poster":"SgtCrispy","date":"2015-04-26T15:24:53.285+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"The grind to level 30 is absolutely horrendous. Having no runes or masteries makes every champion feel powerless, and if you do well you get punished by getting matched against higher level players who auto win trades against you because they have more runes/masteries and the ridiculous amount of smurfing.\n\nRiot should just scrap the 1-30 experience.

The level grind forces people to at least put some basic time into the game, before they just jump into ranked. I know you can just jump into competitive in csgo, and people I know did it, because they don't care about csgo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-04-26T16:52:27.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only disagreement is that removing levels 1-29 would make the rune gap even more noticeable, unless there was something done in matchmaking to separate people with runes from people without.\nPersonally I think increasing the amount of xp you get per game would be a better route, you still get the separation but the grind wouldn't be as horrible.\nMaybe some number tweaks to the jungle in pre-lvl 30 games so that jungle is manageable without a full rune page.","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2015-04-26T17:19:34.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"May be it have to be a bundle? 30 level + some essential runes.
