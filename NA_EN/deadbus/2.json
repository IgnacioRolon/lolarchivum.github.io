Taric is too flashy and shiny, and this lights just confuses me - where ult, where shield, where heal. Is there way to make him clear and understandable?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-08-08T18:03:27.463+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are actually working on a system that will make Champions health bars outlined in yellow/gold when they are invulnerable. You can see this in the Ryze Champion spotlight. This should be out pretty soon and will go a long way to helping Tarics Ult and other Ults (like Kayle for example) easier to read.","replies":[{"poster":"dEAdbUs","date":"2016-08-15T18:22:31.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
