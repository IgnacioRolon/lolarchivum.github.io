These items have shit stats and you lose the powerful active of Talisman or Frost Queen's Claim (FotM is debatable).

FQC's active + more AP + extra ward charge + hp + reduced CD on all your actives > {{item:2301}} + {{item:3512}} or whatever.\n\nOnly times why I'd think the Eye is superior to FQC is if you're playing a mage support and you're using the extra slot for a luxury item such as {{item:3089}} or {{item:3116}} or whatever suits your champion. Or when it's VERY late game and you're somehow full build on the support and actually need the extra slot to give your team an edge.\n\nGames are shorter than they've ever been. Consequently, full build supports are rarer than they've ever been. The game pace itself makes {{item:2301}} and {{item:2302}} useless.
