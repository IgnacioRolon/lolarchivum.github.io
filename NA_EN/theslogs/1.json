And that&#039;s only in combat for two seconds. You can&#039;t see it either. Honestly some people probably couldn&#039;t even tell you what her passive is. It would be really cool to have her passive be more relevant. Or maybe add a part to it that says that phage does the full movespeed boost for her even though she is ranged.

It was not an interactive play-style , and was forcing many players to pick a wave-clear machine as good as her if they wanted a good farm. \n\nBefore this \"play-style\" nerf, her passive granted her 50 flat MS if she hit a champion in every stage of the game!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-11-18T22:03:09.373+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Gives her a lot of chasing power, though","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-11-19T09:20:07.840+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"When it comes to chasing power Vayne passive works by far better..
