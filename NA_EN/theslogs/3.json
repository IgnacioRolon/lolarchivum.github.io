The nexus turrets last 1 second longer than that... The nexus lasts just as long. Ever since, I've realized all games are like that. Don't feed or get fed, doesn't matter. Game is over in 25 minutes or less.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Woodsy2575","date":"2015-11-13T01:59:40.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":26,"body":"I like a game where you can't make massive mistakes, the cream really rises to the top this way","replies":[{"poster":"TheSlogs","date":"2015-11-13T02:00:47.255+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then maybe go play some game that takes like 5 minutes because I don't think people want to sit in 20-30 minute games where they were decided by that single bad decision/outplay that happened before 10 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Specter027","date":"2015-11-13T04:04:23.910+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me? \n\nBased on matchup or having a cautious opponent, your carries, even you yourself, might be stuck just farming while an enemy in another lane just destroys that lane before 6 minutes and takes tower before 9, snowballing out of control and proceeding to run around the map railroading your entire team. \n\nThey put in a bunch of comeback mechanics last year, this year they seem to be removing them - also nerfing teleport so you get less chance to make a cross map impact (though this summoner spell did need to be looked at do to its ubiquitousness and oppression it seemed to bring to botlane.)\n\nThere are games where I don't get a chance to do anything because botlane gave up a double kill at 4 minutes, there have been games where I get first blood on a carry jungle vs an enemy solo laner and it's GG from then on out. This snowball shit doesn't let the cream rise, it makes the game more random based on funky matchmaking and 'skill' is based on pick/ban, early game execution and exploiting matchups with hard counterpicks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2015-11-13T03:15:48.976+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I havn't had any OOHHHHH SHIETTTTT moments like I have had in the \"tank-meta\" cause all I expect is people 100-0 everyone everywhere NOT fun.... or exciting or strategically demanding....\n\nIt reminds me of how Rioters often referred to top lane brawls as \"wet noodle\" fights ignorantly. As unlike \"bot lane fights\" where its just \"Get Killed or Don't get Killed\" top lane fights demands a lot more strategically as you have to think steps on advance, minions, jungler, teleport, cooldowns, positioning, experience, purchases.","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2015-11-13T04:25:53.030+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked the wet noodle fights, even when I participated.  Watching Sion vs Nautilus was the most hilarious thing I've seen in a top lane matchup as well.  Both of them were laughing, both teams were laughing.
