His synergy is solid in a game with other people. There, he is an ok champion at best. But when you go duo with him, and you are in a skype call with your ADC? He is freaking outrageous. From the insane AoE stuns, to the coordinated invulnerable dives, you just can&#039;t compete with him.\r\n\r\nI especially fear for the competitive level. It happens all the time where teams will go straight for early level dives, especially in this meta. Now when Taric hits level six, the team can get an almost effortless dive, with no risks whatsoever. I mean in a normal game with average players, you will have to act swiftly to kill someone under turret and get out with the seemingly short invincibility. But on a pro team? That small window is enough to get a triple kill from a dive and get out of there without a sweat.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace for this is that he can get countered by  CC, and the fact that the mobility creep is getting more and more relevant.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nP.S. You need to nerf how fun he is and how annoying it is to spam his joke.

No wonder it's so expensive.\n* {{item:3110}} feels ok, it's not really that you can ballance an aura item perfectly.\n* {{item:3050}} need some changes. Marksmen can easy get to 60% crit and it's not that you can activate it on command. That stats are nice but the active just feels underwhelming right now.\n* {{item:2053}} not sure you still intend to make this viable for supports. But right now it's to expensive for that purpose.\n* {{item:3056}} has nice stats that supports really could use. But the active is so useless it's not even worth thinking about it. It would be a nice line for supports since {{item:3512}} can be a pretty intressting option. But lack of option can be a reason you wouldn't go for it. Taking risks is nice, but since taking a situational item is already risky I doubt I would take a risk 2 times in a row. The support role is just not designed for that. Better go ful AP Sona instead.\n* Etc...\n\nOveral it feels like armor itematisation is left in the dust for support.

The cooldown feels like the hugh weakness. Since your damage is much lower and your E is your only damage spell (not to mention waveclear like level 2 rush). You will strungle against counter what is perfectly fine.\n* Windspeaker's Blessing, resolve | Enchanter runes| {{item:3302}}  >> Etc\n   * Not tested yet\n* Windspeaker's Blessing, resolve | Enchanter runes| {{item:3301}}  >> Etc\n   * Not tested yet\n* Mastery points into Ferocity\n   * Not tested yet, but I don't think it will be worth up to the keystone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cressalia","date":"2016-04-22T03:48:42.632+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lrplQ28E,comment-id=000400000001,timestamp=2016-04-22T03:02:08.450+0000)\n>\n> That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a committed thing yet.

It would still be as effective for tower diving and surviving ganks, but at the same time, it would give the other team some counterplay during teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SammyTehJammy","date":"2016-04-22T15:38:33.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fighting him, he doesn't seem nearly as obnoxious as some champions do, he actually has some fun aspects and counter play to him. (Insert salt about Soraka and my own personal tilt-Karma here) But I don't think Taric is super op.\n\nOne thing I do think is a bit much is the healing. Similar to Soraka but a fighter. Max Q, start a fight and keep pressing Q for more heals and damage.\n\nMaybe just reduce the Q passive CD reduction to 3/4 seconds rather than 5. Being able to take 10 seconds off in what might as well be one auto attack is a bit much. Changing it to 3 or 4 is a huge reduction and already quite a large nerf but doesn't remove much of what you want new Taric to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nbd Itz Jacon","date":"2016-04-22T14:38:40.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone whose played both as and against Taric, I feel he's in a good state, but I don't think he's overpowered like pre 6.8 Ekko. There are lots of strengths and weaknesses to each of his abilities in his kit. I have found that his laning phase isn't the best compared to other supports. He tends to be irrelevant against high poke bot lanes and a lot of his lane threat comes from his e which has a long, predictable cast/charge up time. \n\nThe places where I do think he's too strong is the dive potential he has at 6 and his team fight interaction with his ult, but the 2.5 sec to cast it is definitely not hard to deal with in a game with everyone in a party. I've seen the ult help make game changing plays, but also fail super hard when the ulted target get bursted down. \n\nI think he's in a decent state, but could have some tweaking. Maybe nerfing the passive and q interaction would be a good spot without removing what he brings to the team fight and laning phase. Having the q potentially on a 3 second cooldown is really strong. Maybe make it reduce the cd by 4 or 3.5 sec with the passive empowered autos. Then the q would be on a5 sec cooldown and not be spammed as often. The mana costs are very on point, meaning that Glacial is definitely needed for long, drawn out team fights. And I think his defensive stats are in a good place early game. I haven't found Taric to be hard at killing before he gets some armor items. \n\nI think as the week progresses with Taric people will realize the way to beat him is shut him down early and work around the ult, like Bard, but way easier. Just some thoughts so he doesn't get overnerfed and not played again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zone of Endless","date":"2016-04-22T01:35:13.520+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"He'll get nerfed.
