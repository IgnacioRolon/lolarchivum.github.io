If you DON'T run into the bush, he gets away scott free, if you do, you die or have to back due to the poison damage, leaving you rather annoyed. It already does a lot of damage with just one tick. If he goes into a bush you don't know if he turned it off to conserve mana or not right now. You could say there's no CLARITY, which Riot basically said they wanted more of. Buffing Singed's poison trail because there suddenly IS clarity, is kinda silly imo. He's already super annoying to deal with even without the ridiculous bush tactics. If they DID wanna buff Singed because of adding clarity to his poison trail, they could buff his flip damage. At least that wouldn't be terribly oppressive. He doesn't need any more damage on his poison trail.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2017-01-21T03:22:08.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never said they have to buff his poison damage, just explained the argument that he should get some compensation in that case.\n\nSinged is actually kinda weird... they probably keep him the way he is because he has unique playstyle but that playstyle doesn't really feel satisfying for a Singed player imo. At least not for me, I play Singed because I like the character himself and being a mad chemist.\n\nI wish they would just rework him, giving him some tools to actually really make plays. His passive giving you health for mana is boring and doesn't change your playstyle at all. Most of the time you just run around as Singed with poison trail toggled on.\n\nIf they could rework him to match the fantasy of an alchemist, that would be great.

He's fun and freelo in low elo, but if you take a closer look he can't do much. \n\nPre 6 you can't gank most lanes except for bot, AS champs. Or if the enemy is almost diving.\nOnce you get some damage items (bloodrazor + botrk for me) you actually are pretty strong as long as you can aa them. But if someone has mobility they'll get away from you quite easily + you're really tanky yet so choosing to chase is risky. \n\nWhile Warwick keeps his identity as a champ that can chase you down, and they emphasized on that. And gave him the tools he needs.\n\nThey were also kinda limited with Warwick. He's the beginner jungler. For most people it's the first jungler they played, and they tried to keep that part of him. \n\nSinged:\nSinged isn't considered one of the beginner champs as far as i know, and he's quite unique.\nHe has an incredibly simple kit but i remember not being able to put it to use when i first started playing him, i actually gave up on him for a while. Then i found out i'm better at lane singed than proxy singed and i've been successful ever since. \nHowever singed can still do what he needs to do. You just have to figure out ways to use the kit. I guess you could look at high ranked players but i don't do that srry.\n\nHis passive while not the greatest, still gives 256 bonus hp with just his base mana. It also allows him to build items that only give mana. (i mean like the pocket sivir ult, Frozen heart, etc) and still get some more hp. \nAnd it is what it is PASSIVE, a passive doesn't have to be a minigame. it should be a little extra that helps your kit. Warwicks current passive is like that too and they modified it. (a change i really like). But it's still pretty passive. \nMaybe they could make it give less health but also make it give him resistances/AP/tenacity (only 1 of the 3 ofc).\nAlso change the tooltip so dumbasses finally realise his shield actually does something, smh.\n\nIf they limit it to some QoL changes to his abilities i'd be fine with it.\nflashy plays aren't his style anyway, imo.\n\nI'll admit tho, New splash arts.
