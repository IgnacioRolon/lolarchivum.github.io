It seems to me like there might be an issue with your configuration folder, so it's not saving or syncing to the server.  This can happen through manual modifications, or it simply just corrupt.  Your best bet would be to reset your config files to default:\n\n **Log into the game** then hop into **a custom game**. *Alt+Tab* out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named **Config**\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
