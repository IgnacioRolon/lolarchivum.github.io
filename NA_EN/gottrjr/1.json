How do I report that? if I am using the golden rule, then I wouldnt forget smite and hand my team  a loss. How can i report that?","replies":[{"poster":"Kadugen","date":"2017-12-08T17:16:25.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why doesn't riot allow you to select smite, if you forgot it, up until about 1 minute into the game? You have the mechanic in the game now to do it (spellbook), so the feature exists, it's just applying it to another scenario. Allow someone to switch a summoner to smite. Also, perhaps, allow someone to change a summoner away from smite (I've had games where people trolled me in champ select by not taking smite until the last 1 second, so I picked smite because I feared having yet another smiteless game.... then we had two smites).\n\nI've had at least 6 games where the jungler forgot smite. Just had one this morning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gottrjr","date":"2017-10-16T17:44:03.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is really hard to win a game without Smite and this is 100% Riots doing since they tied the JG item to smite. Objective security is really hard. Maybe there should be a warning before the game starts or something.... I mean I am trying to climb but auto losses for not bringing Smite do not seem fair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-16T01:41:22.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm not sure that is reportable. You're welcome to shoot us a ticket telling us how someone forgot to take smite, but overall there's not much to be done about someone making a bad choice or a mistake.","replies":[]}]}
