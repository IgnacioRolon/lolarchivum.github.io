Extremely mobile on mini, allowing for easy escapes from ganks.\nCan poke the enemy down and force him out of farm quite easily. If he has even a small lead he can snowball his lane and bring the pain to other lanes with careful rage management. If build with a decent amount of damage he can carry really hard with good ults into W into Q during team fights. Specially if he can land it on 3+ enemies. Mini Gnar is also scary on a team fight due to his poking/sieging potential before it starts and his W % max health damage while he builds his fury.\n\nNot a big fan of tanky junglers, so I can't give you solid advice.","replies":[{"poster":"willcutt","date":"2016-10-27T22:57:51.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plus if your against melee you can make them RQ with frozen mallet (which is a totally balanced please no Nerf rito kappa)","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-10-27T23:17:50.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:150}} \n{{item:3022}} {{item:3071}} \n\nWhat is a Darius?

He's a little susceptible to ganks so I take Exhaust on him and exhaust the jungler and run to turret. He's really slippery if you utilize your E when necessary, and he does a lot of damage and can be tanky if you build {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3022}}. He can definitely carry if he gets ahead, but it takes a lot of games to be really consistent on him. Even ArKaDaTa, a challenger Yasuo OTP on EUW with over 500 games of Ranked goes 1/9 when he smurfs in Gold. So yeah, it takes a lot to be good at Yasuo but once you are he can fit the criteria you want.\n\nAs for jungle, Shaco is somewhat of a risky pick in terms of safety but he does an absolute shit-ton of damage if you position right. He's not the best for being difficult to kill so primarily you want to make quick assassinations and picks, and in teamfights it's best if you clean up. Don't take my advice on Shaco to heart as I'm not any sort of Shaco main, but I do play him occasionally.\n\nOf course, it's ultimately all up to you and who you think fits your playstyle best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-10-27T22:18:51.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}} \ngreat jg, very hard to kill, still high damage, not very mobile tho~\nalso a great top","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2016-10-27T22:14:21.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say no more.\n\n{{champion:62}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-10-27T22:12:10.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unpaladin","date":"2016-10-27T22:11:19.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJaxJax","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chimp Joker","date":"2016-10-27T22:11:08.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/find-your-lunch-table-which-champs-are-friends","replies":[]},{"poster":"No flash no life","date":"2016-10-27T22:09:39.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my opinion tankiness and damage dealing shouldn't go together apart from extreme cases like 60-min {{champion:24}}  or {{champion:75}} , but anyway.\n\nThe best one that fits your criteria is {{champion:122}}. Very tanky (hopefully you'll build him as such), sustain in skirmishes and teamfights, and he **hurts**, like a lot, passively ignoring partial armor which syncs super well with {{item:3071}}, with a true damage dunk. Enemy team cannot ignore you because you'll blow them all up otherwise, but focusing you is a problem in itself since you're tanky and can heal back up with a simple Q. His obvious weakness, though, prevents him from succeeding in competitive plays: melee without any gap closer or hard cc. Be wary of top {{champion:150}} or {{champion:133}}; they will make you suffer.\n\nEdit: I realized I left out the mobility you asked for, but really, mobility, tankiness, and damage?
