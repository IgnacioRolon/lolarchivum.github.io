I used to have a 30-35 ping now 110-125 steady and i want to see if this issue can be resolved. League feels unplayable right now, im avoiding ranked because of this, its really frustrating. If anyone else is having the same issues as me as of late and have any ideas on a fix would be much appreciated. I've also been getting a black screen after champ select where i can just see peoples names and no splash arts, I do load in the game eventually, but later than usual. Im in the UK and my ISP is Virgin Media, I've used  trace route on googles two IPs (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) and the results look fine. Yes i know this isn't RIOT's league servers but they may help tackle if its my end and i struggle to see where the issue is my end.{{item:3070}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-15T21:52:27.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that's no good. Even a small ping increase can upset your gameplay if you're used to certain response times. It's good that you're avoiding ranked until we can get this straightened out as well, don't wanna be hurting that rank! \n\nOver the past couple days, there might have been an OS update or something that changed some of your network settings. Work through the steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) really quick, and test that in a custom game to see how it helps. If that doesn't smooth out that ping, try using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) to test for any packet loss and post a screenshot of the results here for me to see!","replies":[]}]}
