But the chest wasn't in my loot or automatically opened, which is not good to get the notification and not get the reward. Now the real kicker to all of this and why I'm kinda laughing at it, is that I'm honor level 5 and have been for a few days now. No idea if its a late reward or some weird bug, just putting it out there that it happened.","replies":[{"poster":"MICHEAL STARS","date":"2018-01-12T04:33:40.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why i reaching level 4 honor i not receive anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-15T04:25:32.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First up, those honor wards weren't deposited in your inventory. They were indeed automatically redeemed and applied to your account, so you'll be able to find it in your list of wards in champion select. Feel free to hop in a custom game and check for it! I did check, and your Honor 4 Ward has been added to your account already.\n\nAnother point, Honor ranks were locked at the same time as ranked tiers. Since you only reached Honor 5 on 11/10 (after the end of season) you wouldn't have gotten the rank 5 ward skin.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatCatEater","date":"2017-11-22T03:46:27.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes must have missed that haven't been playing as much as i used to, sorry bout that.
