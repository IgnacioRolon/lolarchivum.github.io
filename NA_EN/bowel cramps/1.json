I'm not sure about the direct cause, but I think it could be network related.  Restarting your client should fix up that error.","replies":[{"poster":"Bowel Cramps","date":"2017-11-26T08:56:57.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I got this bug when the client changed to the Blue Essence (think 7.22) every day I play and every day I check and am unable to access my emotes loadout. Was able to use my emotes while in games up until a week ago but now even those are inaccessible to me. Simply restarting is not the solution to fix my problem.\nthanks,\nBowel Cramps\n{{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bowel Cramps","date":"2017-11-28T01:49:18.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Up-date.
