My idea is that the charge should also work on large and epic monsters (Baron, Drake, Buffs, Skuttle, Gromp, Crimson Raptor etc.). Why? First, with beam charge time of 50 turrets will be a lot less effective for taking down objectives, while this should compensate it. Second, it may make jungle Heimer work, and this is something I really wanna try.
