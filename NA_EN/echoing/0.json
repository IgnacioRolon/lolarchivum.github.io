I don't know how they could have hyped up Yreal's martial prowlness in the set-up of the story without making it seem stupid that Yreal, a guy who cut down 10+ dudes in the Battle of Whatever-rock, gets taken out by a Draklorn, who loses to Ashe because he opted to strangle her instead of dark magic-ing it up. \n\nThe comic could have tried to angle his defeat more in the fact that he was old/aged and far from his youth? They could show a flashback right before Yreal's death when Ashe was like 4 or something and remarking how that was the first death she remembered, taken by Yreal's hand when she off collecting arrows off the battlefield or something and Yreal beats up 2-3 dudes without a sweat then offer Ashe some jerky.
