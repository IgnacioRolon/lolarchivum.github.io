My brother bought a RP Card in Germany which we don't have in Serbia, and I've tried activating it and it says ''Try again in a couple of minutes'' and I did, so I waited even longer and same thing popped up. There is this little thing in that box too it says ''If you see this multiple times contact support'' so I did contact support. Still waiting for respond tho. Money is a very big deal right now and I don't want to tell my brother he threw 10$ away, so I'm coming here to look for some help. If any Riot employee can look into this and kinda try and help me","replies":[{"poster":"wαlnuts","date":"2017-03-08T14:38:11.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there ive has the same problem .\nFirst wut country did u set in ur payment ?\nif ur in serbia u might wanna put germany cuz this is where ur brother bought it ?\nAnd u need an activation of the merchant to redeem it aswell .\n\nif that didnt work then sorry mate :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-05T00:57:49.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this issue is still happening, we'd like to help!
