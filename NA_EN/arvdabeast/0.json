If you get mad about it then it’s your fault you couldn’t win the game in the first place. Even if it takes the winner 30+ minutes to win they should be able to claim “ggez”. You think it’s toxic it’s not if someone thinks the game is easy than it is. Like shit if a diamond player comes to silver and wrecks everyone we all know that it was very easy for him/her to win the game. When you see a dominant sports team beat a weak team, you know it was a easy game for the dominant team. That’s just how things go. If something is easy for someone than they have the full right to express it. And if you say it is toxic if some says “ggez” after a 50+ minute game, what if it was really ez for them to win it’s just that they needed the 4 other people to actually do something to end the game. So yeah, fuck off you tilt-prone normies\nEDIT: wow you normies get tilted easily when someone is better than you lol get good yourself so people don’t tell you ggez\nEDIT 2: I personally only say ggez in all chat is when I win after the enemy team was toxic towards me or if they bmed in any way. So if they’re toxic to me, then I have the full right to make them suck it by saying one little phrase that you normies define as “toxic”\nEdit 3 (12/18/18) : jesus christ im looking back at this and regretting what i said","replies":[]}
