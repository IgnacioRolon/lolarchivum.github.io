I instantly panic and check my email, only to find an email that states the following:  \r\n\r\nHello Summoner, \r\n\r\nYour account: kirbyparks was banned due to the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client. We believe that all players should play on equal footing in an effort to promote competitive sportsmanship. You should be aware that modifying your League of Legends client is against the Terms of Use: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. We hope you can see that it is unsatisfying to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an advantage over others. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to dispute the actions taken against your account, you may contact us via this link: http://support.riotgames.com \r\n\r\nIm not sure what I had gotten banned for as I had only used the following programs:\r\nWooxy: Custom Skin installer\r\nMKLoL: Replay viewer and Jungle Timers i think. (which i had downloaded and rejected it because I was told you could get banned and it was confusing)\r\nSkin Preview: gave me the ability to download custom skins and riot skins to wear during the game, which only i could see and not other summoners.\r\nMOD Skin: Same thing as Skin preview but it had Spirit Guard Udyr on it which Skin Preview didn&#039;t have at the time.\r\nSkin Installer Ultimate: I only used this about 2 times and then stopped using it due to its buggyness and inconsistency.\r\n\r\nIf i log into my account right now, it says this:\r\n\r\nThis account has been permanently suspended. Please check the email address associated with your League of Legends account for additional details. \r\n\r\nA couple thing to mention was that Trick2g, a famous Udyr player, released several in-depth guides for Udyr. I watched them and spammed Udyr till I went on about a 7 win streak. At the time while i was obsessed with Udyr, i wanted a Spirit Guard Udyr skin badly. So I managed to download Mod Skin, Skin Preview, and MKLOL to find a skin i could use (The end product of the skin ended up being some rip off with missing particles). In the process I got a .rar file of Spirit Guard Udyr and downloaded it through Skin Installer Ultimate. For some reason, while Skin Installer Ultimate didnt run, the default skin for Udyr was changed to the same missing particle Udyr skin. Im not sure if this couldve affected something with the game files, causing me to get banned. \r\n\r\nI would like to know what caused my ban ( if it was one of the programs or the changing of udyrs default skin ), and if my ban could be uplifted once i removed the programs above and repaired my files to fix the Udyr default skin bug.\r\nThank you,\r\nKirbyparks\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nhttp://mobaskins.com/?p=2297                                   (Skin Preview)\r\nhttp://s.modskinlolna.com/Lib/?name=download      (MOD skin)\r\n\r\nP.S beware of the Mod Skin link, it has very loud music in the website and you can mute tab before it starts.","replies":[{"poster":"JlImm","date":"2016-05-18T02:10:36.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I also got banned, and the only app I used was \"skin preview\".

Our job is to make our players become happier when joining games. The custom tool from another individual or organization to act as a partner to help entice players to come to us more.

If you can not afford to buy and pay riots bills than you can just get banned is what they think and arguing with support does not get you anywhere.

While you clearly used programs that only affected your gameplay and not other players' riot permanly banned your account. On the other hand they do their best to relase broken skins (eg. headhunter nida,project ashe,iblitzcrank) with visuals that either affect the hitbox of the skillshots or are too distracting and confusing for a player to dodge or even make out which skill it is(see projects ashe's e and ult).Also this patch people are actually able to make graves have 0cd on e thus infinite ammo.Previous patch yasuo's ult bug  had him one of the strongest champs.And lets not forget the 0cd blade active hack and the NUMEROUS drop hacks that are still relevant till today.Riot will ban you for using custom skins and view it as scripting(yes you are banned for scripting) but cheaters are more than welcome to ruin everyone's experience .And ok let's say that it is moraly wrong to use such apps. HOW ABOUT A FUCKING WARNING ?Lastly lets  Look at those facts:\n*This post has been for 5 months..you rationally illustrated your points but no riot employee had the balls to state anything at all(because there is nothing to be said.Its just riot being afraid of losing money)\n*Riot states at the EULA that they can terminate your account at any given time(even if they have absolutely no reason to do so).Just another proof that they are douches who won't waste any opportunity eplxoiting your invested time and money(It is obvious that users of those programms don't affect riot's income at all.Even if you don't use those programms or even if you get banned i don't think you would remotely be close to waste any of your money to buy skins)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chriskopel","date":"2016-09-23T11:27:50.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got banned for using mk. it offers quick chat and jungle timers that were bannable at the time","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-09-19T10:15:01.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using game mods, addons, and other third party programs is ALWAYS A RISK and you use them AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is not allowed as people would just then use these programs to play as whatever skin they like, even if it only shows it to them alone and not anyone else in the match due to it cutting into their profits from actual skin/riot point sales.\n\nand if anyone tries to argue about \"omg riot so greedy they make so much money already\" well yeah they make money from skins that have LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ON ACTUAL GAMEPLAY and are not needed at all to play the game. they make money from selling these cosmetic skins because people want them, not because they're a charity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-08-22T12:44:48.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not really them but their automated systems that detected an alteration, and that alteration no matter what it was is still seen as an alteration to the client in some way even though it doesn't change gameplay, all the bot knew is that the client was changed by a 3rd party. that's why it's a use at your own risk type of thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mecha Ridley","date":"2016-08-14T08:01:30.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same 3days ago.
