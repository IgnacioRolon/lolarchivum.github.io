It's my personal go-to site for broad stats like pick rate and win rate in specific ranks.\n\n---\n\n1. Runes  \n2. In-Game Terms  \n3. Last Hitting  \n4. Lane Pushing  \n5. Warding\n   \n>#Wow, this is a lot of stuff, is League really this complicated?  \n\nYes and no, leaning a bit more to the no. Most of this stuff you'll learn simply by playing like I did. In a relatively painless and fast fashion even. However, some people learn differently and therefore may miss a few things. Last hitting, for example, wasn't something I really took seriously until I was almost 30! Don't be intimidated, I just wanted to lay everything out on the table so nothing's missed. Enjoy!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8koqhVq.jpg?2\n\n\nRunes are a way to subtly customize your playstyle of a champion. Each rune will give you a very small boost to a certain stat starting at level 1. You can find these by going to your profile and clicking on the ‘runes’ tab. You can buy runes and additional rune pages from the store.\n\nTier 1 runes are stupidly cheap, but you can easily get away without them until you get to level 20, where you can buy and use Tier 3 runes. Having a page full of Tier 3 runes can have varying effects on roles and champions, and I suggest saving up for these as soon as you’re able. A good rune page can run you almost 12K IP. Keep in mind as well that certain stats are more efficient on certain groups of runes. \n\n---\n\n**‘Marks’**, the red ones, are best for physical offensive stats like **A**ttack **D**amage (AD),  Armor penetration and Spell penetration\n\n**‘Seals’**, the yellow ones, are most efficient with non-magical defensive stats like Armor, Flat Health, Health Regen and Armor per level. \n\n**‘Glyphs’**, the blue ones, are specifically made for magical stats. So Magic Resist, Cooldown Reduction, **A**bility **P**ower (AP) are all efficient buys here.\n\n**’Quintessences’** are the core runes of a page. They’re big, they’re expensive and they can provide a noticeable amount of most any stat. Including stats not available on other rune groups like movement speed and time spent dead.\n\n---\n\nAs you can probably guess the best way to know what runes to buy is to know what stats to get, and that depends on where you want to go and what you want to do there. Keep experimenting and read a few guides if you want to get the most out of your rune purchases.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hsmeXQT.jpg?1\n\nThere are some terms that people use that have not been covered in the tutorial. And if you were like me when I started then you probably don't want to ask “wtf does that even mean” for fear of looking stupid. Well, don't worry, everyone's been there. Even if some won’t admit it.\n\n\n* **Gl hf** - Most important short speech text you can know. It means \"**G**ood **L**uck, **H**ave **F**un\". Be sure to say this at the start of any PvP game so you can show you are a good sport!  \n\n* **mia/ss** - mia is the classic call for \"missing in action\". While I suggest using the [smartping for 'enemy missing']( http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=35156161) if you see someone typing this then their lane is missing. \"ss\" has the same meaning although is much older and seen a lot less in this context. \n\n*  {{item:3153}}  **botrk** - Blade of the Ruined King  \n\n* {{item:3143}} **Omen, Randy’s** - Randuin’s Omen\n\n* {{item:3089}} **Rabby’s, Cap, Deathcap, The Hat** - Rabadon’s Deathcap \n\n* {{item:2049}} **SS** - Sightstone \n\n* {{item:2043}} **Pink** - Vision Ward \n\n* {{item:2004}} {{item:2003}} **Pots** - potions \n\n* {{item:3341}}  {{item:3340}} {{item:3363}}**Red, green, blue trink** - Sweeping Lens, Stealth Totem, and Farsight Orb respectively \n\n* **cs** - “Creep Score” is the term for how many last hits you have. This is a direct representation of how much gold you have, factoring in kills and assists as well. High cs is usually synonymous with a highly skilled player. Your cs can be seen at the very top-right of your screen, while everyone’s, including your opponent’s, can be seen from the score info page (tab). \n\n* **gank** - Is a term for when another lane or your jungle comes in to help, giving you a number advantage. Or inversely when it happens against you. \n\n* **cover** - This means another lane or a jungle is “covering your lane”. Meaning you if you had to recall or go to another lane for whatever reason they will be at your lane making sure your laning opponent does not damage your turret. \n\n* **peeling/peel** - This means team members using cc and damage to get an enemy off of another specific teammate. Usually reserved for your fragile high damage champions. \n\n* **ult** - Every champion has a 4th ability (hotkey R) that is considered their “ultimate ability”. Most champion’s ults are potentially game changing, so be sure to use it wisely as they logically have the longest cooldowns in most situations. \n\n* **AD** - **A**ttack **D**amage. Meaning physical damage. This stat affects abilities with orange numbers and your basic attacks. \n\n* **AP** - **A**bility **P**ower. Meaning magic damage. This stat affects abilities with green/teal numbers.  \n\n* **OP** - **O**ver**p**owered. Meaning unfair, not fun, etc.\n\n* **Face-checking** - This means you walked into a bush that did not have a ward, making you insanely vulnerable to an enemy that is waiting in ambush. This is *not* a good thing to do in most situations and should be avoided. Wards OP.\n\n* **invade** - This means your team is planning to walk into the enemy jungle and either wreak general havoc at lvl 1 or silently steal a buff, to be found out by the enemy jungle later. All invades will end up at either buff, as that is the end-goal of an invade.  \n\n* **collapse** - essentially pincer, it means to group on one location or target that happens to be close by multiple teammates. e.g. \"Collapse on the Vayne, she's out of position!\"\n\n* **care** - short for 'careful'. e.g. \"Care mid, Shaco\" = \"Careful mid-lane Shaco may be nearby\"    \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TrU6RWh.jpg?1\n\nI know the tutorial mentioned that getting the last hit on a minion, monster or champion will get you bonus gold. But I want to emphasize **how important of a skill this is**. More gold-->more items-->more kills-->more gold-->etc etc. No matter what lane you are in (with the exception of supports) you should last hit at almost any opportunity you can, while attempting to push your opponent off of your own minions to deny him/her/it gold, a concept known as **zoning**.\n\nA good thing to know is how to farm underneath your own turret, it will happen to you eventually. A big factor in this is how fast your turret kills minions.\n    \n* **Melee minions** will always take 3 shots from full health, making an auto attack after 2 shots is almost guaranteed to last hit.   \n\n* **Caster minions** take two shots from full, so a trick is to auto just before the *first* turret shot and finish with another after the *second*.\n\nKeep in mind your own minions will be ‘helping’ as well, making your job a bit harder.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CgAI1I5.jpg?2\n\nA common misconception is attacking minions will get you to the last hit faster and therefore means more money. While not entirely false there is the effect of \"pushing\" to consider. \"Pushing\" a lane means you kill the minions as fast as you can to get your minions to the enemy turret asap. This means possibly getting a turret, but also means putting yourself in a dangerous position for a gank as you are farther away from your own turret.  \n\n---\n\n*When to push*  \n\n---When you need to go back to base, but don't want your opponent to get to your own turret before you return.  \n---When you score a kill or two and can afford to be aggressive.  \n---When, for whatever reason, most of the opposing team is confirmed to be elsewhere in the map and you think you can get a turret uncontested.  \n\n---\n\n*When **not** to push*  \n\n---When you want to farm  \n---When the jungler or another opponent could be about to gank (mia)  \n---When you need to go help somewhere nearby.  \n---When you don't want to provoke a fight.\n\n---\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/zeHPT6X.jpg?2\n\nBy and far the single most important skill to know to help you and your team out, **wards are the most overpowered item in the game!** They can allow you to catch an opponent by themselves, or show you the entire team is waiting for you in the next bush, or let you land a skillshot you wouldn't have normally, or tell you they are taking Dragon or Baron.  \n\n####{{item:2044}} **Stealth (green) wards**\n\n>These wards last 3 minutes unless summoned by trinket, in which case that’s 2 minutes until lvl 9. You can only have 3 of these on the map at once, a 4th ward placed will replace the 1st if it’s still up. These wards will take 3 basic attacks to kill, no matter how much AD you have. They will be invisible after they are placed in about 2 seconds.\n\n####{{item:2043}} **Vision (pink) Ward**\n \n>This ward has “true vision” which means, just like turrets, these can see stealthed units. These include stealth champions, traps (Teemo shrooms, Shaco Boxes, for example) and also green wards. These wards however will **not be invisible themselves**, and I highly suggest to place these inside bushes to help protect them. These wards **are permanent until destroyed or replaced** and as such it is suggested to place these within your own jungle and ‘defensive’ areas so an enemy cannot simply attack it without consequence. These wards take 5 hits and a player can only have 1 out at a time, so max for a team is 5.\n\nAttached is a map with good warding spots and places to always try to get vision. High traffic areas like this are dangerous to walk into without vision so I suggest you place a green ward down just *before* a ward expires, *not* after. Wards are always situational so keep in mind where fighting is usually happening and also where you can place ward to keep an eye on assassins and others who can wreak havoc if you do not know where they are.\n\nThe map has generally good places to ward, but do not be afraid to place wards within lanes and less efficient bushes if you think there are or will be enemies in it. Face-checking has a very low chance of being a good life choice.\n\nhttp://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1391095289907/Wardlocations.png","replies":[{"poster":"Pvt Yong Tai","date":"2015-02-03T20:08:13.122+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never ever heard anyone ever in all of my 3000+ games of League, call Randuin's Omen \"Randy\" nor Rabadon's Deathcap \"Rabby/The Hat\".  \n\nAlso, you may want to add that when in forums, OP can also mean \"Original Poster\".  \n\nAside from that, everything I skimmed through seems pretty solid.

This is usually done when someone's very ahead in lane but doesn't want to or can't tower dive for a kill. It's really a form of hyper-pushing and very risky, only a few champions can do it even somewhat confidently. Singed being the most well-known.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2015-04-09T01:45:23.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jumping back in to have a look, here a few months later, I think it would be beneficial to have the link section at the end, a short description of who this guide is targetting, and adding a general advice section somewhere.\n\nSuch as:\n\n* \"You reveal the bush for a few seconds, if you use basic attacks from it.\"\n* \"Improving is about admitting your own mistakes and learning from it.\"\n* \"Kill stealing is about your view on the matter, you should be thankful that you both survived instead of turning it into a negative.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"50CrazyOwnz","date":"2015-03-29T15:30:16.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tip: don't blame your jungler for not ganking if your the one who is pushing. winning your lane you do it alone and there is this thing called wards buy it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"exiledFromBadmen","date":"2015-03-23T17:28:51.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think, Lolking should be added to the helpful links section.

Boy was I wrong! I'm not *BAD* at farming per se. But my map awareness and warding is bad, and I got ganked bottom lane a few times... That warding map was immensely helpful, and I've saved it to my desk top to make sure I look at it before games. Much, much, MUCH appreciated!","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUNAAANS HYDRAA","date":"2015-02-13T10:43:42.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wish Riot had directed me to this guide right off the bat to be honest.
