How and when does it occur? When typping? What does mean 'retained' and 'submitted' in your post?\n2. Does it happen when replying, posting thread or editing?\n\nAlso, some general system information could be eventually helpful:\n\n1. What browser are you using and on what system? Is there anything interesting about your environment?\n2. Are there any userscripts/userstyles affecting how the page is running?\n3. Do you have performance problens on the site?\n4.

When I go back to edit pic 1 shows up.\n\n>Does it happen when replying, posting thread or editing?\n\nAll of the above.\n\n>What browser are you using and on what system?

On campus, so heavy traffic on wireless.\n\n>Are there any userscripts/userstyles affecting how the page is running?\n\nFEK 3.0 (Tampermonkey included), Stylish, Adblock, QR Code translator, Avast\n\n>Do you have performance problens on the site?\n\nNone moreso than usual\n\n>Are there any errors in your console?
