At the time of my original post it had only happened once (I didn't happen to play Sejuani afterwards last night).  Anyhow, when I saw your post just now I figured I test a custom.  And sure enough the bug just occurred for me again in a custom game.  So it appears to be continuous.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-29T18:24:09.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the additional context!
