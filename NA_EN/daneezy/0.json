It's a part of the whole tact concept that the judgements of toxicity falls under. Like, I tend to inform people the moment I decide that I will be reporting them end of game, sometimes they shape up because of it and I retract my decision, it's more of a \"hey check yourself\" notice, if by the end of the game they continued down their wrong path I'll then request that others affected by the individual also report them. As long as things are approached with common sense in this regards it can not be construed as harrasment. In fact, even Riot has a team that will pull other members of the company aside and be like \"hey you done goofed, here's how we're gonna fix this situation\" (I know because I was interviewed for a position on the team, but that's besides the point.) However, in many cases players will go to far in this instead of maintaining a cordial balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-28T20:51:34.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In this instance it can be construed as harassment, In a regular circumstance as you put for your example you would be correct, but if you're harassing someone consistently for an entiregame without stopping at anypoint, asking for a report from everyone else while you were flaming a person just adds it on as harassment.\n\n\nEither way, it's subjective no matter how you try to argue about it.\n\n\nLike arguing about what's toxic and what's not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-07-28T21:13:45.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ctrl F\n %\n\nAaaand there we have it:\n\n>ikbennederlandss: fucking %%%\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb there and assume that's a homophobic slur hidden behind those %-signs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-28T21:08:52.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The log in general is fairly toxic, but perhaps not enough to earn an immediate 14 day ban... save for two comments which will definitely earn one every time.\n\nYou tell another player \"kys,\" which is shorthand for \"kill yourself.\" Encouraging another player to self harm is usually caused for an immediate 14-day ban.\n\nIn your second game you also use a homophobic slur.
