Some of the biggest factors are not just connection, but even the speed at which your hard drive can write files.  As long as you're not getting any errors, I suggest letting it process or else it could re-scan everything for corrupt files.  If your download rate seems exceedingly slow, you can check out our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and strengthen your connection.
