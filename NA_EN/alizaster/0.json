If money is involved then that&#039;s who we please, no wonder so many people are playing other games.  Enjoy your worlds, its great, I watch it too.  However, if you don&#039;t play like them, the game fucking sucks.  I played for 2 or 3 years and stopped in 2014.  I came back after that time, and now the game is horribly designed for the pros.  You guys used to be a company that cared about players.  Now its just income, that&#039;s fine all other corps do that.  You guys have become something that&#039;s not fun anymore.  You guys saved me from WoW but I might as well have stayed. I am not complaining that hard, all I want to know is, why is the majority of players discounted when it comes to balance?  sorry we don&#039;t make you money?","replies":[{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2016-08-04T17:16:16.764+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"because everything stomps in low elo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blumpkin Nation","date":"2016-08-04T17:13:25.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the answer is: because if they balanced around what we normies play like, the pros could easily exploit those changes.

On another note, if they didn't balance the champions around the pros then the pros would just abuse the balances made around the people that don't understand the game (majority of players) and they'd be even harder to climb against. It makes sense to balance around the people who have \"mastered\" the game. Think it through before you post.","replies":[]}]}
