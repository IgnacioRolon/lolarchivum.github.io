I was surprised but..after letting it download for a few minutes, it skipped to 2.5gb...let's hope it keeps skipping and it's only a small sized patch because I really hate these endless 6545454GB updates although all they did was add 3 skins, change some portraits and adjust some champions which looks like a sensible 300-500mb update at most..\n\nUPDATE: It looks like the 3gb number is a fake! It just keeps skipping and skipping, it's much smaller than it looks like.
