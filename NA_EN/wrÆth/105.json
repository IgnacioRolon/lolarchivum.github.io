This really ups his damage.  It's like {{champion:39}} actually.  Usually she builds {{item:3078}} then full tank.  However, {{champion:245}}'s cool down on Q the way it is allows him to abuse {{item:3078}} way better than her even.  She also doesn't have his AoE stun (her's is easier to land though) nor does she have the safety / mobility of his ultimate.  He also has a slow (his Q, passive, and W), percent health damage, a dash and blink.  {{champion:39}} does have a resetting Dash though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"18 NAKED COWB0YS","date":"2016-11-04T18:26:21.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because hes still broken as fuck with fervor and triforce.\n\nits ekko. he will never not be broken. riot has no idea hwo to truly balance him.","replies":[]}]}
