Because lethality is too strong, we now have a tank meta, and because of the tank meta (and other crit items/warlords) there becomes a need for crit adcs. It&#039;s stupid how you are allowed to completely botch laning phase than get that stupid fucking BC + GB + DB core and bam, magically you fuck over everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Zed genius","date":"2017-09-04T18:43:07.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality is so broken that it made a tank meta leading to an adc meta to such an extend that lethality champions aren't even played in most of the games{{sticker:vayne-pose}}","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-09-06T19:59:50.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it seems pretty logical to me.

Reason why we have so many tanks is because of Ardent Censer supports we have hyper carries. And hyper carries need protection from tanks. Lethality is countered by disengage supports, not by tanks. Also Lethality got nerfed in 7.14 hotfix and 7.15. Its not that popular anymore. It was broken for 2 days","replies":[]}]}
