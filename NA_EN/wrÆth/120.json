Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-06-23T13:58:28.009+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL DR:\n\nRemember the following rule:\n\n    At 50 Armor I should have 1100 HP\n    At 100 Armor I should have 1500 HP\n    At 150 Armor I should have 1900 HP\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wyg0ODz.png\n\nPlease have a look to the album:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/3qUe8\n\nI will only present the conclusions here, if you are interested by the calculations of the equilibrium curve, read this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAuUphj2IAt3QDk_WkfoVqydZ_e7cRCzpFewz9aubU8/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**General conclusions:**\n\n    When you are under the curve, buy health, when you are above the curve, buy armor or magic resist:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wyg0ODz.png\n\n    The previous conclusion DOES NOT depend on the AD / AP of your opponent. Even if this veigar has 1500 AP, if you have 70 MR and 1000 health you should buy health and not magic resist.\n\n    Before the lvl 10 it is more gold efficient to buy health, after the level 10 it is more gold efficient to buy armor or magic resist:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/W2SLkzF.png\n\n    Last Whisper and Void Staff move the equilibrium curve. But, against a Void Staff, buying Magic Resist on range champions is still a better option than buying health:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RdewlmT.png\n\n    Rammus gains a huge amount of Armor and MR from his W. Buying health on Rammus is way more efficient early game.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/irAKDrj.png\n\n    Cho'Gath (and Renekton in a different way) gains a lot of health from his R. At 6 stacks Cho is widely above the curve. Cho'Gath should NOT buy health. No Rod of Ages. No.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ZFOLCW.png\n\n    Malphite W bring him 40% bonus armor, and at lvl 18 he is above the curve. So late game armor is very gold efficient on him. But, early game, malphite should buy health before armor (before lvl 12):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HnRIF0d.png\n\n\nIf you disagree with one of my conclusions, or if you think I made a mistake somewhere, please tell me!\n\nAs many of you will point out: This is pure math outside of any real context. In game you won't be able to buy 66 HP for 110 gold. Every item comes with a mix of stat and a passive that must be considered.\n\nAbout the statement: \"health is always more gold efficient early\". This does not mean: \" build giant belt on Ahri 1st item\". Health pots are an excellent way to buy health early for champs that won't need that stat late. Don't forget that after lvl10 armor and mr are better than health. (Rammus still should buy health though)\n\nThe results hereby presented are a simplification of a very complex and situational problem. The calculations are based on the linearization of a non-linear problem between Physical and Magic dmg taken independently. In case the enemy team is hybrid, health becomes up to twice as important since it amplifies both Armor and Magic Resistance.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-06-23T16:15:41.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If you disagree with one of my conclusions, or if you think I made a mistake somewhere, please tell me!\n\nOutdated with new LW applying only to **Bonus** Armor. Also, a similar curve about Black Cleaver would be nice ;)\n\nBut that's very interesting already, thanks :)\n\nEDIT: also, not as important, but I'd be interesting in special cases for Leona/Braum.\n\nRe: Cho'Gath, sure you shouldn't buy RoA if you want to maximize your durability, but I still think it's a good item overall for him. Other options with AP+mana are somewhat limited, and even if the HP on RoA are not optimal, it's still better than no defense at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darfaller","date":"2016-06-23T15:38:34.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Too much math, too much statistics, I THOUGHT HIGH SCHOOL FINISHED FOR ME.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-06-23T12:41:24.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":14,"body":"...\nI can't fucking handle people on the boards\n\nYou build armor to defend against attack damage you build magic resist to defend against people who deal magic damage.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-06-23T12:48:16.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't handle people who don't thoroughly read through the article before commenting.

It also depends on the enemy composition, who's the biggest threat and so on.\n\nIn general, if you're playing a tank or bruiser, you'll want at least one armor, Mr, and a health item. The order that you build them in is 100% situational. Squisher champions aren't as dependent on defensive itemization to do their jobs, so for them you pick 1 or 2 items that help them stay alive and keep doing damage.\n\nTl;dr for tanky champions you want an even Balance of defenses before late game hits. For squishes you'll want at least one defensive item, but don't prioritize it unless you're behind AND it at least provides some dps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bleufromage","date":"2016-06-23T16:16:10.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't handle narrow minded people who think that there is always a yes/no question or an exact time or place to build x y or z.
