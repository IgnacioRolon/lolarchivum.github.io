Me and my friends are playing a game vs some other people, and everyone on my team is really bad except for the support. Everyone on the other team has about 1000+ games played and im assuming they are all at least gold. The only way i can see us winning is if i win lane so hard that i can carry their heavy asses to victory. My usual 1v9 champ is Fizz, but I'm afraid I'll get banned out. Pls halp.","replies":[{"poster":"S0LST0RMER","date":"2017-03-06T17:27:07.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-03-06T00:51:57.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many games is it?
