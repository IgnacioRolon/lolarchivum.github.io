He is stupid strong but not as forgiving if you make mistakes, were as a VI even if behind built as a tank can still be useful in game with her target-able ult and engage. any tank jungler who has utility in their kit such as {{champion:32}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:106}} can be viable based on tank stats and utility of their kits. {{champion:32}} is still one of the highest win rate junglers and he is cc heavy, simple kit, tank and has a good amount of burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-15T00:07:01.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd have to put my chips on Graves too.\nThe other two just aren't as versatile and Graves has great payoff and isn't punished as hard by specific enemy comps the way the other two can be.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-08-15T00:50:55.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about Vi?

Vi has plenty of playmaking ability with her Q and Ult.\nHowever, the idea with Vi is to know _when_ you should ult the carry and _when not to_.\nMost of that is learned through experience in teamfights.\n\nIf you truly believe that's all there is to Vi then I can say with confidence that she's not the right champ to fit your playstyle.
