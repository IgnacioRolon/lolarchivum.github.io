Trash talking is not ok, and this idea that it&#039;s harmless fun needs to stop.]\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not exactly a lawyer, but I&#039;m pretty sure encouraging someone to commit suicide, or carry out a crime is a crime in itself. \r\n\r\nBy the same rite, trying to test the mental limits of the players you are against is more than just a dick move. It&#039;s indirectly ruining the games of thousands of more players, including the one you are playing against, and is part of the reason this community is so toxic.\r\n\r\nBy intentionally tilting a player, you put them in a bad mood for that game, and every single one they play after it that day and maybe even the next. Now that they are in a bad mood, they are more likely to tilt the next game if they already haven&#039;t, putting other players they are playing with on tilt. On top of this, putting a player on tilt causes them to play worse for all of these games, making them much harder to win for the players who aren&#039;t.   This even further contributes to their tilt.\r\n\r\nNow these 4, or even 9 other players will go into their next games on tilt, with the same attitude. And the cycle continues.\r\n\r\nPeople blame toxicity on game length, or autofill, or the report system, but if we want to fix toxicity we have to start with one of the fundamental problems in this game.  \r\n\r\nCreating a community that is ok with, or even encourages trash talk that is &quot;harmless&quot; ruins the games of millions of players every year, and is one of the reasons this game has such a bad reputation.\r\n\r\nNow here&#039;s my story:\r\n\r\nI&#039;m considered a toxic player by the system. I&#039;ve had a chat restriction, but I&#039;m looking to reform. I&#039;ve noticed that leading up to my chat restriction, I had progressively grown more and more toxic without even realizing it. It isn&#039;t until now that I realize all the trash talk over the years eventually built up and I couldn&#039;t take it anymore. I am living proof that this is a problem. While I&#039;m not going to blame some of the things I&#039;ve said on the playerbase, I hope for change in the near future, or we will be all worse for it as a community. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-02-06T03:37:09.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think trash talking is making the game awful, i think it's the people who harass others and then call it trash talk are making the game awful.

Like in one game I recall with the funny role play, this enemy Nasus was on me like all the freaking time so I said, \"Nasus, I know you like chewing on my stuffed bear Tibbers, but there are other people on my team who would like some of your love and attention, go play with them.\"\n\nUsually when I engage in friendly banter like this, the enemy team responds positively and follows up with some other kind of role played response. He responded with something like \"but Tibbers has a squeaker in it!\"","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2018-02-08T23:42:00.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this is fine, but this isn't realistic or what happens.

Calling someone trash/garbage itself I think is toxic and I wouldn't call it trash talk... even though they are actually talking... and saying \"trash\".... you know what I mean lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-02-06T22:50:13.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think \"role play\" plays a big part in what's funny and entertaining chat between enemy players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-02-07T06:06:46.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I feel like there are some forms of trash talk that are acceptable, but they should at the very least be fun and entertaining to both parties involved, which is why I think talking \"in character\" is probably one of the few universal things I think that could be considered good trash talk.
