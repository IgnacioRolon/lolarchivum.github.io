I'm an ADC for my high school team and I need to learn the role, however I didn't want to ruin my rank. Now I can learn ADC without playing flex/norms and don't have to worry about dropping out of gold! Aside from occasional mismatches (low level/rank player in gold/high silver games) I've been really enjoying positional queuing so far. It seems that Riot always gets criticized for what they do wrong, but I think it's time we appreciate something they did right. Share your thoughts below!","replies":[]}
