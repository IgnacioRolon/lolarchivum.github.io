Korea is hands down  the greatest users of Viktor, and have consistently been the ones to pick him more often. \nA series of nerfs, both indirect and direct, have reduced Viktor to an almost unplayable champion in masters up and LCS/LCK. Even below, Viktor struggles. Sure, he has been picked a few times, but only by the \"gods\" of Viktor (such as Crown) and into certain matchups. \nFirstly, lets talk about the rylais nerf. Rylais has always been a core item on Viktor due to It's synergy with his e, q, and r. Ever since the removal of the stronger slow passive, Viktor's power has been substantially reduced.\nViktor once again took another massive hit when doran's passive stacking was removed. This forced Viktor into weird back timings, where he could easily be abused for the first 6 minutes or so before he got his first upgrade, since he would be lacking combat stats due to it's expensive price.\nThirdly was the nerf to his ultimate's movement speed. In combination with the nerf to rylais, it's very easy to simply walk out of chaos field, especially with the mobility of the assassins we will see in the upcoming assassin meta.\nWhich brings me on to probably the hardest hit to viktor, which is the buffs to lethality. In general, assassins can have a field day with Viktor due to his reliance on hitting his e and r to deal full burst damage. With the new duskblade/dirk rush, assassins can abuse his weak points in the game in which he lack items, and his ridiculous waveclear has since been overshadowed by buffs to other assassins waveclear, for example leblanc. And for others, his waveclear doesn't even matter. The whole idea of pushing in a wave is to deny cs and drain the other champions mana pool. A new meta midlane pick on the rise is Zed, who doesn't rely on mana, and is arguably one of the easiest champions to farm under tower with. \nOverall repeated nerfs have significantly reduced Viktor's potency as a pick.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-07-24T14:12:34.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah you can't dodge his E or his Q or his R which means he has to be weak.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-07-24T23:28:36.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"????? did you even read the full post\n\nMy main problem with Viktor is he is pigeonholed into this shitty, outdated build that is easily overshadowed by the new meta of lethality and pretty much every single other build order.","replies":[{"poster":"KoKoboto","date":"2017-07-24T23:40:20.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm just adding my thoughts to it as well.

When you combine his utterly terrible early game and the huge cost of first hextech core its impossible to buy it after 1 back and you absolutely MUST buy it after 1 back or you are fucking trash, literally a cannon minion.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-07-24T23:27:04.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I'm saying. After first back, 9/10 times you can't afford it unless your opponent is a literal fucking potato and allows you to free farm and the jungler never ganks (which in LCS, diamond+ on NA, and korea, never happens). Meanwhile the enemy zed for example can buy a serrated dirk or at the very LEAST a couple of long swords and maybe even a hexdrinker, and at that point the lane is pretty much over if the zed is half competent. The game for Viktor (at least at the highest level) is often decided by the first couple minutes before both midlaners back. This is why only players such as crown still play viktor. Their knowledge of how to play the lane and their mechanics are unrivaled, and therefore can gain a gold and cs advantage before their first back, allowing them to pick up the first hex core.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2017-07-24T14:26:02.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Viktor main, I agree with the points stated above.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-07-24T23:22:44.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even a viktor main, I he needs to be looked at considering his current power.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trashbagz","date":"2017-07-24T00:25:37.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"LethalTempo Jhin","date":"2017-07-24T10:34:08.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, never?","replies":[]}]}]}
