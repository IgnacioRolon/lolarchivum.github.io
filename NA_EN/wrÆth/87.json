Also your win % on him looks like less than 50%, meaning that you seem to be hurting your team more than not playing Zilean. I'm not trying to call you bad, but for real it seems like youre trying every match to build a super squishy AP build.\n\nHave you considered building some AP+HP items ever? It may help. I find {{item:3116}} is pretty good on him despite the delayed slow on his bombs with it.\n\nHonestly your match history with him is really polarized, you do really well, or do bad. That is how a support trying to build into an AP carry usually goes though. You get snowballing, or you get nothing. Trying the same build constantly against all opponents tends to do that to you also.\n\nAt least youre building a sight stone, so there is that.\n\nHonestly I think you could do much better than you are if you built more reactivly instead of trying to go full AP carry every match. Maybe a Zrot, or RCS, or even a Solari would be a good item. I think lack of flexibility hurt you in some of those matches.\n\nOK, I criticized you and called you out on false statements, initiate your rage upon me....
