I personally think that the problem is in ardent censer supports and the strength of blade of the ruined king. But if the rat must be nerfed, here&#039;s what I consider as a reasonable balance change.\n\nSo a lot of people were complaining about how much Twitch E is doing early. I really don&#039;t think that this is the issue. Look at this clip and skip to like 3:10.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaZWczt9F20\nNotice how Vayne horribly miss-stepped and ate a full stack twitch e. Now notice how much damage it did. Barely any. You could factor in the Janna shield, but that only blocked autos, and not the twitch e. Someone like a lucian could have done his full combo and half-healthed vayne. \nNow look at this clip and skip to 1:46.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFk93zESf-U\nNotice how if Twitch miss-steps, he can be punished very easily. Doublelift did not die, but that resulted in him being zoned off of a couple waves of cs, losing out on a ton of gold. He has no way to re position himself immediately, and his health is fairly low level 1: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions/Health\nNotice how Tristana has more health than him level 1 even though she has the longest range re-positioning tool of any adc in the game. \nBut apparently Twitch&#039;s e is overpowered. \nSo here&#039;s what a propose. \nHis attack speed, similarly to Caitlyn, should be lowered a bit. Currently his level 1 attack speed is 0.679. This should be lowered possibly to something more like .63 or something. Than, reduce his attack speed growth per level down from +3.38% to like 2.5%.\nI don&#039;t actually know how much this would affect his attack speed, but the general idea is to hit how easily he can apply stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"WorryWolfy","date":"2017-08-20T19:52:48.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although twitch is performing well we should actually buff him because he is objectively weak and it will show as league of legends becomes older, more clinical and better refined.","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-08-20T20:55:53.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch isnt really weak. Twitch is weak in his early game. but thats not what you pick twitch for. You pick twitch for his late game.\n\nThe proposed nerfs will weaken his Early game while keeping his late game intact. Now i do think the AS per level nerf is a little harsh. The concept of lowering early game stats is the way to go to make him more punishable in the early game.","replies":[{"poster":"WorryWolfy","date":"2017-08-20T20:57:58.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch is weak, objectively in the late game because of how squishy and unsafe he is.  Even if that unsafeness doesn't manifest itself right now, even at the Korean competitive level, (because people don't have a good damage / threat foresight of where twitch can be and give him good angles by standing in bad pockets).  Draven suffers from similar problems.   A good buff would be to give twitch 600 hp at level 18, or 2 giants belts and that would pull him in line with stronger adcs like ashe and corki.","replies":[{"poster":"Rewt","date":"2017-08-20T21:25:49.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are missing the main point here. Twitch isnt a standard ADC. He is an assassin. You are more of a flanking ADC. Not a standard back liner.","replies":[{"poster":"WorryWolfy","date":"2017-08-20T21:50:14.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Stealth can't actually give twitch these flanks and assassinations.  His angles of approach can be anticipated with better play and with time that will show.  Twitch needs buffs to be able to do what he is meant to do and is able to do now in early league of legends.  League of legends is still in it's infancy.  And Twitch just doesn't have what it takes to compete with other champions.  He should be buffed and players will adapt on their own","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-21T15:13:16.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point. Twitch is a bit like Olaf. Olaf thrived in competitive play because the junglers were not ready for him and unexpectant as to how to play against him. He exploited a clear weakness, even though he should never have been able to theoretically become a good jungler since he has no terrain scaling. Gnar is another example of this. He thrived in LCS because teams lacked communication and didn't call out when Gnar was tping, when he was about to go mega, where he was on the map, and other crucial information that allowed his teamfighting playstyle to thrive. Now teams have figured out that if you just wait out his mega, and are more aware about where he is on the map, than he can easily be beaten/","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The steam life","date":"2017-08-21T05:44:04.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'm gonna try to explain this to you there should be no compromise on twitch nerfs he and trist need to be nerfed heavily and putting some lame attack speed nerf isn't gonna do it. He has the 6th highest 0-25\nMinute win date for adc so clearly he isn't that weak early game so stop\n\nI'm sorry but if you want to keep your freelo champ try to play idk renekton or something","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-21T15:08:50.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever even played twitch before? And no, he's not my freelo champ. That would be Syndra.

It's the stealth on-top of a huge AS and MS steroid. And this clip is from early game, which is irrelevant unless the team is smart enough to constantly deny him CS until they're able to end. Don't even tell me to try and ward against him with my ONE pink ward in a team fight. That would do literally nothing to stop him. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything that could be done to remedy this without destroying Twitch's identity as the stealth rat.","replies":[]}]}
