First of all, I recently discovered how helpful the mute button is.\r\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/tdkx9be2XuHAs/giphy.gif\r\n\r\nBut seriously though, if someone says this, chances are you&#039;re gonna wanna mute them. They probably have nothing useful to say, and they might even end up putting you on tilt, which could lose you a  game.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you are this person please think of it from a different direction. Instead of &quot;fucking noobs, had to 2v1 me, fucking scrublords&quot;, i encourage you to think &quot;what did i do wrong myself?&quot;. Because i can garentee (see what i did there ;)  you, 9/10, if you got in a 2v1 or 3v1 or 4v1 or even 5v1, it was your own fault. Using this rule, we can apply it to a classic example situation. &quot;I got ganked. Noobs had to 2v1 me&quot;. Instead think, what did i personally do to get myself into that situation? In this case, you probably did 1 of 2 things, or a combination of both. You either \r\nA- Didn&#039;t ward properly \r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nB- Overextended, leaving yourself too far from your own tower to fall back if you got ganked\r\n\r\nLets try another situation. It&#039;s late game and you are behind on CS, so you go to farm a creep wave by yourself. Since the enemy has vision, you get shredded by them. Instead of the hypocritical belief that &quot;they had to 2v1 me just to kill me ? wowwww nuuubz&quot;, again, apply the phrase &quot;what did i do wrong?&quot;. In this case, it&#039;s late game, and at this point, most of your team should be grouped up, if not for 2 or 3 members gone to push a separate lane. Think about it from the enemies&#039; perspective. They are most likely pushing a lane, or in the jungle taking objectives, when suddenly they see you, isolated, by yourself, apart from the team, on the map. This is an easy kill, an easy 2v1 or 3v1 or 5v1 because you opened yourself up. You gave the enemies 2 things that equal to and easy kill.\r\n1.Vision and\r\n2. Isolation.\r\n\r\n             So in conclusion, next time you get 2v1d or 3v1d or 4v1d or 5v1d, think to yourself, &quot;What did i personally do wrong?&quot;. This mindset will help you better improve overall as a player, and will help you climb in the rankings. Also, don&#039;t be afraid of using the mute button. The mute button has the potential to win games. If you have someone putting you, and possibly your whole team on tilt, why not mute them? Your chances of winning increase by a lot.
