Now lets be real. Has any new champions actually been introduced to pro play? No. is Gragas no longer played in pro play? No. Have any new champions been played recently in pro play? No. Will shen no longer be played in pro play due to his absolute BUTCHERING of his kit? Probably not. So my question to you is, what the fuck is the point of these patches? If you want to really introduce new champions in to the competitive scene, you actually need to fucking buff them. Pro players get so locked into this one meta that it takes a COLOSSAL nerf or buff to actually introduce them to the scene or remove them. So if you really want to \"get new champions to be played  in competitive\" and remove some, then don't just fucking give them small nerfs or small buffs here and there. All that's going to do is make the really dominant champions even more dominant. And no riot, a 5% increase on lee sin's spell vamp most likely isn't going to bring him back in.","replies":[{"poster":"Guyy Fieri","date":"2016-09-08T22:06:38.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize most of the nerds were in patches 6.16-6.18 and I don't think we've really seen any play in any patch after 6.15 yet.
