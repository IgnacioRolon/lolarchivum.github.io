One week shes top pick in pro play, next shes cosplaying a literal fucking potato. I understand Rylai&#039;s nerf had something to do with it, but that can&#039;t be it. And what is her current state in your opinion? Feel like she&#039;s good in the right hands, but in general sucks. Also, what made her so strong?","replies":[{"poster":"Who is Taliyah","date":"2016-12-31T07:06:37.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her current state?\nPlayable, but only for Taliyah fans.

She is playable if you main her, that's the \"problem\" I guess?\nYou won't reach a 50% winrate if you just occasionally play her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2016-12-30T19:22:53.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they fucked up her W, buffed her when she was perfectly balanced because everyone was crying that she was \"weak\" just because she wasn't broken on release, then subsequently nerfed her down because of it.\n\nAnd I predicted every step of it too.\n\nSucks.\n\nShe is actually rather good.

Got buffed in 6.10 hotfix and 6.11 and was fine. Then 6.14 happened which made her too strong because her e-w (now w-e) was easier to land. Then they overnerfed the q bonus damage to minions(6.18), nerfed her ult cd (6.15 I think), and gutted her e-w damage (6.14 and 6.18). With the q buffs from the last few patches she's playable but pretty weak and also a lot less fun/satisfying to play imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-12-30T18:27:53.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"taliyah's actually good, peole just can't play her :I\nalso hi taz :3","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2016-12-30T20:07:07.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AgeOfTheMage,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MvjaIB6p,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-30T18:27:53.582+0000)\n>\n> taliyah&#x27;s actually good, peole just can&#x27;t play her :I\n> also hi taz :3\n\nlevel 6 Taliyah lover here and no she's not, Riot taking away her damage to minions, which is what made her Taliyah, was a huge mistake, they took away an essential part of her kit and now have no idea how to balance her, 50% was a bit overwhelming but removing it entirely was such a huge mistake. The only thing that REALLY sucks about her aside from her Q, is the fact that they changed her W to vector casting which just messes everything up and hasn't helped me out one bit since they changed it","replies":[]},{"poster":"dome025","date":"2016-12-30T18:43:55.044+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only thing I want for her is getting a buff on her mana cost (w and e are pretty high with both costing 110 mana at rank 5) after all the nerfs and changes she got. She was buffed too fast after her release, then her W-Cast got changed (despite the fact that the previous cast was better) and then she got several nerfs but no compensation buff. \n\nPs: I play Taliyah with: {{item:3020}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}}  \nThis build has quite a lot of mana because of rod but it still often feels like her costs are too high. The build has less damage than a build with void staff or another dmg item but I like it because of a good mix on utility/survivability and damage (flat magic penetration from boots and liandrys -> which gives extra damage based on the hp of the enemy).","replies":[]},{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-12-30T18:57:20.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sup age senpai","replies":[]}]}]}
