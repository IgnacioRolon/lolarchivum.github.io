Recently, i've been more and more intersted in picking up skarner jungle, and i have around 4750 ish ip saved. So to buy or not to buy ?","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2016-07-19T16:18:10.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skarner is pretty hit or miss atm as far as meta is concerned. He is at least a solid jungler for now. Im looking forward (as a previous skarner main) to when they actually rework him into something better.\n\nStill, I think he is a fun champ. Try him out on a free week then decide after that :)","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-07-19T16:35:34.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really want to wait till they make him free to play cause that might take a while, is there any other way ?","replies":[{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2016-07-19T17:48:42.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm... Well, then maybe watch some videos on youtube of people playing skarner. See if his playstyle is something you would like. Otherwise, just do it. Owning all champs is a good thing :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
