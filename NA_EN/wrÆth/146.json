To be completely honest I feel like this nerf is directed toward lcs which kind of pisses me off since it's quite frankly inconsiderate to everyone that plays him outside of competitive play (like, 90% of the player base). I mean why nerf him when you've maybe got junglers like *cough cough* hecarim still disguisingly over powered who are a whole lot easier to play. Idk I just feel like these nerfs were really unnecessary. Feel free to leave your thoughts below.","replies":[{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2016-08-14T14:47:18.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're fast approaching worlds, so that means the balance team is working almost exclusively to balance pro play. Gragas is very strong in pro play, so he gets the nerf bat pretty hard.\n\nOn the bright side, this may be the first year we don't have Lee Sin running around.","replies":[{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2016-08-14T15:09:48.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"somehow i doubt that lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OnlyGragasOnlyGG","date":"2016-08-14T14:01:39.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just start with the ult change then see","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-08-14T14:19:33.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kind of upset about the ult changes because now it makes it almost impossible to do your w>e>ult into q combo, which was already hard to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"jinxedchef","date":"2016-08-14T14:41:40.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that is the point.  They don't want any champ to have a combo that can 100-0 and has no counter play.  The changed ult gives the other player a half second chance to flash.  And before you say his combo doesn't 100-0, it chunks a lot and before the target landed from the knock back Gragas's teammates would finish the target.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-08-14T15:01:14.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has plenty of counter play. As a player laning against a Gragas or dueling them, when they see the barrel go down, that's a pretty obvious sign shits about to go down. That's when you back up out of body slam range, rinse and repeat, and next thing you know half his fucking mana is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"jinxedchef","date":"2016-08-14T15:11:00.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no counter play to the slam/flash/ult combo.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-08-14T15:21:38.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no counter play to an insec kick as well apart from destroying the ward before he hops to it","replies":[{"poster":"jinxedchef","date":"2016-08-14T16:45:57.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that is partly why Leesin's damage numbers are so low that he is running one of the lowest jungle win rates and isn't picked in competitive. \n\nBut you are still wrong.
