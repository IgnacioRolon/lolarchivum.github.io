Thanks!\n\nTwo completely different champs, but skarners in a better position atm. Sejuani's strong but completely team reliant and is can be counterjungled. She also has a bad early game. Skarner is a lot stronger than people think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chamuel85","date":"2016-07-19T12:58:44.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends.  \n\nSkarner is a juggernaut (so super hard to kill.  Great damage when you get in, but really no gap closer and can be kited).  He has his 'i choose you!' ultimate.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Sejuani.  She has good ganks pre-6 unlike Skarner, and her teamfight potential is top notch especially late game.  She won't put out the damage a Skarner will though.","replies":[]}]}
