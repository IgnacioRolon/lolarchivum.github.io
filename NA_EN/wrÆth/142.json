My prediction is that he&#039;s going to be played in the jungle and be really broken due to his ability to control his and the enemie&#039;s jungle, the same things that made lee broken. Imagine seeing talon show Bot, then 30 seconds later he&#039;s already top to gank or counter gank. Or you see him show top and your farming bot side, and next thing you know he&#039;s hopped over your wall while your doing blue and he smites for the steal. It just doesn&#039;t seem so that fair, and I feel like his mobility and map pressure will make him a highly contested pick. Please feel free to leave your own thoughts.","replies":[]}
