You're at 3.75/minute.

My guess is either low team participation (only 2 assists) or damage may be low.

CS (top, mid, and adc look for 75 per 10 min) \n\n2. K/D/A as a whole (different weights on kills+assists)\n\n3.  Objective participation. Dragon, towers, and Baron\n\n4.  Wards placed. The support is not the only person responsible for vision. \n\n5.  Character/lane. Your performance is compared to that of others in the position you are playing them.

I heard it's because then people will only play a certain way in order to meet those requirements, but at the end of the day, you have to play well to get one of those ranks but aren't most people playing because they want to do well already? I would certainly like some clarity on what the formula is for this because I'm a support main and one time I went 1/0/22 and I only got an A+. Someone even said that's literally what a sup should be doing. So how do I only get A+? I don't understand it, but whatever.","replies":[]}]}
