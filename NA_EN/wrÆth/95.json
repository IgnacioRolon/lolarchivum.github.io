INTENTIONAL FEEDING IS NOT GOING 6/10 ON GRAGAS MID. FEEDING IS **_IN-FUCKING-TENTIONAL_** . \r\n\r\nWow who woulda fucking guessed.  Seems obvious enough, but you would be surprised how many people are still unaware of this. Usually, if a player is not doing well, they are generally on tilt. Shouting in all caps to everyone in the game to \"REPORT FOR INTEIONTAL FEDIN?G wejmromweg OMFG\" DOES NOT HELP. In fact, sometimes it can put them EVEN MORE ON TILT. I've personally witnessed this LOSE GAMES. So please, if you're a person who does this, kindly stop.","replies":[]}
