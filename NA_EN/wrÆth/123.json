Literally every other assassin in the game has to snowball (which is admittedly very easy in this meta) to get things going, but Pyke just mitigates this entirely. He barely needs an item to function, is still incredibly useful when behind, can solo carry games when ahead, and is an absolute fucking nightmare to lane against. Like seriously. I can&#039;t name a single other champion in this game that can MISS HOOK, run INTO YOUR MINION WAVE, press E and STILL end up winning the trade. And by some fucking miracle if he doesn&#039;t, than he just runs away for like 5 seconds and half the damage he just took is gone. What even. I thought the one thing that was supposed to balance assassin was that they needed gold to function, but Pyke is literally designed to function on low econ. I guess if anything I just want him to be punished more for missing hook at the very least. Like he shouldn&#039;t still be so threatening if he misses his main pick tool, but he just is because E is such a scary engage tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Lemonfaace","date":"2018-12-25T04:21:52.900+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":3,"body":"Agreed.

His winrate in Bronze and Iron is 49.5% at a 15% pick rate, and just for a future reference, his banrate is 46% there, while in Diamond, he has 49% wr as well, just 11.% pr and just close to 30% br, that kinda doesn't show \"mediocre champion\" to me. \n\nNow, considering a few things, let's analize the situation:\n- High skill cap champions with high playrate should should have quite the low winrate considering they are hard to master. 10%+ pr depending on rank is a decently high amount considering between 3 and 5% is what everyone agrees to be a healthy pr, so his wr is quite high for his pr.\n- High pr should also corelate to low wr because more people 1st time the champ, but again, Zed's winrate isn't low, it's actually high for his pr.\n- This last thing is coming from the boards, not my own opinion, but accordion to the boards, high ban rates deflate winrate because said champion is only played against champions that can deal with him easier, so if that's true, then Zed is quite strong.\n\nThe boards made that ban statement towards Akali who has like a 43% wr with a decently high ban rate, yet people still cried she was overpowered, so Zed having both high pickrate, high winrate for his pickrate, and high ban rate should actually show that he's strong, not mediocre.","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomSpirit101","date":"2018-12-25T10:13:41.784+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"As I said, I hate Zed, I'm sure we can agree on that, I just don't agree with your judgement on his balance.\n\nYou mentioned his WR being 49% which IMO is alright for a champion with what.. 11% pick rate?

However, the statistics you provided shows against that as his WR and PR is lower.\n\nLets also talk about the low elo statistics, where obviously there is probably more first time Zeds. However you also have to take into account that many low elo players struggle to play against Zed as they simply don't understand how his kit works. Zed has a higher PR in Low because he works better there. Like all assassins, he capitalizes on mistakes, which low elo players tend to show. So even if you are generally new to Zed, if you know the basics you could theoretically work with him.

He can kill somebody then just recover. He can run away then just recover. He can trade then recover. All of this while building no recovery items or ls. This makes him too durable.\n\nAll of the above leaves little counterplay except to basically CC & burst him. You can't poke him out due to sustain.
