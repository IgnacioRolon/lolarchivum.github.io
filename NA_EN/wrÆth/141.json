I just get shit on in lane and can&#039;t do anything unless I snowball really really hard. I&#039;ve tried Cassiopeia, every adc imaginable, dankplank, and much more, but still almost never do well on them. With these late game carry type champions, i either get shit on and feed really hard, or i snowball out of control and solo carry. So why do people play these types of champions if they are so risk reward? And how do you play them?","replies":[{"poster":"Danjeng","date":"2016-11-03T01:42:03.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are probably accustomed to being an aggressive laner. Remember to focus more on farm (Cassiopeia needs to stack that tear) to scale well later.\n\nThey aren't risky. It's the opposite, mainly a farm fest. \n\nEdit: I saw your game stats. 169 CS by 41 minutes is terrible. Not trying to attack you with mean words, but you have to step up your CS game.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-11-03T09:58:49.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my cs is pretty terrible. I can play the lane pretty well as long as im not against something too oppressive (yasuo, zed, most assassins) then come mid game I have no idea what to do, so I try and make roams and plays instead of just sitting mid all game, and since all late game champions can't really do anything mid game, I usually just feed off my roams.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-03T01:08:06.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm probably the opposite. \n\n I dislike playing lane-bullies and prefer playing champions with a strong mid- and late-game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XinCrin","date":"2016-11-03T01:02:03.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a emphasis on the early game right now so I would avoid a late game team comp.
