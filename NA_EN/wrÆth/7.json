There are always going to be broken champs in a game mode with largely reduced cooldowns (champions dependant on CDR). Just be glad that this isn't in ranked. Also, keep in mind, there are muchhhh more pressing issues Riot has to be addressing than game balance in a gamemode that comes around once in a blue moon.","replies":[{"poster":"Findethel","date":"2016-09-24T16:31:41.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed, such is the terrible beauty of 80% CD-R on maokai.... Much to my dismay, the All Random champ selector seems to be broken and you still only see the samw ~20 champs over and over and over...... AND you don't get to choose who you want to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dont be mad nub","date":"2016-09-24T18:32:55.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Other than that all the little wussies and pusses that queue together are all toxic also, I mean I don't get why children can't understand the difference between casually talking compared to advise and trash talking or flaming. One advise to someone = Flaming to the garbage community. Get off your high horse and learn to take an advise people. So far all the duo's trio's etc i've played against and with since AR-URF came out are all toxic crybabies. Like wow stroke each other more why don't you losers. And yes I am pretty toxic and annoyed of the bahavior","replies":[]}]}
