I don&#039;t understand why though, cause theoretically rumble is supposed to be one of the strongest early game top laners and yasuo is supposed to be one of the weakest early game top laners. I tried my best to scrap shield at 35-30 heat so i could get in danger zone, then harass him with my q, but he just knocked me up and shitted on me anime-teen angst- yasuo style. So how does one outplay yasuo in the laning phase as rumble?","replies":[{"poster":"karruck","date":"2016-07-05T13:53:58.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm\n\n\n\ntrade{{champion:68}}  for{{champion:78}}","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-07-05T13:55:04.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you last hit with poppy ?","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-07-05T14:02:15.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bop 'em with your hammer.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-07-05T14:03:06.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like those wack-a-mole arcade games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-07-05T16:36:29.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play rumble so bare with me... But your flamethrower should go through windwall so deal with him that way, early game overheat autos can hurt so long term trades are beneficial against yasuo. if hes dashing around alot get rylais early so when he isn't dashing he gets destroyed, also use harpoons to pop his passive or force windwall, when he uses it shield up to him and burn him. \n\nAnother tip is instead of dashing when you have low heat but to do the opposite and dash in and overheat when you use the flamethrower that what you can auto while burning him and dish out a lot of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caítlyn","date":"2016-07-05T13:56:04.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spam all your buttons?

Windwall blocks everything you have besides auto's plus his dash gives him an easy dodge from your tazer things (I don't play or play against rumble too much) and the flame spitter.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
