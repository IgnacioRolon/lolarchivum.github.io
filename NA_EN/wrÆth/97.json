It was kind of annoying because the Kayn rage afkd, and we lost a game that was probably already lost, but we still had a decent chance of coming back.\n\nThe second game was one of the most aggravating games to play through in my LoL experience. I was the better midlaner all game. I ended the game with around 20 cs over my opponent, near perfect 10 cs per minute, 3/0/1 vs a counter pick, and an item or so ahead.  Our jungler was also fed on shyvana, and although botlane was feeding, I was confident i could carry late game fights. However, our  gnar ended up afking 4 minutes in, leaving no possibility of remake. Garen was allowed to splitpush top all game, and we ended up losing because of the pressure advantage. Botlane, having already won a tower, just grouped mid, and we couldnt defend top and mid tower being a man down.\n\nIt's so frustrating having to play out a 15 minute game as a 3/0 midlaner with perfect cs knowing that either way you automatically lose, even though you were better in every aspect.\n\nSilver 4, 0 lp later after 2 free wins, I can say that I&#039;m quite frustrated with this game right now.\n\nI know that eventually I will climb past this no matter how long it takes, but everything I did today (getting out of silver 5) now feels like a complete waste because 2 people decided to ruin my games.","replies":[]}
