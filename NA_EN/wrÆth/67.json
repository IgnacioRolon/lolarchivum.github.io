I have no idea what I'm doing half the time macro wise, and I rely almost entirely on my mechanics. The other day someone accused me of using macros. \r\nSo my question is, how would someone actually know if a player is using macros. I don't want to get banned because some player says my ward hops are too fast to be real. I swear, I don't use any type of macros. Just fast finger movement and 50 ping. Could I actually get banned for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2017-07-04T18:52:27.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"instant perma ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Vader","date":"2017-07-04T18:40:26.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're not using any third party program then why worry.
