You could argue that trackers was taken too often on junglers in competitive, but challenging and chilling had their places respectively in solo que, even if challenging was more popular. Now with trackers removed literally EVERY SINGLE JUNGLER IN THE GAME TAKES CHALLENGING SMITE.\r\n\r\nEven champions that challenging smite makes no fucking sense on like gragas or hecarim take it purely because of the fact that it is the only viable option left. \r\n\r\nSo if the idea behind removing trackers was to increase smite diversity, riot failed at that and ended up creating a challenging smite dominated jungle meta. \r\n\r\nVision creep only started to become an issue as of the addition of zombie ward, which eventually caused the removal of trackers knife and sightstone. However, in doing so, Riot made champions like Lee sin and Jax much less fun to play and in turn they had to buff Lee&#039;s numbers to make him another stat ball champ because he will never again be mobile enough to make the same plays.\r\n\r\nIf the reason zombie ward isn&#039;t being removed is because Riot thinks that it is an interesting concept, literally no one thinks that zombie ward is fun to play with or against. It feels unrewarding and braindead to use, but you can&#039;t take ghost poro or eyeball collection because zombie ward is just too good.\r\n\r\nIf riot thinks that vision is too good, then remove zombie ward, rework it, and buff up and add new ways of removing vision. \r\n\r\nInstead of removing healthy items that were made unhealthy as a result of an unhealthy rune, remove and rework the rune instead like you did for mirror shell and iron skin. \r\n\r\nThis has happened too many times where riot hits everything but the actual problem and in the process kills the fun of other champs.","replies":[{"poster":"thefourtysn","date":"2018-03-30T04:26:49.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Interesting point, but removing the wards added a great diversity to new champs to play. It's basically a little nerf towards Lee Sin since he has always been shining. This makes players more cautious when placing a ward because it's limited. As I said this brings back the old Lee Sin, where he builds sightstone. I can see where you're going but you're not thinking out of the box.
