At this point, Zed was like 10/0 and pretty unstoppable. Zed showed top so I went to shove mid, but he showed up sooner than I expected (I thought he would recall).\r\nLast time people told me I did too much editing, so I held back a bit. Keep in mind my computer is not so great so the quality is not as good as I would like it to be.\r\n\r\nAnyways, enjoy!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOcItgyv1h0","replies":[]}
