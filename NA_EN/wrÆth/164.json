Good build for her like all champs she be insane but for a day to day match I yet to be over powered by a cam yet I seen Nightblur match with cam and as usual she's one those that can wipe a entire group out the weakness that atleast one person has said to me is she has bad time with Ad champs each game I played against her or with her she either fed or not so much tribute yet most still learning her I don't think deleteling her be a good ideal that be like saying delete all the other op champs who go unnoticed 99% time anyway","replies":[]}]}
