I need someone to save up for (ip ofc). I main jungler, so obviously i want a jungler. I like to farm up a lot and gank when i can. I'm naturally crap at teamfights so i dont really care about CC. I need someone who is good at dueling (1v1ing, 2v1ing, small skirmishes, not big team fights). I don't mind if the champion is extremely hard to learn. I also would like a champion with somewhat security (meaning they wont be nerfed anytime soon). Also, please don't tell me Kindred, cause i know shes OP and i've tried her but just dont liker here very much. Thx (ᵔᴥᵔ)","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-17T23:14:50.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose there is Master Yi, numerous assassins like Kha'zix and Rengar, or bruisers and tanks like Vi and Rek'sai. There are really a ton of options for jungle, so I'd suggest watching videos or streams of junglers (Nightblue3 is a great high elo jungler stream to learn from). Mastery Yi may be a good start simply because he's so cheap.","replies":[]}]}
