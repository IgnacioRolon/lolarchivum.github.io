But I can&#039;t seem to land a good Q (exploding cask). Every time I let one out it seems like I have to explode it before it even really gets to ferment. I&#039;ve tried the whole EQ combo thing as well, but it still doesn&#039;t seem like enough time. Thanks!!","replies":[{"poster":"rootScythe","date":"2016-07-06T03:56:38.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cask is mainly used for the Slow effect not the damage itself (though a fermented cask is good for jungle clearing).  like Dediguise said its a \"zoning tool\".  Used to slow people who are trying to get onto your adc, or trying to run away from you. Gragas is literally a Bouncer at a bar. You are what prevents chaos in the clubs. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dediguise","date":"2016-07-05T02:58:58.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's better to use the cask as a zoning tool. you place it in a position so that they have to choose between taking the damage and slow or going a route that benefits you. The more indecisive they are the longer the cask ferments.","replies":[]}]}
