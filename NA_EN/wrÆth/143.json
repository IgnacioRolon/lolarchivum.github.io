I mean, i play it quite a bit, but my main roles are top and jungle, so im still not comfortable enough to call it one of my main roles. I've heard a lot of people say that orianna taught them how to play mid, or orianna was their first main. She seems really fun, but is she weak? What are her worst and best matchups, and what to build? Also, is there anyone else you'd recommend?","replies":[{"poster":"xBushx","date":"2016-10-07T14:16:05.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is far from weak. I have a 70% winrate with her. At 2 items she is unstopable.\n\nHonestly she is one of the safest mids, has so much to bring to the team. To top it off a completely game changing ult.","replies":[]}]}
