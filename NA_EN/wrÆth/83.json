They have quite safe jungle clears, are rather straight-forward to play, have flexible build-path (letting them build offensive and defensive items as necessary) and are good gankers.\n\nIf you are looking for build paths, I'd probably recommend something along the following lines to begin with:\n{{champion:5}} {{item:3111}} {{item:1419}} {{item:3142}}  {{item:3071}}  {{item:3143}}  {{item:3065}}\n{{champion:32}} {{item:3020}} {{item:1409}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} \n\nObviously, these are not the be-all end-all build paths for the champions, but they are a decent place to start and decent general builds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Factor","date":"2016-06-16T03:05:15.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:23}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-06-16T01:44:22.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not all of them {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"undefined24","date":"2016-06-16T00:37:11.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jax, xin, yi, amumu, cho, evelyn,nasus, rammus, sion, udyr, fiddlesticks, tryndamere, and there are probably more","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-06-16T00:40:22.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, but can you narrow it down a bit more? lol","replies":[{"poster":"3ofGot40ve","date":"2016-06-16T01:04:59.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax is probably the best on that list, along with udyr.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Searno","date":"2016-06-16T00:52:52.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu by far","replies":[]},{"poster":"God Fist Sett","date":"2016-06-16T00:38:59.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in the 1350 range there's actually some decent ones so you're in luck c:\n\n{{champion:33}}  Rammus is a really good pick if your team lacks a tank and engage  his taunts are also crazy good for ganking and are even better if the laner has cc\nBut if Tanks aren't your playstyle \nThere's  {{champion:24}}  Jax who recently got stronger with the new trinity\n{{champion:5}}  Xin Zhao  Same reason above \nAnd there's Also {{champion:28}}  Evelyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Febos","date":"2016-06-16T00:38:54.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32}} 450 IP\n{{champion:11}} 450 IP\n{{champion:9}} 1350 IP\n{{champion:77}} 1350 IP\n{{champion:5}} 1350 IP\n\nMaster Yi and Xin are very snowbally champions. You don't need much time to learn them. Learning Xin's spell rotation takes longer than the other 4.\nAmumu and Fiddlesticks are easy to understand and to execute. Amumu has 1 skill-shot with large hit-box and a game deciding ultimate.\nUdyr is probably the easiest champion to learn (skillset wise) and he's not hard to master, but you need to understand the game and the jungler role very well.","replies":[]}]}
