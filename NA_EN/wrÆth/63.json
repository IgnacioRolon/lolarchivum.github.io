If you didn&#039;t obviously definitely think of one, why not use google instead? I highly recommend l[ink removed due to boards rules] &#039;s &quot;Funny League of Legends Jokes to Impress Your Friends&quot;. A real crowd pleaser. However, unfortunately I have no friends, so I can&#039;t demonstrate.\n\n2.\nTitle: Shitty joke\n\nBody: Even shittier punchline\n\n[Insert meme here] \n\nThis time you actually have to go on google and find a meme which you copy and paste into your thread. I know. Effort. I don&#039;t like it either, but those juicy upvotes, right?\n\n3.\nTitle: The even in Even-Steven part of the joke\n\n[Insert dank here]\n\nBody: The steven in the Even-Steven part of the joke\n\nNow this one&#039;s only for those of you mechanically intensive players out there. I like to call it the ol&#039; flipple flapple. The dippity dapple. The papple apple. The Cat&#039;s Meow. Only Zed, Yasuo, or Riven players should attempt this maneuver. It&#039;s called switching the order of  the picture and punchline.\n\nAnd that friends, is how you make quality, creative, original (most importantly ofc) content to &quot;Impress Your Friends&quot;\n\nIf you can&#039;t find a career in here, don&#039;t worry, there are many other options on the boards. To name a few, there&#039;s Shitposting, Complaining about how an AP Malphite beat you in game 3 of your bronze promos, Yasuo, complaining about Runes, complaining about support, complaining about assassins, complaining about ADC, complaining about people complaining (def not what I&#039;m doing now), Yasuo, Riven, Yasuo, Zed, Yasuo, &quot;I got banned for being toxic, but I should be unbanned because I decided I&#039;m not going to be toxic for the next 12 hours&quot;. Or you could make art, or a song, or something creative. But I mean, thats work. And work is no fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2017-07-08T20:07:26.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might wanna remove the unrankedsmurfs part from your post, else it might get deleted. \n\nEven joking mods are touchy about website mentions.\n\nAlso can confirm shitposting is one of the best jobs out there, we even have dental.
