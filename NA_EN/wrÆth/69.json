I agree with a lot of these arguments, but Riot has already shown that they won't listen, so these posts really aren't doing anything. If you don't like it he game or the company or whatever, don't play it,.All of these posts I've seen so far have just been jumping on the \"riot rant post\" bandwagon and haven't really been adding anything new to the discussion. We get it, all Riot wants is the money or whatever from the 100 other \"What's wrong with Riot\" threads. So unless you have something new to add to the discussion, or you think riot will actually listen (which is highly doubtful) please stop posting these repetitive ass rant threads.","replies":[]}
