In hearthstone this week alone, I've gotten 3 COMPLETELY FREE packs JUST because a tournament is currently going on. At the start of every new expansion, you also get 3 free packs, and I'm assuming there's some sort of holiday packs as well. \r\n\r\nIf you take a game like battlerite, you basically get a free skin after every match, and there are like 50 achievements that give you chests, gold, and boosts.\r\n\r\nThen you go back to a game like league, and what do you get? Skins that take 2 millennia to craft with a bullshit crafting system, champions that take weeks of grinding to attain and quite a bit of rng, and no achievements or events of any kind, except for quests, which only give a little bit of exp. And occasionally hextech chests, and if you don't get something good well than too bad, because you have to wait another week. On top of that, these chests are a ftp player's only access to skins, but only give about 200 orange essence each chest. \r\n\r\nWhat the fuck?","replies":[]}
