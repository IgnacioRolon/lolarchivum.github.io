But when all 5 do so, then it's over. If you did not give up, you might have realized that you could collect XP from the bot lane, by simply \"supporting\" the adc. Then eventually roam, then pressure objectives with your smite. This doesn't mean the Kayle was right, she was definitely in the wrong, and you certainly all should have reported her. But by stopping playing the game, the entire rest of the team was also wrong, and threw away an admittedly slight, but still existing chance that you could have won.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2017-07-02T02:42:08.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello friend, \n\nit takes a significant number of regular reports to result in punishing actions. if your get chat restriction or something along that line, then you know that you are often getting reported\n\nin that game you explained - I personally would have tried to get you encouraged to play again. it's a sucky situation and about one in 20 of them are actually recoverable. but it is such a hard place to be in. personally, I likely would not have reported you at all - tho some times, due to some situations which I don't feel you described here, such an afk'er is also someone I report - but as you explain it I don't think yours would've been that situation. as you described it, I wouldn't have reported you at all. \n\nIf you find yourself regularly behaving in this way, then try to slowly train yourself into the habit of keeping cool under pressure. it's a good life skill tbh. \n\nwas what you did \"wrong?\" friend - what is right and wrong depends on who is judging you. that is all there is. whether that person is yourself, a friend, an enemy, the police, a starving family stealing bread - all these things change the \"rules\" about right verse wrong. find confidence in yourself - that is what is right for you! if dancing in baron pit in unwinnable games is right for you so be it. personally, I try not to do that, but as I said. if that is what works for you, then that is what works for you.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-07-04T00:24:01.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn you smart","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BigBellBrute","date":"2017-06-30T22:54:42.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tazret,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=08wExP4e,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-30T22:04:55.627+0000)\n>\n> Hi, I just played a game with a person who was autofilled support, than proceeded to take smite and steal every single one of my camps.

You don't do it for the 90 games you lose anyway. You do it for the 10 you pull out of your rump and steal.

Unfortunately, dancing at dragon is still going afk, so Leavebuster could give you an automatic penalty, or since Riot upgraded the griefing detection recently, it could give you a 14 day ban if you were reported that game.\n\nIf your team agrees to give up, FF at 20 (since the ff at 15 wouldn't work with a troll). Or you can use the game as practice at 50/50 smites. Smite also has a cd, so you should still have access to enough cs that you're not completely useless that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2017-07-01T00:16:45.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FreeKittens","date":"2017-06-30T23:05:51.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"you should be banned. you stopped trying to dance at dragon.","replies":[]}]}
