Im not saying that these new champs will be op, or garbage or whatever, but they are going to be really difficult to balance around. They&#039;ll never be good in competitive because one will always be banned out. If they are good, that means that they would have been significantly over buffed to the point where their numbers are so ridiculous that they are broken anyhow. You see what I mean? They either have to be overbuffed or overnerfed since they are reliant on being with another champion that can easily be banned. Also, by reliant, i dont mean unplayable without, I mean not being able to be played to their fullest capabilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2017-04-04T19:22:07.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't say I like having two champions that objectively buff solely each other, but that doesn't mean they end up op/weak. \nI just feel it's the wrong approach to make them a dynamic duo.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-04-04T20:00:31.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just feel like it's kind of forced, and things like this have not had good outcomes in the past. I don't know why, but the first thing that i thought of when i saw these champions was courage of the colossus. It's very niche in the sense that it is absolutely busted bonkers on some champions, but nonexistent on others. Sure, other masteries have these same niche champions they are good on, but none of them seem so forced. Most masteries took some \"figuring out\" and trying them out on different champions yielded suprising results (TLD on GP for example). Courage is essentially just, do you have cc? If not, then this mastery is useless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-04-04T19:35:46.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that one makes a *support* attack faster, and one extends the range of an ally saving ability on one out of 5 targets? I suspect they'll be stronger when playing alongside each other, but definitely not by enough that you'd ONLY run them together.

I think it's a really cool opportunity to test if that sort of thing DOES work. It's super easy to remove if it doesn't, so I'm honestly not that concerned about it existing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2017-04-04T19:46:25.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So to clarify, the champs don't gain extreme buff when played together. Xayah W applies to Rakan and Rakan gains a bigger dash range when jumper to Xayah. The only other change is the grouped recall.\n\nThey simply synergize well together, like braum and lucian for example. They don't require the other to be at their strongest, when together they practically get a minute buff, its not like they'll have to be together","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-04-04T19:45:14.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm think riot designed them for people who duo bot.\n\nAnd maybe LCS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MuffledGarbage","date":"2017-04-04T19:44:19.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well by the looks of it their kits (besides the innate buffs that they give eachother) are well synergized. Xayah does a lot of damage with setup by the gameplay clips that were on the reveal and Rakan seems to like short trades which would force enemies into an unfavorable position...\n\nAlthough with the extra buffs they give eachother it wouldn't force them to be played in the same match together.\n\nLike if I am playing Rakan(the support dude) and my adc is {{champion:429}}, I can proc {{champion:429}} W passive easily due to my skills allowing me to have great chances to do so as well as {{champion:429}} R being SUPER useful for my charm.\n\nBut I do see what you mean.
