Players who get great scores occasionally in norms don't get an accurate bias because they just got matched with players who don't really care about winning, or are even worse. Sometimes they go 20/1/18 in norms and go 0/15/8 in a ranked game. Also, sometimes in ranked, there is a professional booster from Diamond being paid to boost a friend or client who just dominates a 1v5 game.\n\nRanked unfortunately, is the only real way to learn a champ for ranked.\n\nI played about 10 Eve games in Norms before trying it in ranked after the rework. I got about 10 kills a game, 2-3 deaths at most, and then tried it in ranked. My scores continued to be reliable, but I just didn't have the map pressure in a Gold game to actually make the meta builds work and win vs Diamond games (had one game where rank 69 player was smurfing a zed and went 26 kills by 23 minutes. It was gross). Before I knew it, even though my kda and scores were on par with other players, or better, I had about a 15 loss deficit which just plummeted my MMR. Although I started around Gold IV, by the time I was down to Gold V 0 LP, my mmr had dropped from around Plat IV to Silver III. When I lost twice at Gold V, I got demoted. I didn't even have a safety Barrier when I lost at Silver I. \n\nBy then, I was getting a lot better at carrying Eve in all aspects of the game (not KDA) but even then, I was maybe pushing 54%, which is not enough when you bombed your MMR (15 LP a win, 23 lost on a loss), so I switched back and am in the progress of playing my main role again.\n\nIf my MMR isn't wrecked soon, I can play some more Eve in post season, but lol..... I'm sorry to say..... Norms just aren't how people learn ranked. People just don't care enough there to take the game serious.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-10-26T05:27:00.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you are saying, but I think the idea is that if you don't have an idea of the basic combos, abilities, or the role of a champ, you probably shouldn't be playing it in ranked.\n\nSure, some champs will need a lot of real games until your win rate picks up (and until then you really need to learn how to be carried first).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bańg","date":"2017-10-25T22:36:14.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its toxic to call the person first timing a champ an asshole but its \"just a game\" when riot sees him get reported when hes 0-10-0 with no idea what his/her/its champ does.\n\nthey have no clue what ranked even is.\n\nthey think everyone can do what they want as long as they dont type and are positive and they refuse to realize they are hypocritical morons.","replies":[{"poster":"Azadethe","date":"2017-10-26T05:05:54.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately (or fortunately) depending on point of view, Riot is more apt to ban you than the person who goes 0/10/0\n\nAs with any sport, the only way to reliably learn the sport is playing it in a competitive environment. No one ever excels in League without playing ranked and failing at it first. \n\nNow, I'm not saying I'm not sympathetic to the plight of this thread; I am! I have 3-4 Perma Banned accounts from raging at the people who give up, feed 0/10, or make the worst mistakes possible, like running at and trying to fight a Draven 15 times in a row. By Gold/Plat, I really expect it not to happen, but it still does. Bronze and Silver are a pure nightmare. So when it does, so do I.\n\nBut.... that doesn't mean I don't understand that what I do is more wrong than what THEY do wrong. They're just learning. I'm incapable of learning how to have \"on the spot\" patience. I wasn't raised with that, and at 33 years old, it just doesn't come easy. I'm able to collect myself when I'm not soley focused on play and pathing and strategy and trying to lead a team on league of strangers. But when I'm doing all that.... maybe I'm a bit Ausberger's, and although it rarely affects my gameplay, it's easier to get loud and direct and pointed, than to try to tell someone how to win in the 5 seconds before they do something which permanently scales back the game.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that I try to play in between watching my son and playing with and teaching him (he's high functioning autistic, hence my own Ausberger's reference), or get spooked when my wife shadows me when I'm trying to carry a tense game, but none of that is what Riot Sees. What they see is purely what's typed, the lack of empathy, and the constant \"you did that and you did this.\" Compliments are too rare, even though I do say GJ, etc quite often when deserved.\n\nBeing bad isn't an offense. Being toxic is. Take if from someone who will probably never have the \"capacity\" to reform, but really wishes he did.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2017-10-25T23:50:26.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then the entirity of bronze and silver elo shouldn't be allowed to play ranked by that logic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Violet Fields","date":"2017-10-25T22:49:45.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play Bard in the mid lane, and Veigar in the mid lane, whenever I show my Bard people say \"gg\" and immediately assume the game is over, I do this in HIGH silver ranked, and I've had platinums in normal games tell me that it wouldn't be a problem taking him into ranked.
