It&#039;s actually ridiculous. LCS is almost an entirely different game. The teams competing in LCS are high elo players who are playing at a very high level constantly and have a team made up of similar people. They are in close communication and practice constantly to get strategies down. Ranked, even at high elos, people commonly do not have the type of practice/communication that LCS teams have. The champs that work in LCS usually can only be played at that level through a lot of practice playing on that team comp. So it&#039;s unfair to nerf these champs just because of their performance in that certain team comp, or on that level. It&#039;s just not the same thing. Mean while, champs are allowed to stomp low elo just fine without nerfs. A possible solution would be a different version of league for LCS teams in which the champions that perform well in LCS are nerfed accordingly in that version. To conclude, it&#039;s not logical to nerf champs that perform well in what seems like an entirely different game. Most of these champs that are used in LCS don&#039;t even perform at a high level in lower elo (Alistar for example). It&#039;s like taking a small group of high elo players and if the champ does will within that minority then the champ is nerfed for the majority. Please feel free to leave your thoughts below, although don&#039;t flame me too hard lmao. I'm sorry if i sound rambling but i needed to talk about this.","replies":[{"poster":"2LUCID","date":"2016-06-25T06:11:02.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more like the game for us normies is balanced around LCS.
