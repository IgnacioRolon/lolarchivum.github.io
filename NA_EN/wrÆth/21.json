Because uhh...{{champion:69}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:98}} were met with disapproval or disappointment from their fans, Cass and Morde were especially _hated _ and there was an immediate demand for reverts, and the fans were met with a wall of silence or the unsaid but implied: \"I don't care what you think because I know better than you; I'm a Riot dev\" attitude. How much has changed since then?\n\nEdit: I'm only using these examples because they're more recent. \n\nEdit 2: Fine, I'll add a few more. \n\n{{champion:114}}, who was reworked with no interaction, and was left alone for MONTHS while she and Darius 1v1'd for the entire duration of the Juggernaut meta and shat on anyone else that got in their way. Darius was nerfed, but Fiora's kit remains to be outrageously toxic no matter how many times she was nerfed, and a portion of her dedicated mains have given up on her since she feels wrong.\n\n{{champion:41}} The GP mains were few in number, and were disappointed when the light-hearted stereotypical pirate got grim and serious, and apparently wanted to be Donkey Kong since his kit revolves completely around barrels.  Yes, that's very \"pirate-y.\" \n\n{{champion:57}} (Personal gripe here):  I was so excited to see the new Mao, but then when I looked at his decreased W range, I was confused since it would make his ganking more difficult than it already was, then people figured out top Mao was the best, and since then, his kit has been balanced around being a top laner.  So here's a suggestion, get him back into the jungle where he belongs.\n\nHis last Q nerf hit him pretty hard, hurting top lane, and crushing his first jungle clear, so what can we do about that? Mao's theme is being a spirit of the forest, so why not make his W reflect that?  While in the jungle, he should be able to hit an entire camp with his W if they are within a certain distance, but only those jungle monsters - champions in or out of the jungle will still be rooted as a single target.  Maybe testing on multiple champion roots while in the jungle if his ult is on might work? Just some thoughts. \n\n{{champion:133}} Where's Valor? Why wasn't Valor a part of her kit like he was originally intended to be? He's just a glorified taxi service now.\n\n{{champion:72}} Enough mini-games. Stop. Just stop with them. They aren't fun, they don't bring interesting interactions, they're shoehorned in to artificially create \"fun and unique\" designs. That particular phrase makes me puke because to many players who aren't you, it usually means it's going to be frustrating and unwanted. Example? Spires? Vital points? Villains? Test of Spirit? Whack-a-Barrel? \n\n{{champion:161}} We told you he was perfect. We told you he didn't need changed. We begged you not to touch him. You did anyway because \"why not?\"  Don't tell us you wanted him to have a niche, because he did. It was similar to Xerath or Lux, yes, but he was unique, and this time you finally made a champion who was  truly both  unique _and_ healthy...and you steamrolled ahead because Rito Nowz Bezt! Then you did a half revert of the rework because, what a surprise, he didn't need changing after all.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-06-28T18:06:00.823+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey KeevalRoy,\n\nFirst off, sorry that you feel we don't listen or ignore the player base. Not sure when player labs first started as they were already going on for all champions when I joined Riot, which was around when the Marksmen update happened. I know we did player labs on all the marksmen though,\n\nTo answer your questions on the champions above I feel like I have to give a little context into how we gather data and analyze which champions were successful or not, even if it will be a little hard to hear, since it seems you really didn't like many of the recent updates. \n\nAside from the player labs that happen while in development we also gather a ton of data from the playerbase after a champion rework is released. We gather what we call \"Targeted\" and \"Untargeted\" data from surveys that go out to the player base. What do these mean?\n\n\"Targeted\" - Survey to players that play that Champion\n\n\"Untargeted\" - Survey to anyone that plays LoL\n\nWe ask many questions on the surveys regarding Gameplay, Art, Narrative, Theme, Overall Feelings.\n\nFor example, while some people on these forums didn't like the Taric changes, Taric had our highest \"Targeted\" and \"Untargeted\" scores of any rework ever done by the Champion update team. In fact, his \"Targeted\" scores were much higher then his \"Untargeted\" scores which means that most Taric mains were very happy with the rework,\n\nThese go out to a much larger portion of the playerbase then are on the forums. It also goes out to all regions, NA/EU/China/Korea/Brazil. While I believe that the players on these boards opinions and thoughts are super important (it's why I spend a good amount of time on the boards,) I think it would be unfair to say that the players that do go on here and post represent the entire player base for a certain champion.\n\nI do realize this is a super quick rundown of how we gather data, if you have any more questions about this process feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can (Not directly on the Insights Team which is the team that gathers our data, but can answer to the best of my knowledge.)\n\nAnyways on to you questions about Champions above\n\n{{champion:114}} \nFiora was interesting in that contrary to posts on the boards, Fiora's gameplay changes were very well received, it was her art changes that were more mixed. She also received very high scores in theme, as players thought her gameplay much better reflected a duelist/fencer.\n\n{{champion:98}} \nShen was actually the opposite of Fiora. Players were very happy about his Art, but less so about the gameplay. Overall the gameplay scores were still higher then pre-rework Shen they just didn't go up enough for how much work went into it. His thematic scores however weren't very great which is why you see us saying we didn't quite hit his thematic well when we post about Shen on the boards.\n\n{{champion:41}} \n\nActually, {{champion:41}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:78}} &{{champion:14}} , where all by far our highest rated reworks we have ever done. This is sentiment from Mains and Non-Mains. This data, mixed with the data from Fiora and Shen is part of the reason we stopped doing medium scope projects and started focusing mainly on the full VGUs, as when we put full resources/time into a project it usually goes very well, were the medium ones are pretty hit/miss.\n\n{{champion:104}} \nGraves was actually one of our highest rated roster projects ever\n\n{{champion:82}} & {{champion:72}} \nThese 2 were pretty lateral when it came to sentiment from the larger player base. They really didn't go up or down. When it comes to data like this we don't regard them as a success because one of our goals is to improve the champion, not move it laterally. The 2nd goal of roster is to diversify the roster and add more unique gameplay to each champion, so while they didn't go up in sentiment we do think they became a bit more unique then before.\n\n{{champion:133}} \nQuinn actually started out with pretty mixed results. Her gameplay scores went up very slightly, but not down. After a couple months however her gameplay scores went up significantly, which means either new players started maining her and liking her a lot or old players got more used to her kit and ended up enjoying it more.\n\n{{champion:69}} \nInitial Cass reaction was low, but this was partly due to her being on the weak side on launch. In fact, when her changelist leaked early even the sentiment on the boards was super positive to her changes, this changed of course when she was released super weak. After her buffs her sentiment went up quite a lot and it looks like players are enjoying her much more now.\n\n{{champion:161}} \nVel'koz was the example were the boards and the data matched up. Players on the boards AND a large majority of Vel players didn't really like the update. We actually did bring a bunch of mains in the play the new Vel'koz and he was surprisingly one of the best received by Vel'koz mains during out internal player labs. I think that came from the idea of true damage on the Ult sounding better then it actually ended up being. We also don't have final tuning/numbers when we do player labs so he could have been slightly overtuned. What's interesting is the players during the player labs actually said they liked the kit but that they wanted us to change more, not less. Most players said they wished we completely changed his W into something else. Anyways, as you saw though we did make bigger changes to Vel'koz based on that data. As to weather we should have actually changed Vel'koz more, or not worked on him at all, I'm still not sure which was the right answer. In retrospect I believe we should have skipped him and spent more resources on Brand, which while I think turned out pretty good, could have been even better with another fully reworked ability (Maybe R?)\n\n\nAnyways, hope this answered some of your questions. I know at the end of the day if you didn't really like a rework it's not going to matter to you if many other people did like it. Wanted to be as transparent as possible with this though.","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-06-29T18:15:10.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is the Zyra update received by mains?

Since you're here, I want to tell you something that's very important to me that I feel Riot is not taking very seriously.\n\nDuring the Zyra preview, y'all said she would be balanced as a support. That was revised to balancing both equally. \n\nWhen the finished product released, my first impression was that it was a massive buff to supp Zyra since she relies on poke/zone. Zyra mid would suffer since she relied on direct spell damage (nerfed) with a dps component (also nerfed) in a reliable burst combo (also nerfed) typical of AP carries. That ended up being true.\n\nThe thing about Zyra mid vs. Zyra bot is that Zyra bot benefits exponentially more from passive seeds than Zyra mid. Her job is to poke, zone, and create engage opportunities for the ADC. Random seeds create more openings for her to do her job. W seeds are strongest for engage but also carry the highest risk. \n\nZyra's damage has always been balanced around the risk of being 700-ish units from an enemy while being glassy and immobile. The passive seeds remove that risk while still getting the job done in the support role. That is why Zyra sup is too strong right now.\n\nMid Zyra's job is to kill things as a carry. Right now she's good at laning, but her burst combo is weaker and totally reliant on plant damage. The passive seeds are not reliable for kill combos. You need the seeds from your W unless you're counter-engaging. Since the rework, spell damage is lower, Q is harder to land, W cooldown is longer, we have to build more CDR, and we need 3 plants to match our old 2-plant damage. Basically, we traded reliable burst for RNG steady poke, which naturally favors support Zyra.\n\n**The point** is that a nerf to the W cooldown disproportionately harms mid Zyra while the rework as a whole disproportionately harmed mid Zyra and benefitted supp Zyra. \n\nIf you want to balance her for bot, you need to hit the passive harder at early levels or add passive cooldown scaling to ranks in W. If you want to balance her for mid, you need to revert the W nerf.\n\nIf you tie the passive spawns to W max, you create room to add base damage back to her spells without making her OP. Then you have three distinct approaches to the character:\n\nQ>E max for burst with much fewer but more strategic plants\nE>W max for control with much fewer plants early\nW>E max for poke/zone with fewer plants early but rapidly increasing between levels 4 and 9","replies":[{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2016-06-29T22:51:56.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ditto what Redfeenix says.

Because so far, no one has done anything about it. The reporting system failed, yet again. And at least two of the three are still playing.

All of which have completely different decision making and playstyles\n\n2) How are you guys going to balance the \"burst\" to happen in \"about 1 second\" instead of \"about 0.25 seconds\" when things like Master Yi exist? A fed Master Yi with an AD/crit (not bruiser) build can insta-delete squishies in less than a tenth of a second with his Q > AA combo, and in less than 0.25 seconds with his Q > AA > AA combo if the first AA didn't kill them. A fed Lucian can do the same thing. Master Yi is a \"melee ADC\" and so isn't included in this assassin update. Lucian is also an ADC. Why are champions like this allowed to burst harder than assassins after the update? And how am I, as an assassin, supposed to deal with a melee ADC that can kill me in 0.25 seconds if my combo takes 4 times as long (1 second)?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2016-06-26T10:17:14.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can save yourselves some $$$ and time on Rengar if you keep him the same but change the coding of his jump/basic attack.\n\nBecause the coding considers it a basic attack, there's no way to dodge it.\nWhat you can do is (try) to stop his jump, becoming invulnerable or buying enough defensive items to survive his burst and then try to flee.\n\nHaving to buy those defensive items on carries really screw up the balance at times.\n\nIf you remember the crit on his jump/q, it became so bad you had to nerf it.\nhttps://youtu.be/qnhS4PwkIws?t=20s\n\nI'd say this is poor design making, not because of the crit, but the inability to counter it.\n\nLeague has come a long way since he was released, so while it might not have been possible to change back then, how about now?","replies":[{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-06-26T11:12:28.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Declined,realm=EUNE,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=twNjNcUY,comment-id=00010000000400000002,timestamp=2016-06-26T10:17:14.016+0000)\n>\n> You can save yourselves some $$$ and time on Rengar if you keep him the same but change the coding of his jump/basic attack.\n> \n> Because the coding considers it a basic attack, there&#x27;s no way to dodge it.\n> What you can do is (try) to stop his jump, becoming invulnerable or buying enough defensive items to survive his burst and then try to flee.\n> \n> Having to buy those defensive items on carries really screw up the balance at times.\n> \n> If you remember the crit on his jump/q, it became so bad you had to nerf it.\n> https://youtu.be/qnhS4PwkIws?t=20s\n> \n> I&#x27;d say this is poor design making, not because of the crit, but the inability to counter it.\n> \n> League has come a long way since he was released, so while it might not have been possible to change back then, how about now?\n\nHow do you dodge ADCs attacking you from 500-700 range?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hige","date":"2016-06-26T06:52:44.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"uhm well that's a shame but then... can we expect an assassin update v2? or will you be working on the outliers on a by patch basis?\n\nEither way I think you guys should consider simply taking longer with the assassin update :/ since they are the most broken class and even the assassin mains would benefit from a good fixing of the whole class","replies":[{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2016-06-28T01:22:17.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to remember that some assassins are so broken that Riot need to give them VGUs in order to properly fix them. They may only get to 4 big assassin updates in this group update, which will leave some problem children still in a bad spot, but Riot will get around to them individually in VGUs. They've already confirmed that they very much want to give both Evelynn and Akali full VGUs, so it's OK if their issues aren't fixed in the assassin update and they focused on the others instead. If they gave full reworks to those two champions, gave group reworks to let's say Kat, Talon, Rengar and Kha'Zix, plus small updates to Zed, Fizz and anyone else, you'd have a pretty comprehensive improvement in the assassin class eventually. \n\nThe good thing about assassins is how few of them there are.

It also removes a small part of the extraneous mobility that Riot keeps giving to literally everyone which would solve a little of the frustration people have with playing against her, and mobility-stuffed champions in general.
