And that&#039;s saying something, because usually I&#039;m extremely skeptical of game balance. \r\n    This was the actual change: \r\n&quot;Xin sweeps his spear around him, knocking back all targets except the one that he previously dashed to or attacked. (Here is the new part) Xin will then create a zone around himself for three seconds, blocking all damage dealt by champions outside of that zone. As Xin Zhao attacks, he extends the duration.&quot;\r\n   So at first, I was like, well this is busted, this just means that Xin now has a Kayle ult essentially. But than I looked at the video showcasing it, and it actually looks like one of the most balanced abilities to come out of Riot. Essentially what this will do is prevent ADCs from sitting behind 2 tanks while they get healed to full by lifesteal and support shields + heals and deal full damage to xin before he can even reach them (or at least discourage this). This means that ADCs actually have to get into Xins &quot;fuck you&quot; zone where he can actually be lethal and do damage without getting shit on by LDR and Grievous Wounds. This simultaneously decreases this braindead backline ADC wuss playstyle and encourage more aggressive and threatening positioning, that requires you , as an adc, to walk the thin line between death and damage. \r\n   Well done Riot, well done.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-09-13T01:34:06.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if this guy ends up being the solution to adcs being bullshit, what stops an adc player from just straight up banning him?","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-09-13T20:08:05.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you even read the whole thread?

Its way too strong of an ult. It does way too much. TWO forms of CC, a knock back, AND a stun. Damage PLUS % of health damage on top of that...and of course, 3 seconds of him not taking damage. Its the stupidest thing I think I've seen Riot do.\n\nBasically a better version of Aatrox with more CC, more damage and better engages.","replies":[]}]}
