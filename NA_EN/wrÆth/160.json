First, let&#039;s look at what can be reported;\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CnMyumI.png\r\n**1. Negative Attitude**-This is pretty self explanatory; basically, if someone is just being nasty and tilting your teammates, it falls under negative attitude.\r\n**2. Verbal Abuse**-Also pretty self explanatory, just putting down your teammates and directly going out of your way to be harass someone on the team.\r\n**3. Leaving Games/AFK**-Also very self explanatory\r\n**4. Intentional Feeding**-Now THIS is where I see a lot of people misinterpret and report people who really shouldn&#039;t have been. THE KEY WORD HERE IS INTENTIONAL. If someone plays a new champion, or just is on tilt or has a bad game, PLEASE don&#039;t report them for this. I&#039;ve seen so often some teammates gets reported because the team gets mad at them that they had a bad game and we lost because of it. If someone is being nasty at you because you had a bad game, they should be the ones reported, not you.\r\n**5. Hate Speech**-This is basically sexism, racism, and homophobia. Swearing/Cursing DOES NOT count as hate speech. It CAN however, count as negative attitude, verbal abuse, and unsportsmanlike conduct if it is directed at a teammate. If someone is on tilt and says something like &quot;holy shit&quot; in the chat, it wouldn&#039;t count as hate speech, unless they swear directly at a teammate. \r\n**6. Cheating**-Just make sure it&#039;s actual cheating before reporting.\r\n**7. Offensive/Inappropriate Summoner Name **-Self explanatory","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2016-10-11T01:06:57.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see.\n\n\"Doesn't have flash\" \n\n\"Isn't playing meta.\" \n\nOn there... xD\nSo...
