Everyone says he can be &quot;easily kited&quot; but thats kind of bullshit as he can easily run up and you with his q then no more kiting since you cant use abilities. Even if you do have a speed up, garen can usually catch up to you and is too tanky to kill just kiting, even with LDR. If he gets on you, your as good as dead, so i dont know what im supposed to do.\n\nEDIT: I was playing Miss Fortune. Keep that in mind.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT: Part of the reason im asking this is because i just threw a game real hard but im not sure how. One second Garen was like 2/5 and the next he was this tanky bruiser who was the literal embodiment of sanic (who seemed to always have flash up just to kill me). He always one shot me and I literally could do nothing but take it, as I did no damage back, even with LDR and black cleaver.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2017-03-18T20:59:16.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a squishy melee that isn't {{champion:157}}, you shouldn't be fighting a juggernaut in the first place.
