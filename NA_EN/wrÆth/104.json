I love playing her. She might seem weak at first, but if you know how to use her well enough (and ward enough) she'll be a beast. She is a pure tank, but her build is flexible; you can go for either more health ({{item:3083}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3143}}) or a defensive AP item ({{item:3151}} {{item:3001}}) if you are fed and looking for damage. Her damage is surprisingly high with only HP items. She is also very good at teamfighting if you can land her ult, which can be a little bit tricky since it is a bit difficult against experienced players.\nShe is also my first Mastery 5 champion, but my KDA is not good enough for level 6 (I keep getitng As because I mostly play on objectives).\n\n{{champion:102}} Shyvana was my first jungler. I have been enjoying playing her since the introduction of Feral Flare. She is very good at ganking, counterjungling, and dueling, but she lacks CC for ganks. Her build is again very flexible. You can build based on her lack of CC ({{item:3153}} or {{item:3748}} (or sometimes both), {{item:3143}} {{item:3742}} (more slowing items) {{item:3065}}  etc.)  and still be a very good tank killer. I played her a lot in Season 5 to counter tanks in the tank meta.\n\n{{champion:72}} Skarner is pretty good at both ganking and getting objectives. His ultimate can easily turn the tides of a game, and lead your game to victory even if your entire team is feeding.\n\n{{champion:120}} Hecarim's sustain, damage, and teamfighting capabilities make him one of the best junglers in this meta. He is also very tanky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2016-07-19T18:29:19.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id have to agree with a {{champion:79}} or {{champion:59}} both are very usefully at all stages of game. they can provide alot of teams. they can go damage or tank. i personally play {{champion:32}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} jungle alot. but i like tanky cc champs. and typically it allows flexibility to team comps. {{champion:32}}  has one of the highest win rates as a jungler too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2016-07-19T16:56:34.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:59}} \n\nTeaches you the most about the jungle, can change builds mid game, can fill whatever role is needed by this team at the time. \n\nNo idea how much he costs anymore, but he is the best jungler to pick up","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-07-19T17:28:01.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am kind of tempted to get him, but his damage output and tankiness seems really underwhelming","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2016-07-19T17:08:23.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's 4800 and a good first pick jungler, however I'm not sure how good he is anymore after his last big nerf from riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"69469238DEL1","date":"2016-07-19T17:05:00.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-07-19T17:01:33.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Master Yi was my first jungler and I would've gotten mastery 6 or 7 with him if I could get 40 more blue essence.
