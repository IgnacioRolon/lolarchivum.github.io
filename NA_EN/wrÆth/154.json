This is actually a very intelligent thing to do, and can prevent tilt a lot of times. But this also means that they cannot see if you ask for blue or red. So if you are walking towards blue or red to take it and they ping you away, back off. We junglers (well, most of us) don&#039;t just randomly pop into your lane like &quot;hey whatsup asshole, nice wave you got there, whoopsies, all mine&quot;, so don&#039;t pop into our jungle and take our camps. \r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"omnicron007","date":"2017-08-24T04:06:24.161+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"if a laner steals my buffs, i go into their lane and tax minions until I have recuperated the 100g they stole from me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ethan Allen","date":"2017-08-24T04:26:06.453+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=omnicron007,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=FUK7T38L,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-24T04:06:24.161+0000)\n>\n> if a laner steals my buffs, i go into their lane and tax minions until I have recuperated the 100g they stole from me.\n\nmight as well add interest while you're at it.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-24T13:43:37.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And counseling fees for the emotional trauma you had to endure","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXRaichopXx","date":"2017-08-24T04:46:31.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I like to take a little extra so I can make it worth my time.\n\n\nAlso they won't be getting anymore ganks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mig89","date":"2017-08-24T14:26:55.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Loe ELO jungle mentality is one of the worst in the game.\nY'all get stuck because of these types of decisions.

The only reason why I wouldn't fork over a buff, is if the player has already demonstrated that they can't survive, play safe, and will inevitably hand that buff to the enemy 30 seconds later.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2017-08-24T16:28:56.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've learned that the only person I can trust in ranked is myself quite honestly.
