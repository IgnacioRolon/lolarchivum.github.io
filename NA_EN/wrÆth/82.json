Take nasus for example. A champion that rolls over pretty much everything in low elo, but is considered unplayable in high elo. One of the main reasons for this is that the way you beat nasus is ganking him constantly, because he has no re positioning abilities.\n          \n                       In low elo  junglers do not yet know how to abuse this, and that's why he is so oppressive. You pray you get a good jungler, and if you don't you have to try your best to harass him through his lifesteal and innate tankiness before he gets level 6. And if you don't get a kill, come level 6 he wins by default against almost everyone but illaoi and tryndamere.\n\nMeanwhile in high elo we see the exact opposite happen. Junglers repeat gank the nasus and put him so far behind that he is irrelevant from that point on. He sees almost no play, and is usually considered a troll pick. \n\nA champion should not be so oppressive in low elo yet literally unplayable in higher ranks. \n\nAlthough league is a team game, part of what I'd like to see more of is the ability to individually carry, and I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't have to gamble on the skill of another player to decide your lane.\n\nJust some thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Onandaga","date":"2017-12-31T21:39:37.944+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus currently has a 50.8% winrate in diamond+ currently so I don't think it is very accurate to call him \"literally unplayable\" in high elo. He does preform slightly better in low elo but not so much that he is broken in one elo and unplayable in another.  \n\nAnyway I agree with OP's main point that champs shouldn't be balanced around jungle ganks. Top especially should be the place for 1 on 1 duels, I really despise jungle interference in the top lane.

It's actually the opposite, when I play vs Nasus I am worried about his jungler putting too much pressure on my lane, not allowing me to bully and zone him properly.\n\nThe one thing I truely hate about Nasus, is that he is really easy champ to get carried on. Lets say, you deny and kill him a few times as well as get cs lead, but his botlane is hard carrying. In that situation you need to group and start helping your team, because they won't be able to hold 4 vs 4.  Nasus gets enough global gold from his team + some free time alone and becomes relevant again, because of natural scaling.

You don't even need kills, just shove level 1, cheese level 2, and stand between him and the minions. Hell it's really easy to get free trades on him because he's always going to be saving his Q for a minion. Low elo players also don't know how to zone btw.\n\nWhile it is true if you're not playing a high pressure champion to deal with Nasus you probably need Jungle support, that's just naturally how the lane is supposed to go. At that point, Nasus (technically) counterpicked you and the lane isn't in your favor anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3Sleeper","date":"2017-12-31T19:58:52.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You don't need to pressure Nasus at all to beat him.
