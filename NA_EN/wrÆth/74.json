I am okay with his Q dealing fucktons of damage, the problem is that his W makes me unable to escape for the most part, the slow is too strong and the attack speed slow also prevents me from dueling Nasus if I am an attack speed focused champion, so not only I am unable to escape from Nasus, I can't even fight him back.\n\nLook at Darius. He deals so much damage. But unless you get caught by his E, you can avoid his damage. Even if you get caught, you can still have a chance to escape if you use mobility spells or slow Darius. And even if you can't escape at all, it is still possible to duel Darius, depending of the champion you are using. But Nasus? Your only chance is to dash on the other side of a wall, since you will not escape from him otherwise (and even then, Nasus can use Flash himself, provided he carries this spell). The attack speed slow prevents you from dueling Nasus, unless you can QSS it (and even then, Nasus' W has a really low cooldown).\n\nThis ability also makes Nasus one of the best champions in the game when it comes to setup ganks for his jungler. If the enemy jungler is nearby, unless you are close to your tower, you will not escape the gank (and even then, between Nasus' ult and towers being weak overall, it is not like he can't dive you regardless).\n\nOn my opinion, Nasus' W is one of the worst designed abilities in the game. It has very little counterplay. People complain about Malzahar's ult, but Nasus' W is almost on Malzahar ult's levels of retarded. While it isn't a suppresion, it makes up for that fact by being a basic ability with a low cooldown instead of being his ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ardènt","date":"2018-01-21T22:45:34.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is where most people get nasus wrong. I agree it is disgusting, but it's not enough to help your laner win the early game. Given that so much of nasus as power comes from his kit (especially q) the only real way to counter him is to deny creeps, learn wave management, and to get your jungler camp that ***** til 10 minutes after the game ends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-01-21T22:52:20.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Step 1 play riven garen or renekton.

Full combo him lvl1 with Q and electrocute. He had to flash to survive and then becouse I was attacking him the wave is pushing... He farm's his minions under tower with Q (now he has like 15-30 stacks)  he gets lvl2. He use W and Q you for 150dmg then he autoattacks you and Q you again so you are dead. you can survive by flashing away or just instanty running but there is the end of your possibility to win the lane. But player like you playing supports and junglers cant understand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VladCuzBad","date":"2018-01-22T04:30:53.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3009}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"buPPDrmXEO","date":"2018-01-21T22:57:49.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is no counter to Nasus. He is a bullshit champion that shouldn't exist at all. A champion that rewards you for being a passive bitch and playing \"Not to lose\" is unhealthy. \n\nHe is a cockblock champion that prevents other top laner from having ANY impact because he always has to be top to babysit the Nasus or else towers will fall down and stacks will accumulate. \n\nI have no idea why they buffed that STUPID design champion, it's a clear sign that the new developer team has no clue what they're doing, and that they just do things randomly without the vision of the previous designers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penns","date":"2018-01-21T22:47:27.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"theres a lot of counterplay to nasus\" - meddler\nBut old Fizz man, really unhealthy :]","replies":[]},{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2018-01-21T22:42:59.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright, first things first.  Can we agree that you (EDIT: or your top laner) are doing something wrong against him?  Klepto Nasus does have a 56% win rate, which is high, but it's not so high that no one can play against him.  People do it successfully, so can we agree that there is a way to face him properly?\n\nIf you can agree to both of those things you can probably get some assistance in beating him.","replies":[]}]}
