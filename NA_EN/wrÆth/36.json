He&#039;s very similar to Azir in the sense that his kit is so overloaded that if you tweak his numbers just slightly he&#039;ll be either very weak or ridiculously strong. I think this video by foxdrop sums up most of kled&#039;s problems fairly well-https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8mB1xUMbIXE\r\nAnother point I&#039;d like to add is his courage meter and how he interacts with skaarl. In my opinion this is one of the most broken parts of his kit. With his gun ability (I forgot which one it was) he can easily kite opponents and refill his courage meter and next thing you know, he has more health than the enemy originally chasing him. To sum it all up, he seems like a recipe for a broken champion, but feel free to leave your thoughts below.","replies":[{"poster":"redfeenix","date":"2016-08-13T15:54:54.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we see it in pro play first before nerfin him ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-13T15:25:17.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kled is fine right now.\nHe's more weak than anything else.\nThe only thing that might need a nerf is a slight % health reduction on his ult damage.","replies":[{"poster":"WrÆth","date":"2016-08-13T15:30:55.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He may be fine right now but his kit is so overloaded that he's going to be broken soon","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-08-13T15:53:28.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, not really.\nUnless he gets a numbers buff for no reason, he'll be fine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sirjace","date":"2016-08-13T16:46:04.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nerf the ammount of hp scarl comes back with and honestly id say he's pretty balanced","replies":[]}]}
