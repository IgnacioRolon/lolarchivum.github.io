As soon as the champ select ended, my game crashed and i got a directX error message. Thinking nothing of it, i reloaded my client and tried joining the game again. Still no luck. \r\nFortunately, my team voted to remake so i did not receive any penalties. So i joined the que again. The same error occurred, and i spent the next hour deleting files and repairing my launcher. By the time i log in, i realize that my team, has not, in fact, voted to remake. So yeah, now im low priority que for 5 games because of riots buggy patcher.\r\n\r\nNOW i know it could be a LOT worse than this, but it still annoys me that i have to wait 25 minutes more to play the game that i love because of a patching error.","replies":[]}
