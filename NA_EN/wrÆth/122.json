Unfortunately, sometimes the launcher pops back up when it's my turn to pick, and sometimes it doesn't. Due to the inconsistency I'VE \"DODGED\" TWICE IN A ROW. SO NOW I'M SITTING HERE WAITING 30 MINUTES FOR A GAME BECAUSE OF A GLITCH. I understand that this is a very small thing to complain about, but really. This is probably such an easy fix, and It's so obnoxious when you let your train of thought wander and then you realize you forgot to pick. The launcher popping back up when it's your turn to pick would prevent this.","replies":[]}
