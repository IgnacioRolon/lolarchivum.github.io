Then, when i asked him why in chat, he said, and i kid you not, &quot;Yorrick is op&quot;. At this point i was like &quot;fuck me, im gonna dodge before he picks fucking braum mid or something&quot;. I really hit my tipping point when one of this guys buddies banned gragas, even though i clearly showed i wanted to play gragas before, and when i asked him why, he said that &quot;There are kiddies watching the stream, cant have alcohol&quot;. So i was just like &quot;fuck that, im out&quot; and dodged, saving me and everyone else on my team 20 minutes. My question is, can i report this guy for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-07-08T07:20:24.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fairly complicated to decide when it is appropriate to report someone; (my opinion is to mute them in game and think clearly about if it was intentional or not, then report/not report accordingly)\n\nIf you have a valid reason to ban an intent pick (for example, I ban Blitz because I hate enemies playing it, and I highly prefer to have a more versatile support that can do more,) then it's not a valid report, since it's a disagreement with how you structure your team and your strategies for the game, not so much an outright troll.\n\nIt can be frustrating, but it's not exactly breaking any rules and it's not to spite you specifically so there is nothing Riot can do.\n\nHOWEVER, if they are consistently being rude and frustrating to deal with, your report will be valid. You can submit a report with what happened in the post-game screen, but if you can't, sending in a ticket with evidence would suffice as well. :)\n\nPS: Make sure to clarify in Ticket it was champion select :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyipheoryia","date":"2016-07-08T04:04:28.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes you can report him-but, like Kei143 said-it's not punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-07-07T23:12:45.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can report for anything, though that behavior is not punishable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-07-07T23:12:40.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, just because you don't agree with their bans doesn't make it reportable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2016-07-07T23:12:06.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No.","replies":[]}]}
