ADCs are now taking fleet footwork and relic shield with overheal. You would generally run this type of set up on someone like Tristana or Xayah who work well with fleet footwork, and need the relic shield to allow them to scale.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is that with fleet footwork and relic heal, the end goal is to get a massive shield to prevent all trade attempts, while giving your support more gold and getting a decent bit of health. \r\n\r\nNow since I know for a FACT this is going to be the next shitpost on the boards (since we all know just how much the boards love scaling hypercarries) I&#039;m going to try and convince you that overheal is not infact the problem, nor is fleet footwork or even relic. Aftershock is.\r\n\r\nEver since the new runes were released it was clear that aftershock was one of, if not the most broken, only second to maybe klepto. After shock has created a meta in which the support picks a tank with hard engage like leona, alistar, thresh, shen, or even blitzcrank. With aftershock, these supports can go for ridiculous trades and win them because of the base damage of after shock and the STUPID amount of resistances this one rune gives. \r\n\r\nNow why is this important? \r\n\r\nEvery support that goes aftershock (save for maybe rakan) always goes relic shield. The goal of the fleet footwork overheal relic setup, like I said above, is to gain a massive shield. However, in my experience, this is only really broken if you are running TWO relic users in the same lane. With only one, you do not have sufficient heals to really make taking overheal worth it. And with healing supports falling out of favor in replacement of the tank supports, you can&#039;t get your healing from something like a soraka either. \r\n\r\nSo let&#039;s recap:\r\nWhat exactly do you get in a double relic + aftershock engage support lane vs a &quot;normal&quot; lane (adc + healer)\r\n1. High snowball potential, even with a weak adc that is supposed to scale due to the ridiculous trading with aftershock.\r\n2. High scaling with little to no window of error with the ridiculous shield gained from 2 relic shields + overheal and relic health.\r\n3. An easy way to end the game with no potential of comeback. Engage tank supports right now with aftershock can make it so that you aren&#039;t even safe under your own tower. Even siege comps can no longer contest towers due to fear of being leona ulted and ran down under their own tower. \r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, although the overheal + fleet footwork + relic shield combination is meta right now, it is really after shock that is the glue that holds this combination together. Without aftershock, tank supports would be meta, and without tank supports being meta, you would not be able to get the double heal from relic.","replies":[]}
