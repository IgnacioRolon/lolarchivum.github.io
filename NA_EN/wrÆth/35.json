Here's the video if you haven't seen it-https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pC5qHBnnw4I\r\nNow let's begin. First off, I'm glad that ScrapComputer is being a strong, independent jungler and sticking up for us junglers. But in my personal opinion, some of the points he makes are flawed. Lemme begin with the first thing he says which I believe is flawed. \"If I don't like you're zilean top, I don't have to gank for you,\". Just because you don't like someone's champion choice, even if it is a bad one, as long as it was made with good intent and not a troll pick doesn't mean you disregard them as a teammate. Which brings me to my next point, or his next point, which was kind of the general idea of the video. \"I am not obligated as a jungler to gank for you. I don't have to gank for you,\". Now here's the thing. In no way are you technically obligated as a jungler to gank for your laner. How ever, you aren't a very good jungler if you don't ever gank ever. It's like playing support but never placing a single ward. Ganking does a couple things.\r\n1. It gives you gold \r\n2. It gives your teammate gold\r\n3. It allows for your laner to get ahead in cs and possibly take turret\r\nIn conclusion, it is never a good idea to never gank completely during an entire game or ever. I think ScrapComputer had the right intent when making this video, but needed to clear up some of his points a bit more. Feel free to leave your thoughts below.","replies":[]}
