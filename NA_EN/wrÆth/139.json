I feel like if i build full AP i get melted in approximately .11111111111 (repeating of course) seconds. Also, i don&#039;t understand why every gragas player maxes q first. What the hell is the point of that ? Your W deals more damage and isn&#039;t a skill shot that is fuck hard to land. Also, the only point of q imo is for the slow, because unless your opponent is polite enough to stand there for 2 WHOLE FUCKING SECONDS it takes a solid millimeter out of their health bar. I am just so lost as to why you would prioritze maxing a skillshot that deals less damage over a on hit proc ability that deals true damage, %hp dmg (i think) and a shit ton of magic damage. Please answer me so i can finally understand how to get as much damage as possible on the fat man :&#039;((((((((((","replies":[{"poster":"oh that zed","date":"2016-07-08T16:44:52.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Big Boy is a Legendary Fat Man with the Two-Shot prefix, allowing it to shoot two mini nukes at once for the cost of only one, giving it the most damage potential from a single shot in the entire game, with the sole exception of the Nuke, which is obtainable only through console commands.\n\nThe Big Boy is compatible with the MIRV launcher mod; the Big Boy will shoot an astounding twelve[1] mini nukes, while only consuming one. Be aware that the blast radius of this weapon's mini nukes is substantially larger than normal and that the nukes lose their momentum and fall to the ground after splitting. Also, the cost of this weapon is high, at around 14,000+ caps with no charisma and charisma related perks or effects.\n\n\nsounds to me like you should ditch the fat man and get the big boy.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-07-08T18:09:16.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RavenOfPallas","date":"2016-07-08T17:22:47.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought his q can be detonated by pressing q again.
