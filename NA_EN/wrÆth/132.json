I understand that offroles are cool and all, but Jax jungle right now is completely fucking busted and has been since season start. I&#039;m tired of seeing this piece of shit jump on my carry and two shot them with titanic triforce and not even take a quarter of their health in damage with counter strike and streaks abuse. This is out of control.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2018-04-15T02:35:26.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanna talk stat wise, they're performing pretty much equally.

Jax has always been able to jungle.\n\nIf you want my advice (I was diamond and I played jax jungle), just pick Kha'Zix into Jax Jungle, Kha'Zix counters Jax. You could also pick a tank like Sej and just have better team fighting. Split pushing is pretty dead.","replies":[]}]}
