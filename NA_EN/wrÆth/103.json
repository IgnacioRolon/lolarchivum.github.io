At first it looked like it was downloading fine but then it got stuck at 48%. So then i restarted the launcher and now it's proceeding to scan EVERY FILE ON MY  COMPUTER (or at least it seems like it). I finally got fed up cause it got stuck at 33%, so i just restarted for, like, the 10th time and now it's stuck scanning files. Please help. I just wanna play and this is really starting to become annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"RÊD","date":"2016-06-15T18:28:33.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey guys I encountered this problem too \"unspecified error occurred. please check logs,\" I restarted my computer and opened the client for it to patch again. this time it worked.
