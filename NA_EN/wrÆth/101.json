Sure it cuts off a lot of time from her one shot, but a slower one shot isn't explicitly a built in trade off. What IS however is the cast time on her ultimate. This is essentially a way to provide reaction time to her combo and gives a clear indicator of when she will fuck you up. \r\n\r\nA tradeoff, right?\r\n\r\nExcept for the fact that you can q q e r q mid air and cancel the entire ult animation making her combo near instant. Damn dude, what a fucking tradeoff. Definitely not like she can completely negate intended counterplays and mechanics of her kit.\r\n\r\nSo why isn't riven completely fucking busted all the time?\r\n\r\nHer combo is _EXTREMELY_ hard to pull off reliably in high pressure situations, and requires a master riven player to execute correctly as well as quite a bit of practice. Even the best rivens fuck this up quite frequently. \r\n\r\nNoticing some similarities here? \r\n\r\nThe graves combo is arguably even more difficult to pull off. The combo is so hard in fact that you literally cannot do it with ping higher than 50, because the timings are so thing. You literally have to auto r e w q within under a second or else you get knocked back anyways and you look like a fucking fool. \r\n\r\nAlright, lets move on to another champion. \r\n\r\nAP {{champion:79}} \r\n\r\nThis champion is probably one of my favorite midlaners of all time. There is nothing more satisfying then pulling off a perfect one shot combo.\r\n\r\nAnways, the tradeoff of this champion, and the reason why he isn't played midalne often, is that his burst is INCREDIBLY delayed and hard to land. His Q takes 4 seconds just to ferment, and thats not counting e and r travel time. \r\n\r\nThis one is a bit more telegraphed then riven and a lot more fair, but it's still ignoring tradeoffs. In this case, you can q e r flash and cancel e animation making the ult garunteed, and the now fermented q basically will one shot every champion in the game, barring a few tanks.\r\n\r\nThis combo, similarly to the riven combo, is ridiculously hard to pull off, even more so than the riven ult cancel. There are so many moving parts that only the best gragas players (panunu, woody) can do this consistently. This also brings me to my next point.\r\n\r\nThis combo gragas can do is the reason he is FUN as a midlaner. A lot of the fun in playing graves came from practicing the combo until you could land it consistently, and taking risks. Now with the combo removed he has become a glorified power farm master yi. \r\n\r\nI could name countless others like the {{champion:58}} combo, the {{champion:51}} trap cancel, {{champion:134}} 's w e q cancel, and many more. but the point is, these incredibly hard combos made these champions what they are. These combos made them FUN. Imagine riven without her animation cancels. She would literally never be played, because at that point shes just another plain old boring bruiser.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nOne argument that I've heard is that Graves combo is broken because it puts you in kill range right after performing it, but you have to realize that you waste your e to do half of it. Your e literally provides half your damage as you can use it as an auto reset, and is your only escape. Using it to perform a risky combo that only works half the time seems like a fair trade off to me. Also, riven has a similar mechanic where she must use her e offensively to perform her combo.","replies":[]}
