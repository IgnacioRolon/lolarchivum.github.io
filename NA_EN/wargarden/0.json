Never forget the #Bring_Back_Keith followers!!\n\nKeith Rekt doublelift with that 90% crit build. And kudos to quas for winning top-lane morgana. IWDominate on a rampage with rek'sai. I feel like Rek'sai is now iconic to him.\n\nThen again, APhromoo and double did well in lane versus keith and Xspecial, Link was average this game, but then again if you keep getting pressured by zed you can't do much.\n\nand the most funniest the Suicide Bombing Zed, man that was hilarious\n\nOverall very interesting game. The only game more intense was Team Liquid vs TSM imo","replies":[{"poster":"Kail271","date":"2015-03-02T22:50:30.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See, I have been really enjoying watching TL grow as a team, but honestly I don't understand the Keith hype. He's good, but he's not amazing. He is a very talented player, and would absolutely crush me, but I definitely feel like he's overrated. He is almost never with the team when a fight breaks out, and that costs them early fights. The triples Keith **did** get were good, but were essentially just cleaning up the remnants of a teamfight. (god bless him though, made me crush my fantasy week :D) Mechanically he isn't quite as good as several other ADC's, and his positioning can be questionable (even if his dodge skills are incredible, he shouldn't been in the scenarios he manages to escape from).\n\nI like Keith, but I think people need to take a good look at him as a player and focus less on his score line. This kind of ADC can work, as evidenced by SKT T1 Bang, but it isn't at all reliable. Once teams start to pick up on his playstyle, things will change. The same idea can be seen in EU with SK Gaming right now. They were incredibly dominant for the first several weeks, but now their playstyle has been figure out and teams are taking games off them. \n\nTL;DR It's too early in Keith's career to be hyping him as much as the community does. We need to see what happens when teams adapt to his playstyle, and see if he can then switch things up as necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Nestec","date":"2015-03-03T22:24:21.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't this part of the fundamental definition of the word \"hype\"? Once Keith has proven that he's an outstanding player, it evolves from hype into something else more along the lines of recognition and praise. I don't think there's anything wrong with hype this early, because it really is just that -- hype.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2015-03-08T02:51:18.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best game of the week","replies":[]},{"poster":"X Frady","date":"2015-03-02T02:56:18.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keith.
