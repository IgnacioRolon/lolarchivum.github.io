If that doesn't work, you can return to the legacy client anytime via the following methods:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"T3chieTurtl3","date":"2016-11-19T01:50:28.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same Prob Ctrl Down arrow is jesus \nI had 2 dodge 1 game 2\n\nPlease have that auto in some way\n:P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SynJ3st3r","date":"2016-11-18T20:16:25.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to go into a normal draft I got into a game but never connected to it and then I got a leaver buster for it never connecting!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T21:17:17.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds more of a network issue than the client that's preventing you from connecting to the game server.  Your best bet would be to use the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  I recommend testing it out in a custom game to prevent any penalties.","replies":[]}]}]}
