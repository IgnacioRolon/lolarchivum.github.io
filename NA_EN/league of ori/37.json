Also, you&#039;d be surprised how good it is in PVP. During the last Iron Banner I decided to trolll and switched everything in my inventory down to the lowest level item i had at the time, except for my ToM. Took me to level 233, but even then I was winning duels against level 300+ players. ToM is literally SO OP when you take advantage of its exotic perk. The only issue is you have to watch your surroundings to make sure you don&#039;t get outnumbered, because unless you have three enemies all lined up in a neat row for you, you aren&#039;t getting out alive.","replies":[]}
