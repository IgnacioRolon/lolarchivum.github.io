It was originally built to replace powered infantry altogether, but like the microfusion cells they were developed too late, along with the first microprocessors, and only a few remained).\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sJ10Gg0.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hWDSKFh.jpg[/img]\n\njust look at the level of detail on this gun holy crap:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5ikPP8E.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BFeibLL.jpg[/img]\noh yeah and you fight a new BoS branch-off\nhttp://i.imgur.com/b6hltBC.jpg[/img]\none of the three remaining androids:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ocRA0WN.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mMHxqwz.jpg[/img]\nthat armor lmao\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z1gFoUL.jpg[/img]\ntoward the end of the quest:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZiHK3K5.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9FNnEw8.jpg[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5Mcz1Yr.jpg[/img]\n\nthese androids can only be controlled during the quest, but afterwards you can opt to make them followers if you want, which is SUPER useful because these things are WALKING TANKS. Also, you can only get this quest if you beat the main story on the hardest difficulty, among other things.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fSwhI4F.jpg[/img]","replies":[]}
