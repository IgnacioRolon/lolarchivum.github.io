Sure, the ability can be played around, but honestly this ability is too strong for being a basic ability.\n\nFirst off, the ability grows in width to the point that it can block an entire {{champion:21}} ult and lasts .75 more seconds than {{champion:21}}'s ult. That is pretty ridiculous considering that is an ULT vs. a BASIC ability. For people that say bait the wind wall, I have heard it before.\n\n Secondly, the ability moves over 50 units during that timeframe. This part isn't strong, just a feature about it. \n\nThirdly, the blocking part starts even before the ability is full formed and can grant sight to Yasuo and his team. \n\nI just feel that the wall should be reworked or nerfed. Either nerf the duration of the damn wall, the width, both, or add a new feature of a damage threshold that destroys the wall after X amount of damage that scales per level of the ability instead of allowing the wall to get bigger. \n\nAlso, this ability  IS a problem. It is blocking most ranged abilities for 3.75 seconds. 3.75 seconds now-a-days is overkill considering that if your melee diver goes in, windwall get popped, your melee teammate is probably dead because they don't have the covering fire from the ranged characters because 1 second into the engage they get popped now it is a 4v5. (There are some ranged characters who have ways of getting around the windwall).

Kepp in mind, my mana pool, even with maximum passive utalization, only allows me to realistically wrestle wave controll from him wevery other wave, or if I am smart about cannons. \n\nSo, I get about 5 opportunities, assuming I am the better player, 4 of those times I beat him, even still the yas winwall requires me to risk my wave control and lane presence, to fish the EW against him, while his wall is down, as the second wave is arriving. I get a 2-3 second window to ever pressure him.\n\nIf I fuck up this window, Yasuo can turn on me with no cooldowns, and dash through the now arriving wave, which I must also conede because he chunks me there.\n\nFInally, level 6 hits, and I am not a champion anymore, because his ult against me give so much more value than mine against his, again due to WW. A large portion of my strength is packed into my Passive, and my ult is strong because it gives me reliable passive procs when used in chokepoints. \n\nYasuo essentially negates all the power in my kit, escapes all lane threat, and scales insanely, plus he can abuse conqueror, because his lane is so safe, and he gets away with using its power late game, with out paying the price of having such a fighting dependant keystone, that would result in most carries being too weak to fight in lane, unless they already had an upper hand.\n\nIts not that Yasuo windwall blocks my damage, its that it chokes up an already narrow window in a lane against SO many champions when he doesn't even need it, given how strong his lane is by way of his passive, being resourceless, ad a spammable AoE with a 100% AD ratio, that lowers with both CDR and attack speed","replies":[{"poster":"Akaśhí","date":"2018-09-09T22:22:50.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played Yasuo quite a bit and It is not that easy to play against Brand because well you don't necessarily have to E W Q me, when Yasuo dashes into you, you can just E Q W because your E Q is faster than his E animation's ending so you will have no problem stunning him on top of that the windwall has 24 seconds cooldown which is a lot for the  4 second protection it has If you can call it protection since If you don't react fast or don't use it on time you will be probably dead and by the way let's don't talk about mana, right now mana in early game is boosted - you literally have endless mana since every 4 seconds it restores and the mana was buffed early and nerfed late game.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-09-10T01:06:21.623+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Akaśhí,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yjd6TdJz,comment-id=001200000000,timestamp=2018-09-09T22:22:50.415+0000)\n>\n> If you can call it protection since If you don&#x27;t react fast \n\nThis is the problem with Yasuo.\n\nYasuo ONLY loses if the Yasuo player messes up. Yasuo players know they can 1v5 outplay if they play perfectly, and thus go for very challenging plays. The only reason Yasuo isn't insanely busted in even low diamond elo is because most players have poor decision making on him. In Challenger and Pro Play, teams can handle him well with proper coordination - but that's not at all the same as the game that 99.999% of us are playing.\n\nI should be able to beat yasuo by playing well myself. It shouldn't come down entirely to whether he misplays or bot.\n\n\"Bait his Windwall\" - implies Yasuo was baited, he misplayed and used Windwall when he shouldn't have\n\"He needs to react fast\" - implies Yasuo lost because he reacted too slow, Yasuo misplayed\n\"He's squishy if he gets CC'd\" - implies he got hit by CC despite being insanely mobile and having an ability to block projectiles: i.e. Yasuo misplayed.\n\nYasuo only loses if he misplays badly. Yasuo can still make mistakes, or put himself in bad situations, and come out way ahead. He's way too hard to punish, and needs to really mess up to get punished in solo queue. Playing a bit better than him doesn't matter. \n\ne.g. in early laning phase he can windwall my CC skillshot easily and chunk me for 70% of my health when my CC ability is on cooldown. Then I can hit him with my CC ability because he messed up, and barely do 50% of his health before needing to back off (because he'll chunk me for 40%-50% while my CC ability is on cd [lower because I had the time with him cc'd] if I don't back off earlier). AND that's already assuming I've previously gotten rid of his passive shield with an auto attack before landing the CC, if not I'm barely doing 30% poke with a full combo that would normally chunk my lane opponent for 50-70% otherwise. \n\nDoesn't that seem wrong? He gets the full advantage, has full control over the outcome (whether he misplays or not), and yet when he doesn't mess up he gets rewarded larger than I get rewarded when he messes up? What's the point? \n\nYasuo loses because he knows he has this advantage and thus gets too aggressive and dies to ganks, etc... Largely because Yasuo players (below high diamond) make poor decisions. NOT because Yasuo isn't rather strong...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-09-10T01:14:31.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking before act?? thinking and play in same time ?? are u crazy ? {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-09-09T16:49:18.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":13,"body":"windwall is a very necessary part of his kit so removing it would kill him off as a champion, which in no way will be good for the game no matter what you think","replies":[{"poster":"Press Q Win","date":"2018-09-09T16:54:34.476+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Master2139,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yjd6TdJz,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2018-09-09T16:49:18.967+0000)\n>\n> windwall is a very necessary part of his kit so removing it would kill him off as a champion, which in no way will be good for the game no matter what you think\n\nNo , Windwall is what make the champion overused and frustrating to face in general.
