If someone could move it to the right place for me that'd be good, but since this is about champion concepts I thought to post it here.\r\n\r\nThe concepts I see lately all have some form of \"Icon\" for their custom abilities. Where are people getting these and HOW are they posting them? Posting pictures for me just adds a link or something. How do people get it where there is no link and just the picture? Like how the {{champion:266}} {{summoner:21}} {{item:3001}} appear? Is it the same way? Just {{}} with the link in the middle? Same with pictures?\r\n\r\nBut, the icons are customized. How do people do that? Is there a site to make custom icons? Thanks for those who let me know, and sorry if this is the wrong place, but since this IS about concepts and such people might like to know as I sure don't have any clue.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-03-10T00:18:17.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.
