At least, in terms of theme?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"Hey fellas, dipshit here back at it again with more crippling deppression and self-loathing.\n\nToday I want to talk about the Aatrox rework.\n\nNow the general sensus I&#039;ve been getting is that the Aatrox rework sucks a hundred dicks and he should be reverted immediately, right?\n\nWell whilst browsing my favourite questionable hentai collection and contemplating my life decisions, I suddenly had a stroke of genius, amongst other strokes of course.\n\n&quot;Hey wouldn&#039;t this rework have been much better if it was for Mordekaiser?&quot;\n\nI mean. Think about it.\n\nDeathbringer Stance fits with how Mordekaiser has always been known to use slow, yet heavy hitting auto attacks. Nightfall, being a mace, would also probably cause some serious damage to the target and that would explain how they get mutilated.\n\nThe Darkin Blade fits really well with Mace of Spades. Both are Q abilities, both are centered around something happening three times and generally I just think The Darkin Blade, an ability that makes you slam your weapon down with great force, makes more sense with Mordekaiser&#039;s mace, a heavy object, than it does with Aatrox sword, since it&#039;s supposed to be used for slashing and cutting. Plus, it gives cc, something that Mordekaiser lacks badly and is probably one of the highlights he would get if he was ever reworked.\n\nInfernal Chains would fit with how Mordekaiser has always been a master of metalmancy (given how all of his abilities, except for his ultimate, revolve around metal) and thus would probably be able to use chains as a weapon. It certainly fits better than Aatrox, who doesn&#039;t even have anything related to chains in his lore (unless you&#039;re talking about being metaphorically chained in his weapon, in which case the chains in question are still not in his power).\n\nThe passive healing on Umbral Dash carries over from the healing aspect of his W, Harvester of Sorrow, and effectively replaces the shield of his passive, Iron Man. As for the active, it&#039;s probably the one ability that fits Mordekaiser the least. I can only give two explanations for how it could fit into his kit. First off, Mordekaiser is known to be the (unofficial) leader of the Shadow Isles and thus would probably have some kind of shadow magic that could allow him to phase through walls and move faster (this is entirely based on the fact that Aatrox&#039; E has &quot;Umbral&quot; in it). Second off, mobility is the second thing Mordekaiser lacks in his kit, besides a movement speed buff and would probably also get some mobility if he was reworked.\n\nAnd finally, World Ender. Him fearing minions around him fits Mordekaiser really well, considering Mordekaiser was a brutal warlord to be feared during the time he was still alive, and due to him just being a dreadful being to be in the presence of in general, as we can see in his color story where the soldiers guarding the castle all shivered and whispered his name in fear. The movement speed up would carry over from Harvester of Sorrow but the main thing I want to talk about is the revive aspect. During his time as a warlord, Mordekaiser discovered a way to become practically immortal, since everytime he died he would just return later on. This would fit with how the ult allows Mordekaiser to revive. The nice white bar that fills under his health bar also carries over from Iron Man.\n\nOf course, the animations wouldn&#039;t be the same. Mordekaiser wouldn&#039;t suddenly levitate in the air when he casts Q and he wouldn&#039;t magically grow wings when he uses his ult.\n\nNow, before you ask any questions, let me just answer some that I&#039;m sure people would ask:\n\n&quot;Wouldn&#039;t this mean Mordekaiser would go from AP Caster to AD Caster?&quot;\n\nIf we keep the exact same kit that Aatrox currently has, yes. However, Riot could easily just change everything to deal Magic damage instead. Besides, I don&#039;t really have a problem with Mordekaiser dealing AD damage. I actually think it fits him more, given how he&#039;s supposed to be a warlord, than him dealing magic damage.\n\n&quot;The animations wouldn&#039;t fit!&quot;\n\nYeah of course they wouldn&#039;t but nobody says the animations have to stay the same. I personally like the idea of Mordekaiser slamming his fist into the ground in order to make the chains appear, but him flying during his ult is obviously an issue. If I had to work with his current visuals, I&#039;d do it like this:\n\nPassive: Mace of Spades third hit.\n\nQ: First cast is Mace of Spades third hit, Second cast is Mace of Spades first hit and the Third cast would just be Mace of Spades third hit again.\n\nW: His E animation could technically be recycled, but it&#039;d look a little bad.\n\nE: New animation needed.\n\nR: Mordekaiser could get the Harvester of Sorrow animation as his ult animation. For reviving, he'd get the Children of the Grave visual effect over his head.\n\n&quot;He&#039;d lose some very iconic parts of his kit!&quot;\n\nThis would probably be the only thing standing against Mordekaiser getting this as his new kit. Well, besides the fact that the kit is shitty and Aatrox is doing horribly right now but that&#039;s besides the point. I could understand it&#039;d be kind of sad to see the unique mechanic of getting shields for doing damage and his execute-style ult go, so I&#039;d actually accept it if this is the argument people would choose to use against me.\n\nAnyways, like I said, this was just an idea. Feel free to post your own thoughts below.\n\nEdit: People in the comments really like the Iron Man passive and don't want it to go, so to make sure it would carry over, the passive healing from Umbral Dash needs to be removed and replaced with it. Just imagine that Aatrox's abilities cost health.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-04T16:29:08.168+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"His mace of spades maybe could be like Aatrox's Q but the rest doesn't really fit Morde.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-07-04T17:03:04.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=7l5l8xwW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-04T16:29:08.168+0000)\n>\n> His mace of spades maybe could be like Aatrox&#x27;s Q but the rest doesn&#x27;t really fit Morde.\n\nRespectable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2018-07-05T03:19:42.921+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> makes more sense with Mordekaiser's mace, a heavy object, than it does with Aatrox sword, since it's supposed to be used for slashing and cutting.\n\nI don't think you quite understand the merits of a Greatsword.
