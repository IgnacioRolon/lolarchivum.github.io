Im currently chat restricted for another false claim but thats another story, so i proceeded to stay calm and even help my team out and making plays and good calls. i went on to go 12/5/12 as Shaco and completely destroyed the opposing team. Later in post chat i had replied to varus saying &ldquo;Who couldn&rsquo;t carry&rdquo; and that got me immedietly banned for 14 days, i believe we shouldn&rsquo;t allow these very soft players ruin our gaming experience. Anybody can false report you and BAM just like that youre unable to play your favorite game for two whole weeks. In Call Of Duty your reports go straight to the trash and that forces you to grow up and understand that in any competive activity you will encounter trash talking and thats perfectly acceptable as long as no threats are made. Please Riot, grow a pair.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-07-02T01:10:35.655+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered, maybe, that \"he started it\" isn't a valid excuse?\n\nI encourage you to post screenshots of your full unedited chat logs given in your reform card.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombie Gerbil","date":"2018-07-02T02:18:18.818+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want a discussion if you deserve your ban or not, leave your chat-log.\nEverything you have to say is irrelevant until then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-07-02T01:20:43.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[{"poster":"KidCurbo","date":"2018-07-02T01:22:39.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Liquid Poro ","date":"2018-07-02T02:04:38.448+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give us chat logs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2018-07-02T02:09:15.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get banned for people lying about what you said/did.\n\nYou get banned for attacking them back.\n\nSeriously, if you stay cool and mute them?
