If you watched the videos, Tyler1 kept complaining that he was constantly being banned after streaming and that Riot isn't giving him the chance to show he's reformed and so Riot gave him one last chance and told him to give them the account names of all of the smurfs he has been playing on without streaming and they'll review those accounts and see if they will reverse the player ID ban but they would not unban his previous accounts.\n\nRiot didn't beg Tyler1 to come back at all.  You can watch the video he posted on youtube on his return. \n\nHe has stated he's been playing league during this ban time and THEN he says \"Riot begged me to come back.\"\n\nHis twitter is filled with League of Legends related content during his ban. It's totally unbelievable that Riot begged him to \"come back\" when he was frothing at the mouth over tournaments and meeting pro league players and playing the game without streaming.\n\nHow do you come back to league of legends when you never left it? He admitted he was being banned every time he streamed a game but was playing without streaming and wasn't getting banned and that's how he got to prove to Riot that he was reformed? That doesn't sound like Riot begged him to come back. That sounds like Riot was tired of having to keep checking his stream to ban any account he played on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2018-07-02T02:02:10.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"well thats not correct anymore. view numbers on twitch clearly show that fortnite is above LoL.\njust to be specific :D","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-07-02T02:13:12.309+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"View counts do not translate to player counts.

We'd banned those players who were toxic in our game while TDA clan was running it. We never tolerated toxicity. It was hard for these players to get into a TDA game because you had to be a certain level with a certain MMR score in order to. This was back in 2005, possibly sooner.\n\nThe internet has always been a toxic place, as all video games with open communication. \nNow League has this same policy, but stricter than I was when I was a MOD for TDA clan. I approve of the system and I'd change nothing.\n\nNow, as for your claim, the game is dying.. The number of times I've seen people say the same thing over and over again for the past 10 years, seeing the League population go past 3 million players, and players says \"the game is dead\" because they didn't like how the character was designed or they lost their ranked games, or they were banned. Then 5 years later, another 10 million players join this game, and people like yourself say \"the game is dying\". Then another 2 more years we're at 25 million players are playing. \n\nAnd here you are. \nAs thousands before you have said, \"this game is dying\". \nIt may be the end of league for you, but this game will be around for a very very long time for us and the company.
