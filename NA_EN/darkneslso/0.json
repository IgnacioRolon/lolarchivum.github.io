Although only one time today, out of 5 games, I could not join the game after I was at 100%. I had to restart the client in order to load in the game, which was 3 minutes after it started.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darth Whitmans","date":"2018-08-30T14:02:23.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question as well, why does loading screen not load? Basically it freezes on launcher, I know it's not my net, so it's on your end. More and more people are reporting these issues, I myself have 20min queue times in EUW, because I can't start the game and I get punished by Leaver Buster.
