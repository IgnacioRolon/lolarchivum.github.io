I really need help on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T21:41:31.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's still scanning your files then it likely hasn't tried to reach our patching servers yet.  Pando Media Booster is an extremely old system that is no longer used.  Instead, players now directly connect to our patching servers to grab updates.  You should go over the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to make sure that your OS is allowing your game files to get scanned and prepare for an update.\n\nAlso, depending on how old your client is you can have a crapton of files.  If that's the case, you could do a clean reinstall via the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to grab some fresh files.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TurtleKilling","date":"2017-05-10T22:00:20.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!!","replies":[]}]}]}
