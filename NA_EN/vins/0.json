If you poke intelligently, you can poke much more than a tanky support can heal off of the passive. If you're playing the tanky support, having sustain is really important to your viability in lane.\n\nThat said, the utility of this item goes down substantially in late game, apart from the shield. It's a tradeoff that isn't experienced by Talisman of Ascension or Frosqueen's Claim, so I agree with the OP that the full item utility should be maintained, even if it means reducing the amount of the heal or item +health to maintain game balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-07-27T06:57:52.055+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, they all strike an interesting balance.\n\nFor FotM, you don't have to be anywhere for two full minutes. You do require some help afterwards, but honestly I find Threshes are pretty easily able to Flay a wave, etc., and get some gold back.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone running Talisman will repeatedly miss out on gold if they roam during a minion wave.\n\nAnyone with Frost Queen's isn't necessarily going to be in combat often enough to use all their GP10.\n\nThe benefit of Face here is that they can dump two minutes worth of stacks out with a little effort.

The passive is actually two statements/effects, both dependent on having a charge. The first effect is the obvious \"Melee basic attacks execute minions below 200 Health.\" However if you read the second half of the statement \"Killing a minion heals you and the nearest allied champion for 50 (+1% of your maximum Health) and grants kill Gold.\" You will notice that it does not state that EXECUTING a minion grants the heal and gold. I decided to test this out, and found that as long as your allies are near by they will still receive the gold and heal, which allowed for interesting barrel tricks. Of course each charge can only trigger off of a single minion, however you are able to trigger the second half of the passive at range with abilities, just not the execute. I hope this helps you gents (or ladies) and happy supporting!","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-07-26T06:35:04.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People who play Thresh should know this already, hence why it's one of his 3 typically viable starts next to health crystal and Doran's Shield.\n\nAs for my 2-cents on the poor gold-gen of Relic Shield.  It's supposed to be the \"safest\" of the 3 support item trees, but I agree it trades off too much for this.  Perhaps if Targon's Brace gave a meager +1 gold/10, supports that choose this route wouldn't be constantly ending games 20-30% behind even the lowest income amongst your teammates.  Or even worse, with less gold than nearly the entirety of the opposing team, regardless of having earned a victory.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-07-26T09:36:59.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A.

I'm sure some other ranged-supports might pick it up if they removed the melee restriction, but it doesn't seem like it would break the item or make its popularity skyrocket (except on Thresh). If Thresh pokes the enemy, he loses his Flay stacks and therefore does far less basic attack damage while trying to last hit making it pointlessly more difficult. It just seems like an unfair trade off to have to choose between getting an easy last hit on that cannon minion to share the gold, or poke that nosey Braum and when you hit that minion it barely survives and gets killed by another (resulting on 0g and an annoyed ADC that will never trust you to last hit again).
