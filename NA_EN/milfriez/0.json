Basically the scenario is as follows.\r\n\r\nDownload completes, client updates, I login. Top left progress bar never updates and states cannot join lobby, restart the client. \r\n\r\nI restart the client, it gives the vague you had problems we are using an older client then trying to update - message\r\n\r\nI have to go into settings and do a full repair. Once that completes a LONG time later, I can play again. \r\n\r\nThis happens EVERY update. I did read something on here about checking clients version and I'm wondering if that is causing conflicts. \r\n\r\nIn c:\\riot games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects - I have the following folders.\r\n\r\nleague_client\r\nleague_client_en_us\r\nlol_game_client\r\nlol_game_client_en_us\r\nlol_launcher\r\nlol_patcher\r\n\r\nDoes this seem correct? Does anyone have any idea why after EVERY update I have to fully rebuild my client? System is Win7 x64.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T22:39:43.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems to me that your client is having a hard time getting the latest patch to install correctly, which seems to be causing a lot of different problems after you've logged in. I'd suggest first grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running it with force repatch turned on to make sure you've been able to update correctly. \n\nHit me back if that doesn't seem to help and we can dig a little deeper into this for ya!","replies":[{"poster":"Milfriez","date":"2017-05-08T15:25:16.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downloaded and ran the hextech repair tool. I selected public DNS and force repatch. It started to run, then popped up a message saying that some components must run under Admin profile (i'm logged in as an admin-privs user). It said collecting logs, then the whole splash screen just disappeared. \n\nI have 3 separate processes still running as \"Hextech Repair Tool.exe *32\" - but nothing seems to be happening, these have been running for over 30 minutes with no signs of life. Should I kill and re-run as Admin?\n\n_***EDIT***_ \nNoticed that it briefly flashes configuring DNS before it dies. Could endpoint management/Virus scan be causing it to crash since it appears to try and modify network settings?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-08T20:55:43.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes certain antivirus can block the HRT or the patcher from scanning the game files and such.
