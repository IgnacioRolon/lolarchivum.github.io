Maokai is slated for a Model Texture Update coming up in the next patch, and so far, on the PBE, everything is looking amazing. My only issue lies with the changes from the old Totemic Maokai to the new updated one. The things I loved about the skin (enough to purchase it) included the dark twist it added to Maokai, including the colors and patterns all over his body. The old version is simply more frightening to me, especially the black, white, and red contrasts and the way the face was designed. The updated version barely resembles the old one, in my opinion, in terms of color scheme and face model/patterns, etc. \nThis reminded me of the way Warmonger Sion looked in his first updated skin model, and I really think Riot made a good choice in changing him to more resemble the original skin in terms of colors. \nAnybody else think they should do this with the updated Totemic Maokai?\nPlease tell me other people feel this way too.\n[Totemic Maokai Comparison Old (Left) vs New (Right)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lxmx_uAEkX0/VGE7IyZ5ZeI/AAAAAAAAdBY/a-KL8Xx67b0/s1600/totem1.jpg)","replies":[{"poster":"Goilo","date":"2014-11-14T00:06:47.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new totemic maokai skin blows old maokai out of the water.

Truly a step up in most facets. But in terms of a color scheme, it's quite different, right? That's my biggest issue right there. I prefer the darker colors, personally. It makes the totemic theme have a demonic vibe that I really liked. The newer one doesn't have that same vibe for me. But, I guess I'm just gonna lose some of what I paid for. Not a huge deal, I was just hoping others felt similarly. Independently, the new skin looks far more well done than the old one, but as an updated version of it? It doesn't feel like the same skin to me. Personally, I would have purchased a different Maokai skin if I had known this is how it would eventually turn out.","replies":[]}]}]}
