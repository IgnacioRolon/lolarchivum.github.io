It is also possible your account got compromised and someone moved it back to NA from Japan.  If you are sure you didn't change your Username, make sure to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!  One of our Account Recovery Specialists should be able to help out!","replies":[{"poster":"Im not CNN","date":"2016-06-21T14:10:53.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didnt ask me to change username, and I am not the original owner, my friend had to transfer ownership to me, he had busy and dont have time to play.
