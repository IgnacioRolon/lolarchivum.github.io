Specifically, you may have an option enabled that disabled the cursor on full-screen.  Try the following steps to get this fixed up:\n\n1) Click on the Mouse icon in the following directory: Control Panel\\All Control Panel Items. \n2) A new window should open labeled as \"Mouse Properties.\"\n3) Click on the \"Pointer Options\" tab and make sure that the \"Display Pointer Trails\" option is unchecked.\n4) Once that is complete, verify that \"Hide Pointer While Typing\" is also unchecked in the \"Pointer Options\" tab.\n\nHope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
