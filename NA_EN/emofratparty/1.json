Thanks, Rito pls :D\n\nI think mine would be a collective of characters.  I need to sketch it out, but here's what I'm thinking:\n\n___\n\nhttp://colouroflife.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/9.jpg\n*Image via http://colouroflife.wordpress.com/, not sure of original source.*\n\n>#EMOFRATPARTY\n\n* **STORY IN BRIEF:** EMOFRATPARTY consists of three saddened Yordles: Gur, Berep, and Yorf.  After being denied access to a party sponsored by Mount Atin Eclipse Rumâ„¢ because of their drab attire, the trio decided to take their aggression out on the Fields of Justice.\n\n* **DESCRIPTION IN BRIEF:** Acting as one unit, they sorrowfully shuffle along from one battle to the next.  Gur is a tall, lanky creature with pale fur and a mop of hair covering just one of his eyes.  Berep has dark near-black skin smoother than the backside of Fizz's head, and the attitude to match.  Being as small as he is, he rests atop Gur's right shoulder and fear-gazes his way to victory.  Yorf is a small yet girthy Yordle.  Her red skin is complemented by a suite of blackened clothing, with spikes and other sharp materials strewn about its surface.  She isn't keen on not getting into parties.\n\n___\n\n**PASSIVE:** **REMORSEFUL HEARTS**\n*If damage is not taken for **(10)** seconds, EMOFRATPARTY's next auto-attack on a Champion will reduce their vision to a radius of **(650)** for **(1.5)** seconds.  Count is reset upon usage of auto-attack on a Champion.*\n\n**Q:** **DEAD EYES**\n*EMOFRATPARTY freezes and locks eyes with their opponent.  If damage is not taken within **(1)** second of triggering this ability, **(10%)** of the target Champion's health and mana will be donated to EMOFRATPARTY.*\n\n**W:** **SEANCE**\n*EMOFRATPARTY calls upon spirits from the deep.  If this ability lands on an enemy Champion, they are frozen in place for **(2)** seconds and all enemies within a **(350)** unit radius are drawn towards the targeted Champion.*\n\n**E:** **PAINSHARE**\n**Passive:** *Auto-attacks deal **(1%)** life steal towards minions and **(1%)** mana steal towards Champions in addition to their default damage.*\n**Active:** *When triggered on an enemy Champion, removes **(50%)** of own health to deal damage equivalent to **(30%)** of target Champion's health.*\n**Stack:** *Every **(4)** successful executions of PAINSHARE's active increase the passive life steal and mana steal by (1) percent.*\n\n**R:** **WRATH OF THE YORDLE**\n**First Cast:** *Gur, Berep, and Yorf charge towards an enemy and latch onto them, stunning them for **(1)** second.*\n**Second Cast:** *EMOFRATPARTY can then throw the enemy in any direction for up to **(1000)** units, causing **(400)** points in true damage to the target and anything it collides with.*\n\n___\n\n*Stats/costs probably not forthcoming, maybe.*","replies":[{"poster":"Habu x Loverke","date":"2014-08-01T06:09:51.799+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would look like {{champion:103}} with blonde hair and a fancy outfit.

Wrapped in delicious bacon armor.  Happily heralds Ames requests, bug reports, glorious skin ideas and perfectly cooked baconbait.  Occasionally given to bouts of bad dad humor and nesting on the bridge over the Howling Abyss.\n* **DESCRIPTION:** Melee assassin fighter. High risk, high reward; has CC abilities to assist team if she gets behind; can carry hard when ahead. Movement speed passive helps chase down enemies who are separated from their team.\n\n___\n\n**PASSIVE:** **BAIT TAKEN**\n*Enemies drop bacon strips (Bait) as they cast spells or auto attack. Every stack of Bait that Baconhawk collects causes her to fly faster for a short time, decaying if bacon has not been collected for 5 seconds or after 10 stacks.  Every 10 stacks adds a permanent 5 movement speed.  Bait stacks can be expended to augment attacks.*\n\n**Q:** **CAWW**\n*Baconhawk screeches at an enemy, knocking them backwards and spinning them around.  Enemies and neutral (non-lane) minions knocked back near Baconhawk drop Bait.  Baited enemies are knocked back, spun around and stunned if hit by Caww.*\n\n**W:** **SIZZLE**\n*Baconhawk expends current stacks of Bait to fire a blast of sizzling bacongrease in a straight line, creating a spreading, slow zone that deals AOE damage over time.  Gradually, the grease congeals, slowing enemies' movement speed to 25% and applying Baited debuff.  Baited enemies drop two stacks of Bait.  While using Swoop & Perch, can tap twice to Sizzle in a circle instead of a line at any time during the Swoop.*\n\n**E:** **SWOOP & PERCH**\n**FIRST CAST:** *Baconhawk expends current stacks of Bait to take flight for 3 seconds. During this time, Baconhawk is immune to slows, knockbacks or knockups (she's already in the air), and can fly over walls, but her Armor and Magic Resist is reduced to 0.  She gains movement speed equivalent to 50% of her bonus movement speed provided by Bait stacks.*\n**SECOND CAST:** *If enemies are turned away from Baconhawk or Baited, Baconhawk dives onto them and perches, attacking them mercilessly with increased % attack speed equivalent to the number of Bait stacks collected since Swooping.  If she does not Perch on an enemy and instead allows Perch to end on the ground by default, all current Bait stacks are consumed, Baconhawk herself acquires a form of the Baited buff called \"Rekt Chickenhawk\" where she cannot collect Bait stacks for 60 seconds, and is slowed by 50% after landing.*\n\n**R:** **BACONFLOCK**\n*Baconhawk calls down the Baconflock from the skies to attack an area.  Any enemies who are Baited or are currently in the Sizzle zone are focused by the Baconflock, and are pecked until they leave the zone.  Enemies facing away from Baconhawk are terrified and run away from the zone, dropping Bait as they run.*\n\n___","replies":[{"poster":"EMOFRATPARTY","date":"2014-08-03T23:33:06.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS BACONLOVE IS *DELICIOUS*, AS IS THIS CHAMPION!\n\nAnd, oh...what's that?

As such, so is his hit box and AoE effects. Also, Dragonzilla gains an additional 50% extra health from all effects.\n\nQ: Cone of Fire - Dragonzilla, is still a dragon. So he breaths fire. Lots of it. Everywhere. For a long cone in front of him, Dragonzilla channels a flame dealing magic damage to all enemies inside the flame.\n\nW: DRAGONzilla - Hes a dragon, so he can fly; but not for long, because of how big he is. Dragonzilla jumps/flys a short distance, ignoring terrain. When he lands, he deals damage to nearby enemies and knocks them back.\n\nE: Fear Me - Dragonzilla roars as never before..literally, *as never before*. Each time Dragonzilla uses this ability, it gains a small amount of range and damage. All enemies hearing the scream take damage and are feared for a short period.\n\nR: The Government is Involved: Passive: Where ever dragonzilla goes, the army is after him. At all times there is a small army of Yordels chasing him down. They will attack him on sight, but will also attack anything else that looks scary (namely, non-allied champions) - dragonzilla moves twice as fast as they do. When he backs, they back 8 seconds later. Cannot be shot by fountain or turrets, or selected to attack.

One could in theory build him tank, but he would deal zero damage, and it would make all his abilities null. I want the champion to be forced to build AP, but then rely on his auto attacks to build up overtime, using his abilities to stay on the champion and to deal extra damage, without being able to burst the enemy champion instantly, making skill a necessity. That's who Salveon would be. The ult would be exactly what it was called, a last resort. He gains resistances and tons of damage, but also inflicts bodily harm to himself due to the heat of the flames he is conjuring. Using this as either an engage to a teamfight, or as a last choice when the summoner accepts his defeat.\nI'd like some advice on it if possible.\n\n\n***Lore:***\nFound sword.\nFamily Died.\nCliche extra story.\nBlah Blah Blah Injustice.\nMagic.\nCan wield fire based on passion for justice.\nBlah Bah Blah kills all who oppose him.","replies":[{"poster":"EMOFRATPARTY","date":"2014-08-02T06:17:07.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite part is the story.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dankest of Meme","date":"2014-08-01T21:37:20.880+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine would be a homeless man in a chicken costume pushing a shopping cart","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeluxeOreo","date":"2014-08-01T18:30:38.815+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"DeluxeOreo\n\nPassive: Milk; Taunting an enemy dipping yourself in milk will grant 5hp regen every second over 1 minute.\n\nQ - Oreo Toss; tosses out an Oreo dealing 2% of current targets health + 80 Dmg (lvl 1)\n\nW- Split; splitting in half, any attacks aimed at the centre of you will miss, however any attacks that hit the split ends of you will receive the damage.\n\nE- Crave; Makes an enemy crave your creamy goodness, bringing them towards you in a daze for 0.5 seconds (scales higher with lvl)\n\nR- Lick; Causes  enemies to not resist temptation of your chocolaty amazingness, any target within basic attack range will Lick you while taking damage from multiple spinning Oreo's for 3.5 seconds.\n\nMage\nSecondary- Tank\n\n{{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaperAxe","date":"2014-08-05T17:49:35.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PaperAxe The Paper Weapon\n\n\nPassive: I'm Paper!\n\nLowers max health by 1 on every attack permanently\n\nQ: S**T Papercut.\ncause the enemy to bleed for 1-5 damage every 10 seconds until they die or base\n\nW: White Glue\nadds 10-50 health permanently\n\nE: Fire axe\nIncreases move speed by 100 + 20%\nand you leave a trail of fire behind you costs 10 health per second\nthe fire is actually paper and does no damage j\n\n\nOrigami rage\nDeals 200400-600 + 4x your I'm paper Stacks + stuns for 2 seconds as they're over come with rage from used paper when trying to do origami","replies":[]},{"poster":"TinySparrow23","date":"2014-08-04T19:27:47.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Defence21\n\nPassive: Defensive Reactions\nEach time Defence21 is attacked by an Enemy Champion, he gains Armor or Magic Resist depending on if the attack dealt was Physical Damage or Magical Damage, respectively.

It explained that it had been a magus from before the most recent Rune War who specialized in water elemental and transformative magics. During the height of the Rune War was when he had been cursed to remain in his battle form, and to have his name forgotten, by a vanquished foe. As no cure for his curse could be found at the time, he was placed into hibernation until the cure became possible.

I made a druid and I needed a druidic sounding name. I knew nothing (and still know next to nothing) about druids. I don't remember my process but I eventually settled on this collection of sounds as a very manly, druidic name (Brie-Deh-Roe). I wasn't always Brydaro . When I played WoW I became Elfenheimer and Kooker (NE Hunter, Gnomish Warrior). XBLA I went by another name, and on PSN I became Otto Dafei.\n\nThe biggest threat facing me right now is not assimilating well into adulthood. I'm 21 and I don't have the presence of mind nor the will power I expected to have by now. I've disappointed my younger selves and I'm trying to get myself moving forward in life. Because of this, I decided to retake the name Brydaro, because an 8 year old me decided that was the manliest sounding name he could think of. I try to meet the standards that boy had for this man, and striving to do so have improved my life a little. \n\nTL;DR: Brydaro is an old name.\n\nWith all that in mind, I suppose the best representation of Brydaro would be a bastardization of the abridged and fluffed druid and an aztec warrior. He would wield a traditional wooden Chimalli and a Macuahuitl. He would be wearing an eagle headdress and printed leather armor. He would of course have to be around 5'8\"ft tall, and built lightly; but by no means weakly.\n\nPassive - Eagle Totem: Brydaro generates an Eagle totem every 40s. It lasts only a minute and temporarily (until used) replaces Brydaro's trinket. When placed it takes on the active whatever Trinket Brydaro has. This includes scanning the area immediately around the totem, briefly providing extended vision or merely lasting an additional 0/20/40s depending on rank of Trinket. In addition to the standard effects of a trinket, these eagle totems provide Brydaro with an additional 10/20/30AD and 5/7/10% of his health while within a certain range of the trinket. \n\nQ - Savage Strike: Brydaro dashes to a target just outside of melee range and strikes with dealing 100% AD and causing he target to bleed for an additonal 2/4/6/8/10% of thier max health over 10s.\n\nW - Beastmaster: Brydaro summons one of 3 jungle animals (at random) to aid him for the next 10s\n       Puma - The Puma strikes every time Brydaro strikes dealing 50% of his damage and increasing the bleeding damage of Savage Strike by      1/2/3/4/5%\n       Dog - The Dog will strike every time Brydaro strikes dealing 25% of his damage, and slowing the target by 3/6/9/12/15%, attacking their legs and feet.\n       Jaguar - The Jaguar patrols nearby bushes granting true sight. The Jaguar converts all of Brydaro's damage to magic damage.\n\nE - Sun God's Blessing: Brydaro is bathed in sunlight, granting him true sight within 400u and cauterizing fresh wounds, healing him for 30% of all damage done in the last 10s over the next 3s.\n\nR- Heart Taker: Brydaro attempts to take his victim's heart, dealing 200/300/400(+.20AD) true damage.
