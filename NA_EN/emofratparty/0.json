While the embedding feature is great, it can be inefficient when linking something akin to a Google Doc.\r\n\r\nNow instead of formatting, I just have the document itself embedded into the post, which is not what I wanted.  Any ideas on solutions, or whether or not there are any?\r\n\r\nScreenshot attached for clarity.","replies":[{"poster":"MaliceCity","date":"2014-09-26T18:56:06.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm that one is a bit tricky. We are going to be rolling out a fix soon that will let you link to content without it auto-embedding which should help this. We could probably fix the treatment that google docs embeds get as well, but that will take a bit more time.

It's great to know that you're at least working on it, regardless of duration.\n\nBy the way, links in comments *do not* auto-embed.  Not sure if you could cross some of that functionality to actual post content, but thought it might be worth knowing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-09-26T19:50:25.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hmm that one is a bit tricky.
