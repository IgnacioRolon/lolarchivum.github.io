I'm not name calling, I'm not trash talking or being toxic.  I wasn't flaming and all comments are factual and an attempt to be productive.  Keep in mind there isn't the context of game play, pings, other teammates response and an effect and not the cause.  Did I get trolled?  Yep.  Did I let what was happening in game get to me and affect my game/get tilted?  Guilty.  Upset? yes; frustrated? yes; but seriously, this is ridiculous.  A few admitted expletives but not directly at anyone, and even attempts to not use the words themselves.  If you can't tell, my adc and mid are feeding their faces off, making painfully obvious and preventable mistakes, and I am patiently (patient for me anyway) trying to plead with them WITHOUT being toxic.  I could see if I was just being shitty for no reason, spewing garbage, trying to incite anger, inting, trolling.  But this is one human trying to communicate with another human.  Am I not allowed to be angry when someone doesn't take something serious that I take serious, and that should be since it's ranked, my time, LP, energy?  Isn't this a little extreme?  I see far, far worse go unpunished.  I mean, let's be objective here: It's a competitive game, in real time.  Do you, riot, not expect any emotion or passion and that it may go uncensored?  It's not like I am just going off the rails and unloading without any provocation in in-game chat is my point and I get a 25 game chat ban?

Stop harassing me please.\n\nC) \"The only reason you would threaten to report someone is to coerce them to do something you want them to do, or to stop doing something you don't\"  No shit sherlock?

I'm trying to get them use some common sense.  Clearly I need more work in my delivery, I admit, but wtf did it become a crime?\n\nD) \"Nobody is punching you in the face. You're using incomparables here.\"  It's a metaphor and it is comparable, whether you want to agree to disagree or not.  The problem here is you can police speech all you want because it's nice and concise, but nothing is done to police behavior, i.e. players playing horrendously, most times intentionally and out of spite.  Once upon a time, used to be able to report folks for being \"unskilled\".  I'm going to wager that riot found that colossal undertaking in and of itself and removed it because it would be all they did all day.  Let me break it down for you.  Player A can play as bad as he wants to, he can sell all of his items and buy tears, run in circles spamming his emote, dropping wards at the fountain, etc.  He can feed his face off, ragesplit, bait his team into committing  to plays and dipping out... literally any number of troll moves and not get punished as long as he doesn't say a word. This is toxic BEHAVIOR, i.e. the punch to the face.  Now, if I speak out against it, or try to encourage different behavior, or coerce as you want to put it, I'm the villain?  I agree maybe not the best use of my time, but then we're playing a video game and debating on chat forums, so what's new?  But, this is some millennial shit man.  Which brings me to...\n\nE)  \"if someone's doing something reportable, you can just report them and be done with it.\"  There's the million dollar problem, you hit it right on the head.  Behavior that I've outlined should be reportable and punishable, more so than words typically because it's what causes the words to begin with (see face-punch thought exercise).  Just because it's not that way right now, doesn't make it right.  You don't like what some is saying, you can mute them, which makes all of this painfully difficult for me wrap my head around,  yet I have no recourse for aberrant play/behavior.\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-07-31T23:02:17.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You asked for an explaination,  so I gave you one.\n\n You can dislike the explaination and use counter arguements as much as you want, but it's Riot's rules, not yours.\n\nThe reason why you would threaten for reports is so that you can punish someone.

This is insanity.\n\nThis is from the support article [Reporting a Player](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884#h2q2): \n\n>**Things to avoid**\n\n>* Do not threaten or repeatedly tell a player you will report them. Doing so can encourage players who are already negative to continue their behavior. Whether they know they are being reported or not has no bearing to whether the system will act on them. But most importantly, repeatedly threatening or arguing with a negative player can end up derailing the game for everyone else and then open yourself up to reports and possible disciplinary action as well. Avoid negative thoughts and useless chatting with poor performing teammates! Focus on victory by muting the offending player and then reporting them at the end of the game.\n\n>* Do not ask other players in the match to report the offending player. It only takes one report for our systems to review a game. Additional reports will not do anything for the offending player; however as mentioned above, it could open yourself up to a report of your own; especially if you are derailing the match by constantly demanding reports of other players.\n\n>* Negative behavior is **unacceptable** regardless of the circumstances or who started it. It can be tempting to respond to negative players with negativity of your own. Our systems do not care who started the behavior and will treat each reported player based off the merits of their own case. The only way to handle these types of players is to mute them and continue playing the game followed by giving them a report at the end of the match.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-07-31T21:07:16.180+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because something is \"factual\" doesn't mean it also can't be toxic/flame.","replies":[{"poster":"Aladoron","date":"2019-08-01T12:00:57.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The lovely \"facts hurt my feelings\" argument &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Bad Degenerate","date":"2019-08-01T12:31:58.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's trying to say that the way those facts are conveyed can hurt.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2019-07-31T21:07:11.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn’t any real reason to keep harping on them, it won’t make them play better.
