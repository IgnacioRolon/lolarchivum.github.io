Usually when those Play or Reconnect buttons turn grey it's because the client isn't detecting any connection with the servers. I would first make sure to cover the basics with the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and try using an ethernet cable instead if this happens often. \n\nIf that's not helping, I'd go ahead and hit up the techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your network logs to see what's going on.\n\nYou shouldn't be getting any punishments if this was just the first time either. You'll only get punished if it starts happening rather often.","replies":[]}]}
