She got Ap ratios on 3 out of 4 skills, the dmg is just absurd if you can land a e + r combo, ppl often doesnt know how to play against it so that's a huge advantage for the player, and still ppl thinks it's a troll pick. I stayed on team builder for 50+min, constantly getting kicked [ and luckly found a group that allowed me to stay ] and getting told \"ap mf is a troll pick, gtfo\"\r\n\r\n\"But she is supposed to be a adc\" Ap tristana says hello to you my friend\r\n\r\nYet, Ap tristana is not a troll pick and is a \"kill or be killed\" mage, while Ap miss fortune can safely poke from afar and dodge skillshots thanks to her passive.","replies":[]}
