Nonetheless, whenever I come to the boards, there are 100s of daily post claiming to be unfairly chat banned.\n\nWhat&#039;s the point of this post?\nI am legitimately curious as to what you guys are saying that warrants a ban. I cuss, insult and taunt people every game and nobody ever mutes or reports me. I pretty much tell me my lane opponent, &quot;You (effing) suck lol&quot; every game while harassing them for the entirety of the match. Still honored by teammates and receive friend requests from enemies every game.\n\nSo how far beyond the realm of relevant trash talk do you have to go to warrant a ban?\nIn my 100s of games of shenanigans, I&#039;ve never crossed that line.\n\n**TL;DR** What outlandish things are you guys saying to get you banned?","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-11-19T00:30:19.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trash talk and toxicity is very different, trash talking points out small mis-plays or lack of skill and a minor level.\n\ntrash talking is things like \"nice flash\" or \"can't even hit a single skillshot\"\n\ntoxicity is \"I hope you fucking die\" or \" Lmfao you are actually fucking garbage\"\n\nthe difference is huge, so you might not be a great human being, but you are not bad enough to get banned/","replies":[{"poster":"Raw Booty Hole","date":"2018-11-19T01:01:34.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=35E7Bgw1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-19T00:30:19.560+0000)\n>\n> Trash talk and toxicity is very different, trash talking points out small mis-plays or lack of skill and a minor level.\n> \n> trash talking is things like &quot;nice flash&quot; or &quot;can&#x27;t even hit a single skillshot&quot;\n> \n> toxicity is &quot;I hope you fucking die&quot; or &quot; Lmfao you are actually fucking garbage&quot;\n> \n> the difference is huge, so you might not be a great human being, but you are not bad enough to get banned/\n\nWishing death on somewhere is absurd, people do that over video games? lmfao #losers\nBut I'm definitely guilty of calling people \"complete trash\" if I pick up a double kill on enemy laner and jungler","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-11-18T23:32:23.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">What outlandish things are you guys saying to get you banned?\n\nI mean, most of the people that come here to argue against their ban also post their chat logs so you can go see for yourself.
