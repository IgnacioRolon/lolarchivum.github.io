Neeko, Zoe, Pyke, Kaisa, and soon Sylas. All agile mega-nuke damage dealers (arguably with very obnoxious overpowered abilities). I&#039;m getting really tired of the game being centered around champions like this.  I look forward to champion developers sitting down and creating a champion with a positive impact on the game that aren&#039;t one-shot execute style champions, rather than coming up with whatever is the most ridiculous, colorful, and high damage dealing champion. \nI think this turn towards mobile assassin style champions reflects what is wrong in this game. It feels absolutely terrible to play right now, with most of the champions in the game building to one shot. Also listening to Tyler1&#039;s stream right now and he just said &quot;Riot&#039;s balance team can&#039;t tie their own shoes&quot;. Lol. But actually we&#039;ve been waiting a long time for proper balance changes hopefully they decide to turn the game around.","replies":[{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-01-17T10:51:42.558+0000","up_votes":34,"down_votes":3,"body":"That is a huge problem in general with League right now.\nThe game developers /think/ this makes the game more exciting which will entice people to watch eSports.\nUnfortunately, this will fail and will cost them money long term.\nThe game will be weakened severely from this mentality if it is not fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Vah Medoh","date":"2019-01-17T14:11:32.978+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"Since they started to add missions like \"Watch eSport/worlds\" they know that they are losing players/viewers.

People who can't dodge skillshots complained. How different is to die in 1 combo after she hits you with bubble and a max distance Q and a Lux or a Syndra, who can poke you through minions and if you get hit by their skillshot cc you're as dead as fast as if you got hit by Zoe's E. The answer is, Zoe was new, more people would be playing her (how often do you actually see Lux/Syndra mid now?), the flavor of the month.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xaritscin","date":"2019-01-18T18:30:14.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can only complain about {{champion:555}} in this case. an Assasin should never have hard CC on his kit, EVER. {{champion:245}} is fine becaue it requires setup but pyke doesnt have to setup anything he just does the dash almost instantly and stuns you without a proper frame of time to respond.\n\n{{champion:518}} is fine as long as you dodge her habilities, and her ult is as unreliable as {{champion:143}}. you can just simply walk outside of the AoE (unless you got CC'ed)\n\n{{champion:142}} was a mess to play against but she got nerfed heavily after release and i barely see her, the damage se can throw depends a lot on setup so you just have to be on the lookout for the projectiles (much like with {{champion:76}}  back then)\n\n{{champion:145}} seems balanced, i play her regularly and im pretty sure you need to push way more effort in order to nuke someone compared to other marksmen that are being picked up(*cough* {{champion:202}} , {{champion:21}} *cough*)","replies":[{"poster":"hazerddex","date":"2019-01-18T22:43:00.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xaritscin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6yyeg1bu,comment-id=0020,timestamp=2019-01-18T18:30:14.284+0000)\n>\n> i can only complain about {{champion:555}} in this case. an Assasin should never have hard CC on his kit, EVER. {{champion:245}} is fine becaue it requires setup but pyke doesnt have to setup anything he just does the dash almost instantly and stuns you without a proper frame of time to respond.\n> \n> {{champion:518}} is fine as long as you dodge her habilities, and her ult is as unreliable as {{champion:143}}. you can just simply walk outside of the AoE (unless you got CC&#x27;ed)\n> \n> {{champion:142}} was a mess to play against but she got nerfed heavily after release and i barely see her, the damage se can throw depends a lot on setup so you just have to be on the lookout for the projectiles (much like with {{champion:76}}  back then)\n> \n> {{champion:145}} seems balanced, i play her regularly and im pretty sure you need to push way more effort in order to nuke someone compared to other marksmen that are being picked up(*cough* {{champion:202}} , {{champion:21}} *cough*)\n\n{{champion:142}}  is old school {{champion:76}}  which is probably why i don't find her anywhere near as dangerous as some of the new blood players. her q is easy to predict not to mention if your a mid laner you have a very useful item that counter the one time you don't dodge or aren't behind minions. {{item:3163}}{{item:3814}}  if your ad mid {{item:3102}}{{item:3157}}   if your ap mid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2019-01-17T17:27:11.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with your points, but Neeko doesn't have a mobility spell (technically if she gets the third attack off on her W passive, but that's within her auto attack range, not too safe)","replies":[{"poster":"Roark1","date":"2019-01-17T23:17:21.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Casting her clone grants a short burst of movement speed, and especially within a teammate fight she is able to get into the backline and blow up everyone because her R scaling is so high and the R range is so large.

However, I personally like them all because they are unique. Let me explain;\n\nWith Neeko it's **fun to play against** her, like good shaco or Evelynn players for instance might enjoy playing her. It's very cool that Riot adds deception based gameplay as I see that as a conduit for the future of MoBAs generally. It adds other options to win fights,\nreally testing players' intelligence and instincts.\n \nNow with Kai'sa I enjoy her W which is important because she is a **hybrid**AD and/or AP. \nHybrids are a classic but rare archetype just as sneaky and tactical micromanager assassins are. Now her W gives her a long-range harassment or execute option, crucial to her AP builds because in theory she could go mid. However because her W(and whole kit in general) are on such a long CD and that she's squishy, she obviously goes bot. \nShe is a hybrid with many options, and options are always good imo.\n\nZoe is an erratic example of a knight in chess, able to secure poke in otherwise (almost) impossible ways for other champions. I do question the ability to pick up item actives and summs, but it's a minor issue for me. It takes understanding capability and adapting to it which is as simple or complex as walking on the enemy half of the river to avoid a jungle gibb. Map awareness in general is one of the first skills you must learn in League for this reason.\n\n\nAnywho that's just what I think, cheers","replies":[]}]}
