I've had a terrible issue with getting out of bronze I've never even made it to the promos and have won 5/20 games because we either get a person who leaves or someone messes up and the team continues to harass them till everything is haywire. I usually pick a safe role which would be support so I can ensure we have wards in the right places and babysit my ADC if they are cautious like I am. I would not say I'm bad at league but I been losing massive amounts of LP even when I try to tell my team to calm down and correct them in what they could do better. \r\nMy real question is what other role would you suggest to play to ensure victory for my team. I understand it's more of a teamwork effort but I need a role that's going to probably be the reason we won and some good champions that are currently really good to use. Thank you in advance for your information shared.","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-08-21T04:10:21.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rules of Thumb:\n\n1. Pick what you're good with, not what's considered \"in-meta\". This is one almost everyone knows, but you can't make a list of Rules of Thumb without it.\n\n2. Avoid counterpicking yourself, so long as your pick stays within rule #1; you don't want to make the game unnecessarily difficult.\n\n3. Full-AD comps are bad. The thornmails are real. Your team needs to be really on top of it in order to keep the objective focus you usually need to win with a full-AD comp.\n\n4. Stay positive. If your teammate screws up, give them a \"damn, bad luck\" sort of comment. If someone's raging at someone other than you, try to calm them both down; if that fails, just ignore it/mute them. If multiple players are all flaming each other, either ignore it or mute them all. If you're getting flamed, what usually works for me is responding with stuff like \"luv u 2 bb <3\", which both entertains me and sometimes defuses the rager.\n\n5. If your team looks like they're still trying to win the game, don't surrender.\n\n6. If you see team members that have given up trying to win, surrender. You need your team behind you to come back.\n\n7. You're the one that screwed up. Keep this mindset. Thinking how your allies lost a game for you doesn't help; you can only improve yourself.\n\n8. Objectives over kills. If you can get a turret or dragon, stop chasing Udyr halfway across the map for a minute and get the free gold.\n\n9. Don't mistake an unoccupied objective for a free one. If they aren't on your minimap, they might well be after whatever it is you're taking.\n\n10. This is my own personal rule, but some people have found it helpful before: Always play as if your summoners are down. Don't expect them to be available. Ever. Play with that mindset, and you'll get yourself in a lot less trouble, and when you do find yourself in a pinch, Flash might actually be up when you need it, for once :)\n\nThat's about all I've got, not sure how helpful any of it will be, but here it is.\nGood luck out there on the Rift, m8!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-08-21T03:33:03.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions like Talon and Fizz in the mid lane are great for snowballing a game out of control (provided you're good with them). Getting an early lead, then roaming around and destroying other lanes is a great way to ensure your team has a huge advantage. Jungle is also a good role because they can affect every lane, though it does take a lot of game knowledge and good decision making to be an effective jungler. Overall though, you can carry in every lane; it's difficult at low elo because your teammates are really hit-or-miss much of the time. Overall you're not going to win every game, but as long as you win the majority of them, you'll advance in rank. Don't get discouraged, always be looking to improve your own game, seek out information from better players (lastshadow on youtube gives really great advice, steamers like Bjergsen and Nightblue3 are great teachers), if you find yourself feeling or playing poorly take a break, and try to stay positive. The throws at low elo are insane, with good teamwork there's usually a way to come back. Just remember you're not alone; even high elo players have trouble getting out of Bronze; some games you just can't carry, but most games *are* winnable. Best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
