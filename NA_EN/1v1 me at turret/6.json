{"poster":"1v1 Me At Turret","date":"2015-04-13T04:10:42.462+0000","title":"Toxicity: A Symptom of Humanity","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":24,"down_votes":11,"body":"Hello fellow summoners!\n\nSo I haven't been as inspired as of late to post anything worth reading and I do feel I have let a few of those who used to enjoy my threads down... so first let me apologize. I guess I just wanted a small break from taking everything seriously and thus... let the quality of my posting be hindered because of it. So in that regards I would like to apologize... Luckily, there is Riot to continue to inspire me to write on behalf of the community, which brings me to tonight's thread. \n\nTonight I asked to speak to a certain Rioter to look into a player behavior issue for a friend... and in doing so I let it slip that I don't necessarily see eye to eye with Lyte. (Who knew?) So in doing so, the Rioter asked me simply... why I don't see eye to eye with Lyte. (I guess he didn't think I would make a fuss about anything, or would post something silly in response like... \"I got banned.\") Well, as soon as I was getting into the discussion as to what I feel ails the community... he did what every other Rioter has done in the past when it comes to me, which is run as far away with your tail tucked between your legs and finished the convo off by stating he didn't want to have this discussion anymore. I'm going to include the conversation but for the sake of this Rioter's privacy... I will not be including anything outside of Riot in his name, the other portion will be whited out. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JMyBrvl.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mAnXWef.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1M9wezf.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HX6IRFQ.png\n\nNow, I've been very professional and polite when it comes to Lyte's plunders and how they have mismanaged this community time and time again... but I will say this is taking cowardice to a new low. When someone comes at you with constructive criticism... this is how you are trained to handle it? No. It isn't. This just further proves my argument that Riot's staff is incompetent at what they do... but that isn't what I wish to discuss today. I want to finish what I had to say with you, the community. You deserve to see what I have to say just as much as this person did, so with that... here we go. \n\nToxicity. It is a word we hear countless times over countless threads but it never stops being an issue. We always hear about how Riot is combating toxicity, but no matter what they say... it doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. We keep having numbers thrown at us saying it's going down but we never get any sources saying otherwise while most of us can safely say most of our games have at least one person that deserves to be punished by Riot's standards. Some days it seems like the problem is even worse... but what causes toxicity? Is it the actual problem? Or is it the symptom of something else? Now, I'm not saying it is right to be a complete asshole in game... nor do I support people who tell others they should kill themselves... but I do feel that things won't be getting better if we continue to follow Lyte's lead. \n\nWhat is toxicity?\n\nToxicity is defined as the behavior of someone who is less than polite, who will behave in a manner that will dampen the mood of those around them... and who has no remorse for their own actions. I feel the first issue we have with toxicity is the definition itself. Yes, toxic behavior is infectious to other players... but it isn't something that can be defined so broadly. I feel it comes in two types. \n\n1) Trollers: Those who instigate toxic behavior... those who push the buttons of the players around them for their own amusement. Issue with trollers is by Riot's rules... they aren't necessarily in the wrong as long as they aren't offensive. They aren't just toxic... but a core proponent of toxicity in games. \n\n2) You: Yes. You are now or at some point will become toxic. Toxicity is infectious and isn't just something found in certain types of personalities. You might not be toxic in game, but somewhere at some point you have been out of line... yelled at someone... or said something that you later regret. This is a natural reaction to stimuluses that are outside of your control. This is the main reason why toxicity should mainly be defined as a symptom, and not a problem. Although some are more prone to reacting, I would bet that even the most patient of individuals still has their limit when it comes to tolerance. This doesn't excuse the behavior, in any shape or form. \n\nWhat causes toxicity?\n\nTo be honest, there isn't an exact cause to what you or I experience. Everything happens on an individual basis. Each individual responds to each stimulus in their own, unique fashion... either internally or externally. In game toxicity has a few specific stimuli that can be combated, those stimuli are as follows... (Understand I won't be talking about all stimuli... just the two I feel are most... important)\n\n1) Trolls: As discussed above, these are toxic individuals who will purposefully manipulate the rules to allow them to hinder the gameplay of their fellow summoners for their own enjoyment. Obviously the best way to combat this is amending the rules to help Rioters punish those instigating vs those who are being instigated more, thus alleviating the problem in most games.\n\n2) Consistency in teams: Now, this is a tricky one... but currently, MMR isn't accurate enough of a system to make games consistent enough to put you with players of your similar caliber. Some games you will hop in, your team is communicating and performing as it should while others... it almost feels like you are smurfing pre-30 and your teammates are just now getting a handle on the game. There are a few causes of this... but the largest agitator when it comes to MMR is Elo Boosting. Once MMR becomes more accurate... I would be willing to bet you would see a drastic drop in toxicity, especially in Ranked solo queue games. \n\n3) Elo Boosting: Now, as much as it puts players in the wrong MMR... making the match making system even more inaccurate than it already is... This also causes an inflated ego in most players that purchase these types of services seeing as most purchase them because \"they feel they deserve this rank\" regardless of looking at their own performance/growth in the game. Obviously Riot is doing their best to combat this... but until then, Elo Boosting will be a problem. \n\nFeel free to leave any criticisms to this below...\n\nOtherwise as per usual... \n\n@Baconhawk @Frosthaven @Pendragon @Lyte @Player behavior @Riot @WookieCookie @Riot Chomey @Tamat @KateyKhaos @Meddler\n\nEdit:\nTo stop people from derailing over and over... IT WAS RIOT CHOMEY! \n\nUpdate:\n\nSpoke with another Rioter today and while I was talking to them... the subject of Chomey came up and I can confirm he DOES work in Player Behavior. ","replies":[]}
