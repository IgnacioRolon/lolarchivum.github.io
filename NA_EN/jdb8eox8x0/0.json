So basically, Elementalist Lux itself unlocks you 5 icons, Lux and the skin, whereas the Master Edition unlocks you multiple content alongside the Elementalist Lux skin itself. Then it wasn't a mistake, but instead a misunderstanding I guess. Thanks anyway! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-12-09T20:48:16.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ophelia Dusk,realm=EUW,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=MWnyNsTV,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-12-08T13:24:32.852+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the clarification.
