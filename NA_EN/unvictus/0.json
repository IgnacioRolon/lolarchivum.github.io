{"poster":"Unvictus","date":"2018-06-12T16:11:44.035+0000","title":"Riot, you deserve every ounce of negative feedback you're gonna get for the Garen and Darius skins","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":7,"down_votes":14,"body":"Riot this is nothing short of an outrage. For years you have gotten hate for giving certain champions more skins than others and up until now I stood by your decisions and understood why you did so. Some champs are simply easier to make skins for, some make more revenue, some just simply fit the skin line you wanted to produce, etc... This however is a disgrace and you clearly haven&#039;t learned a thing over the years in terms of the community&#039;s feedback as far as skins go. And because of that I feel no sympathy for you in the slightest for all the hate you&#039;re gonna get for giving Darius ANOTHER DAMN LEGENDARY SKIN! Its actually mind blowing that you would pull something like this. I just can&#039;t believe with a whole roster full of champions who only have few or no high quality skins (especially legendary skins) that you give Darius another one. And don&#039;t even think about bringing up Cho&#039;Gath or Tristana. Both of those champions are very old and received their first legendary skins back when skins as a whole were very low quality. Meanwhile, we have Darius whom was given Dunkmaster approximately 3.5 years ago, getting another legendary skin. \n\nNow the following argument is heavily biased, but please hear me out. Now before I start, let me state that I know Katarina just received a Death Sworn skin back in November but I&#039;m going to make a pitch that she could&#039;ve fit the skin line just as well. First off Katarina does not have a legendary skin despite being a very old champion and being one of Riot&#039;s main poster children for the game practically from the beginning. She would&#039;ve fit this skin line just as well and could&#039;ve been named God Queen. The description on the teaser post actually led me to believe that she had a chance at receiving the skin as her and Darius both seemed to connect with the lingo used. This is quite clearly another take at a VS. event and it would&#039;ve made just as much sense for it to be Garen vs Katarina due to their very obvious ties through lore. Deep down I knew that them giving it to Darius was a possible reality but I truly believed it favored Kat because Darius already has a legendary skin. I feel like this specific argument contains some valid points but if you wish to debunk it in favor of the fact that Kat has too many skins then so be it. It doesn&#039;t however change the validity of my initial argument and the fact that only 33 champions have legendary skins (I might have counted wrong). Meaning a majority of the roster is without a high quality skin such as a legendary skin and here Riot is giving Darius a second one. \n\nI personally do not care for either skin and will not be purchasing either one. However, even if I did I would refuse to purchase them and if any of you feel the way I do about them giving Darius another legendary skin then I encourage you to join me in boycotting the skins. It&#039;s time for them to really listen to us about skins. I truly appreciate Riot&#039;s statements about welcoming feedback and how they say even though they don&#039;t always respond, they are listening. However, I think the best way to really get our point across is simply to not buy the skins.\n\nTLDR: I have no sympathy for Riot in the slightest for the amount of negative feedback might and probably will get for giving Darius another legendary skin despite over 75% of the roster being left without one.","replies":[{"poster":"WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOO","date":"2018-06-12T16:24:19.792+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really donâ€™t think this requires outrage","replies":[]},{"poster":"MattQ101","date":"2018-06-12T16:58:58.431+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do agree kat should get a legendary skin, but Garen and Darius fit the VS really well and the theme of the vs and the relationship between Darius and Garen as rivals fit the VS event perfectly.

As far as I am concerned that is a pretty big lore tie for a Vs skin series.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ivaine West","date":"2018-06-12T21:33:07.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Darius deserve another legendary skin yes  ! more legendary skins for a legendary champ like him {{champion:122}}  {{sticker:darius-angry}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nylisa","date":"2018-06-12T17:30:05.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There was a time when i thought, if Riot explain why they make these decisions, it would help me understand and deal with the things i'm not happy with. but after their responses about Lux's latest skin during Chinese new year i don't think that would help anymore.\n\ni'm a bit sad because Noxus and Demaica are two of the regions that got updated fairly recently compared to some other regions but they are choosen once again while Freljord , bandle city , Zaun , Piltover etc are still in line.\n\nAs for the Quality of the skins themselves. they seem fine at the moment. can't say much more until i see them in game and PBE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-06-12T17:07:48.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"All the 0 outrage theyre gunna get.\n\nhttps://goo.gl/images/N3EXdQ","replies":[]}]}
