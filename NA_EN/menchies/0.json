I have noticed this for about a month and a half now, but it&#039;s started to bug me sooo much that I don&#039;t even want to use Astro or Omega skins that much anymore. Maybe I&#039;m wrong though and it&#039;s supposed to be like this, but I&#039;m pretty sure its not.\n\nIf it is a bug, Please try and fix this in the next little while, I don&#039;t care if it takes a week or a month, I just want it done eventually.\n\nSorry if you don&#039;t appreciate the layout of this post, this is my first time reporting a bug on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2016-05-17T01:18:41.183+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SlimeyBoyRioy,\n\nI'm a skins audio dude. Just looked into this for ya, everything seemed to be working as intended. Some skins use pieces of the base sounds to create the sound of an ability. In this case, Astronaut Teemo has the same cast sound as base Teemo, but a new laser sound, and laser hit sound. Omega squad has totally new auto attack sounds and was working just fine, playing all of his original audio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vonderhamz","date":"2016-05-17T01:27:22.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, update: I checked out an early skins spotlight of the video, and it seemed like the Cast for Basic Attacks on Astronaut Teemo wasn't working at all. I went ahead and lower the volume by 8dB (about 1.5x quieter). It'll still be there for gameplay feedback, but should be less obtrusive now. You'll see this out in 6.11 or 6.10!\n\nCheers,\n\nVonderhamz","replies":[{"poster":"Menchies","date":"2016-05-17T15:28:39.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vonderhamz,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=0HT6is8z,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-17T01:27:22.647+0000)\n>\n> Actually, update: I checked out an early skins spotlight of the video, and it seemed like the Cast for Basic Attacks on Astronaut Teemo wasn&#x27;t working at all.

I love the skin to bits, but the auto attack noises just feel so inconsistent with Teemo's autos. It would be great if it's fixed in the near future! :D","replies":[]}]}]}
