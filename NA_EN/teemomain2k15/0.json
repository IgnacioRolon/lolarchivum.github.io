I play a game called Elsword, which has gameguard security and recently I've tried to launch league while playing Elsword with no avail. That may have altered the PVP.net patcher kernel unknowingly. No errors came up when trying to play both at once League just didn't open. Just to help ya out with what may cause problems with the Kernel. I have successfully launched the launcher now. \n\n~Thank you for the help, love, Jacob. {{champion:103}}","replies":[]}]}]}
