Like I had originally posted, just curious whether those who had paid money for a chroma pack felt it unjustified with the new packs containing 8 and the others not. ;w;'","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-08T05:02:11.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The prices per chroma are the same, the larger bundles cost proportionally more.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-08T00:34:44.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant really think of it as unfair, these same champs you talk about are also the only ones whose chromas could be bought for IP at a point.","replies":[{"poster":"Ammikins","date":"2017-03-08T04:48:40.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RÃ²ssy,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=ATsGqzUW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-08T00:34:44.769+0000)\n>\n> Cant really think of it as unfair, these same champs you talk about are also the only ones whose chromas could be bought for IP at a point.\n\nI agree but I'm more so talking about the amount of chromas. xD i.e. already paid for chroma theme only having 3 over at least 5? Like all the new ones coming out. I get that they changed it for IP worth which is awesome. I'm just saying, more chromas!\n\n\nAlso, sorry if I misunderstand what you wrote. I'm tired.","replies":[]}]}]}
