Blue Team's ADC (Miss Fortune) went 11/5/9 | Did nearly twice as much damage to enemy champs | 241 CS | 14,206 gold  while the Red team's ADC (Ashe) went 5/8/7 | 207 CS | 13,920 gold. Miss fortune was level 15 when the game ended while Ashe was level 16.\r\n\r\nI understand measures were taken to adjust how snowbally the game can get but doesn't this seem a bit off? With the sheer level of kill participation alone, set aside the CS and gold earned, shouldn't MF have been the same level or higher? What's the point of getting so far ahead if it still nets you an experience deficit?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-28T22:00:00.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe there is an experience deficit once you're at a higher level, but I do believe you get more experience if you're falling behind. \n\nMost of the experience you get comes from being near creeps or minions as they die, so it's pretty likely that Ashe was simply around more minions as they were dying.","replies":[]}]}
