The supp champs there have powerful damage abilities that are on the same level, if not in some cases even stronger than normal champs in that game.\nIs Riot somehow trying to turn the supp role that we have now into something more like the one in Dota 2? If yes then this idea is flawed to the bone. AND do not tell me in League you support by dealing damage. I am not reffering to knowing how to trade damage in certain scenarios, but saying the supp role we have should NOT be introduced to insane levels of damage in their abilities.\n\n\nI know this damage creep shitstorm that started being stronger and stronger all the way from S8 up once the Runes Reforged got released won't stop anymore, but why the heck is Riot forcing through, with such conviction, damage over the role that is known since the very beginnings for its trade of protecting your teammates?\n\nNowadays, supports are being introduced slowly with overpowered kits filled with that much offensive power it burries the OG meaning of supports that LoL existed all these years with. \nAnd also the mages lacking any form of mobility are forced to play botlane and build full damage, adding up more fuel to the fire since they outscale normal botlane comps in regards to power scaling.\n\nI am certain supp mains like myself loved the role for how rewarding being able to properly protect and help teammates win could actually be. Therefore I won't understand nor accept this subbit shift that Riot is trying to put into the support role, by having levels of damage unnatural to the role.\n\nI don't want Dota 2 supp concepts in LoL, this is not right. Simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"NY64","date":"2019-12-02T16:01:06.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea what you are talking about, there’s only a senna not doing much dam....

The OG meaning of supports that has existed all these years was a large flaw in the game's design that has taken far too long for riot to address. It made the role far too restrictive and the game is more interesting when a larger variety of champions are allowed into each role. \n\nThat being said, I don't think saying riot is following dota 2's model is really accurate by any measure. Dota 2 tries to make supports function on a much different power curve than other champions. Meanwhile, riot tries to make league supports have a more similar power curve as other roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posui Gart","date":"2019-12-02T14:53:21.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The supp champs there have powerful damage abilities that are on the same level, if not in some cases even stronger than normal champs in that game.\n\nYou probably played some other dota2.\nIn the dota2 I played, items like BKB(magic immunity for 10-5 secs) exist and mages have almost 0 scaling. If your Q does 300 damage at lvl7, it will deal 300 damage at lvl25.\nIts the CC that matters, undodgeable 3+sec targetable CC that can be used after blinking from 2k range away, that matters. Or other utility things they have. Support damage in dota2 falls off hard.\n\nAlso, if you have a problem with mage supports, play a jungler and gank the shit out of bot. It is much easier to gank a Brand support botlane than Janna or Thresh support botlane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draehl","date":"2019-12-02T14:56:34.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not a fan TBH. Overall I'm fine with supports having low gold income IF Riot would reduce burst damage/raise max HP across the board. Right now it feels like you need a bunch of gold for items- either to burst the enemy down or provide enough defense to not get instagibbed. If we were simply allowed to live longer at baseline (with no gold) then we wouldn't need a bunch of gold to play with unless you're specifically playing a carry support.\n\nWhat if the two HP support items had some kind of unique passive- Reduces damage dealt by 30% and reduces damage received by 15%. The two offensive items could go in the other direction and give extra assist gold or something similar?","replies":[]}]}
