Also The rollout post on Surrender@20 with the dates for each region has been mysteriously deleted. Although many people saw it and can confirm probably with screenshots that it was in fact there and both NA and EU were supposed to have it enabled.\n\n\nIf there was a bug a simple post or popup on the client in the warnings section explaining it would've been nice. similar to when you're aware of x problems with servers/store/rp etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Masala Chai","date":"2018-05-03T01:45:58.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't understand this.\n\nI patched to 8.9 yesterday at 3 PM PST utilizing the Korean client, and I was able to change my splash then on the NA server.
