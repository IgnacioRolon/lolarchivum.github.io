I tested this earlier and it seems random. Is it just by every random ability? Or only empowered abilities by R? \r\n\r\nKarmaʻs R cooldown starts 45. I shoot a target with R+Q and I looked and its still 45. I auto one and its still 45. I do regular Q and its still 45. Then I donʻt pay attention during laning phase and somehow the cooldown is at 43 seconds and so on. Can someone explain?","replies":[{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2019-03-28T04:24:02.024+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It reduces the remaining seconds for your ultimate not the actual ultimate cooldown. 43 seconds cooldown is probably because of the cdr per level rune.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-03-28T04:32:24.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all abilities, even those empowered by her R.\n\nIf she hits 3 champions with R >Q, it'll knock 9 seconds off the cooldown.\n\nIf she auto attacks someone, one sec off.\n\nRight now it's Champions that reduce cooldown.
