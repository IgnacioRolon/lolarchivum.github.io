Did not pull my rank backwards?","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Season 8 made Iron and Grandmaster. In my perspective, Iron means \"Lowest of the lowest of players\" and Grandmaster means \"JUST in between Masters and Challenger\". But some people state that it actually just reduced everyone's elo backwards. \r\n\r\nMeaning People who are Bronze are now Iron and Challengers are not Grandmasters. Does that mean im not practically Platinum and im technically Gold elo? \r\n\r\nMe seeing myself almost hitting low Diamond is a boost of confidence to climb. But I also like truth. Am I still technically Gold and me hitting Diamond is just Platinum?","replies":[]}
