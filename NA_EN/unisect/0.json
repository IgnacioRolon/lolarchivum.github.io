But I wanted to download map skins for Summoners rift and when i did that, it worked fine. But I got greedy and downloaded this \"Snow\" textured map that when I launch league, it crashes my league and says I need reinstall league. \r\n\r\nI did that but now it says I need my lol.launcher.exe or admin.exe but they are missing from my Riot games foldier. So I reinstalled the software holding the map skins or league itself again but they are still missing. I even used Hextech repair tool but that didnt help either. So im left leaving myself here to the community...\r\n\r\nLike i said, I did stupid things and I need help gaining my lol.launcher.exe back if anyone knows a way to get them back or where they are?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-20T21:40:33.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeaaaaa it's never good to use third-party apps since you're never sure what they actually are. At this point, I'd suggest using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running it with reinstall AND clean uninstall. After that, you should be able to launch the client with LeagueClient.exe.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailic","date":"2018-02-11T10:12:58.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done that and the Tool said that everything is fine but my Launcher is still completely missing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2017-11-20T04:05:24.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL Launcher hasn't been used for quite a while now. use LeagueClient.exe","replies":[{"poster":"ManInTheMoon","date":"2017-12-13T16:48:06.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My client doesn't work at all... it wont even open, the league of legends logo appears, the processes start up on task manager, but they end a few moments later, and it just wont open, could it be a Windows 10 issue?
