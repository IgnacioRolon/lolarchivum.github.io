HELP","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing LoL for a bit now, and I decided to download it on my laptop. I do so, and it's a bit slow, but that's just my internet. But- when it reached 84%, it just hasn't been moving since. I calculated that the download would take anywhere from 3-4 hours, but its been 7 hours. **Help me please! \r\n\r\n**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T20:19:15.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At 84%, your patcher is downloading files from the patching servers. When you see it hang up at this point, it's a sign that there's an issue keeping a constant connection to those servers. Most of the time a local network setting or configuration is at fault for this, so I suggest working through the steps in our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to address this.\n\nLet me know if you continue to see this issue during patching.","replies":[]}]}
