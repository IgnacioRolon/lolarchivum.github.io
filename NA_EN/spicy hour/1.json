As a person who's had one bugsplat induced leaver penalty, and one client crash queue dodge in the entire time I've played, so not looking to get around anything.\n\nWhat's the incentive to rejoin? If Disconnecting and getting back in has the same penalty as DCing and staying DCed, then why would a person ever want to rejoin and try to help win? Especially since they get no rewards, and still lose LP if they do manage to comeback for a win.\n\nWhy wouldn't a person not just play a different game, until the league one ends, then just eat the penalty they will get no matter what they did?\n\nShouldn't rejoining and helping improve the experience that has been negatively impacted be incentivized through potential for no penalty should you rejoin and win?","replies":[]}]}]}
