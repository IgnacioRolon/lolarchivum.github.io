The only other mid lane champions that are played against him are: {{champion:7}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:90}}. Why? Because all of those aformentioned champions are just as oppressive and safe during laning as Azir is, its just Azir is the best pick because of all of characteristics he holds.

Might still be strong enough, or even too strong, in pro play though.

I'm modelling this post off of the \"Direction\" threads from the mage update.\n\n**What he's good at and his Niche**\n\n*  Damage. Azir should keep his hyper carry status. He's able to do a lot of damage quickly but still isn't \"burst mage.\" How he should do that damage going forward is something I'll bring up later.\n* Range. Azir should keep his range. Just recently I was against a post rework Ryze and I knew that I would absolutely refuse to engage him on his terms. It's so satisfying to be playing a mage and yet feel like you're wielding a spear and keeping someone at the other end of it. That's how Azir at his best should feel to play. Where he gets overbearing is that range ON TOP OF how difficult it is to close that gap and actually touch him.\n* Zone control. Similar to range, Azir is best when he makes the enemy fight where he wants them to fight. The more tools he has to do that the better.\n* SHURIMA! By far what sets Azir apart as a mage is his soldiers and how he commands them. Having to \"auto attack\" instead of casting abilities should be the thing that makes Azir Azir and yet gets lost in the mountain of things he does well.\n\n**What he doesn't, er shouldn't, do well**\n\n* We've established his primary goal should be to keep you at a distance and/or keep you where he wants you to be. However, if you get inside of his \"defenses\" he needs to be vulnerable. Unfortunately he has three ways to ruin your day. He can ult, E away, or E into you getting a shield that may be enough to win. Currently, having a knock back AND an escape is too much. Not to mention that you'll have a flash in every game too. Something has to give. ~~Perhaps he shouldn't be encouraged at all to dive head in. Remove the shield so he's less safe. Maybe his ultimate should do no damage. Perhaps playing around his E mobility should be a more central part of his kit. A longer, static cooldown may make both players AND teams more aware of his high and low points. Especially if it was accompanied with a new visual indicator for when he can cast it. Literal sands shifting around their ruler. TL/DR: No damage on ult, longer E cooldown, more visibility and counter play potential on his mobility.~~ I've decided that for Azir to be balanced shifting sands needs to be removed. This really really really hurts because it's been such an integral and fun part of Azir for so long. And it's the only thing that remotely embodies his \"bird\" aspect where he's able to glide across the battlefield and make plays. He'll need a new E then which I'll touch on later.\n* Early game dominance. Q>Auto>Auto>Thunderlord's is...a disgrace frankly. Commit to the \"hyper carry\" concept and make him weak early on but in more meaningful and visible ways. I have some ideas that I'll touch on last.\n* Q. Azir's Q cooldown should also go up. He should be more about smart placement of his soldiers and about continually spawning them in fights as opposed to constantly trying to reposition them all over the battlefield. As a balance, the slow on it should be more powerful so that being hit buy it is felt in more ways than just damage.\n\n**What I'd like to see Azir become**\n\n* Soldiers. It's bad for the game that Azir can do all the damage he needs with one soldier. Two is plenty and three is gravy. What if needing to get three soldiers on the battlefield before being a threat was a thing. And what if being able to get four or five soldiers all in the same fight was the hallmark of a great Azir? A way to hit his early game dominance while promoting the above playstyle would be to make soldier damage additive. Currently one soldier does 50 damage at level 1. Subsequent soldiers deal a % reduction of that to the same target. What if instead each soldier always does 30. Currently, one soldier is enough with the Q>A>A>TL combo to take most mids to 60% health at level 2. This new system promotes skillful play while taking early power away forcing players to spend more resources BUT getting more damage when played right. Literally as I type this a concern has struck me. Azir's Q scatters the soldiers out into a line. So it'll be nigh impossible to get three soldiers to attack the same target. Hm. But if late game if there are more soldiers out, that last longer, form up tighter, and have adjusted(if needed) radii then that may not be a problem. What if also attacking decreased the recharge rate on soldiers.\n* Zone control. I really like the mental image of Azir's soldiers as an extension of his self. He the body, they the spear. As Azir, you should always be trying to keep the enemy on the pointy end of your spear. So, as mentioned before, his Q having a stronger and longer lasting slow, but becoming less spammable, would be a good way to do that. A decisive use of a Q to put the enemy where you want them. Perhaps his soldiers should have a slow too but that may be to much and he'll get Rylai's anyway. \nHonestly I wonder if a majority of problems with mages right now would disappear if Rylai's was removed. Rylai's is not a utility pick. It's a must buy. Tangent over.\n* E. With the removal of shifting sands Azir needs a new E. I propose that his E is an \"AA\" reset. Upon casting his soldiers will knock up enemy champions hit for .25/.5/1/1.25/1.5 seconds based on level. This gives him more to do as a marksman and timing autos while synergizing with his zoning abilities.\n* R. He may also need a new ultimate. It could be mostly the same but with a few key changes. What if soldiers shot out in all directions around him. At it's start it is a closed circle but at max range it becomes a somewhat loose formation allowing champions to path through. BUT! Unlike the current emperor's divide these soldiers can also attack! This gives Azir some separation but doesn't make him untouchable to certain champions. But to get close to him they must put themselves in a dangerous position.\n\nWhat do you think reader?","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-07-24T11:39:45.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks pretty good mate.

It has gotten me out of tough scrapes and lets me do the famous Shurima Shuffle. But that is the main issue with balancing him. It's like Kalista. She has insane mobility so they had to weaken everything else about her to compensate.\n\nI love doing the shuffle, but in a real fight it usually isn't the best option. If I dare dive into the enemy team, I just handed my enemy a high DPS carry on a silver platter. Even if I get a kill or two out of the shuffle, I would do more good by sitting behind and attacking with my soldiers.\n\nThe Shuffleis honestly just a flashy play and a noob trap to be honest.  His ult should be used for self peel. Now for his E.\n\nAn emperor stands behind his soldiers and fights through them, so he shouldn't be able to dash with his E.\n\nThis encourages the playstyle of standing back and summoning an army to fight for you. With this change we can give Azir back most of his power now that he will  want to set up shop and wreck from one place. You get to him you beat him.\n\nNow to compensate Azir players. Emperors do not only have soldiers, they have bodyguards. I propose that E summons a different sort of sand soldier, a bodyguard. They will work on an ammo system like sand soldiers, but they have a longer cool down and only one can exist at a time.\n\nThey can last at least a minute, and Azir can't move them. They will dutifully follow their emperor. \n\nIf an enemy gets too close, they will charge them, exploding into sand on impact and knocking them back, giving Azir a speed boost depending on the rank of the skill. This gives him an escape but doesn't make him impossible to catch. It gives him a fighting chance.\n\nNow we can let his soldiers do separate damage, giving you a reason to spam soldiers.\n\nHis play style will be to create. Zone of control, a camp if you will. He will command his sold from there with bodyguards to defend from ambush.","replies":[{"poster":"JosephAngelo","date":"2016-07-24T19:01:37.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. His E is really problematic. I think he was designed to be a long ranged DPS hyper carry mage (on his champion profile, he is primarily classified as a mage and his secondary role is Marksman), like AP kog maw and karthus but what is usually associated with long ranged hyper carries is low mobililty and low amounts of CC which is true for kog and karthus yet azir has what I believe to be the longest dash in the game AND argueably the best CC ultimate in the game, which coupled together makes for arguelbly the best combo in the game; it just doesn't fit. It doesn't matter how difficult a champion is to play, no champion should be this overloaded.\n\nHis E is a really fun ability but from a multiplayer game design perspective, when the enjoyment of the nine other players in the game matters, it is very unfair and overwhelming. His E and perhaps even his ultimate should be removed. Classifying him specifically as a zone control DPS hyper carry mage (like karthus and kog Maw) giving him really long range and damage, rewarding him if he positions correctly but also giving him low or no mobility and limited CC.\n\nMy ideas:\n\nReplace his e with Anivia's wall ability. It is exactly the same ability it just looks like a phalanx of soldiers instead of a wall of ice.\n\nReplace his ultimate with an ability that makes a shell of sand soldiers over his body, (like at the end of the movie 300) making him untargetable for 1-4 seconds but during this time he cant do anything. When he comes out, based on how many sand soldiers he has up, he will gain a shield.\n\nAnd let him have a lot of soldiers. Each one does does a fraction of the damage they do now but additional soldiers do 100% additional damage each and Q'ing more than one also stacks the damage.

It would remove memories of the shuffle.\n\nMaybe add the knock up on Azir's E. That way it prevents dashes through the wall.\n\nThe ult is interesting, but how does he escape with it? It has the same issue that Zhonya's has. You just stand around him till it ends than clobber him as soon as it wears off.\n\nMaybe have him knock back champs around him when it ends. (Like in Ascension when you ascend.)\n\nI haven't played long enough to know about that nerf, but that sounds like something that could be given back to him.","replies":[{"poster":"JosephAngelo","date":"2016-07-24T21:08:37.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would miss the shurima shuffle but I am willing to give it up for a healthier game. Which is a game in which azir can't dash 3000 units and ult and entire team wherever he wants AND a game in which azir isn't nerfed every other patch like clockwork (this is demoralizing).\n\nI actually disagree with the wall blocking dashes like his ult does now. I don't think this is fair or healthy. It inhibits counter play. Champions that create terrain (anivia, Taliyah) especially backline hyper carries SHOULD be countered by champions that have dashes to get on top of them even over terrain and kill them (hopefullly) or at least cc them for some time so they don't have an opportunity to do damage to the rest of their team.\n\nAs a dedicated mage and ADC player, I can say that it is frustrating when a renekton dives on top of me and kills me before I can do anything BUT I would say it is ten times more frustrating when I am the renekton player who tries to jump on the azir but he makes a wall that I cant jump over even though I picked a champion who has a dash that can get over walls because I know I am facing a champion who can make a wall.

Actually, because it is terrain, even champions without dashes cant cross. So basically it shuts down.....EVERYONE! :D except people with blinks and teleports like kassadin, ekko katarina.\n\nFor the same reason, I hate yasuo's windwall; it totally shuts down champions with projectiles, which is ALOT of champions. So basically, these two abilities by themselves can make anothers champions entire kit absolutely useless for several seconds.

Two of my favorite mechanics on azir are when I am facing an udyr, I will ult and then kite him around my wall for the full seven seconds while he tries to run around it to get to me. My other favorite thing to do (if you are an azir main you NEED to try this even though it is harder because it only lasts 3 seconds now) ult someone who doesn't have a dash or flash up into a jungle camp, traping them there. I 1v1'ed a pretty fed darius once by ulting him into chickens camp where he just stood there while I auto attacked him. his whole team freaked out when I did it XD.\n\nAnd the idea of him sacrificing his soldiers for a shield I think is really neat.

While the best players in the world are, for obvious reasons, the best examples to take into account when balancing a champion, that is not to say a champion should not be balanced for low elo.

Ryze right now is in a weird place. He is obviously good but people haven't figured him out yet. I know a bunch of TF mains who picked him up and they basically say he is freelo. He didn't lose any damage in the rework. He just gained utility. That is usually a good sign a champion is weak currently. When Korea stops playing them.
