After few patches, everything will probably slowly get fixed, as they cant put in 10 nerfs at a time but nerf and see stats then nerf again if needed.\nI'm sure Riot is aware of the problems, and I think that is why this patch is longer, other ADC's are getting buffed the next patch like Lucian and Draven to match up their power. Camille is soon going to get a nerf, (conformed by Rioter on reddit, in a Camille OP post which went to top, and they knew she had a bit too much).\n\ntbh, every start of a new thing, something has to go wrong.

Preseason is all about shaking up balance and following up on changes. This preseason we've seen virtually no follow up changes or even discussions about what was implemented in Season 7. Here are a list of things that Season 7 has introduced that haven't been balanced or even discussed for this entire month.\n\n1) The assassin \"rework\" has been a failure. Currently the entire class is MIA outside of {{champion:7}} {{champion:107}} and {{champion:55}}. The rest of the class is unplayable with how easy it is to mitigate damage with exhaust/heals/shields.\n\n2) The jungle is completely out of whack. Diversity is at an all time low. Can you keep up with {{champion:64}} clear speed and gank pressure? If so you can be played! If not? Well sucks to suck.\n\n3) 5 man bot lane dives 8ish minutes into the game was a rare sight in LCS at one point, now it happens in virtually all of my games at gold/plat elo. First bot lane to back = auto lose lane and you instantly start the inevitable snowball. (First turret gold is bullshit)\n\n4) top lane is an absolute mess. There is no reason for the jungler to head top. Top lane currently just waits for a fight to break out bot lane and TP down for hopefully a teamfight win that snowballs into a first turret + dragon. Rift Herald is just terrible. Takes too long to take and the buff is meh.\n\n5) redemption + locket has virtually killed the assassin class for how strong and easy the damage mitigation is to activate. Op as hell and still 0 riot discussion on it.\n\n6) Caitlyn has sat at a 53% winrate for most of the preseason with a 30% playrate. Still no nerfs in sight as she currently is killing bot lane diversity.\n\nI could name a couple more but it's depressed me. My point is though that even if we are on break, there's no reason to at least have a couple of red posts here and there over the break discussing balance. The game is currently not balanced and has introduced a lot of game health issues that I think are worth discussing.","replies":[{"poster":"zaire90","date":"2016-12-29T05:37:54.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from what ive seen rengars more of a fighter until late game or until he picks off some low hp targets to get snowballing, lbs a mage, and kats more feast or famine then ever","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xonra","date":"2016-12-28T08:41:43.784+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You likely won't hear much or more importantly SEE much until the LCS starts.
