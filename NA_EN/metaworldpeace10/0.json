Something is always going to be the best so long as you have masteries that provide raw stats and damage. What about thunderlords?

It actually only triggers that way if the auto attack enhancement is NOT an on-hit effect.

Warlord's and Fervor are both auto attack/attack speed keystones, they need to be in the same tree because wanting one over the other should not involve having to choose a whole bunch of different talents on the way. \n2. Warlord's is primarily an ADC mastery and thus makes most sense in the tree with % penetration (what ADCs largely want). Thunderlord's works better on the classes less adept at bursting tanks, so existing in the same tree as flat penetration makes sense for that mastery. Putting Thunderlord's on %pen champions confuses champion strengths and weaknesses, same for Warlord's + flat pen.\n3. To add to this, swapping TLD and Warlord's from the pen stats that best suit them would not only be unhealthy but would feel bad for most champions involved. Assassins absolutely do not want to lose access to flat pen but if they want to access that flat pen in your vision they would need to give up the keystone made for them. That is a trade-off no class currently has to make in their masteries.\n4. Mage supports without proper sustain (aggressive mages + Bard & Zilean) only synergise with Thunderlord's and are required to go deep into Cunning (Bandit, CDR), plus Resolve (summoner spell CDR) to a certain degree. Thunderlord's cannot be in Ferocity because it is the only tree that supports have no deep access to.\n\nYou cannot prioritise anything above balance when making changes to systems like these and your concern only seems to be with what's \"fitting\", but while Thunderlord's is very vaguely fitting in Ferocity (I disagree with Warlord's being fitting in Cunning), it'd be a disaster if it was placed there without big changes to both of the relevant trees. The champions intended to use Thunderlord's are also intended to go deep into Cunning in general and a lot of them are intended to have absolutely no interest in Warlord's. No champions would be happier with this swap than they are with the current setup.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2016-10-19T04:04:13.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VoMdBZTH,comment-id=000000030000,timestamp=2016-10-19T00:15:23.575+0000)\n>\n> Some designs are equally useful to anyone, others are more valuable for specific conditions.
