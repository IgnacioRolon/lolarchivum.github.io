Why does Kassadin have his ult nerfed severely (even if it functions like Kog's ult, and is quite frankly the only person I can think of that pays very heavily for his mobility) if other champions have just as good mobility on much lower cooldowns with barely any cost on non-ultimate abilities. Why does Kass lose his ult when one can get just as much range with Lee Q + wardhop, or Yasuo + minion wave, or Kalista + anything, or Nidalee + hunted target??\n\nThe reason people don't really care about the above stated is because most of those require some other thing to be done, whereas Kassadin just ults freely with no constraints other than mana. Nidalee has to either land a spear or trap to make it work, Kalista needs to Q or find something to attack, Yasuo needs a minion wave or plenty of other targets of some type, Lee Sin has to buy sightstone to get a ward hop whenever he might need it, ect.\n\nI can see what they mean, but Kass has not been a problem as of recently. He may have a high ban rate, but he's barely picked more than Malphite in ranked games. Kass's first round of nerfs (main case being ult damage taken and Q silence removed, along with slightly slashed AP ratios) I think put him in a really good spot. He can't instantly burst people down quite as easily, but you could still kill people given enough effort. All of his abilities are short range, requiring you to ult to use any of them. If you lost the ult range for a slightly non-glorified flash (with the scaling costs, might I add), then he won't get in range to do anything, and he won't be able to do much. He's already near-useless pre-6, he shouldn't also be useless post-6.\n\nAll those other champions come complimented with tons of damage, Lee Sin also gets some tankiness as well. Given you can catch up to Kassadin, his damage will be somewhat lacking. You probably know trying to chase Kalista is suicide, just because she has both sustained, burst, and poke damage along with insane mobility all in one kit. We're mad that Kassadin, probably the least of any offender (other than the occasional mobile tank) for this mobility creep situation, and HE is receiving nerfs. Kassadin has a 99.4% ban rate early 2014. After the nerfs, he was practically unseen in ranked. We feel Kassadin nerfs were unjustified, because he was already in a somewhat good spot.\n\nRiot needs to stop making all of these double standards. It's really getting annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"FastAsHeck","date":"2015-02-26T13:53:32.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh no you all got me wrong. i disagree with the kassa nerfs. im just saying that everyone was complaining about mobility creep and included kassadin, but i dont see a post here that says \"thank you for nerfing kassadin riot\". im just saying that people always try to find something to complain. kassadin didnt deserve the nerf, he was fine as he was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ramix The Red","date":"2015-02-25T21:01:30.176+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't wanna go on a long rant here so I'll keep this short:\n\nWhen people complain about mobility creep, the usual suspects are {{champion:64}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:103}} \n\nMost people agreed that Kass was, maybe not balanced, but at least way less of a problem than a lot of other champions.
