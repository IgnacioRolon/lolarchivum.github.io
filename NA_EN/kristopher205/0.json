After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. In a series of games between a high-rated player and a low-rated player, the high-rated player is expected to score more wins. If the high-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the low-rated player. However, if the lower rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. A player whose rating is too low should, in the long run, do better than the rating system predicts, and thus gain rating points until the rating reflects their true playing strength.\"\n                                                                                                                                               - Wikipedia on Elo rating system\n\nMMR/ELO isn't just a method in League. It is a commonly used system. It will average your teams MMR (hidden number, but many sites offer a somewhat accurate estimation) and the enemy teams MMR. If theirs is higher you win more, but your individual MMR does play a part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-03-01T05:26:02.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other games, if your team MMR is lower than your opponent team MMR then you gain more LP when you win because your match was harder.\n\nI feel like at some point on a win streak, your MMR will be the highest on your team, so you are forced to carry (your high MMR balanced with lower MMR teammates). \n\nHmm, have you queued with your friend?
