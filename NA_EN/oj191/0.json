As well as having your basic \"skill at league of legends\", he also can do stuff that other champions cannot do, or at least not in the same way as he does it. This means that \"skill at lee sin\" is also a relevant factor.\n\n\nCompared to say.... Pantheon who is purely point and click and winning a fight is typically just a matter of stat checks - do I have the damage and defenses to kill them before they can kill me, allies can come to their aid, or they can escape the fight. Even his ult mostly follows the same decision making patterns as the summoner spell Teleport, albeit with a lower cooldown and range restrictions (unless you go AP pantheon I guess? lol). The only real \"Pantheon-specific\" decision making he has is passive management, and even that typically isn't much more than \"use stun asap after they break my passive for instant refresh\", *so far as I have been able to gather from watching, not being a pantheon player myself*.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, screw lee sin, he has too much of a good thing and never has to fight a battle he doesn't want to.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-11-19T04:31:27.282+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"He's fine right now IMO.\n\nI think he's hated more due to the fact Riot doesn't like nerfing him, but they don't think twice when it comes to nerfing something else.","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2014-11-19T04:40:20.820+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"> He's fine right now IMO.\n> \n> I think he's hated more due to the fact Riot doesn't like nerfing him, but they don't think twice when it comes to nerfing something else.\n\nI just hate him because he has too many mobility choices in his kit\n\nunless HE screws up it's almost impossible to catch him without overbearing numbers, and sometimes not even then.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-11-19T18:06:20.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so your saying you want riot to nerf everyone with a movement ability like they did to kassadin?\nLee Sin is a unique champion and the only thing that needs nerfing on him is his armor and health regen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"thinking man","date":"2014-11-19T03:13:41.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2014-11-19T03:19:05.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I think the last nerf he'll ever need is making it so I can flash during that 1 second root of his ult.\n\nTo be honest IMO  I would also say he needs to either a) not be allowed to cast W mid-Q2, just queue it to go off immediately upon landing; or b) have CC interrupt his W dash; but maybe that's just my anti-mobility-creep bias.
