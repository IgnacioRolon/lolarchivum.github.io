Key fragment drops are random, but the rate of which it drops decreases each time until you obtain 12.  That rate will then reset every ~28 days.  Capsules are also random, and would substitute what could have been a fragment drop.\n\nOur [hextech crafting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) guide also has more info too.
