We don't think Singed needs a big push to make his way back into the mix in top lane, so we're looking at some small scale changes, both to give him something new and cool to do and to give him a little nudge up in power.  The main changes we're looking at here are:\n\n- When Singed Flings an opponent into his Mega Adhesive, they are snared for 1 second\n- Slight buff to rank 3 Insanity Potion stats bonus\n\nThe first change is about adding some cool thematic utility to Singed and opening up some big play-making potential when he gets creative with comboing his abilities.  We like the core stuff that Singed is doing and we didn't really want to change that too much, but we wanted to give him some new ways to think about his E and W usage and reward players for using them well together.  The second change is just a slight nudge up to his late game effectiveness, as Insanity Potion's rank 3 isn't quite as noticeable in the late game as the earlier ranks are in the early-mid game.\n\nAlso, Singed is receiving these kit changes in tandem with some visual changes! The model and textures for all of his skins have been updated, so you can look all spiffy as you run by people and throw them onto disgusting puddles of goo.","replies":[{"poster":"StrikeZone","date":"2014-10-10T02:00:46.045+0000","up_votes":41,"down_votes":11,"body":"Give him MR per lvl  and put tenacity back on his ULT\n\n\n\nnerfed him last year when you took away the ghost power up and the year b4 that when force of natures and leviathens was removed...

Singed also has serious problems in the lategame due to his aged kit and how he can't cope with all the new champs with their fancy utility. I have over 1500 Singed games in Diamond 1 over the course of 2 seasons and I have seen him change. Not only did he lose his tenacity, but other crucial items got nerfed on him. Since he has no ranged abilities (more than the slow) and no gapclosers, he is left to being more or less useless in teamfights against a coordinated team that can call out focus, which is why we will never see him as a toptier competitive toplaner.","replies":[{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2014-10-10T14:46:49.120+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"He was played successfully at worlds last year and this year.

I understand that you believe he needs help but Proxy Singed is literally one of the most annoying strategies in the game.

One reason proxy farming even came around was because of the problem singed coudlnt fight people in lane.\n\nIt would be nice during lanning phase that he could actually fight  someone who isnt  a dualist or able to not get kited by all the adcs and any champion with a slow, stun or snare, or one that has a gap closer. god forbid you be able to do something in a team fight ageist a good adc.","replies":[{"poster":"SirLapse","date":"2014-10-12T06:41:10.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're freakin joking if you're telling me my argument isn't fair. I've seen Proxy Singed basically warp games into a catch the Singed effort. The cooldown at lv6 with 40% CDR is 60 seconds. And it lasts for 25 seconds.\n\nHe'll be able to cast that every time he comes to split push over and over. And it's annoying. I've seen plenty of Singed games turn into unfair battles because proxying is something Singed can do. Telling me that *I* shouldn't be playing at the level that I'm playing at...you're using insults to counter an argument for an anti-fun strategy Singed can do?\n\nSinged + Rylai's + other tank items makes Proxy Singed almost impossible to stop once he gets going. The goal is to shut him down early, which requires teamwork. Some teams don't know how to stop Proxy Singed and that's not going to make the strategy any less toxic.\n\nDoesn't counter anyone? Bro you ever use Singed vs. Fiora or any melee top laner that actually need to use autoattacks to get you? With tanks in the top lane being popular Singed has fallen out of popularity. It doesn't suddenly mean he sucks. Meta doesn't define who sucks and who doesn't, it just defines what people want to abuse.\n\nSinged is meant to tank in teamfights, flip people, and slow them. With plenty of tank champions who have better utility in top lane, and with APs being ranged masters who bust up melees (Ryze), Singed is just not a viable pick for most occasions. Doesn't mean he needs to be borderline unkillable like in the older seasons. That's not how you improve game health.","replies":[{"poster":"StrikeZone","date":"2014-10-12T14:14:56.497+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wtf are you talking about, who has 40 cdr at lvl 6? even is someone did, they would do no damage and have no tankyness. Your argument is a joke.\n\nIf you dont know how to play agiest a startagy then your obviously playing at a higher lvl then you should be at. \n\nBy the time Singed has rylais and other tank items the time for him to be proxy farming should be over. Further more Proxy farming is a high risk, high reward strategy. From my experience ive seen it hurt more than it helps. Alot of champs can also proxy farm...most top lanners can. The rest of your argument in the 3rd paragraph is about one team not using teamwork, in a team game to shut down one players early game.  If you dont know how to do something you should learn, singed was only force to learn to proxy farm because of being unable to lane ageist top lanners. Once again most top lanners can proxy farm. \n\nMeta champions are the champions that the highest elo players are picking over and over because they are currently the best champions in the game. \n\n\nSinged is meant to tank in teamfights, to bad thats all he can do because he cant catch the adc who is kitting him the whole time with tons of cc on him. Who is talking about making him borderline unkillable? Mundo is not unkillable and he has the same tenacity and the same MR per lvl. \n\nYou cant frist pick a singed because his coutners are so bad that it makes playing in lane unfun. The meta has changed because of nerfs, buffs and new characters being released.  When was the last champion that was released with out a gap closer. Safety is only one click away.  Or you can just get red buff and kite him all up and down the teamfight and kill him.\n\n\nOnly have 4 or 5 viable people per lane is unfun and a bad way to improve the game.

I am singedlife/hey its tiptup from oce, and I consider myself to be a very experienced singed main/player. I was previously challenger(with 75%, win rate, 4.5kda, however I stopped and account decayed) and (whilst lolskill isn't entirely accurate) I was ranked number 1 singed in all regions (an achievement nonetheless) http://imgur.com/0AXrrvE. Due to the shift in meta, ryze, riven, lulu,  gnar, rumble being top tier top laners (from the previous renekton, shyvana, rengar, mundo, jax meta) and the popular/strong botlane picks; janna, nami, morgana, braum, adc; trist (knockback and jump), lucian (ult+dash), corki (huge gap closer) have kits that have caused singed to suffer significantly. The issues singed suffers from specifically are his pushing into proxying/roaming ability as new top laners bully too harshly and have kits that kite/cc (lock him down) too well. Also his proxying and team fighting ability has been indirectly effected to a great extent due to the nature of the mobility/cc/range in the current meta. Champions like morgana, janna, lucian, tristana have kits that when used properly, really negate initiations and singed's team fighting ability. To address these issues, singed requires a tenacity buff on his ultimate and mana reduction on mega adhesive early ranks (top laners are typically cdr based with no mana, those that are do not suffer like singed early). The tenacity buff will assist singed's proxying and team fighting ability as heavy cc and kite/ranged kits are strong in this meta. The mana reduction on mega adhesive is necessary for singed to become viable in lanes with lulu, ryze, gnar, rumble, jayce, as it is too costly to use and their kite/cc heavy kits make it impossible to apply pressure to be able to cs effectively or have a threat to get to them at all.\n\nTLDR; previous Challenger/Rank 1 singed world. Shift in meta has indirectly nerfed singed significantly, popular/current meta champions dominate singed in lane and team fighting with range/high mobility/high cc (them tornadoes and snares....). Addressing these issues, singed requires a tenacity buff on his ultimate and mana reduction on mega adhesive in early ranks.

But now you are updating Singed which is one of my favorite champs and I own all his skins (Including the Riot Squad Singed) I have some comments about the changes. I'll list them per skin and hope you guys agree and will change them (especially the once for Riot Squad since it's such a rare skin and my favorite)\n\n**Riot Squad Singed:**\n\n* what i liked in the old skin was that the riot parts were really white and that looked really good. I'm talking about the fist icon on the shoulders and the front of the shield where it says Riot that bar has to be white too! There is another fist logo on the back of his tank which I think would look better being white too.\n \n* the second thing i think got lost in translation are the brown pockets in front of him. They should be black! That brown doesn't fit the skin in any way!!! \n \n* Last thing is the way the shield looks I really like the old one but I can see you guys might want to change it. if you guys REALLY want to keep the new one that is fine but please put back the black riot letters, the white fist above the window and make the outlines white.\n\n**Hextech Singed:**\n\n* You guys started off good (asuming you started at the bottom ;) ) but then you guys changed the brown and the shoulders to goldish and it look horrible. Please change that color back to the brown it used to be or continue with the brown that is on the bottom part but please get rid of this horrible color.\n\n**Surfer Singed:**\n\n* First off the surfboard: Please make him hold it under his arm again not as a shield, make the art on the bottom of the board again not just plain white.\n \n* Secondly the Color: Please get the blue of the shirt back this one just looks faided. I do like the new color of the trousers and the red straps. \n \n* And the last change would be for the tank on his back, in the old one it had a really big purple bar which looked good, now it is a really small barely visable stripe and i would like to see it a little bigger. + the taric picture isnt as clear as the old one which is a huge part of the skin.\n\n**Mad Scientist Singed:**\n\n*  There isn't much I would do differently the only thing I would advice is for the purple tanks on his back. On the old one there was this little orange things on there, I would like to see them make a little logo or a skull or smth that makes it look dangerous. Since there are a lot of those chemical warnings in the lab.\n\n**Augmented Singed:**\n\n* Like the Mad Scientist the change looks good although I really prefer the black/darker armor/mask on the top half of the skin. That is something that has to be changed to fit the theme again.\n\n\n I really hope this will get seen and by the team that did the VU for Singed and that they will do some of these changes. Especially the Riot Squad Singed because the old one looks so much better in the way it is now and that's not what the VU is for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StrikeZone","date":"2014-10-10T06:01:23.990+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is a glich on singed flip after the latest patch","replies":[{"poster":"KNHT","date":"2014-10-15T14:30:50.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem i think, when you flip instead to go flying back it just jump on the position.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OH NO ITS LU BU","date":"2014-10-10T02:10:01.886+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget to map his laugh to a single key so you can spam it at your opponents as you run away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2014-10-10T02:14:00.245+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't completely relevant, I do have to wonder if you plan on looking at his lore during this: He still has the \"Warwick is an Alchemist\" lore that was retconned, and it's apparently been that way for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GengarBot","date":"2014-10-11T05:46:53.884+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a singed 1 trick pony and have been since season 1, I'd like to add my own input; I like the changes so far and these will help a lot but I feel it wont be enough to see him in competitive play (I know looper used him once) or even see him a lot in solo que. I think giving him tenacity back to his ultimate is the best choice because he doesn't have any gap closers besides speed which is very counterable, that seems fair cause its just a little too much for singed to get his job done there are just too much cc teams bring against this guy even the lowest slow will prevent singed from flinging a target, for a champion that's speed based he should have some type of mitigation to help.  As for mana costs I think they are fine cause you normally end up getting mana anyways maybe the early costs could be lowered a bit cause as of right now I find myself oom after 1 fling early game. Then MR per lvl would be nice as well I know you justified against it cause of his ultimate giving him free resists and I actually agree but it wouldn't put him over the top if it was given to him cause when I think of singed you think of really good late game (but I think right now he is best mid game then falls off into a peel tank late) imo his late isn't even that great I find I lose most of my games when late game happens and I win most during mid game. I'm not saying do all of these these are just thoughts and suggestions. What you have now on pbe is great but the tenacity on ult is the only thing that will make him better or at least reduce slows by a lot at least so teams have to use hard cc on him at least, as of right now more speed is good but that just means slows work even harder against him cause all slows are % based.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MortifyMore","date":"2014-10-10T15:06:23.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot, I was looking at the Surfer Singed skin on the PBE (Surr@20) and I noticed his surfboard is no longer being hold, it's just like his shields.

I honestly wish you'd do something more like what happened to Sion for an update of Singed.\n\nAlso, don't enjoy being so critical, and unrelated, but not a big fan of his new splash art either, it looks better all around of course, but it makes him look so much older and wrinkly, whereas I always felt that he wasn't that old and was pretty cool based on his voice.","replies":[{"poster":"StrikeZone","date":"2014-10-10T03:34:12.458+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"with azir and peole with so many gap closers and other escapes in their kit...singed just cant catch people or do damage to them in lane and in team fights people have so much peal and kite.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2014-10-10T02:37:05.111+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just logged on to say how happy this makes me, and how much I appreciate your remembering an old and uniquely fun champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Edasich","date":"2014-10-20T02:52:54.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs more voice lines.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hydration Bot","date":"2014-10-13T01:08:14.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, just a cool idea for the \"Mega Adhesive\" Snare thing.  Could you make the effect globally available by knock-ups and misplacement's and not just Singed him self with his fling?  For example a \"Lee sin kick\" into the Adhesive, would also snare them if they land in it?
