Essentially, we're looking to do two things here:\n\n1. Give Renekton a lot more Fury when he's fighting champions and a little less Fury when he's not interacting with champions.\n\nP - Reign of Anger\nFURY DECAY RATE:: 2/second >>> 4/second\n\nQ - Cull the Meek\nFURY GENERATION ON NON-CHAMPION HIT:: 5/target >>> 2.5/target\nFURY GENERATION ON CHAMPION HIT:: 5/target >>> 10/target\n\nW - Ruthless Predator\nNEW - FURY GENERATION BONUS VS CHAMPIONS:: 10 Fury\n\nE2 - Dice\nNEW - FURY GENERATION ON NON-CHAMPION HIT:: 2.5/target\nNEW - FURY GENERATION ON CHAMPION HIT:: 10/target\n\nWe really wanted to give Renekton some new ways to spike his Fury generation in teamfights without making his laning power go crazy, so we've put conditional Fury generation on all of his non-empowered abilities that is stronger vs. Champions than vs. minions.  We also increased the decay rate on Fury so that Renekton doesn't sit on full Fury without staying in combat.\n\nAlso, a small note here, Renekton has never generated Fury when using empowered abilities, so while the tooltips are being more explicit about this interaction, the mechanics haven't been changed with regards to empowered abilities.\n\n2. Smooth out Renekton's healing from Cull the Meek so that it is still relevant later in the game.\n\nQ - Cull the Meek\nHEALING VS MINIONS (Non Fury Enhanced):: 5% damage >>> 3/4.5/6/7.5/9 (+0.04 Bonus AD)\nHEALING VS MINIONS (Fury Enhanced):: 10% damage >>> 9/13.5/18/22.5/27 (+0.12 Bonus AD)\nHEALING VS CHAMPIONS (Non Fury Enhanced):: 20% damage >>> 9/13.5/18/22.5/27 (+0.12 Bonus AD)\nHEALING VS CHAMPIONS (Fury Enhanced):: 40% damage >>> 27/40.5/54/67.5/81 (+0.36 Bonus AD)\n\nI apologize for how mathy this ends up being, but the tl;dr here is that healing vs. minions is unchanged and the healing vs. champions is better  vs. targets with higher armor.  Basically, we wanted Renekton to still have the choice to heal himself with Empowered Q after opponents built armor, since the ability's main function breaks down in the middle of teamfights on live right now.  The current tuning on this healing is that he's going from 20%/40% post-mitigation healing to 15%/30% pre-mitigation healing, which is almost always a buff for him (except at very very low armor values).\n\n\nAll in all, we're just hoping to get Renekton into a better spot where his late game is not so impotent, while still leaving him with the strong early power curve we've come to know him for.","replies":[{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2014-12-16T02:32:16.656+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you considered making it so he gets the full vs Champion Fury gain and Heal on Monsters?

The result was a 100% pick/ban rate at worlds because he brought something that most top laners can't provide (which is support levels of peel and cc).\n\nAlistar jungle was also a thing way back in the past, which again was problematic, as his ganks were incredibly dangerous. You couldn't dodge the headbutt dash, you couldn't tenacity or cleanse the knockup, the tower wouldn't deal enough damage through his ult and you needed more than 1 form of cc to stop his ult. And his E kept him healed up throughout the jungle clear so he would always be full healthed when ganking (meaning dives for days). His ganks had little to no counterplay and to nerf/rework that would also ruin his role as a support.\n\nI don't think Renekton in particular would be a very dangerous jungler as he has been played jungle in the past, but keep in mind that Renekton's utility and trading strength early on would mean that he would become another kha'zix/pantheon/lee sin based on the design of his kit so simply throwing him into the jungle without considering the repercussions before hand would be a bad idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheRainInSpain","date":"2014-12-16T05:24:07.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes, though even with Fury spiking on large monsters, Renekton doesn't really bring anything to the jungle that a multitude of other junglers do.  So Riot would push a champion that doesn't really benefit in the jungle.  You might as well ask Riot to push Sona as a mid lane mage.  You'll get the same impact with the playerbase.\n\nRenekton's kit is basically a lane bully bruiser kit, focused on fighting and brawling, and getting empowered abilities for doing so.  He is best in a lane, where he can get in a scuffle, get out, and get back in, while keeping combat stance going.  Junglers need to journey from camp to camp with lots of upfront power in the early game so they don't get creamed by the camp or an enemy champion.  It's hard to keep up the Fury for the rare moment Warwick jumps you, as the whole travel from camp to camp to gank to camp really hurts his Fury generation.\n\nYou could use Renekton as a dedicated jungle fighter, taking enemy camps and bashing his face in wherever you see him in his jungle, but your teammates lose their ganker so you must hope that they're oppressive lane bullies that WIN lane because they're not getting help from you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2014-12-16T04:53:52.803+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big thing that has irked me since I started playing Renekton long ago in the age of his release is how unresponsive his 2nd E feels when used in rapid succession.

If you do not feel comfortable responding on this thread i would greatly urge you (and would appreciate) making a dedicated olaf thread (which might be a shitstorm of snide remarks, hashinshin fanboys, and people who are probably unhappy with a long wait for olaf changes i still feel like it would greatly benefit both the community and the game in the long run and would respect you to try to uphold such a challenge)\n\nI think we can all agree olaf leaves something to be desired when team fighting comes around... so these changes would be targeted at \n\nA) letting him either catch people or do more damage from range because at the moment he has neither compared to pre rework\n\nB) modifying he E power curve through various means to reduce toxicity vs melee champions in the laning phase and increase its effectiveness and utility as the game scales as well as amplifying his core theme as a sustain tank\n\nC) giving olaf a clear role without returning him to raidboss status of s2/s3\n\n1st of all i would like to give my most controversial change\n\nE) increase the cooldown at early levels and increase the cost back to 40 percent of the damage value. In exchange olaf's E now applies all on hit effects, most importantly, minion agro and lifesteal.  With this change you will accomplish three things. 1) change the abilities scaling so it is drastically less effective in lane (where honestly its the biggest problem) toward late game 2) create an incentive for damage builds and make them feel satisfying for the olaf player (another area where hes kind of wanting) 3) return a old interaction between w and e as well as adding counterplay and stressing the importance of w as a long cd meaningful trading tool throughout the game (clarity) as well as solidifying and placing more importance on his sustain tank thematic \n\nIn my mind there is no downside to the above change. ive tried to look at it objectively from all angles and through both a player lens as well as riots balance team lens. I think this is a rather stale area in olaf's kit with alot of opportunity for tuning or balance tools to be added in a similar way to renekton.\n\nSecond of all i would like to say that while the nerf to q from a 54% slow to a 45% slow may have been justified (olaf was very strong in the karma sivir medallion meta) many of the things that made olaf a strong competitive pick have now been eliminated, and the game is more offensively inclined than every before (dragon buffs as a whole and baron removal of regen)\n\nIn this regard as a designer i feel you have options on what to do with his q.\n\nFrom my perspective his q is bogged down by two different design goals.  \n-olafs q power should come from its poke and ranged damage as well as vision\n-olafs q power should come from its slow and ability to catch opponents\n\nYou should probably explore one of these and not both at the same time!!!\n\n As a designer you went out of your way to demonstrate that q would be alot less of a poke tool. Even though removing ad from W was more targeting this position in the rework, you decided to take ten damage off of q at all levels. your goal here seems to be absolutely clear that his q doesn't have its power loaded into poke. \n\nWhile this may be fine the nerf to olafs q slow seems to be targeted at what the community and the pro scene sees as problematic inside of his kit. When olaf can catch people he is an overwhelming champion......So the balance team nerfed his slow leaving an immensely unsatisfying olaf to play\n\nBecause of the above results of his changes i think you have two options to change olaf either increase his q as a ranged wave clear and poke tool (increase ad ratio base damage ect and remove some of the slow) or stick to your original guns and shave the fat off this multi purpose tool so olaf can catch people when he needs to (increase the cd when he doesnt pick up. lower base damage ect)\n\nIm counting on you man!!!!\nthanks for your time in advance","replies":[{"poster":"Emperor of Arima","date":"2014-12-21T06:17:59.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like, i get the idea, and you want a rioter to see it which is cool, but you should probably post it on the boards instead of here where it's relevance is kinda iffy at best.

Renekton is a lane bully BECAUSE of his fury. Making it decay faster can be a nerf if you're against some one who pokes a lot and keeps you low on fury because of it like Lissandra and Gnar would do all day long. There's also the fact they reduced the fury generated on minions and Ren NEEDS Fury to properly trade with champions like Liss and Gnar, otherwise he'll E in, W, Q, then E back. Half way through your Q animation, they'll be unstunned because you didn't go in with fury, so they'll be going balls deep on you since you're now in their minions and chase you away from the minions, making you lose the trade. \n\nRenekton bullies his lane by gaining fury, diving into the minions to his enemies, W'ing with 50 fury, then pressing Q in the minions and on his opponent, then E'ing back. Less fury, less often to be able to dive in and bully, thus reducing his overall effectiveness. Tested it and it's a pretty harsh nerf to his laning phase unless your opponent is melee and you can E near them for a quick Q, then E'ing back, without using a 50 fury Dice that is.","replies":[{"poster":"Emperor of Arima","date":"2014-12-21T06:49:22.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a lot of renekton, i often use my Q before my W because a fury enhanced Q gives more damage/heal back than an enhanced W which frankly, doesn't do as much in lane, because usually, that extra stun duration don't really prevent them from hitting you back any more than a regular W does.\n\nAnd as for the ranged thing. Like... range champs already annoy renek on live. they have this nasty habit of staying just out of your E's Range, so the only thing u could do is land a Q on them... maybe.. then they hit you... whether fury decays like on live or on PBE, it's gonna be a situation where you COULD rip the to shreds... but they're gonna keep their distance from u.. so it don't really matter if you have 0 or 100 fury\n\nAnd if what you're saying is it gives him a greater strength (better bullying power against melees and weaklings) but greater weaknesses (ranged pokers/range disablers) then by all means it's a good change imo","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2014-12-21T10:30:53.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know who you face in your games, but your empowered W's stun duration is incredibly noticeable and the damage it provides is dramatic no matter what, especially if you're against anyone who might be using 21 points in defense so they have tenacity. As most people who play Riven will tell you, a .75s stun is more like an interrupt and a way to make a squishy cry or give you enough time to land an extra hit. With Ren, the damage difference between empowered W and Q aren't nearly as dramatic even with the fact that you level your Q first because no matter what, it's giving you 50% damage boost and your W is based on TOTAL AD while your Q is based on bonus. \n\nI'll go ahead and lay down the numbers for a level three Renekton who's about to go balls to the wall on any champion. If you're like pretty much every Renekton, you play like C9 Balls and build exactly like him, including runes and masteries... which is 15 AD in Runes and 9/21/0. At level 3, this provides a total of 22 bonus AD. Your Q does a base of 77.6 and your W does 137.5. Empowered, your Q does about 116.4 while your W does 206.25. Q->Emp Q difference is about 39ish damage.... W->Emp W is about 69ish. Not only do most prefer the number 69, but 69 is greater than 39. To say the damage your W does is negligible whether empowered or not is silly. Yes, your Q can heal you for more, but the point of trading is not to dive in when you're likely sitting pretty high on health by pressing Q on minions and then... healing off the champion... Trading is putting off more damage than your opponent. If you're topped off and dive at a topped off, let's say Riven, she's going to E away, take no damage, and now you have no fury. You're still topped off. She's still topped off. There was no trade. If you had chosen to E in first, press W to stun her as she E'd, you'd remove her bubble and lock her in place so she'd be forced to eat your Q and an AA before you E away and then she'll likely chase you through minions with her Q, take minion aggro and you press Q for days for sustain while she loses the trade. This works for most common top champions with the exception of Jax. Jax is the ONE exception because he'll likely be prepared to press his own E as soon as you hop at him, in which case you troll him by Diving in, Q'ing, then E'ing away so he either jumps at you like an idiot into your minions to stun you so you can then stun him and nom his face or he backs away slowly and cries in a corner while he waits for his jungler to come help him feed. \n\nOf course, tactics obviously change depending on your opponent, but the bigger, more sustained bursts come when you press W first and prevent them from reacting while you unload your Crocodile fury all over their face and then make your exit like a bawss. Saving your W, however, can also be a good tactic when you're going tankier than a Mundo because you do absolutely no fricken damage and want your minions to do it for you. Yay for OP minions. This is usually not the case though and you're required to throw your own purple or blue balls at the enemies because your minions are lazy bastards who won't take an extra step forward so that ranged champ will get aggro.\n\nAlso, Renekton has such bad issues with ranged champs right now, that he's out of the meta.

At all.\n\nWhen I play renekton I jump in all the time without fury because your kit makes it incredibly safe to do so. You can easily land your full combo in the span of the stun and e away before they have a chance to fight back. Also, I know you should get more fury for more damage/heal but it's not a big deal if you don't have the fury. ","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2014-12-16T06:38:21.722+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you dive in without fury though, you lose out on a LOT of damage and if you do the combo, you run the possibility of getting that 50  as you finish the combo, then when you E back, you just lost all that fury and none of it was used against your opponent and now just shoved your lane harder than a normal E back would've done and if you do this when ever your CD's are up rather than when you have the fury to do so, you can open yourself up to ganks, cause your opponent to easily turn the tides by you have absolutely no fury and you're on full CDs. A usual lane you counter with Ren is Riven and Shen and popularly top right now is Lissandra, Riven (Depending on Tier), and Jax. Usually against Riven, you can't quite combo her. If you do your tactic, you end up getting stomped by her just following up with an E+Q+W+Q+Q to chase you the hell off. Jax can easily press E after, or during to block your W, and then Q at you to ruin your combo. Lissandra would stop your E back entirely and then out trade you because you didn't wait for your Fury. Shen would just laugh your damage off with a quick Q+E+AA combo to heal your damage back and trade equally. \n\nOverall, you can't rely on an E+W+Q+E combo with your E on such a high base CD unless you have the fury to make it worth it every single time. Reducing the fury gen on minions makes you less of a threat, especially on champs who will abuse the fact that you don't have fury to trade well like a Riven, Jayce, or Jax and just whack you hard. This makes trading with a Garen and Darius even scarier. They know if you're low on fury or you just E'd away after combo'ing and possibly just used the last of your fury, that you're a sitting duck. With a little bit of tenacity, or just pressing Garen's W, they can negate the stun and trade before you E back, then chase you and destroy you. Ren may not require fury to do damage, but to trade equally with high damage champions who have tankiness or chase and/or escape ability? He has to have it or he just gets out traded. Every champ has to have his downfalls, but this exaggerates Renekton's. \n\nPersonally, I do have the PBE and I DID test this. Sadly, the PBE is full of a lot of people who aren't even on par with people who are sitting in Bronze, so I wouldn't say the test is 100% accurate. Through what I was noticing, my abilities, even on FULL waves with the cannon, the Fury gen with E and Q was incredibly low. The only way it seems to accurately gain fury is the AA the minions, but that takes 10 AA's per 50 fury. Most would think, \"That's not bad.\" then you realize 10 minions is nearly 2 waves. You can AA minions more than once, obviously, but then you push your lane and in most cases, that's not exactly a good thing unless your opponent is pushing as hard as you are. I will mention that I did rape my lane in the games that I played, but again, that was mostly due to the horrific players you find on the PBE. I honestly should not have been able to go 10/1 before taking my first turret with only going B twice and dying once to a Vladimir. Just going off of just the fury gen though, it felt incredibly lacking and it lessened the amount of time I usually take to be able to do a devastating 50 fury, without pushing. Of course when it came to team fights, even without pressing my R, I was having no issues keeping up my fury. It was to the point when I would be able to E through minions with 50 fury, W a squishy, Q 2 or 3 of them at once, and have over 50 fury again to be able to do a max fury Q in a second or two. Of course, because of being fed as Renekton, it usually went W a squishy, press Q then AA and they're dead, then moving on to the next target with 50 fury at the ready. For AD Renekton, this is horrifically scary. Tank Ren, which is the more viable way, would likely be rolling in free 40% of his bonus AD all fight long, especially with your R going.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2014-12-17T02:13:08.175+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"overall this is a nerf right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Treyen","date":"2014-12-17T17:57:08.940+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you want to give him a better spot late game....by making him weaker in lane so that he never gets there?
