I never quite got around to finishing it around that time until I realized it's October and that the Harrowing is arriving! I decided to dedicate this Poro to the Harrowing Poros.  What do you guys think?\r\nI want it known it's my first successful attempt at taking a drawing and turning it into a digital painting, so I'm very proud :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-08T21:53:58.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this so much! ^--^","replies":[{"poster":"LovelySkylark","date":"2014-10-08T23:10:34.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I love this so much! ^--^\n\nAW thanks :DD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BodyBuild","date":"2014-10-09T03:11:02.966+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get an Undead Lulu with the Harrowing Poro?","replies":[{"poster":"LovelySkylark","date":"2014-10-09T03:17:50.178+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH MY GOD.

Maybe a greenish dark green color scheme?    Something to make her seem like she did dark magic to bring herself back.  Ill think more about her abilities.  You give me your feedback, Artists are the real creators.\n\nBat wings sound awesome!  \n\nRito Please we have good ideas here for Harrowing 2015.","replies":[{"poster":"LovelySkylark","date":"2014-10-09T04:24:01.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it.
