I think my resolution might have changed from 1280 to 1366 or something of that sort, so i hopped in a practice game and tried to change my resolution and the only option is the 1300 one with an asterisk next to it, so I tried changing the resolution in game.cfg but whenever I go into game the file resets to 1300 or whatever even if i save it, what else can i do because the game is completely unplayable.
