HELP?????????????????????","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I just lost a ranked game and got an afk ban. Why? Well it's because of riot's new trash client. I bugsplatted before we were about to win and I couldn't rejoin. My league client started to update and when it finished, I kept clicking the reconnect button and it wouldn't work and it's not because I didn't have internet, it's because of the new client. Idk wtf happened there, but I couldn't log in and when I finally was able to we lost because they were already at nexus. BRING BACK LEGACY CLIENT PLEASE. HELP RIOT AND FIX THIS BEFORE IT HAPPENS TO ANY OTHER PLAYERS","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T03:04:42.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks that something happened that caused you to get kicked out of the match, be it an unstable connection or some critical game failure, but we definitely need to get to the bottom of this before it happens again. \n\nWe may need to do a little troubleshooting before we can get to the bottom of this, but let's start at the most typical cause for disconnects. Go through the steps in [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and we should at least be able to narrow down what's kicking you out of those games.
