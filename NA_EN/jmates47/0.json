It happens every time when I purchase this item. When out of combat and I hit the correct key it works 100% of the time, but when combat is involved the item decides not to work. My friends are also having the same problem so I know its not just me.","replies":[{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2016-12-25T02:49:09.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a problem I have too, I like to call it \"Bad reaction time\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-12-24T22:19:57.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually this is because you are silenced or otherwise CC'd and can't use it when you try, not because of a bug. If you can't figure out what happened I recommend downloading your replay and rewatching it. You can also get the Overwolf app to watch the segment right after it happens, and see exactly when you were pressing your keys.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-24T22:29:46.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in-client replays!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-12-24T22:29:25.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try using it _before_ you get stunlocked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SchmidttyGames","date":"2016-12-24T22:26:40.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't use Zhonya's to break CC.
