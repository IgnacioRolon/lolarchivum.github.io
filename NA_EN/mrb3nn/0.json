Instead they are just the same as other ward 'Skins' in the Riot store.\nThis discussion was previously created in the community creations, but the rules say that you can post the same discussion in multiple boards where they apply.\n\n-Thanks.\n'MrB3NN' (EUW)\n\n(Discussion in Community creations: http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-creations-en/5O0sVnfX-champion-ward-concepts-ideas)","replies":[{"poster":"Dreddeth","date":"2015-03-05T04:23:26.590+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Jax Lamp-Post ward would be nice, I think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Desmond Law","date":"2015-03-04T22:47:09.235+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you could troll enemies with the olaf ward.
