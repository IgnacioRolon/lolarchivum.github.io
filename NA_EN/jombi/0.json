To top it off, you can no longer re roll champion shards you get for a random champion permanent. Is there a way now to easily earn blue essence or do new players/smurf just have to disenchant every shard we get until we save up for a new champion? If this is the case, shouldn't the amounts for disenchant be increased, or start to implement blue essence at the post match reward like every season prior? It also seems that with every level you get a capsule for a random basic champion shard. Those shards should be insta free champion unlocks if you don't plan on re-introducing post game blue essence.\r\n\r\nBreaking this down, it seems like new players are going to have a hard time unlocking champions, and all the rewards are going to players who already have every champion unlocked... Below are some thing I think might help newer players.\r\n\r\nThe random champion shards we get, turned into a free champion unlock and already owned champs automatically turned into BE/Shard for us to disenchant //everything else post game stays the same.\r\n-OR-\r\nKeep the champion shards, and at the end of every match obtain the same amount of IP (now blue essence) we would get for wins/losses from the prior seasons.\r\n-OR-\r\nIntegrate blue essence into the champion capsule that you obtain at level up so newer players won't have to disenchant the shard of a champion they got AND/OR level up to 30 just to get to unlock that single champion.\r\n-OR-\r\nThe re roll system for champion shards. (Probably the easiest thing to do to make new and older players happy).\r\n\r\nIt just seems like obtaining even the cheapest of champions is going to take forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-14T03:37:40.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty hot topic right now of course, but honestly in my personal opinion, newer players have it rather easier than vets.
