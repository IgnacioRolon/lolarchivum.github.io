Basically, the boards, reddit, groups of friends, whatever all start freaking out and going &quot;THIS WILL BREAK THE GAME! THIS IS GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!&quot;\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not. It really is not because there is this one little factor people seem to forget.\r\n\r\nYou only get one big rune. You only get 1 shot at a big slice of pie and you need to consider the vast array of options that are in front of you. Do you want Apple or Pumpkin? How about Cherry? Maybe some Blueberry? What about this famous Rhubarb pie! \r\n\r\nThe point is, you have to pick from a variety of options and you only get one. Each option has clear ups but people are forgetting the downs that come with those. If I pick the summoner spell swap rune, then I miss out on Ultimore. If I pick ultimore, then I am missing out on the TLD style spell. All of which offer different powers and will change how you approach a game. So before we start freaking out about how we have 50 seconds ults! (We already have a ton of those guys...?)\r\n \r\nRemember that Karthus just gave up a lot of his early game damage potential and isn&#039;t the full potential of his damage but he will have more chances to shoot off ult.\r\n\r\nAlso on the note of Ultimore, you are using your ultimate to gain some CDR on it. Unless you already have a low CDR on it or it&#039;s a low impact style ult, then I highly doubt you will be just fire it off in lane with no purpose. Then when you walk to lane you don&#039;t have ult and I can now all in you because you are down an ultimate but I am not. Same goes for summoner swap, etc. There are many other factors to consider.","replies":[{"poster":"Rafatinoni","date":"2017-08-31T18:11:31.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think people are overreacting about this.

The runes will open up options that current runes don't. People are wondering why we don't keep current ones when all they do are give champions their base stats.

Well even then it's important to note the stats are likely to change, there is a variety of other runes in those same slots, and we don't even know if many of these runes will stat the same in the final draft. It is just too early to be lighting torches and getting pitchforks to charge Riot's front office.\n\nI didn't notice that part so thank you for pointing it out to me. It still isn't that amazing honestly. If Riot doesn't like it I can see it going to 10% at max which still requires 10 ult casts when you may lose out on a rune that would give you straight up damage.\n\nEdit: Again it just comes back to there being trade offs and the power from current runes and mastery's being shifted into these. So I am not worried.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-08-31T19:08:23.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fairness, the Red post calls out that it's not a Keystone.  It could even be a basic rune but we will have to wait and see.\n\nI'm in the same boat with you.  Not at all worried about the changes.  If anything I'm excited to see something more interesting than Fervor on everyone with AD or TLD on everyone else.\n\nJust in case it was missed on the new TLD it looks like you will need to be more creative with your attacks to proc the damage.  If I read that correct you can't just use the same 3 damage sources to set it off so the investment in the damage will be higher.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-08-31T19:20:26.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just looked and I believe it's a greater rune not lesser.\n\nYeah!
