Being smacked for 800 in two hits and getting dropped before you can even react because the only counter play to Auto-attacks is don&#039;t be in range, a design which we changed LeBlanc for having, but Marksmen get to ignore that general design flaw?\r\n\r\nIt just doesn&#039;t make any sense in my mind why that is not only allowed but supported so often by Riot with all the tools they give Marksmen to shine. They have a core design flaw that only has two weaknesses; don&#039;t be in their range and they are squishy. The latter weakness being easily negated by an ungodly amount of effects in this game. \r\n\r\nJust seems broken in design to more you think about it. Auto-attacks really don&#039;t have a weakness like an ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-29T00:25:49.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because someone needs to kill tanks.

But then you'd have to buff tanks so that armor scales better into late, forcing the enemy adc to stack these pen and shred items. ADCs would still have the option to go an ad/crit build to kill squishies but they would get steam rolled by an armor stacking tank. If they go %health and armor pen, they will kill the enemy tank but then the enemy assassin/mage should be able to outduel them 1v1. That seems fair to me though.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2017-09-29T02:11:27.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, let's be honest here.\n\nAn assassin will always 1v1 an ADC unless they're massively behind or the assassin fucks up.\n\n(also, armor shred does almost as much damage to squishies as they do to tanks.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-09-29T00:15:37.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider their average damage over the course of the whole game though, rather than their average damage when at 4-5 items.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-09-29T00:21:25.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean it isn't bad either across the game.

While, yes, it is a flaw, it's really more a flaw in the same sense as Dodge Chance used to be; it's RNG. ADCs build 80% attack speed every game, and put their other 2 slots into defense. However, if we were to remove critical strikes from the game, we would have to give every ADC a reliable way to deal damage in the late game that didn't deal as much early in a more balanced way. This would likely come in the form of % max health physical/true damage on-hit in their items instead of crit chance. This would in turn result in every ADC building those items and Guinsoo's, getting the stacks on Guinsoo's, and then dealing just as much damage to squishies anyway because they double hit every other auto for probably 30-40% max health per hit, depending on how much is put on the items.\n\nBasically, the only way to turn ADCs into something more balanced is to give them something that would force another item to be reworked because it's just as broken.","replies":[]}]}
