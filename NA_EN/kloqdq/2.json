These capsules contain champ shards and blue essence, and if you hit special milestone levels, you’ll earn special rewards like gemstones or hella rare emotes.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/nXlJYxE6-shout-out-to-cactopus-and-other-rioters?comment=00000001\n> The whole system is balanced so it will be as fast or faster to unlock champions than before with the IP-based system. That said, we are making First win of the Day more important (it'll give a ton of XP). So if you're the type of player who plays tons of games every day you might find it slightly slower. Otherwise you'll be unlocking champs in at roughly the same or faster rate.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/sJ8N14Hy-riot-cactopus-just-confirmed-we-are-no-longer-getting-ipbe-after-games-how-do-you-feel?comment=001b\n> We are NOT making it harder for you to unlock champs. Unlocking champs is getting way faster for everyone with preseason with runes becoming free, and then we're also tuning leveling speeds specifically so that leveling gets you champs as fast or a little faster than the old IP-after-every-game system. \n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/8h0YpEWl-how-to-reward-vets-without-just-dumping-30-boxes-on-them?comment=00150006000100010000000000000000000000000000\n> This is why we keep stressing that the new system isn't going to slow down the rate at which you earn champs. For players like you, you're almost certainly going to be earning them faster than before. The only folks who might earn champs a little more slowly are the people who play tons of games every day and reach a very high level. And even then it's only going to feel a little slower for them because we're putting more power into the First Win of the Day (it'll give a lot of bonus XP).

We definitely are not intending to give players exclusive cosmetic content for leveling from 1-30. There has been an idea floating around about maybe giving you like a random ward skin or whatever when you hit 20, but I don't actually think we're even going to do that. So again, if you're already level 30, you're not actually missing out on anything. You got IP when you were leveling.
