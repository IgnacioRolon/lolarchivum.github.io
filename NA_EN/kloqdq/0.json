Every game pretty much gets broken down into, who has the most crit and how long can they AA. Crit is the one stat that can make or break a game, and how much crit you get, and how often you get them, completely removes skill and meaningful choices for every adc and player. This is because Crit makes a character&#039;s late game amazing, Yasuo is a great example of why loads of Crit chance can create toxic gameplay, expect with more range. As a stat it&#039;s bad but as a damage enhancement it&#039;s good. Current crit is a terrible thing for this game.\n\nGood examples of a &quot;Crit&quot; type of ability are:\nCaitlyn Headshot\nJhin 4th shot\nVayne Silver Bolt proc\nKled 4th auto\nFiora second Auto on E(w maybe? been a while)\netc etc etc.\n\nThe reason why these are GOOD is because they have a clear indication of when they are going to happen, there is some way to avoid the damage and it&#039;s an amount that is guaranteed and balanceable. Current crit isn&#039;t like that, due to it&#039;s random nature, uncertainty and hard to pin point amount. This is also unhealthy for the game because every marksman and their mother can only be viable if they are good with Crit. &quot;You can build crit son? WELCOME TO THE FAMILY&quot;\n\nNo...Just no.\n\nBuild paths are ruined because every marksman needs crit to be op, so when someone snowballs, they get more crit and they win. You can&#039;t do anything else because Crit is too good. The only reason leath. worked is because it allowed for more early game but at the cost of later. Now that crit is the only strong option, and it&#039;s strong, it&#039;s unbearable. If crit was removed then all the crit based items could be redesigned and rebalanced to better serve another purpose. IE could amp damage every 3rd aa with a jinx style attack speed buff the longer you auto as an example. Items could be changed to really make them special and not just, okay this makes my crit better, with the effect as second. \n\nPlease let me know what you guys think. I would love to hear some more opinions on this. I know a good number of people are thinking the same and I hope Riot will look at this issue and agree. Thanks!\n\n*Note* I don't really think ADCs are all that bad or anything. I'm not raging please nerf or some shit. I just want to see the role have more and I know it's because of crit that we will almost never get that. I will try reply to any comment and explain my reasoning and thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyber HeroXL","date":"2017-06-22T18:27:01.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://orig09.deviantart.net/bd28/f/2015/128/8/f/tomska_i_love_it_by_misterchive-d8sniol.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"abca98","date":"2017-06-22T18:25:43.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My problem with crit chance is that it is unpredictable. You never know when to expect that extra damage. I would like crit to dissapear and be a different stat, like a damage amplifier that grows like {{champion:22}}  passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-06-22T19:11:56.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree. Crit is ruled by RNG and it also is just unhealthy when you get 80% crit and autos do 1000+ damage all the time. Moving Crit to the stuff I listed and even ashe like passive make it a lot more fair and reasonable. It's also just something to balance easier.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-22T18:18:46.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, specially in regards to how much it railroads ADCs builds. The standard ADC build is the triple-crit (2 zeal items + IE/ER), lifestal and amor pen (LDR/MR). Maybe sell boots late game for GA. A handful of ADCs escape the pattern (Ez, Draven) but most fit it to a T. The choices are mostly between Runaans or Shiv, then between PD or RFC.","replies":[{"poster":"Kloqdq","date":"2017-06-22T19:10:31.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much.

Right now it's crit or bust. It's almost always like that. I'm not saying just remove crit and leave the marksmen's out in the wind to be forgotten. I'm saying, shift their power to more meaningful items and scalings that aren't rng, aren't one dimensional and are not the single factor to decide if you can win a game or not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moooose2","date":"2017-06-22T18:31:37.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3143}}","replies":[]}]}
