Might not be your standards, but the vast community around the world has adjusted to this system and we're happy with it. Only people who have a problem with this system is either they're new or lack empathy or they're completely ignorant. I and many players who have adjusted to this system have been here since 2009 and still going. Most of us, we go in with a positive attitude and intentions when we play the game. The people who try to ruin it for us, we just mute them, report and move on. Riot isn't really concern about new players, as long they're positive players. \n\nLeague of Legends is meant for players with a positive mindset and self-control. Which you're lacking.

The system is fine and it's improving. Also, you're only level 11 with maybe what, a week of experiencing League of Legends community? I've been here for 9 years and I've seen it all. I've seen every kind of player the internet has to offer and when it comes to this community, League of Legends community. Nothing surprises me. I've even seen you type of players. New and fresh with billions of thoughts, idea and many complaints. With no idea what they're talking about. While we welcome idea and complaints, there are things that never change here. That's the players. While more are getting punished every day of every hour, we still have them. \n\nYou're new here and you have to understand that the mute function is your best friend. \nWe have a couple sayings here.\n\n**\"Mute Report and move on.\" and \"You're either part of the game or part of the problem**.\"\n\nIf you're bent on joining arguments or \"defending\" yourself or others, then you're part of the problem. Riot wants to get rid of that problem. That's where punishment tiers come in. You only get four. The fourth one is the one you want to avoid. But if you think this game is meant for chatting, arguing, and insulting, then like I said, you're not meant to be here. Because that requires Self-Control.\n\n_**Advice:** If you want to help your team or friends, tell them to mute that toxic player and report after.\nDon't ask reports, don't tell the player you're them and do not provoke them. \nMute. Report.

We can all claim we don't deserve to be punished or anything of the sort. But in most cases, when threads about a defense are made, it often comes up that what is considered to be ok for some, is considered to be not ok for not only the rules of the game, but for a good deal of players.\n\nIf you believe yourself to be a victim of a false report that had slipped through, it's better to file a ticket. Sooner that gets cleared off the account the better in that case.","replies":[{"poster":"Dont Quit ILY ","date":"2018-03-13T00:12:37.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I assure you it wasn't a false report but, under these circumstances I move that we make what it takes to get a punishment harder/ taking multiple offense and increasing harshness of punishments with more over time.","replies":[{"poster":"YokoNomi","date":"2018-03-13T00:16:28.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dont Quit ILY ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gxfuUmGA,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-13T00:12:37.975+0000)\n>\n> I assure you it wasn&#x27;t a false report but, under these circumstances I move that we make what it takes to get a punishment harder/ taking multiple offense and increasing harshness of punishments with more over time.\n\nPlayers already get permanently banned after a 14 day ban, if they're persistent with their behavior. Unless you plan to head to their place of living and cut off a toe or something, I think the actual punishment itself is bad enough. Also, against the idea of making the punishment system more lenient. The problem is, the game probably is the way it is with the system, due to how players can get.\n\nThe unfortunate part is the latter isn't excluded to League. It's why I never bothered with Overwatch Ranked. One match was all it took for me to wonder when I started playing CoD. Competitive games can bring out the worst and best in people.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-03-13T00:06:38.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks.
