But since you started releasing king rammus and ufo corki to the public and no account start date on any forum or profile. Is there anywhere I can go to show that yes I am from Beta and have been playing since the start? It would be nice if the very few still with the game from the start got at very least a Icon or maybe the border that I got with Def not blitzcrank on the second release of it. Showing that I got the skin from beta and not a box or something. Just  showing a start date of some kind on profile or forum is something.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nLong time shy supporter yfelomen :)\r\n\r\np.s. still love the game lol","replies":[{"poster":"SuperGeon","date":"2017-06-06T02:38:50.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did they start giving out King Rammus and UFO Corki?

Not like I can send this as a link to anyone. I feel like I should have something to show someone the years I have spent sticking with League. But honestly people just dont believe me when I say I been playing since the Beta and it's frustrating.\n\nbtw I am not seeing anything about how long I have been with league with that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
