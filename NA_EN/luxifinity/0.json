Some even thought about dishonoring themselves just to get their desired color. Then a rioter said something like encouraging the people who commented about this not to dishonor themselves and riot will consider this feedback and think about it. I see this on the comment section of the announcement post and boards. \n\nand guess what? they didn&#039;t do anything. The honor ward we got is still depending on our honor level, no freedom of choice. I was actually considering to intentionally throw games and flaming to get honor 3 since I extremely love the color blue, but I trusted riot they will figure something out of this oh boi they did nothing at the end. I disliked purple. \n\nI'm just extremely disappointed ","replies":[]}
