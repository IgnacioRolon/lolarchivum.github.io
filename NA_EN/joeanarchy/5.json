NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE.\r\nsame with ANY OTHER sport.\r\nLeague is no exception.\r\neven if you&#039;re way ahead, and winning lane, and roaming well, and winning team fights (when they happen) if your team is running in without you, dying and feeding the enemy team, you&#039;re gonna have a much harder time winning, doesn&#039;t matter how good you are.\r\n\r\nand granted a diamond level player might be able to get on a smurf account and climb out of low elo, but they have had time to practice against other diamond level players.. similar to a pro football player could easily beat a bunch of elementary school kids at the game..\r\nif you&#039;re stuck in low elo, you can&#039;t practice against higher skilled players and get better and climb. so you won&#039;t get to the point where you can do that..\r\nlike if an elementary school kid never practices at football again in his life, he won&#039;t get any better.\r\nbut that diamond level player still won&#039;t be able to be 5 places at once, and is gonna lose due to trolls and stuff too..\r\n\r\ntruth is, if you&#039;re trying to climb, but feel stuck because your team is feeding and holding you back. they probably are. \r\njust like any other sport.\r\nin a regular sport, if you&#039;re doing good, and your team is sucking, the coach will keep you and cut the ones who aren&#039;t, and you&#039;ll get to move forward and they won&#039;t.. sadly LP Gain/Loss is just measured by if your overall team wins, when it should look at individual performance win or lose.. because you can do well, but your team suck.. \r\n\r\nall in all, if you&#039;re doing well, it is your teams fault you aren&#039;t climbing. period.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yautja wannabe","date":"2018-09-21T07:25:27.577+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Many people feel the same way, which is why they're updating the ranked system.
