If your opponents want to cycle the drake, they have to kill it. This gives YOU an advantage if you choose not to focus the drake, because you are not preoccupied with the drake and can choose to do things like gank or steal their red buff while they are trying to kill the drake you're not interested in. The longer the drake goes unattended, the less time there is for new drakes to spawn, so if you keep the drake warded, you can use your opponent's movements to your advantage if they feel they need to cycle it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2018-09-28T03:25:19.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And just to add to your point, especially in low elo:\nIt becomes easy to bait the enemy team towards the objective with the 1 intention of making picks on the enemy team","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZackTheWaffleMan","date":"2018-09-27T17:39:06.321+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oleandervine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zto6WaOF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-09-27T17:17:10.733+0000)\n>\n> Fire and Earth [...] Wind and Water \n\nI'm triggered that you didn't call them by their correct names","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alzon","date":"2018-09-27T18:14:57.616+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cloud Drake is my favorite.

Honestly with how weak turrets are anyway I feel it's better than Mountain, and it scales better than Ocean even if it's weaker early game.\n\nPeople just don't respect it because it's invisible power, compared with seeing true damage numbers pop up off Mountain or seeing your health/mana tick back up with Ocean in the early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-09-28T01:44:44.008+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I’m taking a tower over an ocean dragon, sorry.\n\nThe amount of effort to take ocean is too great, especially since it’s only dragon that can fuck you over if the enemy comes over since it has a powerful slow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrza","date":"2018-09-28T13:01:18.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ocean is my favourite because I'm a mid and support main, so that health/mana regen is SUPER useful.

So part of that decision comes down to who the two junglers are in the game.  If there is a Shyv, you need to take the dragon if she is on your team or not.  If you are a fast killing high sustain like WW, then there is no excuse to ignoring drag unless they really ahve it camped out, but then you can be bullying other lanes.  Some rare junglers like Yorick are mostly about objectives and then lane pushing.  When you can run around with maiden in jungle all day, you own the jungle unless they team you.  Some champs are plain up aweful at stronger objectives and cannot take it unless they have another lane available to them.  Also, it is aweful to take early dragon if your team is at risk of losing first turret.\n\nSo taking drag is not always so simple, but any drag offers advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devaliah","date":"2018-09-28T03:18:39.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an eve jungle i love cloud drakes, i like the bonus move speed on my clears, as well as the synergy with celerity when you stake them. not to mention just staking 2 together makes it really hard for the opponent to catch up to you, easier to position and execute plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wacky9","date":"2018-09-28T02:47:35.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other junglers not taking dragon...\n\n_Smiles in_\n{{champion:102}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2018-09-28T01:27:30.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine if the team is in the middle of taking towers/rift/baron over any non infernal drakes, nothing is wrong with trading. \n\nIt's also dumb to die for anything not infernal when your team is behind.\n\n I will still spam ping the jungler if he doesn't take the free dragons when I call for it no matter the dragon type, there is no excuse for failing to take something that is free to take when they have nothing better to do at the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excellent Era","date":"2018-09-27T20:17:55.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you aren't talking about smurfs..\n\nbut its a little known fact that challenger/diamond smurfs almost never take dragons unless an infernal spawns, that's how pointless the other dragons are to smurfs","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-09-27T18:12:46.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly sometimes in solo que it is not worth it due to the fact that if its Mountain drake it only really helps you late game although the true damage to towers is great. most of the time risking lane pressure, losing experience, minion gold, or risk getting a surprise attack by the enemy is not worth it.","replies":[]}]}
