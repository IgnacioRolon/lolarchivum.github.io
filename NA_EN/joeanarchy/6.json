We already have a ranged DPS hypercarry in bot lane. We don't need two. We need some kind of utility, engage or splitter.\n\nI don't mind off meta stuff but Jinx top makes zero sense.

The only time I could even kill her was if I had flash because I had to use all my damage to get on top of her otherwise.
