Her W means she can never be ganked and can never be poked or focused down. She can dive -before- level 6 and get away with it the majority of the time.\r\nOnce she hits 6, her death-bubble extends to 1500+ units thanks to her ult, which is on a shorter base cooldown than almost any other ultimate ability in the game.\r\nOh, and if you want to ward the bush she's hiding in, good luck, since she'll just auto-Q-auto it for free gold (assuming she doesn't just engage on you for another kill, for some reason).\r\n\r\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do against Leona?","replies":[]}
