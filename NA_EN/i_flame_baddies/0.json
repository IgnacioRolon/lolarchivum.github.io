It is a fun game that can be slightly addicting, yet the community has to be the worst in any game I have ever played. You just get these super toxic people who have no idea what they are doing. I am gold iii on an alt account and i create a new account to duo with a friend who is getting back into league. First game in my provisionals some guy trolls and decides to Soraka Jungle, K, quick 18 minute loss. Next game up against a panth+rengar bot lane. Easy right? Well top lane (teemo) loses to Yi  top lane so mid flames and they both rage afk type at each other. OK...next game..velkoz jungle, yas support, with malphite adc..(dodged). Reque  user 1 wants to be mid, but user 2 denies that request. So user 1 bans his champ and picks adc and runs mid all game. Did not dodge because I already dodged once. I mean even on my main account it is the same type of shit. It seems like Gold and below is a bunch of little ragey pre-teens and RIOT DOES NOTHING! But let me drop an F bomb to tell the two ragey kids to Shut the F$%^ up i get slapped with a 10 chat ban, not to mention those who &quot;soft feed&quot; get no penalties. &quot;its hard to tell if someone is feeding.&quot; Multi Million dollar company, create a division that investigates inting reports that requires watching video and identifying play patterns. its not hard. I think I am going on another 4 month break from this game. Gives me headaches.\n\nP.S. before people dismiss my claims due to my username, it is supposed to be facetious as I do not flame at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2018-12-14T05:15:49.006+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the state of the game upsets you that much, then maybe taking a break might be the best course of action for the time being. \n------------------------------------\n> [{quoted}](name=I Flame Baddies,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hsd1p6jg,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-12-14T04:34:50.473+0000)\n>\n> But let me drop an F bomb to tell the two ragey kids to Shut the F$%^ up i get slapped with a 10 chat ban\n\nIf your teammates are hardcore raging at one another & you see no way to diffuse the situation peacefully (telling them to \"shut the F$%^ up\" will just make things worse), then you'll just have to mute them & power on through the game.\n\nAs a support main who grinded to Gold, I have had plenty of games with Teammates such as the ones you described.

Especially with people like T1 [pre-reform] (meaning, especially people who can just continue to create multiple accounts, get multiple accounts permabanned, and still continue the cycle without caring about the consequences)\n\nIt being the game refers to things like their bots taking care of the report system not being able to differentiate certain aspects such as 4-mans report stacking their rando when they lose...or having a lot of bugs or server issues...or literally everything to do with f- -king Kai'Sa.\n\nThe players don't make those decisions. But in the event of having a 4 man who report stacks their rando when they lose, or people who find and constantly exploit an in-game bug knowing full-well it's not how the game's intended to be played, or deciding to one trick a champion with 0 counterplay potential past lv 11...those are all community (player) issues.\n\n(If you can't tell, I hate Kai'Sa... :P )","replies":[{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2018-12-16T02:29:12.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could be right in free to play being a factor.  but in my opinion the most toxic thing about this game is the inability to leave.\n\ni play a lot of CoD and i sometimes get pretty mad playing it.  i often will get frustrated and pissed at the way my team is playing or how the enemy team is playing.  but there is an instant cure for my frustrations in that game.  i turn off my ps4.  and it is almost instant relief.\n\nwhen i get frustrated and upset in LoL there is no relief.  i am stuck with these teammates or enemies who are making me suffer for sometimes 45+ minutes.  so i reach the point where im not having fun anymore and i am still trapped in that frustration for a very long time.  no escape.\n\nthen my rage builds and builds and sometimes i lash out with toxicity at the other players.  this NEVER happens to me in CoD.  because it is only a thing in this game.  the game itself has a toxic design.  \n\nplayers who are toxic in this game are very often not a problem in other games they play.  that is proof that the game is what causes these players to be toxic.\n\nPS - i hate kai'sa too","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2018-12-16T15:43:16.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a very fair statement: you definitely have nailed the issue in the fact that you get punished all the same for attempting to remove yourself from a toxic situation. Obviously, they have a reason for doing that: leavers are an almost guaranteed game loss.\n\nThat's one of those slippery-slope arguments, because saying that riot should remove that feature of punishing leavers will result in constant leavers, but there's obviously an issue in being unable to remove yourself from a situation before becoming the same as the people you've got an issue with.\n\nMy suggestion would be to further reduce the timer for surrender to 10 minutes. While at 10m, I completely agree with riot that its too damn early to call the game, toxic people have already made up their minds, and people wanting out of the game with those people are...well...wanting out of the game with those people. 10 minutes is about the average amount of time it takes for toxic people to peak in their toxicity, as well as about the average time that their victims are most tempted to become villains by fighting back.\n\nMy main was perma'd essentially from exactly the issue you're talking about, so believe me, I feel you. But I firmly believe that the people are the issue. It's not Riot's job to make everyone get along. It's their job to make a game, and to make sure that people aren't intentionally throwing it to ruin the fun and the chances for their teammates, which is not quite the same.","replies":[{"poster":"EL HAMSTERO","date":"2018-12-17T01:44:18.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah man i dont think it is riot's fault.  they have created a great game but it is also a toxic game.  \n\ni agree with you i dont really see a good solution to leavers.  it would be really bad if players could leave the game too.  it would end up being like 5 vs 2 in like half of the games. \n\nso yeah they are probably doing the right thing not allowing people to leave.  but it doesnt change the fact that being stuck in a frustrating situation for 20 minutes is extremely toxic.  it is just the way the game is.  the game is toxic.\n\nand thats before we even start to talk about snowballing, autofill, demoting, etc.  there are multiple factors built into the game that cause extreme distress to players.  it is a toxic game before you even add the other players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-12-14T17:01:51.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, you want Riot to create an entire division to investigate punishment cases?\n\nYou remember this thing called the Tribunal?

It IS hard to tell inting from having a really bad game in some situations...like my most recent, super embarrassing Fizz game where I thought I could fight Akali and ended up spending more time dead than alive. Not from inting, but from getting pretty much constantly destroyed by this guy and his jungler at every point of the game. Fizz is not fun to play when shut down. But I will admit that it certainly LOOKS like I was trying to feed...that's probably one of my worst games and highest death counts since I was a literal noob.\n\n4.
