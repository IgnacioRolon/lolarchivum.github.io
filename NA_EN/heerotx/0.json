It's a lot different than an anonymous online service. I think there's always going to be some amount of troll on the internet. I don't think complete reformation is possible in the long-haul, but I do think it is somewhat feasible to limit it by restrictions and bans. I think with the way it's set up now, it does help by a lot, but there are still some major flaws to it. From what I understand of the internet, it keeps their websites clean by restrictions and bans. Idk what I could suggest to help, I'm just adding my two-cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeeroTX","date":"2018-06-13T15:48:07.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, thank you very much for replying, I honestly appreciate getting a response from a Red.\n\nSecond, my suggestion in theory provides \"good\" experience for the reporting player rather than \"bad\" experience for the reported player.  This is my thought.  If the majority of players all report 1 player in pregame as \"toxic\" then they all get to re-queue for a new game.  No harm, no foul.  The \"troll\" also queues for a new game.  This allows the majority to move on quickly and ENJOY the game and EVENTUALLY the troll should lose interest or at worst only adds say a minute delay to each lobby he joins.  If people want to cry about the \"abuse\" case, then in a \"worst\" case yes, people can use this to dodge an off-meta pick that they don't like, BUT I would suggest this is ALSO better in the long run since the alternative is that they'll be \"forced\" to play that game and I'd bet at least 50% of the time will flame the off-meta person (leading to MORE toxicity in the game).\n\nHere's the problem, the game is INTENTIONALLY tuned for team-play.  The rank system is intentionally configured to only reward TEAM achievements (rather than individual achievements) and the whole system is designed to only reward you for working WITH your team.  This is good in that a well designed strategy game SHOULD revolve around a cohesive team.  The PROBLEM is that if you're not going to PUNISH people who clearly get their jollies from sabotaging the team. (they don't care about the \"rewards\" of proper play) then the WHOLE experience is destroyed for people that want to play the game.  This means EITHER there needs to be an \"automated\" solution that (yes) allows for bad actors to abuse it, but the benefit will be there for players who want to work TOGETHER. (no offense, I'm mostly fine with whatever non-standard pick anyone wants to do, my own main isn't \"meta\" right now, but if you want to play YOUR choice pick, then you're also putting your preference above the \"team\") Or else, you (Riot) need to put more effort into MANUALLY policing trolls/toxicity, because yes, the only real \"solution\" is to have human people respond to complaints because players of a game that is designed to get us to find the optimal solution will find ways to \"game\" any detection algorithm.\n\nTLDR; Please either give us more control of our team in this TEAM game, or else give us better rewards/goals for the individual, because currently the bad actors have too much control to sabotage the player experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnIy Leona","date":"2018-06-13T12:41:51.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about a checkbox option to mute everyone, even in champ lobby. that way you dont have to do it in game too, and it mutes pings too.. pings are used mostly as toxic now lately, all the question mark pings when you miss a skillshot or mess up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-06-13T02:17:50.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it seems like you are playing something off meta and it works for you, but to us its trolling so bye\"","replies":[{"poster":"HeeroTX","date":"2018-06-13T02:21:17.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnboundHades,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8LXqaJE0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-13T02:17:50.230+0000)\n>\n> &quot;it seems like you are playing something off meta and it works for you, but to us its trolling so bye&quot;\n\nNo, dude LITERALLY banned my pick and picked the support choice simply because support also questioned why he banned my pick.

I do this for one of 3 reasons 1) The champion is trash in the current meta 2) The champion is trash for that specific role 3) I don't want the enemy to have that pick (ie you are last pick and plan to play Yi, yeah good luck with that). I don't do this all the time, only when I feel that if I DON'T ban that champion we will guarantee lose. I have actually had some people stay in lobby and pick something more relevant to the team comp after that and we win. It's when people get mad and choose to punish us for making a ban choice that things get sour. This is why I never declare a pick. I can often times tell just by what people are planning to pick whether or not we will win. And most of the time people don't care about team comp they are dead set on their planned pick regardless. Riot gives me a ban to use how I see fit. And that is how I see fit to use it. I'm not being toxic or trying to piss you off, nor trying to be funny, I'm trying to do what I feel gives the team a better chance to win (yes I know you think being able to pick your one trick will win us the game, but that is a very conceited and quite frankly, blind way of looking at the game).\n\nOn a side note, I wish ban phase in ranked was similar to LCS. Being able to see the bans, and NOT have duplicate bans could add more strategy to the game and actually make us randos feel like a team. Give us time to talk strat, open up for more counters. Overall a more competitive game imo.

I was angry that the player banned my champ, but I COULD have accepted it, but THEN he PICKED the Support's champ (and Soraka is NOT a good top pick, at least certainly not in current META) which says to me that person was trolling, period.
