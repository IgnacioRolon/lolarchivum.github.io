So what if there was a new way to Queue that worked thusly:\r\n\r\n1. Click &quot;Ranked Team Builder&quot;\r\n2. Choose your roles as per current\r\n3. Game goes as normal\r\n4. Once game ends, if you played your PRIMARY (or if queue&#039;d as fill) you&#039;re given the option to stay in your current role (or leave the team)\r\n4b. If you played as your secondary or &quot;autofill&quot; you can offer to switch roles with another player, if they accept next game plays with your new role considered your &quot;primary&quot; (considered secondary/autofill for the person swapped) or you can just keep your role or you can leave\r\n5. You can vote to &quot;kick&quot; a player.  If 3+ players choose to kick one, that player is booted.  If less than 3 players agree then any players who voted to kick auto-leave\r\n6. Once roles/departures are settled, the team queues and fills any missing roles\r\n\r\nIdeally, after a small number of games, you SHOULD be able to find a solid TEAM that can work together.  At worst, you should be able to slowly build up a group of people that you mesh well with.  And ideally, you should only need to replace 1-2 people as time goes on.  It should also be easier to identify trolls/toxic players since they will continuously be kicked.  It should also cut down on &quot;elo hell&quot; because most people should have a &quot;known good&quot; (or at least &quot;decent&quot;) set after a small number of games.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-06-28T20:04:13.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't that the same as just adding the people you liked playing with and queueing with them next game? Plus, how many people play ranked games back to back like that? Most people I know like to at least get a few minutes break between games, specially ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"HeeroTX","date":"2017-06-28T20:22:27.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no.  Yes, you can replicate this functionality pretty easily, but it's pretty well established that people will more likely go along with something if they don't need to put \"extra\" effort.  Plus, this system would (in a way) \"insure\" you maintain your role, whereas the current system does not.  I think a fair number of players would keep the band together if they have a good team AND maintain their role.  The whole point would be to build to a team and maintain it as long as possible and then (eventually) hopefully just swap out 1 player/role every so often as people leave.\n\nI know I often play several ranked in a row, especially if I'm on a winning streak.  I usually walk away if LOSING both to get off tilt (if necessary) and (to a lesser extent) to NOT re-queue with a losing team.  Plus, there's a decent number of people who for a variety of reasons don't want to friend someone after 1 game OR immediately jump out of lobby.  This mode would mean people EXPECT to maintain a good team and just gives a simple mechanism to stick with good/friendly players.","replies":[]}]}]}
