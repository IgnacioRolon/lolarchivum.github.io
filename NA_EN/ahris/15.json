It will help understand the comparison between APC and ADC. Can ignore if you want and go down! \r\n\r\n\r\nADC should not have so much defensive items for being a very strong threat. Lifesteal already is one of the strongest defensive stats in game. It works in lane, and in all phase of the game. Late game it can heal a ton through crits as well. Along with lifesteal, they have so many anti mage items and anti assassin items while being much more of a threat than Assassins or Mages. \r\n\r\nImo ADC should not have lifesteal. They should not be able to lifesteal through assassin&#039;s burst. They already can QSS mage&#039;s survivability cc and lifesteal off of them when they are trying super hard to burst you, why do they have more defensive items? \r\n\r\nIn the other hand of ADC, Mages have: Banshee, Zhonyas... that&#039;s it. They don&#039;t have any other items to combat Assasins or ADC and that shows a lack of defensive items for mage. Zhonyas have a 120 sec cd which is much longer than QSS or Edge of Night Cd. Banshee can easily be broken by a poke and they have to wait 40 sec for it to come back up(though adc&#039;s use auto attacks so banshee is not rlly a counter to them). \r\n\r\nEither remove some defensive items from ADC (riot said they are planning to buff edge of night) or give some defensive items to Mages.
