You are supposed to take damage if you went glass cannon runes. The tradeoff is you do more damage for less tankiness. \n\nNow sacrifice your secondary tree for more tanky ones so that you can survive more. Tanks are still quite tanky to assassins and mages. They arent strong against adc as adc is obviously their counter. \n\nFull damage runes is a high risk high reward playstyle. You can either snowball so well or end up feeding and get snowballed against. Going 1 defensive and 1 damage will mean the snowballing effect will be minimized more as people will end up surviving more.","replies":[]}
