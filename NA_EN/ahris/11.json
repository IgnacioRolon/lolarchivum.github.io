It also has stealing summoner spell and 70% movement speed for around 4 seconds. \r\n\r\nA better E, goes over walls and goes very far. Can access the back line very easily and can chunk for tremendous damage. It also does true damage and tanks are also hurt from it. \r\n\r\nA better R... arguable. \r\n\r\nAlso a better passive. Zoe has lichbane passive and Ahri has some garbage 20% for 3 seconds only when 2 spell hits. \r\n\r\nSo yes. Overall Ahri is a MUCH worse version of Zoe who does her job but MUCH better. Ahri is all about E Q burst and Zoe does it but can do it everytime much more easily. \r\n\r\nHow is this fair? What does Riot think of Ahri? Saying she is fine is a STUPID lie they can make. Fine? Lol gl with this game ruining my champ.","replies":[]}
