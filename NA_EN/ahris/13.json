I think I should just stop this League playing. The way Riot reworks Ahri with disguised nerfs and constantly nerf her kit everytime has done it for me. Riot does it this way and ignores her when she feels horrible to play. \r\n\r\nMany of you guys dont like me, yeah, I get it. I comment too much about Ahri and you guys are annoyed by it. Apologies. Ahri is a champ that I just enjoyed a lot in the past and has been my main constantly. \r\n\r\nBut ever since her rework in season 5, her kit was just completely ruined in every angle. Every single one of her skill was nerfed. Not ONE ability was spared to stay as is. Though her Q did not quite get as much of a nerf, but the mana cost nerf still remains that took place at season 5 rework. \r\n\r\nI know you guys hate Ahri as a champ. You guys may find her hard to deal with. Sure. Now compare her to basically every single Mage in game. Do you find her hard to deal with? Not quite. \r\n\r\nAhri was once again nerfed at around season 7? Only because the mass population could not stand that Ahri is played too much and have a decent winrate. Just because of that. The very annoying part of playing against her? The argument was often, \"I just cant kill her!\", \"She gets away too easily!\" None of them was about her doing too much damage, or in general toxic gameplay. Ahri's identity at that time was an uncatchable midlaner who relies on landing her difficult to land skill shots to do damage to single target who also lack significant amount of AOE damage. \r\n\r\nSince Ahri, compared to other Mages, is significantly more squishy than others. She has much less utility than others as her charm is her ONLY cc and it is single target and also much harder to land than most skill shots in game. The only thing going for her is her single target burst. \r\n\r\nEven then, people argued that she was broken, only looking at the stats on winrate and nothing else. No highelo players considered her broken, only lowelos found her difficult to deal with(she wasnt even picked oftenly in competitive). How it feels to lane against a champ is also an important factor for the game. Ahri still could not quite 100-0 an enemy before without being significantly fed(meaning missing a charm did mean her damage went down a lot). But the very fact that she just won games more than normal because of how her kit functions as an uncatchable apc, Riot considered to nerf. \r\n\r\nCurrent way of Riot nerfing champs looks at numbers, popularity, and winrate rather than how the champ feels to play/play against. I believe none of you will object to this when we had Zoe, constant Zed buffs, anivia buffs, master yi gold thingy(though it is getting nerfed, but only because it produces also high winrate and used competitively and making it seem unhealthy), Yasuo, Irelia, and many more. \r\n\r\nRiot constantly argue about healthy or not healthy concerning other champs, but to some champs Riot constantly gives favoritism. Even on the skin video where Riot was announcing this years skin for the less popular champ, Riot included Ahri in as a joke that existed amongst League community about her getting too much skins. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at so many other champs in game, like Lux, Draven, Garen, Darius, and many more, they get at least around 1 skin per year, at a more frequent intervals than Ahri. Though, many people ignore those champ and focus on Ahri. Why Ahri over all champ? \r\n\r\nThe fact that Riot announces Ahri as basically a champ that gets many skin on the video just fed on to the popular joke in the community, making it seem like a fact that she gets more skin than any other champ. This is depressing because other champs do get as much or more than she but those are ignored. \r\n\r\nNow, talk about Ahri reworks. Riot always nerfed her AOE damage in favor of her single target damage. Which is a constant removal of her Mage identity, but into an assassin. However, compared to any other Assassin, she has no way to use her snowball to carry games. The reason for this is because, Assassins DO have reliable single target burst that does most of time mean they kill the target unless the assassin player messes up very hard.\r\n\r\nFor example, look at leblanc. Her Q R W combo alone does significant amount of damage that can delete players late game. As well as Talon who only needs to proc his passive mid game to do a lot of damage to delete the enemy. As well as Zed. Most of these champ has unavoidable damage that allows them to carry games and be the sole reason their team will win. Other than Talon, many Assassin scales not too bad into late game, making them scale as much as Ahri(once her ultimate is down, she is more useless than any other Mage in game). \r\n\r\nThere are also champs like Zoe who basically does the same thing Ahri does but better. Her E is a much better E that can be used in lane, teamfights, and also applies wonderful damage to tanks without putting herself into any risk at all. She can use her combo without much risk, and repetitively because of their low cool down. In terms of AOE damage, well Zoe's Q also does AOE but not that useful as an AOE. Same can be said for Ahri because her Q's AOE is only relevant for midgame when not everyone has too much damage and her Q still does damage. However, once around 25+ min, her Q becomes basically a spell only to cast when you land charm. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because, there is no reason to use Q to apply damage only when your team is doing well to push the enemy back. Meaning, her one ability to deal AOE damage relies on her team to also be in an advantage. So, her being fed is one of most useless thing to happen as she does not offer anything for the team, and even her single target burst relies on her extremely difficult spell to land to be able to burst anyone. \r\n\r\nOther Mages, when fed, does a lot of damage and does not need to rely on one spell to do damage while their other spell being AOE damage that has great hitboxes as well. Lets look at Syndra. \r\n\r\nShe is a Mage that has amazing burst, aoe, utility, and kiting ability. If Syndra Misses Q, no problem, you still can slow the enemy with W and land your E and ultimate for the finisher. All of this is AOE except for her ultimate. Even without ultimate, with significant fedness she can do a lot of damage to a single target, but as well as other champs due to her AOE damage and also her utility(aoe slow and stun).\r\n\r\nAhri, her W and R does no damage despite it having much lower range than other Mages while also ONLY landing to 3 targets unreliably. This is fine, since it is auto targetted so hitting them all may be too strong. However, with its current strength and range, it is a horrible ability to use. Add on to the fact that her W will only gain extra range when she lands charm, yes to single target burst, to deal perhaps the electrocrute damage to make the damage seem high is dumb. W has less than 1/2 the cd of charm but its relevance is only when charm is up. What is the point to even have this ability? It ONLY does damage, and ONLY to single target and its damage is basically NO damage. \r\n\r\nDid you know that Zoe's W has much more damage than Ahri's W? and that Zoe's W gives her free summoners and 70% ms for 3? secs? The ratio on Ahri's W is basically what you would give a tank, not to a Mage, but the tank spell would also have some kind of utility as well. \r\n\r\nEver since the range nerf onto her W and R, Ahri slowly became a champ that is a wannabe Assassin. Riot constantly nerfed her AOE damage and never tried to fix that part of her. People will only look at the numbers concerning her single target. Well, know this, her single target damage was much better in season 4 because her w and r also had decent ratios. Now, the numbers on her W and R is very very low. \r\n\r\nRiot made Ahri required to take electrocrute to deal damage. Riot believes that making her burst relient on a rune that is on 50? sec cd is an AWESOME way to make her feel amazing to play. To be honest, electrocrute should be removed all together. No champ should rely on a rune that is only up every 50 sec and be balanced around it. \r\n\r\nMost of this writing will perhaps disappear into this board and will probably never be read. That is Riot's way of ignoring its players. I am very sad of what Riot did to Ahri and the way they decided to fix her, was to actually ruin her. If only Riot knew, Ahri was perhaps one of most well designed champ in season 4 and a very fair champ(winrate was around 49% but still VERY fair to play against and play and no one felt like she was too overbearing). If they knew that reverting everything of her kit to that time will mean she will be completely fine, then idk.\r\n\r\n I guess I will continue playing this game, I dont know. Playing league just became a habit for me. I feel obligated to play it since I played it for so long. If only there is other games I enjoy playing...\r\n\r\nRiot ruined League of Legends themselves. Riot made Ahri reworked and never tried to revert her kit to what it was before. \r\n\r\nHowever, people will constantly believe that Riot is making favoritism to Ahri, please. If you think constant nerfs is favoritism, I guess that may be true. Like got to nerf Irelia right? But, people always think Ahri is fine or whatever, when she is just horrible to play. Why they think she is good? Oh because I played her a couple of times and she did not feel bad! Or like, oh I played against her and I just lost :( . Or like, I played with her and she did fine. \r\n\r\nPeople say ADCs are unviable today, but they are still picked and played. They still have extremely broken lategames. But, are regarded as garbage because they think they are garbage. But since the mass population believe so, it becomes a norm and Riot has to buff ADC role. Why? Because League of Legend is buisness and if people leave because of nerfed crit adc, then they will lose their company! Crit adc is one of most unhealthy role in game that just single handedly determined if games are won. \r\n\r\nRiot's mistake was to leave ADC so strong for so long. Because of this,  many players became too possessive of the power that they had, that once their power is made balanced, they will rage and perhaps have no reason to play the game anymore.\r\n\r\nWhen Mage role has been in constant nerf throughout every season since like season 4, through disguised nerfs in Mage item rework, champ rework, and other stealth nerf to them, Mage players are not as vocal about their position becoming very weak. \r\n\r\nLike, believe it or not, the Mage \"rework\" sounded good. What they said made it seem like it is the best thing ever. But instead it was to make the game \"healthier\". Lol. \r\n\r\nAhri currently is not healthy. What healthy means that Riot has stated sometimes is, feels good to play against and while also fun to play as. She feels horrible to play as, and you would only play her if you dont care if you want to win or not. Other players may enjoy playing against Ahri because dodging her charm and killing her feels like an outplay, while charm being one of hardest skill to land in game and also being Ahri's primary damage, disengage, and surviability, is just horrible design. \r\n\r\nI talked a lot. If you are still reading thanks a lot. I think I'll end it here for now. I will most likely not play this game as I used to, if any. Riot ruined Ahri's kit throughout multiple seasons through Mage rework, stealth minion buffs which nerfed Ahri's wave clear(removing mr and making it scale hp so her true damage is useless), rune rework, and Ahri rework. \r\n\r\n If no one reads it, I am sad(well it is too long, and I used to read long ones until my brain got super tired of Riot's way of balancing). If Riot does not read it, I will also be sad, but it is expected if they dont. I was ignored constantly when I made posts before, this is nothing new. Riot never replied to my Ahri posts because they feel it is better for them to not get involved then to say anything. Then to get their hopes up. Yeah, this method is fine if you are not looking to have players stay playing. \r\n\r\nI don't know if Rioters remember me, but I was the one who made constant Ahri post since season 3, season 5, and many other seasons lol. It was a long journey. Not one post was commented by the Red. They claim they are reading it, maybe they are, but if you dont comment it feels like the entire post gone to a waste. Perhaps it is, looking at Ahri's current state which is worse than before. \r\n\r\nEver since Ghostcrawler in his video said they are planning to nerf Ahri, at around season 7? Was one of most bad thing I heard. Like what are they gonna nerf? Her kit already did not really have damage. Only thing they can do is like, revert season 5 rework and reduce her surviability that way to decrease her winrate. But no, they made her W and R damage, garbage lvl of damage which is only used for... idk? Spell stacking on her heal passive? Or like... not sure. Oh, her R is only for the dash and nothing else. You dont ever use her dash for damage because it does no damage. \r\n\r\nI remember when season 4 Ahri also had dfg on top of everything else. How that time she was so fun to play, rewarding, and also balanced. But Riot decided to destroy her kit. \r\n\r\nEvery day, I hope to see something regarding Ahri that was made better. Every day. Just last week, Meddler discussed possible Ahri buffs. I was happy! But, I knew it will end in a way I dont like. They never did the way that is best. They will probably tweak her passive movement speed or heal or mana cost. They wont touch what is the problem. \r\n\r\nI no longer get hopes up when seeing Ahri changes. I always had good hopes for it, and it was ruined. Even when she was balanced, she will get nerfed. So like, what can I do? If riot only looks like winrate and popularity and communities view on a champ, then how would it feel for them?\r\n\r\nI am quite saddened by coming Irelia nerfs, and to many champs. I completely dislike making some champs only relevant early/midgame, only for them to be completely outscaled, and completely unfun to play once it goes into lategame. Talon,Irelia, and Ahri, I feel is like this. Early/midgame, Talon and Irelia is really strong, but lategame they suddenly turn to be very useless unless had a great chance. Their damage falls off so hard and it feels really bad to play them. \r\n\r\nThen you have nerfs aiming to nerf them for ALL game time. Even though the champs problem was early/mid game, they will feel weaker to play while also having horrible late game. \r\n\r\nWhy can't all champs have a decent lategame too? Why does ADCs have to be the ticking time bomb and no one else? Why does a champ have to become useless at lategame even though they played early/midgame well? Why make some champs fall off signifcantly harder than others when their early/midgame isnt even strong(Ahri)?\r\n\r\nOkay, Ill stop it here. It was a long and depressing journey playing this game. This game will probably not even gonna last for any longer. If Ahri got a complete revert to her season 4 status, or even season 3 status, it would have been soooo great!!! Sad...","replies":[]}
