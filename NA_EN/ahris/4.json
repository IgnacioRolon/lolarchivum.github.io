Events and skins from the teams that win them have NO bearing on what other champions get skins. Also, she has more bc she is a part of the original champions. I agree with Quantitative as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZedUsanGovos","date":"2018-08-01T02:26:21.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hells bellsX,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kAN9jRw6,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2018-07-31T23:18:03.374+0000)\n>\n> just because its an event skin doesnt mean its not a skin. i dont buy that &quot;ItS SpEcIaL sO It doEsNT CoUNt&quot; bs she got a skin less than a year after championship and project a year before that riot know damn well they coulda waited till next year to give her another skin or something.\n\nIt really does matter though. \n\nBy getting an e-Sport Event skin, though they may have another skin to their collection, it doesn't change the lapse in time since the champion's previous skin. \n\nThink about Zed. \n\nZed got Shockblade as his release, and then SKT in 2013. \nNothing for 2014, and then PROJECT in 2015. \nThen he got CShip in 2016, and DSworn in 2017. \n\nThough he has three skins aside from PROJECT/Shockblade, two of those skins don't change his Skin Schedule, meaning Zed had technically gone three years until PROJECT. I'm not sure about normal events like the Harrowing or Snow Day/Winter Wonder/Santa skins. But in one case, where they DO count, Zed had gone another two years until DSworn, which is fine in his case (though we really do need a Legendary right about now, Rito). In the event they DON'T count, he's going another 3 years without one, especially considering how popular he is, as well as the possible thematic options, and how long he's been out-- being 6 years now (which is even more of a reason to giVE HIM A FUCKING LEGENDARY RIGHT ABOUT NOW, RITO). It doesn't help that the only skins available to buy for almost all year are his release skin and his first other skin.\n\nThis applies to Ashe, as well. Since it's Championship, like with Zed, she hasn't gotten an actual skin since her PROJECT skin, in 2016. Meaning it's been almost 2 years, which, for a champion who isn't on the level of Ezreal/Lux, but isn't forgotten like the Donger, is understandable.","replies":[{"poster":"Delta Shizu","date":"2018-08-01T02:32:11.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its just the E-Sports skins that dont count.
