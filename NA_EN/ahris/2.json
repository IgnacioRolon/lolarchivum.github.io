But come on in worlds no one really get ahead. There always those stall 1 hour games. Ahri chances are lower when it goes to late game. She shines more in the mid/late game. When everyone isn't as tanky and does not have MR or little  MR.  She always powerful when she has ultimate. She would not dare fight anyone without it unless fed or assitance from a teammate. I would love to see her at worlds like back in Season 3. But that is a nono at this point","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carrie Pigeon","date":"2017-08-31T03:56:52.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially what Linna Excel said. Ahri is a champion who fits a jack of all trades type of thing similar to well Irelia. She has decent poke, decent sustain, decent mobility, etc but nothing is absurd. Does this mean the champion is bad? Not at all just there are better picks for specific team comps that would much rather run someone other than well Ahri.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2017-08-31T03:40:21.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"U mean u won't get another ahri skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2017-08-31T03:34:32.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it's extremely unlikely.  She's not a great high elo champ atm and the pro meta has its own needs.  In order for Faker to get his Ahri skin, SKT would have to win worlds and he'd have to pick her in the finals.  I don't see him picking her when his team will need a better champ for whatever team comp they are running in each matchup.\n\nAhri's biggest weakness at that level is she just doesn't excel at any one thing well enough for a pro to justify picking her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-09-01T02:09:59.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hope not","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-08-31T03:48:43.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Need moar ahri skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2017-08-31T03:37:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"y not","replies":[]}]}
