Ahris w requires no skill and usually can only hit the enemy whenever you use your ultimate(because of its short range). Even then her w has been the most noob friendly tool that made her extremely easy to play. Instead of continuously nerfing every part of her kit, reworking w so that it will require much more skill would be great(while keeping her a fun champ to play)!","replies":[{"poster":"Rákãñ","date":"2017-06-09T09:14:50.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh? I wouldn't mind it being a shockwave on Ahri's Orb. Without casting Q, the wave would be around Ahri, cast Q, The wave would be the location's of Ahri's orb at the activation.\n\nThat if it really needed to be reworked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-06-09T07:29:50.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"First idea that comes to mind is to make it buff her next three autoattcks with magic damage but make them melee range or close to it.","replies":[]}]}
