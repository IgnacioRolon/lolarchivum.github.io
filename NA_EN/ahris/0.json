Before i buy a skin, I want to know if refund is possible if the champ just feels super not satisfying to play. I am not getting the money's worth if the champ I play ends up being a trash and gutted champ. I probably won't ever play it anymore. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T22:43:00.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there are three different options available to you if you want to take out a champion for a spin without committing to buying it outright:\n\n1. Wait for the Champion to become available on the Free-to-Play Rotation\n2. If you have unused refund tokens, this is an option to refund the champ if it doesn't work out\n3. \"Rent\" the champion through Hextech Crafting when you have the Champion Shard.\n\nI definitely get where you are coming from:  Nothing feels worse plopping down 6300 IP and not only be super underwhelmed by the champion, but simply not having fun with it when you could've spent it on another champion.

To explain my question better, I was asking if after buying a skin of a champ, then soon(Season 8 is going to start soon!) after the meta change and what not and the champ becomes completely no fun to play. In this case, would you still be given a refund? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2017-08-24T23:00:40.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhh, in that particular instance, no :(\n\nGenerally, the meta in League changes quite often.  Champions that are commonly believed to be useless, suddenly end up in Pro play, and all of sudden they are \"good\" again.  Not with any direct buff/nerf, just depending on the meta.\n\nSo while a champion may not be the best at that point of time, it may change later!  Or you can adapt with the times.\n\nFor example, when I first started playing in 2009, I mained AD Twisted Fate.  Since then, he has been reworked A LOT, and made to be an AP champion, but I still play AD TF and have a ton of fun, I also win at least half of my games as well.
