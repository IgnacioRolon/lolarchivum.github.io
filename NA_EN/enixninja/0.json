Try using the wired mouse without other background programs running (a [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684#wq3) can help with this) and let me know if you still see that odd lag.","replies":[{"poster":"EnixNinja","date":"2018-01-24T23:02:26.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no software associated with the mouse (it’s a redragon mammoth gaming mouse).
