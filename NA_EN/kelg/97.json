I have been playing him since I first started back in season 2. These changes completely change Mordekaiser&#039;s identity, and in my opinion, are destructive to him as a champion. Most people who play Mordekaiser want to play him in a solo lane. Sure, no one will object to the **option** of being able to use him at bot lane... It&#039;s a welcomed change even. This rework is taking away what people loved about him, most people who pick Morde just want to sit in a solo lane and do their thing. They don&#039;t want to have to rely on a support.  This is what made Mordekaiser, Mordekaiser. So what I suggest:\r\n\r\n* **Please, just allow Mordekaiser to use his W solo.** It&#039;s not asking much. I don&#039;t think any Mordekaiser player would disagree with this. If you don&#039;t allow him to use his W solo, you will be effectively forcing him into bot lane. He will not be viable in a solo lane at all. Please just let the Mordekaiser players play him as we always have. No, he will not be overpowered, or unhealthy for the game if you allow him to solo. Think about it, Mordekaiser has tons of counterplay in a solo lane... Any CC, Lifesteal/Regen, Shields/Barrier, easily ganked, long range, and taking advantage of his weak early game.\r\n\r\n* Restore his movement speed back to what it was. Anyone with a slow can escape him, especially ranged characters. His movement speed did not need touched. \r\n\r\n* This is a bit of a lesser point, but if you want him to really feel like a juggernaut, try some tenacity on him. This would be a way to make him feel more dangerous, while not giving him CC or mobility.","replies":[]}
