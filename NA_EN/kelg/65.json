Let&#039;s be real here, the idea that there should be a slow moving(lowest MS in the game counting passives and such), CC-less, mobility-less, zero tenacity, champion that is countered by both CC, and mobility when 99% of the champions have one or both of these things is seriously poor design. Right now he&#039;s just some kind of experimental mess that was supposed to go in bot lane but doesn&#039;t work there, and has been left in a shit state since his rework. He needs either a full revert or a partial revert to make him more of a solo queue champion. I know he&#039;s not a popular champion, but please don&#039;t make us wait for 1-3(+??) years for him to get a VGU.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2018-04-22T04:56:33.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think just increasing Mordekaiser's base stats would already be a great change.\n\nSeriously, his base stats are garbage, except his base AD, which is insane, but that doesn't really matter much, especially since Morde rarely buys Spellblade items.\n\nHe needs his movement speed to be back to 340 like before the rework, and his armor and HP to be increased to at least acceptable levels, so that laning against AD champions wouldn't feel like a chore.\n\nSeriously, Mordekaiser only has higher base HP than some enchanter supports, Ezreal, Zyra, Sion, and Gnar. Every other juggernaut has at least 2000 base HP, but Mordekaiser sits at 1856 base HP. Even Cho'Gath gets 1934 base HP at least, and he can increase his HP ad infinitum. His base armor is comparable to that of many mages and ADCs, and he sits at the lowest possible base movement speed for a champion, only being better than Janna and unmounted Kled (it is important to note that Janna has a passive that increases her movement speed, with her W giving her even more movement speed, so she is more than compensated for that). It is unacceptable that Mordekaiser sits at such low base movement speed tier when he doesn't have any form of mobility or CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vartius","date":"2018-04-21T22:36:31.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny you mention Azir, since Morde actually counters the bastard hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-21T23:37:04.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=5NwLG2y4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-21T22:36:31.653+0000)\n>\n> Funny you mention Azir, since Morde actually counters the bastard hard.\n\nDoes he?

Either that or he pushes lane, and Mordekaiser can't push back. Morde is also at risk of being dived, while Azir is not. Azir can attempt to kite Morde later in the game, especially if he has Rylai, and if Mordekaiser tries to get near him, Azir can ult and use his mobility to escape.\n\nPlus, Azir makes for a bad choice for a ghost with Mordekaiser's ult, since he can't summon soldiers, which are necessary to deal damage as Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Vartius","date":"2018-04-23T12:12:22.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He actually does counter Azir.\nAzir early deals damage in a very sustained, slow manner - Mordekaiser shield can almost always negate all the damage Azir can dish out. Mordekaiser can and will catch up to Azir pre-6 without using flash (Boots/celerity) - and once Morde is on him, Azir cannot fight him in any way. He may use his mobility... However, a Mordekaiser should go in just AFTER Azir used his Q and Azir won't be able to really escape him. Azir on low levels has a very high CD on his Q.\nMordekaiser power spike comes at level 3 - that's when Azir will be most vulnerable. In order to stand any chance Azir has to pick all three spells by level 3, so Q will still have a 15 sec CD. If Azir wants to poke Mordekaiser, he has to use his Q. If he does, Azir is either dead or will waste his flash.\nBy level 4 Azir will have 12.5 cd cooldown on Q, so Mordekaiser will still be able to go in while Q is cooling down. \nLevel 5 - 10 seconds.\nLevel 6 Azir gets ultimate - That's when Mordekaiser will be forced to use flash in order to kill Azir... When his ultimate is ready. Azir has a pretty standard cooldown on his ulti - 120 seconds.\nAt this point he still has 10 seconds on his Q.\nThe moment he uses his Q, Morde can go in, just as he did ealier and bait Azir's ulti - that or kill him.\nOnce Azir uses his ult Morde can allow him to disengage... And just go in after Azir uses his Q again.\nOr he can flash, if Azir used his own flash ealier.\nAfter that Azir will be gaining more power, mostly due to his cd going down and cdr going up.\nBut pre-6 Azir even with a lot of CDR will still be an easy prey for Mordekaiser.\n\nMordekaiser is countered by Azir only in a situation where Azir isn't behind and is fed. And that shouldn't happen if you lane against him.\n\nBack when Morde and Azir were a bit more popular, one could see it on sites like Lolalytics and champion.gg as well - Azir was always lane countered by Morde.\nCurrently not much data can be found - Azir slightly globally counters Mordekaiser - but that's mostly due to the fact that usually Mordekaiser lanes Top, so Azir won't be matched against him.\n\nEDIT: Azir is actually my favorite laner to fight against aside from Yasuo - in both cases I can be certain that if I am not camped by the jungler I will be  fine.\nAnd on Mid even Mordekaiser can escape ganks, so that's that.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-04-22T07:49:48.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I'm not even sure why Nunu is getting a VGU before Morde.
