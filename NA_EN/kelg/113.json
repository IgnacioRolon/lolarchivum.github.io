Aside Urgot, these champions don&#039;t even have higher bulk for their lack of mobility(especially Paperkaiser) literally have no way of dealing with it since they mostly use slows to catch their enemies when dashes ignore slows entirely. These champs were supposed to fight against tanks but tanks are basically extinct and all you face now are speedy bruisers {{champion:164}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:39}} that out dps you or assassins who just poke until they can all in burst you.\r\n\r\nYeah, I get it, no one wants to watch stuff like {{champion:75}} or {{champion:82}} in LCS games because they are boring to watch, but you don&#039;t have to make every champ dash around the screen 24/7, it might be fun to watch, but it&#039;s not fun to play against. Might as well retire and delete immobile champs at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"TrainerRobo","date":"2018-07-16T17:17:13.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I whole-heartedly agree. I'm an Urgot one trick, and playing him nowadays is somewhat more difficult. I used to be able to rely on frozen mallet to allow me to slow and stick to the speedsters, but now I cant even do that anymore after it was nerfed on ranged champions. Tanks dont build tanky anymore because they fall off hard late game, so they typically build ap (see Cho'Gath and Malphite). It's difficult to play any bruiser with low mobility anymore because of how speedy everyone is getting and how tanks went down the toilet. It's honestly sad.\n\nThat doesn't mean you cant do good as those champions, of course, but it's true that they're seriously falling out of favor due to fast bursty champions. Urgot at least has it lucky that he has some range to him, but since mallet was nerfed that also became his downfall. At least you can build him beefy enough to be able to pop squishes and deal mad damage to other beefsters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bluezy","date":"2018-07-16T17:30:32.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing fine with urgot at the moment in lower ranks. I Do have trouble sticking to the enemy and half the time need summoners to secure a kill during laning phase. They could buff him by increasing his movement speed to 340 or making his Q grant him movement speed since it barely even feels like an ability and doesn't help me stick. He's definitely not OP and has hard match ups. I like the fact that's he doesnt rely on items to much and can build versatile def items. Finding success with glacial augment and ms runes.","replies":[{"poster":"TrainerRobo","date":"2018-07-16T17:48:55.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glacial really isn't too bad on him, though I havent had much experience with it (maybe a game or two).\n\n I feel like what he needs is the nerf from frozen mallet being taken off for him. That would make him as good as he used to be, especially in the meta where everyone is fast.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Escheton","date":"2018-07-16T17:20:24.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play them bot and have a Zyra or Brand peel, cc and kill for you.","replies":[]}]}
