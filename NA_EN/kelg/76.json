It was overall .9 with an average winrate of 46% and they didn't buff him.  Fuck riot we don't need thier buff hand out BS all the Meta champions get.  \n\n#No Meta is ever Mordes Meta. \n\nSo they will hide behind the excuse that he's just not in a Favourable Meta.  \n\nAlmost anything they say about Mordekaiser is Bullshit anyway.   \n\nA  recent one. Which I have heard the same BS answer multiple times.\n  Morde player\" Can you remove the W passive since it doesn't do anything for Morde and use that to give him some Base stats\" \n\nMeddler \" if the experience passive doesn't do anything, then why would we compensate him if we  removed it. \" \n\n\nTo answer that: BECAUSE it's  has a calculated power budget  allotted to it as part of his Kit. Regardless of the fact you nerfed it to be Negligible in the early game.  \nIt still has  inherent  power attached to it and is easily sighted as removable by Most solo lane Morde mains In exchange for some  Base Movement speed.\n \nWhich would actually increase the Overall enjoyment of playing Morde: FROM Resigned to Inevitable Failure\n TOO Masochistic Depression\n\n\nThe definition of Masochistic I'm using\n(enjoying an activity that appears to be painful or tedious.)","replies":[{"poster":"KlydeFrog","date":"2018-05-07T15:54:04.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also his q is one of the highest damaging moves in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-05-07T16:14:26.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KlydeFrog,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=TfNdALHt,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-05-07T15:54:04.950+0000)\n>\n> Also his q is one of the highest damaging moves in the game\n\nIt's so unreliable.

It needs some ad ratio or something. The ally with his shield doesnt really mean anything. That tells me he us jungling and or bot . not solo lane.the fact his q does more damage then a nasus q is pretty decent but it doesnt interact with hydra for some reason. Also as i said i go ad and the only offesnse i build is triforce other then that tank.
