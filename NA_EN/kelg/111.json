If a champion isn't popular to begin with throwing a bunch of skins at them will not make them so. Also notice that the champs you highlighted have all been in the game for 7 years.\n\n{{champion:103}} 2011\n{{champion:1}} Launch Champ\n{{champion:99}} 2010\n{{champion:51}} 2011\n\nThey have had time to accrue skins while the typical scapegoats for Riot playing favorites {{champion:136}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:164}} have not\n\nAlso these champions all have very limited skill curves and are \"gateway\" champions to other more complex champs. That means they have broader audiences which means they get more skins. That's why they are popular in the same vein that an {{champion:22}} or {{champion:86}} is.
