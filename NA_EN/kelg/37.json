The bug causes his W(circle indicator) to become invisible for the rest of the game once it happens.\r\n\r\nAll you do is cast his W then use protobelt and reactivate his W during the dash and your W will be invisible for the rest of the game, even if you die or sell protobelt.\r\n\r\nThis bug is very annoying to play with and happens all the time because I find protobelt fun to build on Morde. \r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\n\r\nPlease fix it\r\n\r\nVideo of how to do the bug:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs15SCcQab8","replies":[{"poster":"FyreWall","date":"2018-07-28T20:58:14.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not new, this is probably the fifth time someone had reported this feature.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-29T04:07:31.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FyreWall,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rfl7YaU5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-07-28T20:58:14.596+0000)\n>\n> This is not new, this is probably the fifth time someone had reported this feature.\n\nWell they should fix it then.","replies":[{"poster":"FyreWall","date":"2018-07-29T17:31:02.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=rfl7YaU5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-07-29T04:07:31.222+0000)\n>\n> Well they should fix it then.\n\nMorde has spaghetti coding, if they try to fix one if his bugs out could literally destroy league of legends.

I think at this point it is not worth reporting Morde bugs. I mean the guy is not only bugging himself but now other champions and the game itselfs. They should just delete him and give as an anime girl champ with the name Morde instead. It just not worth it anymore to keep anything from this dude anymore. Better change the name too. It may turn out that it is bugged too.\n\nMemes aside, really don't bother. As far as i meme about a lot of things everybody is with me on this. At this point is like \"Oh morde has a new bug. Not really suprised but good to know\" ya know.
