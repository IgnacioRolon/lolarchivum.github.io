I do like his new one, but I've been a Morde main since I started league and it's gonna hurt seeing his old design just gone. This champ has a pretty big following for one that's kind of obscure, so there are people out there who would like this as well. It could be a 750 skin with no new voice or vfx even(or you could use Adam Harrington's voice even). Sort of like captain Gangplank, but without the new lines. \n\nTo be honest, half the work is already done, if you use Pentakill Morde's model as the base.\n\nYeah, I know Swain, Galio, and other champs didn't get one, but still.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/EO5kRTB","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-06-05T02:37:23.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His design didn't change heavily though. He's still a large armored warlord. It's like saying when Nasus had his VU that he should have had a traditional skin just because small details on his outfit weren't identical to the original. Like \"OMG that smol dot is two pixels over!!!! I need a new skin that shows it back in the previous position\"\n\nSomething like Sion on the other hand that was this weird looking green skull covered zombie vs his reanimated armoured jaw monstorus appearance is something very different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-06-04T21:39:59.826+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Aside from the fact that they have stated that they won't do traditional skins anymore (and seriously, it's been like 5 years since the last one, it's not happening again)...\n\nEww, no.

Plenty of people who play him before the rework like his design, even if it is \"cringey\".","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2019-06-05T16:26:07.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't necessarily have any inflated like or dislike of Yasuo or Ahri, but their designs are more in line with modern design standards. Mordekaiser was not, his entire appearance looked painfully 80s-90s, and doesn't really have any place in the game as it stands now, since there aren't really any cringey or egregiously tacky champions that look like they were designed 2 decades ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-06-05T01:14:02.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna have to go with no on this one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divin1ty","date":"2019-06-04T22:13:00.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  It could be a 750 skin with no new voice or vfx even(or you could use Adam Harrington's voice even).
