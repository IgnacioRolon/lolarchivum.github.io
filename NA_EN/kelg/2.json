It's fine to express disdain but when you think you know what a champ needs and you don't even know what counterplay there is to the champ and its mechanics, then that's just silly.\ntl;dr The 99% of the playerbase states opinions of champions and how strong they are as facts and think their facts are solutions to gameplay issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Sebastit7d","date":"2018-11-29T18:42:40.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See, that's the mentality that makes such arguments hard to agree with, people have gotten used to thinking that the enjoyability of the game depends entirely on your skill level, not with the gameplay itself, and when there are champions in the game created by CertainlyT which are known to be pain in the asses to deal with unless you're on the top 5% of the playerbase then there's an obvious problem with the champion's gameplay. The fact that you believe that if you don't spend 5 hours a day playing this game to get better pretending to be a pro you can't have fun actually baffles me.\n\nYou don't have to be a god at the game to be able to tell something is annoying to play against or be unsatisfied about aspects of the game. Sure, the opposite can also be said about people that have a couple of months of experience, those clearly don't know the basics of the game and they would be the only kind of people i would agree they have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nPeople need to realize that this is a GAME and a lot of people don't even care about ranked at all or not enough to spend hours a day grinding something meaningless to your average joe such as divisions. This is NOT some sort of elite society in which your opinion only matters if you're high elo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-11-20T01:32:28.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"why are you being downvoted lol","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T01:37:10.233+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=THE RlVER KlNG,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=t2V4ZyXo,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2018-11-20T01:32:28.734+0000)\n>\n> why are you being downvoted lol\n\nWho knows.
