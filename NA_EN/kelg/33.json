It's got a modal system that slightly adjusts what you're hearing as you cycle through the draft, so you hear a different piece during champ declaration, a different piece during bans, and then a different piece during the picks. It's not as easy as just slapping the old theme into ranked and calling it a day. \n\nThat being said, I 100% agree that Riot should bring the old theme back in one way or another. Might require more technical work, but it was a fantastic piece of music.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2017-10-02T18:29:01.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes, the classic theme of League of Legends.
