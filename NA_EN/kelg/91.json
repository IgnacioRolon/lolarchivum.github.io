You could add some damage on it, and that could make it a little more attractive, but it would just add to the damage creep in the game. Anyone have ideas for buffing this keystone without going too ham?","replies":[{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-06-24T10:49:01.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can see two options:\nOption 1: Remove the slow effect from the AA section and add it to abilities based on level scaling (10%-30%).\nOption 2: Make slowing effects increase damage done by abilities and effects.\n\nOption 1 would benefit AD and AP champions alike, Option 2 would be far more useful to those that inherently build things like Rylais, ireborn, frozen mallet, or had inherent slows in their kit.\n\nThe current active item slow is underwhelming enough that it could be removed or kept in (it wouldn't really matter either way).","replies":[]},{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2018-06-22T21:07:11.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some OPTIONS:\n1. lower the cd on it's application - can be applied more often\n2. add minor armor/mr pen (adaptive) to it upon slowing an enemy (like 5/10/15% or less ranking up with ult levels).\n3. enemies affected by cc (the slow of glacial augment or some other cc ability by a champ using glacial augment) take 10-25 true damage dependent on level.
