{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-12T09:30:45.144+0000","title":"Mordekaiser rework discussion/ideas","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"{{champion:82}} \nMordekaiser is a pretty flawed champion by design... He's a melee ap caster with no way to reach his target, and no way of sticking to them. He's a champion from the \"old LoL\" where mobility wasn't rampant, and on every champ. He worked back then, but has been nerfed many times(both directly and indirectly), and in this new LoL, he just can't compete. Any CC or escape is enough to invalidate him almost completely, and if he can't kill his target(with his ult) he will probably be killed pretty quickly without much of an impact in a team fight.  I came up with this rework idea a bit ago in an attempt to make Mordekaiser more viable and more interesting to play. I always saw Mordekaiser as some kind of AP melee carry, with a pretty weak early game, but an awesome late game. So in this rework, I lowered his overall burst, but gave him a little more sustained damage and utility to help him keep up with current champs. The numbers might need some tweaking, but this is just an idea.\n\n**Iron Man**\n\nMordekaiser converts 25% of the magic damage he deals into a temporary absorption shield (half as effective against minions and monsters).\nMaximum shield strength is 90 + (18 Ã— Mordekaiser's level)+(120% armor and magic resist). The shield decays by 2% per second.\n\nNotes: Shield generation is down to 25% from 35%. Since his shield was always considered a toxic mechanic in lane, this makes it harder for Mordekaiser to be \"unkillable\". Also, Max shield is down per level, but can be increased by building Armor/MR. Shield can also now be generated from other sources of magic damage, such as Gunblade, instead of just his actives. His shield generation will be somewhat better end game because of this. Also, I reduced his shield decay by 1% so he can build it a little before a fight.\n\n\n**Mace of Spades**\n\nRANGE: 380(Reactivated RANGE: 575)\nCOST: 5% of current health(Second Cast COST: 10% of current health)\nCOOLDOWN: 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4(Second Cast COOLDOWN: 20/17/15/12/10)\n\nActive: Mordekaiser enhances his next attack, converting it to deal magic damage and replacing the base attack damage component with a base amount of damage. He swings his mace with such force that it echoes out, striking all nearby targets. While Mace of Spades is active, it can be activated again, and after 0.5 seconds, Mordekaiser will jump to the target location, smashing his mace down and dealing magic damage within a small area and rooting all enemies hit for 0.5 seconds. Enemies below 40% health will be stunned for 1.25 seconds instead. Mace of Spade's cooldown is increased by 150% and Health cost is increased by 100% when used this way. If Mordekaiser is disabled while casting Mace of Spades, it will go on cooldown and the skill will be interrupted.\n\nMagic Damage: 85 / 120 / 165 / 200 / 240 (+50% AP) (+ 100% bonus AD)\nReactivated Magic Damage: 100 / 140 / 190 / 240 / 280 (+65% AP) (+ 150% bonus AD)\n\nNotes: The option to reactivate Mace of spades gives Mordekaiser a way to reach his target(shorter range than the basic Kha'Zix jump, and also has a 0.5s delay), as well as some CC to weakened targets at the cost of increased cooldown and health. Also Mace of Spade's AoE is reduced, but can hit any number of targets within range now.\n\n**Creeping Death**\nCOST: 8% of current health\nCOOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12\n\nActive: Mordekaiser creates a protective cloud of metal shards to surround himself for 6 seconds, increasing the his armor and magic resistance and dealing magic damage each second to enemies within 300-range. Each time an enemy champion takes damage from Creeping Death, they gain 1 stack(Max: 5). Enemies afflicted by Creeping death are slowed by 6% per stack for 1 second, up to 30%, and Mordekaiser deals 3-15% increased damage to the target, increasing with each stack. At 5 stacks, the target is inflicted with Grievous Wounds for 4 seconds and Creeping Death's cooldown is reduced by 3 seconds. This effect cannot take place on the same target twice within 6 seconds. \n\nMagic Damage Per Second: 15 / 22 /40 /48 / 65 (+ 15% AP)\nSlow Duration: 1 seconds\nArmor & Magic Resist: 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25\n\nNotes: I took away the ability to cast Creeping Death on allied units(and also reduced the armor/mr bonus) and some of it's power in exchange for some more selfish utility. If Mordekaiser stays near a target for 5 seconds with Creeping death active he will be rewarded with increased damage, and a cooldown reduction of 3 seconds. Also I added Grievous Wounds to him to make him sort of a counter to champions that rely on healing to fight.\n\n**Siphon of Destruction**\nRANGE: 700\nCOST: 6% of current health\nCOOLDOWN: 9/8/7/6/5\n\nPassive: Mordekaiser's basic attacks deal (+25% AP) bonus magic damage on-hit and restore health equal to half of the bonus damage. \n\nActive: Mordekaiser afflicts all enemies in a cone in front of him, dealing magic damage. Healing from Spell Vamp is increased by 50% on Siphon of Destruction when dealing damage to enemy champions.\n\nMagic Damage: 60 / 75 / 120 / 160 / 215 (+ 50% AP)(+ 75% bonus AD)\n\nNotes: The Passive on Siphon of Destruction and the increased spell vamp were added to make up for the health costs on spells, as well as to give him some sustained damage(He attacks with a giant mace... So it should do some damage). On the active, the up front damage was lowered and the cooldown was increased to take away some of his ability to bully in lane.\n\n**Children of the Grave**\nRANGE: 725\nCOOLDOWN: 115 / 100 / 85\nActive: Mordekaiser deals magic damage to a target enemy champion and curses it for 10 seconds, dealing additional magic damage over time and healing himself for the damage done. If the target dies while under the effect of the curse, their soul is enslaved as a controllable ghost and will follow Mordekaiser for 30 seconds. The Ghost cannot use any active skills or items and deals magic damage with its basic attacks. Ghosts have an attack speed equal to 200% of Mordekaiser's attack speed and deal magic damage equal to 35% of Mordekaiser's AP on hit. Mordekaiser permanently gains 3% of the target's total AP and AD when the ghost is finished.\n\nInitial Magic Damage: 12 / 14.5 / 17% (+ 2% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health\nMagic Damage Per Second: 1.2 / 1.45 / 1.7% (+ 0.2% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health\nTotal Magic Damage: 24 / 29 / 34% (+ 4% per 100 AP) of target's maximum health\n\nNotes: Lowered some of the range on his ult. I also changed the ghost to be more reliable, but at the same time, less \"OP\". Currently, it's mostly useless unless you get the ADC(or a high AD champ), so it's a feast or famine kind of ability. With this version, you could get the ghost of a support and still deal decent damage. Mordekaiser also will gain stats based on the target, so you will still want to try to kill the adc or apc with this.\n\n\nPlease share your opinions and oppositions on this idea, and any suggestions/changes would be welcomed as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-12T09:36:02.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why do people downvote and not comment?
