They want to modernize a champion and make it almost what the original strived to be. By giving a traditional skin its kinda pointless, for example, when you go from old to new warwick. But, with champion updates like traditional trundle, its an entirely new aesthetic that also serves as some sort of alternate reality trundle. \n\nA traditional type mordekaiser skin would be great because like you said would work something like Captain Gangplank where it shows an actual evolution of the character.  \n\n(PS what I said about the VGU thing doesn't apply to Galio, they basically made an entirely new champion -.- )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-06-23T18:55:39.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was more or less that they didn't actually sell very well at the time, so they stopped producing them so they could save resources.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-23T19:01:18.572+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rM6TE1Ts,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2019-06-23T18:55:39.565+0000)\n>\n> It was more or less that they didn't actually sell very well at the time, so they stopped producing them so they could save resources.\n\nOr maybe it was because they were giving them out for free.

To be honest, I think it's kind of disrespectful to the champ's history, and old playerbase to just change their appearance completely and not make a traditional skin, but that's just me. \n\nI still believe{{champion:20}}  {{champion:28}}  {{champion:50}} and {{champion:3}} should get traditional skins, though for Galio and Eve a chroma matching the old colors would do tbh. \n\nChamps like {{champion:19}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:84}} are nearly identical, or in {{champion:83}}/{{champion:6}}'s case they are straight upgrades  in appearance and color scheme so I don't really think they need one.","replies":[{"poster":"mrmeddyman","date":"2019-06-27T21:58:19.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=rM6TE1Ts,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2019-06-24T08:06:57.364+0000)\n>\n> I think it was because they didn't bring in any money, since they were giving the skins out to players that owned the champs previously.\n\n100% not true. Riot believed that it detracted from the effort on updating all a champions other skins in a VGU. And would force them to dedicate extra resources to the champion and likely delay their update as they had to make essentially an entirely new skin.\n\nAnd like you said a lot of the champs they updated didn't need them. Either because the VGU looked very similar but updated so it already was \"traditional\" or because the champion was so butt ugly before it was deemed a waste of energy to preserve anything of them, like Urgot or Yorick (and imo Morde tbh).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Swaid","date":"2019-06-24T01:38:02.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot should do traditional skins again, those designs shouldn't forgotten and merely a footnote on a wiki page for some new player to go \"Oh, that's neat\" and then move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Kombinator","date":"2019-06-24T16:15:35.380+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's something Riot can turn into profit.
