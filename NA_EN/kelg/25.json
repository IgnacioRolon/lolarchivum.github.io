That caused Galio being viable only when his Flash (0 mobility) and his ult was up (same case as Annie).\n\nThis is why Galio's ult was toxic.

I agree that Poppy's was toxic which is why I didn't mention anything about it. Galio's ult was my favorite ability in the game though. Galio \"being weak\" had nothing to do with his low play rate because he wasn't weak. His entire kit was strong if you had a brain and didn't spam yourself out of mana. Every champion ever with high mana costs has had low play rate and I have played and enjoyed all of them. I love the reward of powerful abilities when you can manage mana. Galio, Yorick, Poppy, Urgot, Taric, and Sion were all extremely mana hungry before their reworks. The only one who kept that aspect was Taric and to no surprise, he is the only one I still play.","replies":[{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2018-07-25T21:16:18.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlienPrimate,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FQYa7HZA,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-25T16:26:08.492+0000)\n>\n\nI believe Riot changed it not so much because it was toxic to deal with like Poppy or Fiora, but cause it was inherently bad design as an Ultimate. It forced you to stand still and take damage, and for those not experienced enough if they placed it wrong they could be less effective, it also didn't help that clicking at the wrong time would cancel it early. It widely split the good Galio players and the mediocre to the point where it made him difficult to maintain balance and placate both ends of the spectrum","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2018-07-25T22:42:23.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your argument is kind of dumb.

It is really powerful if used correctly but there is plenty of counterplay to it (don't group up, save cc abilities, pick Braum or Udyr, etc.)  On the pick Braum or Udyr part, there was also a level of mastery on Galio's end.
