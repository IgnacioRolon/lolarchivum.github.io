The point is to be able to balance the stats (and the suggestion) with the price. \n\nif it's 3100g 3200g or even up to  3500g that is pretty fair for the stats. Get out of the mindset that something has to be lost to be gained. The factor is time and money and it doesn't have to be stats. This is why most ppl don't actually understand the concept of balance because they automatically assume that to be given something else they must lose something they already have..This is wrong","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-10-26T02:07:43.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"tri force dotn have everything any more it use to. when it had ap, crit and as and ad with the phage and sheen passives","replies":[{"poster":"CurS1VE","date":"2019-10-26T02:11:34.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"neither would rylais, he is asking for 1 addition to something that has TWO stats (and a slow)\n\nWhere's your logic? Triforce has more stats, more everything and IT EXISTS in the game! To make the statement that Rylais would have everything is ridiculous. \n\nWhat matters isn't the stats but the Price! It can still have the HP/AP and slow as well as the CDR, for it to have it, it doesn't have to lose anything the only thing that would need to increase is the Price! \n\nif it's 3700g would you be saying the same thing? No absolutely not and if you did you would be trolling\n\nshut up hyperbole boy and learn how to think outside the box\n\nBTW, GLP has stats that are pretty similar to this already (hence why i suggest a shared unique) and that is a item that is like 2800g! It has similar AP has a lot of Mana, it does DMG and has a active that is pretty power! The reason why i suggested what i did was because this would be a sister to it but at the same time HP is still a stat that boosts your survival so obv if rylais had something that was always on and gave HP it could exist in theory but it needs to be more expensive than something like a GLP and how much is the question not the stat","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-10-26T02:26:43.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"shut up hyperbole boy\" wow way to start trying to insult cuz people dont agree with you. \n\nok lets give {{item:3116}} 500 hp 100 ap , 20 cdr and its passive and let it cost 3800 gold","replies":[{"poster":"CurS1VE","date":"2019-10-26T03:05:04.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"has nothing to do with agreeing with me, it's that you aren't constructive and are dismissive","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2019-10-25T23:41:21.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3067}} {{item:1026}} {{item:1052}}\n\nitd need to be more than a 250 cost increase though","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-10-25T23:38:13.893+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"yea that item is already over loaded \n\nit dont need cdr and none of its build path provides cdr","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-10-26T00:05:21.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFawknSunshine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=2OLKyK8t,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-10-25T23:38:13.893+0000)\n>\n> yea that item is already over loaded \n> \n> it dont need cdr and none of its build path provides cdr\n\nHow is it overloaded? barely any champs build it and its kinda garbage\n\nliterally nobody would build this item if {{item:3151}} didnt exist","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-10-26T00:07:13.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"cuz they had to lower the AP on it other wise it was build in every game by nearly any ap champ \n\nnow you ad cdr to it it is going to be the same as it was, built ever game. \n300 hp and 90 ap is very strong for an item that provides the passive it does","replies":[]},{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-10-26T02:51:13.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when it had 100 AP, 500 HP and a 40% slow for single target spells and a 30% slow for AOE spells.
