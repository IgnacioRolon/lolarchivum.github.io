We felt it was time to execute on a new support with a darker, deeper thematic than most of our support cast.\"\n\nThey're referring to a NEW support. Not a rework. And if they were to tease a Nautilus rework they would list it at the bottom of the roadmap like all other new VGU teasers. Example: The Nunu teaser in the last one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-04-19T18:26:56.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Nunu and that's fine.
