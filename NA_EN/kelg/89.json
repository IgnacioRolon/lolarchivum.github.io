You haven't seen me play. You see numbers. You don't see mechanics. Circumstances. Team strategies that require my sacrifice. Even if you had, it would still be difficult to say that every single player in your games was better unless you saw me play directly against every single player in the games you've played.\n\nClaims that can't be substantiated are conjecture. Conjecture has no teeth. It's misdirection at best, rhetoric at worst.\n\n> Any elo outside of iron 4 what you do would be considered trolling.\n\nYet I'm far outside of Iron IV and I win games with what I do. Sure I lose some games. Who doesn't lose some games? But my win rate over the past month has sat between 65 and 70%, which means I win around 7 games for every 3 I lose. If I _were_ to have a reason to go back to ranked, that rate would equate to climbing the ladder.\n\nYou don't buy my elo? Check my OP.GG if it means that much to you. Every single game has at least one silver player. Most have at least one gold player. Several have a platinum player or two, and one last night had a diamond player. I queue solo, so it can't be my duo buddy boosting me. Must be that I belong here. You're playing ranked, I'm fooling around in normals. You can't expect to compare the two purely on some KDA numbers.\n\n> And what is that nonsense about hidden health bars?\n\nI play without health bars visible. I've been doing it for like three months now. Some guy threw it out there, chat got spammed, now it's a must or I don't get paid. I've adapted.
