Maybe, but that doesn't make him OP. \n\nThis champ has a low skillcap so it's not like people are still learning to play him, and his WR will only continue to drop when people learn to gauge his damage properly while vsing him.\n\nNow compare him with a champ who is actually OP {{champion:92}}, more mobile, more burst, less counterplay, and 53% wr in high elo. \n\nIf Morde was nerfed again, you might as well delete the champ, because he already hard loses into meta duelist toplaners like {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:92}} .\n\nMorde has plenty of counterplay options, people just need to use their brain.","replies":[{"poster":"Xavanic","date":"2019-06-20T01:27:16.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the hotfix was un-necessary and was a nerf to an already weak champ, his winrate spiked because he is an easy champ to pick up and lots of ppl played him while being a little harder to lane against like literally every other juggernaut, now that people are learning his winrate is dropping and he will more then likely drop below 50%","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-06-20T02:43:22.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xavanic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zgKWRvXs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-06-20T01:27:16.800+0000)\n>\n> the hotfix was un-necessary and was a nerf to an already weak champ, his winrate spiked because he is an easy champ to pick up and lots of ppl played him while being a little harder to lane against like literally every other juggernaut, now that people are learning his winrate is dropping and he will more then likely drop below 50%\n\nI don't think the hotfix was completely unnecessary, but I think the nerfs on his passive in the late were too much.
