Because of how his q works you can evade it. The same applies to his e. Avoiding his spells means less passive uptime, thus less damage. Unless he has atk speed he wont stack his passive that fast (provided you arent afk).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-10-15T22:12:43.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3140}}  for both.

Maybe Yorick could get better control over his Maiden of the Mist.  Maybe he could also bind the Maiden's fate to an ally, tethering the maiden to the ally, and if the ally takes lethal damage then the Maiden is consumed to grant a temporary revive, like his ultimate used to do (maybe slightly different in function to make it less glitch-prone).  During the temporary revive, it could make the ally appear gray-opaque as a ghost, so that would bring back champion ghosts to the game but in a somewhat different form than previously existed.  Obviously, Yorick would need to pay for this utility in his power budget somehow, so the Maiden could have its stats reduced and binding it to an ally could cause it to fade away automatically after a brief time limit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xelaker","date":"2019-10-16T05:19:45.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make it a skillshot so morde can't just waltz up and pick a 1v1","replies":[]}]}
