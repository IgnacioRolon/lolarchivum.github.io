His health costs are absurd... His E cost 72 health at rank 5. His QWE together cost 175 HP. That's 175 true damage dealt to yourself with each rotation of your spells.\n* Give his Q or W a movement speed boost similar to Garen's Q. 35-40% movement speed for 3 seconds or so?\n* Make his W castable on enemy units, and lower MR/Armor\n* Give him a movement speed boost when moving towards a target with Children of the Grave on them\n* Movement speed boost when moving towards low HP targets?(reverse Soraka passive? but a lower amount).\n* Make his Ult inflict Grievous Wounds.. Morde has the most useless ult at level 6, its damage is completely countered by a health pot...\n* Give his W a tenacity bonus, or add tenacity to his passive(more tenacity based on how full the meter is?)\n* Increase his base movement speed to around 360\n* Make Spell Vamp more effective on Mordekaiser\n* Make his Q interrupt channels\n* Increase his Model/Hitbox size(with VU) \n* Iincrease his AA range with his Q, or just in general\n* Make his Q deal increased damage to towers (to boost his pusher theme)\n* Reduce the rate of decay on his passive","replies":[{"poster":"Kowe The Ewok","date":"2014-10-14T12:19:03.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some nice ideas.\nPersonally I think Morde doesn't need much. His concept allow him to survive and punish a lot of popular assasins. I've successfully played him against Zed and Talon.\n\nI however agree that his healthcosts feel unjustified. Especially if we consider that these values are leftovers from a time where Gunblade, WotA, Revolver and Haunting were incredibly overpowered.\n\nHe paid the price for having a good synerg with them, even more than Cassio or Vlad.","replies":[{"poster":"Yokel85","date":"2014-10-14T17:00:05.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, they're there to be a cost for using abilities.

It decays so badly now that it can't really protect him anymore except in the case of clutch shielding yourself.  I mean its fair that its this way, but if you need to be clutch with it, i'd prefer having an actual shield.  Anyways, while increasing his ms would be nice, I feel it might be in the wrong direction.  What I felt was his \"main\" kit was that he was basically a \"rock\" or a \"wall\".  If he had his shield on him, you can't go up to him and mess with him because he will win and make you his servant for the duration of his ult.  Increasing his ms makes it so he can chase down people and execute them and I just feel that takes away from him.  Of course if him being a \"rock\" or \"wall\" isn't what he should be, then I'm fine with him getting to move faster.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-14T20:45:44.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't honestly think he needs more power on his passive, it's already one of the best passives in the game.

It would also be nice to have him basically be the ultimate \"you can't move me out of lane\" character. I like that he has no CC or Mobility or MS boosts or any form of disruption and I think he should remain that way. He just crushes all of his foes under his foot by spamming his mighty abilities like he don't give a fuck.\n\nAnyway, here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Increase Melee Range to 175 from 125 and have his Q extend his Autorange by 125\n2. His Armor and MR bonus from W is doubled on himself and make the amount he gives to allies a passive bonus \n3. Remove the damage and healing from R completely. Make it instead Amplify all damage Morde does to that target by like 20/30/40% \n4. Have his E heal him by 11/12/13/14/15(+10% AP) per enemy hit with it but increase the Health cost by 10% AP as well\n5. Change his Q's Bonus AD ratio into Total AD so it functions like every other Autoattack reset in the game but separate the Mace hit from the AoE. Basically your main autoattack when you use your Q would deal Total AD + AP as Magic Damage (notice no base damage for this) and then it would cause separate magic damage + AP to bounce to nearby enemies. If they are alone the damage of his Main Q obviously still increases by 65%. \n6. Have his Health costs be subtracted from the Shield before his Health Bar\n7. Gain 5% crowd control reduction per 10% of the bar (so 50% at max bar)","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-14T20:44:20.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of giving him tenacity.

I would not go too much far with that.\n-As i said, movement speed boosts does not fit him well.\n-Probably hidden OP, but i like the part where he loses armor/mr for something else. Really, too many ballsy stats there.\n-Again, i dislike movement speed on Morde.\n-As ^, but less justificable.\n-This is intresting, but what if instead of griveous wounds he sucks away part of the healing? Counterplay needs to be done and if an enemy support wants to save his ally then he must be able to do so, but with a price ( besides spell consumption). However GW too is in his simplicity a good idea, even if GW are going probably yo be removed soon.\n-I proposed something like that! Link at the bottom, i love the idea of tenacity on him! Or even just speed reduction resistance, if it is too much OP. He does not need to be very movable, but at least hardly stoppable!\n-Meh. He is not made to be mobile, and won' t change much.\n-Morde does not really need a spell vamp boost, really. His Q in duels can be devastating, his W and E can get up chunks of life and shield, his Ulti has an increadible sinergy on his own. I mean, won' t be bad, but i rather give him power in other zones.\n-Neh. Not really like he needs that in the end, he is a team pressure champion non anti-mage or what else.\n\nI went super-simplicistic here in order to give my view of your proposal, if you want check my old thread\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/rk6wZEwf-gameplay-discussion-mordekaiser","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2014-10-14T13:28:27.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that most of that is pretty good idea wise (he has to have some form of innate sustain so he isn't always forced to rush WotA/Gunblade, and a shield doesn't count)\nRiot needs to:\n1. Make some form of innate sustain for him.\n2. Make his shield deplete at 2% per second instead of 3% (Small change), OR make it only deplete when out of combat (5 seconds of not taking or dealing damage, it seems like it would be more consistent for a shield based on damage you deal).\n3. Give him a speed boost on EITHER his Q OR his W, not both, (Q upon activation, or W for as long as the shield is on).\n4. Make his E slow, even if it is a tiny amount.\n5. Make his ult either scale better with AP, or give it Grievous wounds like you suggested, so it is more consistent at killing low health targets. Maybe instead give it execute style damage, so the the damage scales up higher the more damage they have taken?\n6. Give him a VU, nothing huge, sort of like the Singed changes, just enough to modernize his look and textures.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IAmNeverViable","date":"2014-10-14T16:35:44.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk but moredekaiser has identity crisis in my opinion.
