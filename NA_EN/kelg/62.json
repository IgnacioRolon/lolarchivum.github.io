So unless they are building tank it would be bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Saezio","date":"2018-11-20T16:26:40.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LJO3NiqU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T16:15:52.620+0000)\n>\n> not really because most are ranged and it would be reduced to 40%.

Fleet requires you to get in auto range and does not grant you permanent HP and the empowered auto does not deal extra damage. A spell grasp would proc on Ziggs Q xerath Q velkoz all spells. you get my point I think. It wouldn't benefit melee tanks in the slightest since they are already melee and autoing. So who is it helping?","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-20T16:30:45.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saezio,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LJO3NiqU,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-20T16:26:40.005+0000)\n>\n> first off it is reduced BY 40% not to 40% so it is 60%.
