Add Torment to the mix, and Morde became a terror.\n\nThat said, his 'new' W was simply not that great a skill to even give the champion. It makes little sense for him, and they only did it because they made Spellvamp a mid game purchase and broke his ability to sustain.\n\nThe honest hope is that when he receives a VGU that they rework him. At this stage he lacks the early sustain he used to enjoy, and has been turned into a tank without CC - nor the sustain of tanks like Mundo.
