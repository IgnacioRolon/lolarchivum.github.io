But even still, a single 6.6 CD blink hardly qualifies as \"hyper-mobile\". You've got to have either a resetting dash or multiple dashes to qualify as \"hyper-mobile\" IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-11-09T22:26:52.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the CD comes after Shaco breaks  the invis. So when Shaco actually uses his Q to escape (without breaking stealth) CD goes from 6.6 secs after casting to +10.\n\nBut yes, there's no world in which Shaco is hypermobile, where Zed have super waveclear or Lee have decent waveclear","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2018-11-09T18:22:40.092+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"sounds like you need to learn to play against assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2018-11-09T17:56:10.227+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gotta sell skins somehow.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Beholder","date":"2018-11-09T17:58:17.668+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kelg,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jfYifBra,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-09T17:51:51.775+0000)\n>\n> Back in the golden days of league the counter to assassins was to shove them in, but now they all have\n> great wave clear and some have hard CC to go with it, and to top it all off, most of them have hypermobility to \n> make them ungankable in lane, so they can just shove you all they please.\n> It seems like it goes against the fundamentals of this game...\n> Why would you pick a tank or a bruiser if you could just delete someone and CC people when you need to?\n> \n> {{champion:121}}  evolved spikes are basically an aoe snare, Hyper mobile with jump resets\n\nOk ok, no, evolved spikes are nowhere near an aoe snare.
