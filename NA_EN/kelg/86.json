I know you can do something better riot. How long do we have to wait to get proper ap bruiser itemization? We were promised them in s10 preseason.\n{{champion:517}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-10-24T15:39:58.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all...

They need to be melee only so vlad, Swain, and most of the champs you listed don't abuse them and use them better than Champs like Rumble and Morde.\nThe whole reason I didn't give these items mana(as well as AP on the lower side) is so that champs like Fizz and Ekko wouldnt reallt want to rush or use them.","replies":[{"poster":"Titanium70","date":"2019-10-24T18:03:10.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok enlighten me:\nIn what world would {{champion:50}} a frontline battlemage \"abuse\" an Item in an unhealthy way that {{champion:82}} a frontline battlemage uses in a healthy way??? \nThose two are essentially the same freaking champion to a degree where also their base kits are almost identical!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
