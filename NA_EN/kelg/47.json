Some people might not want to see you play that champion in a ranked game, because you are probably gonna feed, and that's a wise ban.\n\n2) If there's a popular strong champion but you are last pick hovering it, and not even ask for someone to first pick it for you, then it's wise to ban it, otherwise the enemy will probably get it.\n\n3) Your win rate on that champion is horrible. If someone sees your op.gg and sees that your intended pick is on a 30% win rate, then it's wise to ban it, because then it means that the chances of winning that game are very low, because of that win rate. Again, very wise\n\n4) Being a dick.
