With all the mobility/CC pretty much every champion has these days, I guess his weakness is any other champion.\r\nI never thought I would see the day where an already trash tier champion is gutted to complete worthlessness.\r\nThere is a reason why people who actually play Mordekaiser never built him as a tank... He can be completely ignored because he has no way to disrupt the enemy team. These changes just force Mordekaiser to build as a tank, which his kit is horrible at. He is going to be even more of a one trick pony now that he basically has to get a ghost to be of any use to his team now. Good job riot, good job.\r\n\r\nRIP Mordekaiser 2015","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2015-02-14T23:18:00.921+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whoever is putting these changes through has no idea how bad Mordekaiser is right now.

You can kill two minions at once with the q rather than just one, so you basically can double stack. His e was rather annoying for a bit, but they toned that back. As for Morde, he needs a nurf asap.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EzraTwitch","date":"2015-02-14T22:54:56.255+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Even the Ghost sucks, because it no longer generates shield, so your super squishy while everything is on cooldown, even with ghost out.

I seem to see a monster that only needs one item to become unkillable and deal massive amounts of damage at the same time.
