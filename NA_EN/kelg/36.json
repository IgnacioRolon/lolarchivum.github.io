Whether it was his bizarre gameplay or his cool design, something always kept players coming back to the champ. He was also seen as some kind of exotic champ before his rework and people thought he was interesting because no one outside mains played him, and no one knew what he did. \n\nI've been playing since season 2 and bought Morde as my first champ because of how cool he looked, and have been playing him nonstop ever since. I am a huge fan of his old design and would love to see him come back as a skin, even if it's just a cheap one. It would be a nice love letter and throwback to the Morde community.\n\nI'm not asking for a legendary skin or anything, just a simple model swap, maybe with recolored red particles, and he would be perfect. \n\nI miss my boi\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MRrrDUN.png[]","replies":[{"poster":"Makarakarn","date":"2019-09-18T20:34:48.150+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"They stopped doing these a while again, and I doubt they're going to give morde special treatment.

Riot's all about money these days anyway, and Morde isnt a money generating champ.

I feel like you're letting your bias in a bit there, I assure you the game is most definitely the same with or without him, but I guess I could see how from your perspective it could seem that way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Whyte Lyon","date":"2019-09-18T21:52:19.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Commentary like this from League's \"mains\" community is the equivalent to unironic flat earth or anti-vacc culture.

Not sure why youre acting like these mains are some 60 year old man who doesnt understand todays technology, this person only asked for a classic Morde skin and Im sure they are aware that Riot doesn't do them anymore yet that doesn't mean that this person and other mains of the champion wouldn't want a skin that reflects the old champ they played.
