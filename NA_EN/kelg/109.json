There really needs to be more rune options.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ViciousSummoner","date":"2018-04-15T16:22:31.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phase Rush/Arcane Comet/Electrocute/Unsealed Spellbook these work decently on Rumble and Morde.\n\nJust about anything works on Singed.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-04-15T16:49:30.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ViciousSummoner,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T90Osu65,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-15T16:22:31.203+0000)\n>\n> Phase Rush/Arcane Comet/Electrocute/Unsealed Spellbook these work decently on Rumble and Morde.\n> \n> Just about anything works on Singed.\n\nI cant speak for rumble, but I see him(and Morde) take Aery a lot, which is supposed to be a support keystone.\n\nMorde does okay with phase rush(SRS was much better for him) and electrocute but they are a little iffy to proc sometimes because of the 3 hit condition and the fact that his auto and q don't count as different spells. It's hard to proc these runes on targets that he would want to run these against because he has a hard time getting in melee range of ranged squishies. Unsealed spellbook is also not good on Morde because he needs more damage or tankiness to win against other bruisers like Darius.","replies":[]}]}]}
