He gets outdamaged by tanks, he gets melted by adcs and burst mages even with his overvalued passive and he just feels awful to play with his 325 MS and 0 gapclosers/CC, when every other champion in the game has speed boosts, slows, displacements and dashes. \r\n\r\nThe original reason he was so slow was because he did a crapton of damage with his Q, but now it&#039;s not very impressive at all and actually quite underwhelming. For being a champion with next to 0 utility, no mobility, and brings only damage to the table, Morde still gets outdamaged by a fair amount of champions(he&#039;s #66 out of every champion). Look at {{champion:142}}  for example, out damaging Morde with 1 ability and putting herself in no danger at all, while Morde has to throw himself into a life or death situation to even try to compete. \r\n\r\nWhy would you ever pick current Morde? His ultimate isn&#039;t as good as people think and it&#039;s very situational. None of the keystones are that great on him... Phase rush is no SRS and aery is just a worse version of DFT. Glacial augment is pretty good for killing squishy champions but doesn&#039;t give you any damage to help kill tankier enemies, and Morde can&#039;t really utilize Grasp due to his slow movement speed and no ability to get in and out of fights.\r\n\r\nAs a Morde main, League is honestly becoming a chore to play because I feel like my champion can&#039;t even compete with anything anymore.\r\nHe honestly needs some help right now... Yes, I know people consider his kit toxic/anti-fun, but some simple buffs could work wonders to bring him to a healthy and playable state without breaking him, at least until his VGU comes around.\r\nAny of these ideas would help a ton on him:\r\n\r\n* Movement speed bumped back up to 340, this should have been reverted after his Q was nerfed. This isn&#039;t even a major change, but more of a QoL buff.\r\n\r\n* Higher base armor or scaling armor. There is absolutely 0 reason why adcs should have more base armor than the slowest champion in the game.\r\n\r\n* Slightly higher HP scaling. loss of HP/lv runes hurt him.\r\n\r\n* Slightly higher scaling attack damage. Morde used to have the highest base attack, making {{item:3078}} and {{item:3053}}  amazing to build on him\r\n\r\nIf {{champion:157}} , a champion who nobody thinks is weak, can be buffed, then I think {{champion:82}}  could get a little bit of love as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Tychusfindlay918","date":"2017-12-19T20:43:52.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his W should have the shred over time effect even if mordekaiser is the only one using it.\n\nAn MS buff to 335 would be nice\n\nadding a .15 total AD ratio to W health steal might be preferrable to loading mordekaiser with more damage. As it stands right now, if you go AD-oriented juggernaut mordekaiser, the heal feels really shitty as the game goes on compared to more AP oriented mordekaiser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CyberBalt","date":"2017-12-19T18:39:35.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with pretty much everything you said, but sadly your efforts seem futile. Riot is incredibly stingy when it comes to changing this champion.

And even with all those bugs, he can still be a very good champion in the new 5v5 game mode that allows an entire coordinated team to work around his calls. TheKingOfEloHell said it himself and he's right.
