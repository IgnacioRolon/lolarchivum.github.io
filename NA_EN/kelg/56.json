He has no bad matchups vs toplaners, and easily beats every toplaner by outstating them. With his double HP bar, tons of cc, and damage, he's way too strong of a duelist at all stages of the game and is overtuned as fk right now. He needs some heavy handed nerfs. I don't get a ban because this champion exists.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2019-06-08T17:13:12.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL look at how long {{champion:103}} and {{champion:238}} have been S tier in mid. Look at {{champion:8}} win and ban rates for these champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Call me Douglas","date":"2019-06-08T17:02:31.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If u don't know how to play versus him, just ban in every ban phase. He is not that hard to kill, ask jungle for camping top, swap if u dont cant laning. A lot of options to choose.\nWish u luck in next game vs him {{champion:223}}","replies":[]}]}
