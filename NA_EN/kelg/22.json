I think Kled already covers that \"Duo of humanoid and animal but the animal just makes sounds while the humanoid talks to it like it was actually talking\" thing kind of well, so it would be nice to see Willump kick simple reponses and jokes.

Sure, there's a touch of absurdity to them, but Draven is a narcissistic executioner, and Rakan is a rebellious militant in-it-to-win-it with his girlfriend. They don't even approach the level of silliness of someone like Kled, Lulu, Tristana, or Zoe.\nMundo, and by that note, Singed, are all relics from the early times of the game when they did make almost every character silly and whimsical. Singed, as we see, is not silly in the lore, but instead a sadistic chemist in Zaun who does experimentation on live people. I would imagine that with their VGUs (wherever that may be in the future), these two champions would be pulled out of their tropes and gaggingly bad dad-jokes and into the dark side of science where their lore is taking them.","replies":[{"poster":"Chase Me Daddy","date":"2018-04-19T23:31:00.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you may be right. At least Singed is a lot darker from a lore perspective, it's just that his Gameplay and VO don't portray that. Mundo would probably still be pretty silly though, atleast from a visual and VO perspective. I think it's a bit of what makes him what he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-04-19T23:47:15.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said, Singed is old as fuck, and his design and VO are from the ancient days of the game when camp was what the characters were all about. He desperately needs a VGU to modernize him and make him fit with his darker lore and story he's had for the past like 5 years (prior to his most recent, he was going to cook the heart of Soraka to make a potion for Warwick...).\nMundo, I agree, sorta, but he's a pretty blatant Hulk jab, and he needs to deviate some from that. Same thing as Singed, he needs to be modernized so we can take him at least a little seriously, even if he does have some goofy lines here and there. But he's not a goofy or lighthearted character at all, he's a roided up chemist who butchers people for fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-04-21T09:58:38.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mundo is not an experimenting chemist anymore, that's the old lore.\n\nHis new lore is that he was a curiosity found in the streets of Zaun (purple skinned child) taken in by scientists to experiment on. They found out that he has the ability to heal every wound they induce on him and so they made cruel experiments every day, trying new ways to hurt him. But they soon found out that he has a weird relationship to pain as well: he enjoys it, he is an extreme masochist.\n\nThese scientists were the only doctors Mundo knew and in his opinion, the wounds and pain they inflicted were pure joy. That's why he wanted to be a doctor himself (so called himself Dr. Mundo).\n\nSome day, he managed to escape from the cell and killed all the scientists to bring them \"joy\" and \"cure\" them, then he headed out to do the same to the people in Zaun.\n\nHe is basically an insane biological abnormity, thinking that he is doing something good by shoving cleavers into stomachs of innocent people, since he tragically misunderstood the concept of a doctor.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
