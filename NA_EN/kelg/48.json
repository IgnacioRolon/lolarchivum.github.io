The jungle can win every single lane by sitting and camping with 0 consequences. You don&#039;t get enough wards to cover all the places they can gank from, so you aren&#039;t allowed to even play the game if they sit near your lane, while the enemy is able to go full aggressive because they have the jungle with them. \n\nJunglers can even can outlevel and out CS laners and some, like Lee sin, can straight up kill you in 1 rotation. If your champ doesn&#039;t have a million escapes built into their kit they just instantly die to any gank because immobile champs aren&#039;t given any tools/stats to survive ganks for whatever big brain reason. Riot also made this problem worse by killing jungle diversity and pushing farming and tank(and tanks in general) jungles out of the meta for good. This honestly is one of the biggest reasons this game is so frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Hügö","date":"2019-01-11T21:28:01.370+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Another complaining post about jungle.\n\n> If you get a bad jungle, and the enemy gets a good jungle the game is over\n\nSame goes for every other role.\n\n> The jungle can win every single lane by sitting and camping with 0 consequences.\n\nI wonder how many junglers you have in 1 game where they can camp every lane\n\n> Junglers can even can outlevel and out CS laners\n\nNice try mate. The jungle is constantly 2 levels behind of solo laners when he goes even. When he even falls behind it will be around 4 levels. The only time the jungler is a higher level is at level 2 or he is real realy fed af but thats your fault and not his.\n\n> like Lee sin, can straight up kill you in 1 rotation.\n\nCan laners too....\n\nYour post is the definiton of 0 knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-01-12T04:54:50.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hügö,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cwE4ZQ65,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-01-11T21:28:01.370+0000)\n> Your post is the definiton of 0 knowledge.\n\nYou're right im just a 0 knowlege diamond player what do i know?\n\n{{sticker:sg-lulu}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kovorix","date":"2019-01-12T12:22:32.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then I tell you as another diamond player that you 0 knowledge.
