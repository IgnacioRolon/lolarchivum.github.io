I mean he's good but his plays are so overrated. I see people ejaculating whenever they see his play. \"Faker Yasuo Montage\" is just him missing 200.000 Qs and then hitting one tornado and ulting 2 people and killing them, that's what they call outplay. Also, i've seen a reddit post where he literally flash ulted as Neeko into 4 people and stunned then, redditors praised him like he was a god lmao. Even a silver player that plays Neeko for the second time could've done that. Ugly nolifers are licking even uglier nolifer's ass, as usual.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2019-08-10T22:08:55.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Blame the players, not the champions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"14daysuspensionk","date":"2019-08-10T22:31:18.427+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this today.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xZTnGju","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-08-12T22:57:13.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=14daysuspensionk,realm=EUNE,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=ApnEZUk9,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-08-10T22:31:18.427+0000)\n>\n> I saw this today.\n> \n> https://imgur.com/a/xZTnGju\n\ngigayikes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-08-10T21:42:38.685+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"No the worst is when someone bans a champ and then says \"Someone ban X\" like??? you had a ban, use it bruh!","replies":[{"poster":"Thuban","date":"2019-08-11T00:27:09.291+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"And you have a problem with this how?

Janna, lulu, soraka, nami etc. beat pyke as long as you play safe.\n\nNeeko again doesnt like defensive enchanters, primarily janna (lets be real, most \"op\" engage champs are hard countered by janna. Also makes me sad i cant play janna for shit)\n\nMorg can only shield 1 person. Her Q is a pain, yes, but morg is picked for her E. Blitz likely fucks her up now with his shieldbreak ult given he can just W walk up to her and she lacks mobility if you can bait Q, but other than that offensive supports without reliance on CC beat her pretty well.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cubical","date":"2019-08-11T06:09:20.563+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only get mad if they complain in game","replies":[]},{"poster":"5or6stores","date":"2019-08-10T22:16:29.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then enemy team picks Yasuo/Pyke","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrCakeThe1st","date":"2019-08-10T21:38:35.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"EXACTLY WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY PUT THAT?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bugog","date":"2019-08-10T22:31:16.560+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't normally ban anyone when I play normals.
