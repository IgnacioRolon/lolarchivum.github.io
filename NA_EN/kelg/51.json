Modekaiser changes, and why they won't work.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, first of all, it's nice that Mordekaiser is finally being looked at.\r\nBut these changes will not make him a viable, or even an attractive pick. \r\n\r\nFor starters, why pick Mordekaiser over any other tank?\r\nPeople will not look at him and say \"Oh my.. that passive! Always shield, never die!\" Nope. Even if his shield made him nearly invincible he still wouldn't be picked competitively. The reason? He is more or less completely outclassed by a good majority(if not all of the other) tanks and bruisers. Okay, we got it, you want his weakness to be getting kited(I'm sorry, but this is a piss poor excuse for a weakness in league of mobility). But the fact of the matter is he won't ever be a good pick if pretty much every viable champion in the game can kite him with ease. Mordekaiser has no way of sticking to his target. Sure you can get the crystal scepter, but it's effectiveness is minimal on Mordekaiser, seeing as most of his attacks are AoE or DoT. There's just no winning with this champion. Mordekaiser is so devoid of utility, and he gets nothing spectacular in return for it. Yes, his ghost is good. But in the end it isn't powerful enough(and certainly not reliable enough) to make his entire kit weak, and dependent on him getting a ghost(his ghost can be easily kited also, and even 1 CC can let you escape it).\r\n\r\nIf you want Mordekaiser to be a good champion, he needs some serious changes to his kit. It's outdated, and comes from a game where point and click stuns were the norm. Just modifying his numbers a bit won't fix him, he needs a complete rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2015-02-19T20:13:35.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been around since season 2, and Morde has just been ignored and indirectly nerfed. There's no reason to keep him in this pitiful state he's in. I'm not saying to give him buffs directly, but I am saying he needs a kit rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KPVdqOqmF0","date":"2015-02-19T17:25:33.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I garuntee that if mord had AD ratios instead of ap ( im aware q has ad ratio ) and he dealt all physical damage he'd be a monster with no other changes even if he were liable to being kited. This says more about riot's overbalancing of melee ad in league of mobility than anything.\n\nHonestly though most of you are probably too new to remember when he was the biggest lane bully in the game, you dont want that tto come back trust me","replies":[]}]}
