However the problem with this Keystone is it only slows extremly shortlycand has a weird starting high cd, but even 4s is too much in late teamfights because other 4s keystones like Grasp and Conqueror can be can be activated before teamfights and proced in them.\nWhat I'd really like about Glacial Augment if we can give it an additional effect. When they're slowed the next attack/spell will bonus addaptive damage but instantly ends the slow on contact with incoming damage. This can make it a good kiting/chasing/trading Keystone but for that purpose of additional effect I'd decrease slow duration by 5%.\nMy suggestion though.
