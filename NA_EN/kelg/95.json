He was just deleting my fed AD last game and I couldn&#039;t do anything about it. It&#039;s just gross to watch and not fun to play against at all. Nocturne is pretty much the same, if you&#039;re in his range he can ult and burst you. I just played a game with an enemy Noct and Wu, we still won, but it wasn&#039;t fun at all, and I feel empty. How long is league going to remain an instaburst game? It&#039;s kinda annoying already.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lets have shrex","date":"2018-07-10T20:11:37.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{item:3147}} {{item:3095}} fuck sake nerf these and not the champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2018-07-10T20:55:38.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They already are lol.

Riot is probably looking into the underlying reasons why they are a problem. Or maybe they're looking into long-term fixes for the characters.\n\nIt could also be because the champs are only a problem now because of items that have been released recently. If those items are the problem then it's a much more involved process to ensure that nerfs don't unfairly impact other characters that _also_ use the same items.","replies":[]}]}
