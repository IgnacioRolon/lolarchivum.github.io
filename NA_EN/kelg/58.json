Can't help dragon too busy getting mad stakz.  Same with exh support singed a while back too.

There is already a plan for Sion in the works with gold value changes.\n\nLet's use support singed for an example.

End of the day though it still breaks all current rules in place, and falls in line with past offenses. \n\nWhy are people getting banned?...because the report system was designed to prevent the majority of what this strategy promotes.

Maybe others on a team -really- don't like the champ you want to play and you were autofilled in an off-meta role (shaco teemo yasuo etc)?
