Set all numbers to 1. damage, crit chance, attack speed, hp, everything all set to 1\n2. clearly define roles and lanes\n- Top laners + top lane \n= Tanks which dive and tank initial damage, juggernauts which can tank better than fighters, fight better than tanks, but cant do either as well as the counterpart, and fighters/brawlers/duelist, damage dealers for front line in team fighting. able to help defend/take Rift Herald and Baron.\n= Top lane being a island, where tanks, juggernauts and fighters can freely farm and engage each other without the massive burst damage easily dictating their early game, unless ganks and roams from jungle/mid, which would leave those lanes open and exposed. rift herald and baron should be defendable for laners in this lane.\n......\n- Junglers + Jungle\n= Junglers having a variety of champion types that have abilites that can quickly clear the jungle and gank when necessary, giving a jack of all trades role to balance whatever team comp you have (tank if the top laner is a fighter, AP if mid laner is an AD assassin, assassin if you dont have enough burst, etc). junglers should be able to gank for lanes, jump in a team fight close to the end and cleanup, but easily engage jungle buffs and objectives, and help take laning objectives.\n= jungle being a place with jungle buffs big team fighting objectives and a place for jungle to farm early and laners to farm late (if they need to catch up)\n.....\n- Mid laners + mid lane\n= Mages with AP damage to cover the lack of AP on the team due to a high AD comp, or assassins to cover the need for high impact burst damage. able to roam to top or bottom when needed. should be able to provide coverage in team fights for whatever kind of damage is missing, either being assassins that engage, APC, or cleanup crew.\n= mid lane should be the most important lane to push overall, being the shortest, basically the vanguard to the end of the game, gankable, but also versatile.\n.....\n- Bot laners + Bot lane\n= ADC/APC- Bot laners should be able to play a variety of marksmen and mages, but should generally always be the ranged damage, and be the highest damage dealers at the late game, but the easiest and squishiest to kill, the epitome of glass canon. sitting in bot lane to get as much farm as possible, but also keeping them as far away from the brawlers of top lane as possible. ADC/APC should worry about farming and becoming the back line death canons of the game. being the ones the rest of the team should worry about getting the most fed early on, so they can carry the hardest late game.\n= Supports- Tank supports, vangaurd supports, enchanter supports, and poke supports should all exist to give final variety and coverage to a team comp. able to help their laner in whatever way they are geared to. able to roam and impact the game after laning phase is over, and able to provide excellent support in team fights. able to protect their laner from in coming jungle and mid lane ganks.\n= Bot lane should have 2 people, because the support should be helping the glass cannon survive and get strong enough to fend on their own, and because dragon is a strong early game power spike, you should have 2 people bot lane to protect it as much as possible. it should be the least important lane to push early tho, as it shouldnt have much aside from the dragon pit to worry about. tho getting a quick doublekill on the enemy bot laner and support and pushing their turret to end laning phase quickly, should be a strong advantage. bot lane turret should be the hardest to kill, to prevent the bot laners from roaming too soon.\n\n/dream team (my opinion and bias)-\nTop: Nasus\nJungle: Kayn\nMid: Brand\nBot: JInx\nSupp: Nami\nVS\nTop: Darius\nJungle: Evelynn\nMid: Ryze\nBot: Tristana\nSupp: Janna\n-with the balances i mentioned\\\n.......\n3. balance all jungle camps and objectives.\n4. balance all items, so they help their individual roles as evenly as the items for the other roles.\n5. tweak the numbers change you did in step 1, raise things and lower things for each level and each role. lower crit chance and attack speed at early levels from 1, to whatever percentage, give tanks more defence and health, etc etc..\n6. smooth the edges out to better reflect each champion, and play style, giving every champ some kind of counterplay.\n7. make the games last 30-40 mins, so everyone has the chance to show their skill and allow for awesome comebacks and such!\n8. figure out how to better match up players with other players of equal skill, lose the MMR system because it makes no sense, get rid of autofill or at least make it optional, because a plat top laner could be a bronze support, straight game skill doesn't reflect each role.\n9. better deal with AFkers and trolls, flamers and useless teammates.\n10. make it easier for one person to climb and not rely on their team AS MUCH when in solo queue. and if not, give us some way to better work as a team, that doesn't involve people typing so much, because when you're typing, you're not playing, and when you're not playing, you're probable getting killed..\n\nanyway, this is something i've thought alot about, and all these changes would make this more of a team based game, while not punishing solo players. allowing people to carry by themselves, but also letting true teams shine with their cooperation skills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Killalot","date":"2018-07-04T12:31:28.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest problem with this game is the toxic community tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-07-04T18:31:20.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Say it louder for those in the back.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2018-07-04T18:27:08.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know, but when death recap shows 4800 damage in 2.3 seconds while playing a jugger (even teams), i feel cheated.\n\nmaybe slow it down with the burst damage, and loading the game full of true damage. its like since season 5, i went from \"i have 5k hp, i can survive fights\" to \"well, i just blew up before the knockups were finished\".\n\npreviously it was marksmen who blew you up. now it feels like its mostly junglers, and still marksmen if they ever get to lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-07-04T17:41:19.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think someone  in another htread made a very good post of how the game (would work if it was good) im going to see if i can find it and quote it.\n\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/GAEWpPVZ-season-1-veteran-here-riot-has-never-suceeded-with-the-assassin-class?comment=00020000\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Holgranth,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GAEWpPVZ,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-07-02T15:45:51.316+0000)\n>\n> Assassins would need to be build around being a follow up to allied damage.
