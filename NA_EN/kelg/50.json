At lv 5 her qw auto does half your hp and to top it all off she has a chain that can hard cc you from a lane away... You can't trade with her, hell you can&#039;t even fight her because she because she has 2 flashes on a 10 second cd. If you push her you get ganked. There is 0 counterplay to this champ, so why is this a thing again? Leblac is actually the most cancerous champ in the game tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"ez mental boom","date":"2018-11-06T00:37:56.694+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people don't like when a champion needs a whole lot of button presses to get a kill\n\nThough Akali has to press like 15 buttons just to get what LB is back to doing in 3 xd","replies":[{"poster":"ankoanko19","date":"2018-11-06T19:50:30.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ez mental boom,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E7qgHOIq,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-11-06T00:37:56.694+0000)\n>\n> Because people don&#x27;t like when a champion needs a whole lot of button presses to get a kill\n> \n> Though Akali has to press like 15 buttons just to get what LB is back to doing in 3 xd\n\nLOL!
