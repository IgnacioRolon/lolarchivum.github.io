Same design, like Garen, Nasus, and Master Yi&#039;s VUs. Mordekaiser has always been my favorite champion design. He&#039;s a Shadow Isle champion, but doesn&#039;t really have that generic spooky ghost look. I really like his \"dark knight\" look, and hope it stays that way.\n2. Same Voice actor. I love his current Voice actor, I think it&#039;s perfect for him.\n3. His sarcastic+evil personality.\n4. No overly filtered voice, please! Can&#039;t even understand what champions like Thresh are saying half the time.\n5. You only need to click once, fool! (his joke maybe?)\n\nWhat I think should change\n1. His ult DoT animation. It&#039;s just a spinning Mordekaiser head floating above people. Looks silly.\n2. His lack of movement when doing pretty much anything. Kind of boring to watch.\n3. His death animation. He just explodes, lol. While I do like this animation, it makes him seem more like a joke character. Maybe this should be his pentakill skin death animation.\n4. Dragon knight and Infernal skins. They&#039;re pretty much chromas atm.\n5. His skins to use different weapons. Would be awesome to see him use a great sword or something in a skin, since it attacks pretty much the same as a mace.\n6. Lore expansion. There isn&#039;t really any lore about his past.\n7. More lines.(obviously)\n8. Removal of his lame lines. (\"No pain, no drain.\", \"This whole... living thing is... highly overrated.\", etc.)\n\nHow would you like to see his VU handled?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2015-09-05T17:55:55.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I would love to hear him having more lines.

As the first undead, possibly the most powerful of the Shadow Isles champion and the fact he actually seems to be plotting on betraying them, Mordekaiser is the one Shadow Isles champion that could get away with being significantly different from the rest.\n\nThen you look at his new particles, realise they dont have any metal whatsoever anymore and cry.\n\nI actually really liked how Mord's power wasnt just limited to his necromancy. Adding his massive physical prowess + Metal manipulation helped him feel not only more unique, but also powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2015-09-08T02:40:52.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Matezoide,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=1AsXRoM3,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-09-07T20:38:11.161+0000)\n>\n> Considering what they have done to every single one of his particles, Mordekaiser is definetly going to turn into a generic green ghost with filtered voice.\n\nI know...
