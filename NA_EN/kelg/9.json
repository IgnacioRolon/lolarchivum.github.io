Sure they were strong, but it gave Morde a lot of macro power and added complexity to what some would call a \"braindead\" champ. New Morde's kit seems really vanilla and seems like Riot just wanted to play safe when making him. After Morde's numbers are nerfed down to a reasonable level, I can see him going back to being a low pickrate champ due to how telegraphed his entire kit is, and how immobile he is.\r\n\r\nWhile his ult can be fun, the whole idea of death realm isn't all that interesting considering that there is virtually no reward for winning the fight, and later in the game it's hard to kill enemy champs outside the support since they will have zhonyas,  Qss, or will have outscaled you. \r\n\r\nI think instead of taking stats out of the death realm, Morde should get the enemy champion's ghost. This would make him closer to his old self and would bring that cool mechanic back in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-06-14T06:50:39.347+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And Yorick too, right? \n\nIn fact, let's add back the fact Gnar could be invulnerable on a corner of Camille's ult, Tryndamere's ability to kill allies, Poppy's ability to push baron out of the pit and into the enemy Nexus.\n\nWhat they did was give back the old Mord, the one that could turn around an attempted gank, without relying on the buggiest type of ability in the game.","replies":[]}]}
