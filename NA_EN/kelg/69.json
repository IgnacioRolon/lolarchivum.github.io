The solo W use will barely change anything. Basically, his W is going to be pretty much useless, (especially in solo lanes. How is this supposed to help solo lane Mordekaiser?\nHe is going to be the same as he is now,  and the \"sustain\" is pitiful from his W now that it has a cost. If you want to make him useful in solo lanes, make his W more useful when solo. Make it deal more damage, drain more, or have no cost when an ally isn&#039;t around. The reason why duo Morde was so strong was that his W heals him, and his partner.  \n\n\n**[Max number of units drained reduced to 2 from 3]** \nThis change, will all the other nerfs will make his W very weak, this and the fact that it now has a cost is going to hurt his competitiveness. I say just scrap the whole bot lane mess that is current Mordekaiser, there is no way to balance this to be viable without him being overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-09T04:16:10.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At least his solo lane is no longer unplayable.

Old morde was fine just needed move speed quints and maybe flash.\n\nI agree, it was too strong. But throwing on so many nerfs at once is really going to hurt Mordekaiser as a whole. Riot seems to forget that this is a champion with no mobility, and no CC. You can't just bring him to the same levels of power as the other champions... His shield has been made quite weak with this rework, the heal was supposed to offset this... But I guess CertainlyT wants Morde's shield, what used to be the main reason to pick him, to be non-existent and pointless. So what's the real point in picking him now? Dragon ghost? Q? To play a immobile champ whos overall weaker now than a speed demon like Garen who fills the same role?\n\nAnd yes, I agree, old Morde was good, and fun. He wasn't toxic really even though Riot likes to act like he was. He had clear strengths and weaknessess. The Mordekaiser rework is toxic because of how he's supposed to function. He's supposed to unload a truckload of damage off of one CC, and kill his opponent in a short period of time if they can't get away. Nobody wants to get 1 shotted by a single skill, it's just stupid, and poor design in my opinion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ID x iKuma","date":"2015-09-09T03:20:25.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"bro bro bro\n\nthey did not nerf his Q damage so hes fine lol","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2015-09-09T04:06:54.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ID x iKuma,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=NQWmgJ8l,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-09T03:20:25.663+0000)\n>\n> bro bro bro\n> \n> they did not nerf his Q damage so hes fine lol\n\nHis Q is ridiculously easy to avoid, even in duos.
