I&#039;ve been following the talks of Mordekaiser updates for a bit now, and was interested, and even excited in what they were going to do... But this.. This is so incredibly stupid that it even makes my brain hurt trying to fathom why they thought this was a good idea. If the balance team ever tried to play Mordekaiser as a support or ADC replacement, you would see that he just gets harassed out of lane, and is forced to hug the tower. What changes here are going to remedy this? Oh I can get a Dragon ghost! This change alone will make up for the rest of my nonexistent laning phase! And since we&#039;re going to be losing lane 95% of the time, we&#039;ll have more time to focus on getting the dragon ghost! lol. Mordekaiser has just been **forced** to play two roles that are 100% troll for him. Do you honestly think people are going to let you pick Morde instead of an ADC? Seriously? Mordekaiser has now become the champion equivalent of revive. Never in this game&#039;s lifetime did I think riot would make such a nonsensical balance change.\r\n\r\nP.S. His movement speed was nerfed, Have fun being kited even more than before.(and lol at the E changes)\r\n\r\nRIP {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-08-05T03:02:30.119+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The dragon ghost is pretty ridiculous though.

Most people oppose the idea of the changes. You are saying that no one has the RIGHT to question the changes until they've already been released. I don't think you know why Riot use isolated testing environments before they release anything to live servers. If it has been released officially, and the champion was horrible, then there would be overwhelming backlash. And for two weeks aswell. Riot would be pressured to release a great fix in the next patch, and they could not mess it up. There's a reason for testing environments, and the live servers are not anywhere to test these changes first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
