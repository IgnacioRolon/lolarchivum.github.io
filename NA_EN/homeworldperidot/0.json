In the Store, there are three scrolls that move the focus of the box left-right, up-down, and up-down for lists. I have to constantly mess with the three scrolls just to use the search feature and still see everything. I've looked in settings and I can't find a \"UI Scroll/Zoom\" option, so I'm just getting tired.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T23:36:21.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like there may be an issue with your display resolution and the client's scaling.

I'm not able to determine your desktop display resolution, but I recommend trying to resize the client until the bars don't show up anymore. You can do so by grabbing the bottom right corner of your client window and while holding down a left click, dragging outwards to expand the size of the client. Below is a screenshot to assist you.\n\n(Click to Enlarge)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/SX0pd\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"HomeworldPeridot","date":"2016-08-08T05:58:03.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/da2f68ec93ced17eb8cdf8c13ff102a1\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/2b7b6d742bf133b7504cc93cb37e9d7d\n\nIt removed that problem, but now I can't see a small chunk of the screen at all.
