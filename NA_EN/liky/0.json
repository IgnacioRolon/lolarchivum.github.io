Is it possible that your suspension was related to boosting during the 2017 season? That's one way to disqualify you from the rewards. If that wasn't the case, or if you want to dispute it, you should submit a ticket and get more details about it.","replies":[{"poster":"liky","date":"2018-01-07T13:32:00.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your help.
