The frames are capped to 60 in game, which is not that bad but i'm used to play at 144, and when i alt-tab to quickly check something on the internet or whatever, i have a little freeze that last for a second or so. That last part is quite horrible. \nAs mentioned above this is the third time that the exact same problem occurs after an update, the exact same issue... \nThis happened to many other after the creators update and then i read all the problem fixes including deactivating DVR and the game balk and so on. I've also permanently deleted xbox app which also lead to problems. All my drivers are up to date. \nThis time i really dont find the solution, yet i'm a hundred percent sure this is caused by the update again. Yesterday i was still playing with 144 fps and no freezes at all, then i updated my pc during the night. This morning, knowing from the past that the update could cause problems, i checked if it was the case and SO IT WAS. \nI'm pretty desperate and pissed at MS. Same as always, can someone relate and help me fix this problem? \nMuch appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-02T17:47:15.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry this is still happening for you.  :(  If you're tasking out and back in, your connection is likely getting clogged and trying to catch up everything that happened.  What happens if you instead switch your resolution from Fullscreen to Borderless?  Tasking out this way shouldn't pause your connection during the game, so you may be able to seamlessly swap in and out.  Otherwise, you may not want to task out while the game is going on.  I don't believe this is really a specific issue with your PC settings, but just the nature of networking.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcusTan","date":"2017-12-02T22:19:48.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny enough this did the trick for me... I can't thank you enough for helping me! Still i find it so strange that when i select full screen, my frames are immediately capped to 60, i mean obviously something must be causing that and not just 'the nature of networking'.\nBut thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"MVP Every Day","date":"2017-12-02T23:38:02.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The framerate cap is because of the Xbox game app thing on windows. I don't remember what its exactly called since I completely removed it from my computer to fix the issue. for some people, you can fix the issue without unisntalling it but for me it didnt work and i had to uninstall it completely. if you dont use it just uninstall it. do some google searches about: \n\n60 fps cap in games on windows 10 and disabling game dvr. \n\nif none the solutions worked for you, then try uninstalling the xbox app following the youtube vid below which guides you on how to uninstall the xbox app. \nHope this helps. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrZLOCkqpXc","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Draconian565","date":"2017-12-03T01:44:04.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, not sure if you've done this already but go to My PC -> Local Disk -> Riot Games -> League of Legends.\nScroll down to your Clients (should be 3 of them) and right click to hit \"Properties\"\nGo to compatibility and check the box that has the words \"Disable Full Screen Optimization\"\n\nThis recent Windows 10 Version 1709 completely messed up my gaming and OBS settings and that helps it a little. I don't get screen tearing after this, but I still get 59-61 fps irregularities only when I'm recording.","replies":[]}]}
