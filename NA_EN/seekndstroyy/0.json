These include outdated drivers, or even the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which was recently auto-enabled in a Windows 10 update and causing problems for some players.  As your first step, I recommend making sure that xbox bar is disabled.
