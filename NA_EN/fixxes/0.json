PC keeps shutting down.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lately league is making my computer restart. sometimes I am at the middle of a game or even about 10 seconds after the loading screen and my computer just shut's down like if I pressed the power button... I don't know what to do.\r\nI already tried playing the game at low specs, still makes the computer shut down. the minimum specs of the game are 2GB ram (I have 4), 2GHz processor (I have i5 1.6 + turbo boost till 2.6. yeah, not the best, but runs the game), 8GB HDD space (I have 150GB free on my SSD), shader 2.0 and 512MB Vram (I have radeon R7 m265, supports shader 5.0 and 1GB Vram), directX 9.0. (currently I have DX12). \r\n\r\nas you see my computer is not the best (it's what I can afford right now), but it meets the minimum requirements. till about 2 months ago I could run the game smoothly, with no problems. this shut down problem comes and goes, sometimes I can spend a whole day without it happening, and some days I can't even play 1 match. I have pretty much nothing installed despite some essential programs like antivirus, a cleaner (bleachbit), an office suite and some other daily use programs, all trustable, I use them for years.\r\nI don't go out there installing software like a mad man, I take a lot of care to avoid crapware and viruses. I don't change registry or windows options... my computer was formatted last week (on trying to see if the problem was with windows 10), but problem persists. my computer is 2years old and I don't plan to buy a new one or even upgrade this one... like, come on, I am able to play The crew, far cry 3, Need for speed most wanted and other high graphical quality games on this crappy machine, how can't I play league on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-16T21:44:00.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if there's an overheating issue or some kind of hardware failure that's causing this to happen.
