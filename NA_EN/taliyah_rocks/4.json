Out of over 15-20 queues (some were dodges) i was placed mid only THREE times, despite mid being my primary role.\r\n\r\nI don't mind playing my secondary roles every few games, but i would REALLY love to be placed mid, but matchmaking is freakin broken to the point that it's sickening. I want to play this game for fun, but i'm not even allowed to play what i want at least a decent amount of time. I understand the purpose of matchmaking, but this is going too far.\r\n\r\nMid seems to be the most contested role, so i was wonderring how midlaner mains handle the shitty matchmaking. I've noticed that mid secondary top yielded the best result... but even then i'd be matched top more often than mid.\r\n\r\nThere really should be a system that increases your chance to roll primary when you played secondary, much like how you get auto-fill protected after filling.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylas","date":"2019-03-20T08:03:42.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i que as mid top, ive been filled top once, and filled to every other about half the time, mostly adc tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"kristopher205","date":"2017-03-19T15:49:05.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I queue up for mid/top and I would say out of 10 games I get mid 8 or 9 times. \n\nIf I don't get mid, I usually dodge because I am the best mid on my team usually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LBmyBB","date":"2017-03-19T15:39:30.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find someone else to play if you can't get mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hovering Hentai","date":"2017-03-19T15:31:29.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play with four other people\n\nSimple solution xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimmy K","date":"2017-03-19T15:30:15.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually try and space out the times I queue up by a couple minutes. If I get a queue pop and I accept but someone else doesn't, I immediately stop my queue wait like 10 seconds and then requeue so I get different people and another chance at getting my role and not getting autofilled.
