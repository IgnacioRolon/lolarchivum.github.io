Zac&#039;s rework is so boring and unreliable. His ult is so hard to place properly and even when it works, it doesn&#039;t feel satisfying at all.\r\n\r\nHis kit was already reliant on his E landing, now every part of his kit is a hit-or-miss.\r\n\r\nHis damage is gutted, so when you miss your abilities you are just useless in a teamfight.\r\n\r\nHe just feels boring in general. Please riot, unrework him like you did with Kog&#039;maw.\r\n\r\nSeriously Zac was fine!!! He didn&#039;t need a rewok, he was balanced, useful and felt great. His rework was uncalled for!","replies":[{"poster":"SexyBabyJesusZ","date":"2017-05-04T04:45:42.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont like it, and I dont like having him on my team because now he offers nothing if your team can kite his ult or has a backline that he cant reach.\n\nseriously this rework sucks revert it riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-05-04T04:49:38.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"well. i Don't know why is this a topic but heres my opinions\n\nno. \nKog maw was not technically unreworked he had faster attack speed and minor bonus damage, the \"unrework\" gave kogmaw even higher damage and the power to shred tanks into little snow flakes, and kogmaw never received a full on gameplay update, unlike other champions they gave them new mechanics changed or created new abilitys, he had alot of change in stats,as well as damage.\n\nzac does not need to receive an unrework, his new kit is pretty good and funny to watch, honestly no offense but your opinions arent important to riot, they look at the communitys needs, and what the community needs is........ YASUO TO BE NERFED. thats a new topic.\n\nif you dont understand becuase your a grown up and older then the 12 year old that typed this.\n\nT.L.D.R\nhis rework makes him fun and kogmaw never got unreworked, just slightly changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah Rocks","date":"2017-05-04T05:40:25.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fG9y2AqY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-05-04T04:49:38.649+0000)\n> \n> T.L.D.R\n> his rework makes him fun and kogmaw never got unreworked, just slightly changed.\n\nBut Zac's rework is NOT fun... that's the point... plus he's even more unreliable, which makes things worse.\n\nAlso did you miss when Kog'Maw had 5.0 attack speed? That was something completely new to LoL and they unreworked him after some time.","replies":[]}]}]}
