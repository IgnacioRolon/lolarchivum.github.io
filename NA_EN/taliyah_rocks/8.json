Her early clear feels soooo slow. Add on that the fact that her ganks are really bad pre-6.\r\n\r\nWhile i know her midlaning is fine, her winrate is much lower in the jungle. I feel like she could use an attack speed buff to ease her clear.\r\n\r\nAlso is it even worth to complete {{item:1402}}? I feel like rushing a {{item:3115}} after getting {{item:3706}} offers much better clear and scaling.","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2018-02-23T20:52:14.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana neess to be unplayable in all roles and then reworked into something slightly less overbearing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Potchikir","date":"2018-02-23T21:27:31.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah she isnt viable in jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lunar Lunacy","date":"2018-02-23T20:55:57.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the clear that lich bane gives her :D I play her mid though lol {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:14}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2018-02-23T20:46:01.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes a mid laner and she does not rely on her AAs to deal damage. Instead, her spell is what buffs her AA for short period of time. Giving her more AA speed would not change anything at all.
