Quite frankly i&#039;m surprised that Yasuo is THE most played champion considering he&#039;s almost always perma-banned.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t consider {{champion:412}}{{champion:222}}{{champion:236}} to be cancer or tryhard champions, but i still listed them since they were amongst the most played champions. Although Thresh has often been considered THE best support in the game (beside meta abusers).\r\n\r\nAs for the other champions.... can anyone say they enjoy seeing them in their game? I personnaly hate seeing them on the enemy side, and hate seeing them on my team even more. These champions are either loved (by those who play them) or hated, there is no gray zone.\r\n\r\nAlso, most of the time, players that main any of those champs, also happen to main other champs on this list. I&#039;ve stopped counting the numbers of time i would check a Yasuo main profile, only to see that they also play Lee Sin and Zed.\r\n\r\nWhile i know that meta abusers (looking at you {{item:3504}} supports) can be considered more cancer, their state changes with the meta. But the above champions are all-around cancer to play with and against.\r\n\r\nSo what&#039;s up with that? From my quick and unprofessional analysis, it seems that the LoL player base is split into two kinds of players:\r\n\r\n-Those that only play tryhard champions, and have their champion pool limited to those.\r\n\r\n-All the others that have a varied champion pool.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if i&#039;m wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-08T06:33:53.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see blitz as tryhard.

Can a bad Vayne pull her weight? Nope, they basically turn the match into a 4v5.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=MysterQ,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rBQNi3qz,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-08T06:26:46.043+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:64}}  - He&#x27;s not strong.

I find Yasuo annoying, yet i still win most of the time against him. It's just that these champions have a tendancy to leave a bitter sensation to those that play with or against them.","replies":[{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-11-08T16:32:17.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I (and a lot of the forum) had a problem when Lee Sin was in 60%+ of games.
