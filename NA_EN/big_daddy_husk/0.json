His Q is simply the best hook of the three (him, Blitz, Nautilus)- it has better range, CD and mana cost than Blitzcranks, disables the opponent for the longest while he's dragging them in, it gives Thresh the _option_ (unlike the others) of choosing whether or not he wants to go in and make it a hard engagement with his E and ult (how many times have you Blitz hooked an enemy Alistar, Amumu or Leona and screwed up your team?), and oh, it also lets him jump walls- Naut can't even fire his hook through walls at all! Flay is one of the most powerful and versatile CCs in the game, capable of pulling opponents in or knocking them back at his discretion. His ult is an AMAZING disengage tool which can also be used offensively if Thresh jumps onto you with Q. Oh and unlike Naut and Blitz (and other all-in supports) he's RANGED, not melee. And just to add injury to injury, Flay gives him a damage buff on his autoattack harass.\n\nAll this adds up to make a support champion who not only has unique strengths that NO other support can provide (Dark Passage) but, more importantly, has_no weaknesses at all._ He's not squishy. He can all-in almost as well as the likes of Leona, but far more safely. He can both engage and disengage. He can _poke_ for fuck's sake! He has some of the best CC in the game. He even has a shield (on the Lantern, natch). Hell, pros play him with Relic Shield so he can even sustain (the bonus damage from his E makes up for not getting the execute proc when last hitting). If he has a weakness, I'd like you to tell me what it is, other than \"he's not a dedicated healer\" which will make you look like a retard. But we all know he has no weaknesses, and so do the pros, who have NEVER stopped playing Thresh for even a single patch ever since the day of his release. NO other champion has _ever_ been so utterly ubiquitous in the meta- he has literally _never_ not been a highly viable pro pick (I think he's the only champion _in the game_ who can claim this).\n\nThresh is CertainlyT's greatest success and also his greatest failure- a nightmarish balance monster who overshadows literally every other support in bot lane. He has NO bad matchups and fits EVERY team composition because he's simply flat-out too powerful.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-08-21T04:42:41.851+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP means the game they released as promo along with Arcade Riven and Final Boss Blitz. The game consists on saving poros from Baron Nashor, while owning some champions on the way. Clearing the game with Blitz unlocks Thresh, who has a higher delay in his grab, but catches everything in it's range.\n\nAlso, add to your rant the free AP he gets from Souls. Ok, he has no scaling armor and needs to get it from Souls, but they also grant AP AND extra damage on his autoattack thanks to E's passive. What annoys me the most about the free AP is that Thresh was released by the time Supports build was boots, philo stone, and a shitload of wards and pink wards to wage Vision Wars with. In that context where the supports had no gold to spare on damage items to scale with, Thresh got AP for free...

It is true that thresh has an extremely strong kit.  I've tried to make a guide on mobafire for him, but wasn't able to, simply because the correct way to build thresh is to build how the team needs you!  Thresh brings everything to the table a team could want: heavy crowd control, the ability to peel, high damage, and an escape for his ADC, as his own escape if you use his Q cleverly.\n\nHowever, Thresh is not overpowered.  The advantage of Thresh is his versatility; he can be used as a blindpick any day without question because he fits into most any team.  Thresh has many disadvantages in response to this, which I list below:\n\n           * Thresh falls off after the early/midgame.\nThresh's main advantage is his E/Q combo at level 2, which can all-in most support/adc combinations of the day.  However, if the enemy dodges the combo, a huge powerspike is lost to Thresh.  The same goes at levels 3, 6, and 11.  After these points, thresh's entire kit relies on landing a hook, which despite what someone with less experience might tell you, is easy to avoid.\n           * Thresh has clear counters and comparable supports to battle with.\nIf you think thresh is the only one who plays the way he does, or is the strongest in lane, you aren't playing right.  Thresh has equal or lesser strength to braum and leona, and is flat out countered by morgana and alistar, who can negate his combo's.  Thresh isn't leagues ahead of these other supports; I could take any one of these others and have comperable results.\n           * Thresh relies on his team's lead and his earlygame to win.\nThresh's main strength is his powerful laning phase and deadly earlygame ganks.  After this point, however, he becomes useless if his team can't find a lead.  In fact, if his team is behind, Thresh can dig a deeper hole for his team with misplaced hooks, stupid dives, attempted rescues, poor roams, and baits on his team.  In addition, Thresh's passive, collecting souls, makes his armor fall off of the other supports' levels if he can't reach them.\n           * Thresh can't peel as well as other supports.\nThresh actually has poor peel.  Don't believe me?  Just try keeping their tank off of your ADC when you're behind, and we'll see whose right.  If you compare the peel of Thresh to someone such as leona, braum, nami, janna, morgana, alistar, or even Karma, you can see how he isn't amazing.  Any of these other supports has a better method of peeling, usually with the aid of a targeted ability.  Leona? bash with shield and jump on them.  Braum?  Auto them so they can be stunned by your ADC.  Nami?  Heal your adc, make them move fast, and pool the attacker.  Janna?  Play as janna and get freelo.  Morgana? spellshield your adc and root them for 500 years.  Alistar?  Pulverize and headbutt.  Karma?  Root, slow, move fast, and shield to peel them.  By comparison, Thresh isn't as strong as you might think.  All of his abilities are either skillshot or rely on him positioning away from the fight, which you generally don't do with thresh.  If you miss your Q, you have a 10s CD.  If you miss your E, you're screwed and have to use your ult.  If you throw out your lantern, the enemy can just toss a ward on it and your ADC is screwed.  To be fair, Thresh isn't hopeless for peeling, but the point is that most other supports are better, other than thresh using his lantern to help an out of position target.\n \nI like to compare Thresh to Lee Sin, or irelia: usable in practically any composition due to their strong earlygame/midgame, but falls off during the lategame to a position not nearly as effective as other choices.","replies":[{"poster":"I is Illiterate","date":"2015-08-21T21:50:06.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BaldursGateII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kq0Eps8x,comment-id=0023,timestamp=2015-08-21T21:08:21.422+0000)\n>\n>            * Thresh falls off after the early/midgame.\n\nUm, his damage might, but since he is the only support with infinitely scaling armor and since his strong utility never falls off, I would say that saying he falls off is misleading.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=BaldursGateII,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kq0Eps8x,comment-id=0023,timestamp=2015-08-21T21:08:21.422+0000)\n>            * Thresh can't peel as well as other supports.\n> Thresh actually has poor peel.  \n\n While some supports like Alistar may have better peel than him, Thresh by no means has *poor* peel. His disables and repositions, knock-ups and slows make him one of the **best** peel supports in the entire game, especially with CDR which is commonly built on Thresh.\n\nI play lots of Thresh, and the thing is that he does *way* too much far too well. He has strong safe engage, very strong \"lockdown\" (hook into flay into box or any combo means you're not going anywhere), insane disengage, and strong team fight presence while scaling into a very strong tank.  Oh, and the ability to reposition allies and save their butts all game long. Yeah, he is overloaded and too powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Not Katarina","date":"2015-08-21T18:04:44.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"tfw you're just trying to make a joke about poro roundup and everyone takes it seriously, Thresh gets nerfed next patch for being able to grab too many poros and everyone blames you\n\nhttp://pre14.deviantart.net/1226/th/pre/f/2015/148/0/5/sad_pepe__feels_bad_man__vector_by_hirussai-d8uq43y.png","replies":[]}]}
