And it's only a 975 skin, which is why I don't understand, instead of making it a turret thing why not just make it option. If you're pushing majority of the game then the hood will always be on, until you back and only for those moment you're back the hood is off. Or if you're being pressured and have to stay near turrets, the hood will never go on. I really much prefer it to be a choice thing, because the automatic system will make it lack a lot subtlety. For instant, say I am being pressured really hard in lane, and all of a sudden I toggle my hat on and \"Fuck shit up\" that's pretty dope...","replies":[{"poster":"MavenSong","date":"2016-07-17T11:05:34.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By new tech I ment auto changing on location","replies":[{"poster":"Jaeryn ","date":"2016-07-17T18:04:34.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes you're right.
