I just love Aatrox art-wise (especially his late Sea Hunter skin which is AWESOME) and I'm just very sad about the state in which Aatrox is right now and I'm a bit passionate about it ^^.\n\nWhen Aatrox was released, I used to play him a lot. I loved his art and I used to found his gameplay fun. But right now, even if he is on the weak side, I simply find him BORING and at the same time incredibly toxic. \n\nWhat I would like for him is a rework. Not as big as Sion or Poppy ofc, but definitely something as big as the Juggernauts (and more like Mordekaiser rather than Garen).\n\nLet me explain.\n\n**1) a) Build diversity : **\n\nAatrox has almost no build options at all. Black Cleaver is awful on him since he doesn't benefit at all from CDR and has no AOE physical damages at all except his Q (his E feels bad outside of laning phase and his Q costs too much health by far), Titanic Hydra is also awful on him (he either needs raw AD or AS and his base health is very low therefore Titanic Hydra is bad on him) etc. Trinity is out of question for him because he only has 2 abilities with pretty long CDs, Sterak is also out of the question for him because his base AD is not high (so no combo Trinity / Sterak etc).\n\nEvery time I play him (toplane mostly) I do the same build again and again : if I need raw AD I go Ravenous Hydra or chasing power / tank busting power I go BOTRK then I go full tank (almost always Randuin / Spirit Visage because of their passives and actives) and as a last item, GA. Against a balanced ennemy team with AP and AD, this is the same build I HAVE to play.\n\nThis is simply BORING. I have no problem with having a couple of items being considered \"core\". But Aatrox has no \"core\" items. He either has items that work with his kit or awful items that absolutely do not work with his kit. On Irelia, Renekton, Gnar, Darius, Jax etc I have a couple of core items but I also have OPTIONS depending on how the game is going on and the ennemy comp.\n\nAlso, you changed how Sion's passive health decays in order to not punish him for building tanky. But at the same time, Aatrox is punished HARD for building any health item at all. A simple Q + E combo costs him 15% of his current health.\n\n**b) Poor scaling, unhealthy, boring and \"makes no sense\" kit (I'm sorry Meddler but I really think that he does it all :( ) :**\n\nHis passive is not good at all except in very early game. Yes, you can dive an ennemy at lvl 3 with it. Yes you can prevent a dive at lvl 3 with it. But outside of those situations it is useless. During those 3 seconds of wait, the ennemy can flee or wait for its CDs to come back to kill you right after you revived. You also have no damages or sustain at all when you come back to life because you lose all your bonus AS, leaving you unable to either deal damages or sustain. His passive feels \"meh\" because of the loss of the bonus AS. I'd rather have you get rid of the bonus AS and give him better base AS and AS growth.\n\nHis E is absolutely insane in laning phase. It gives him pushing power, easy harass and hybrid damages and a form a burst when you ready his 3rd AA and combine it with his E. But outside of laning phase, this ability FEELS very underwhelming. Scaling is awful and even art-wise it feels awful (we know that his sword can expand so why Aatrox is shooting some weird energy to the ennemy when he could expand it ? Imo it would be a lot cooler).\n\nHis Q feels awful. I find it very cool animation-wise but :\n1) awful scaling.\n2) awfully long CD and since CDR is bad on Aatrox well ...\n3) too easy to interrupt (Trundle's pillar or even Anivia's wall can stop it !!!!).\n4) costs by FAR too much health.\n\nHis W is at the same time super weak and potentially very toxic. Aatrox is the only champion in the game who has to chose between dealing damages and healing. This is a necessity since his sustain is so strong but at the same time, it makes him a weird champion to play. If you are behind you will never use your W to deal damages. If you are ahead you will ALSO never use your W to deal damages. I had a couple of games where I was incredibly fed and you know what I did on Aatrox ?\n\nI rushed huge, raw AD items (Hydra, BT and so on) and used my AS bonus from my passive and my ulti to destroy the ennemy team while healing myself for AN ABSURD amount of health thanks to the quite good AD ratio on Aatrox's W. You don't need to deal damages with his W when you have at 20 minutes 200+ AD and 1.5 AS when you use ulti. But healing every 3 AA for 150+ (with the lifesteal) and almost 400 when under 50% HP ? Yes pls.\nI was unkillable. Literally. \n\nBut even when I'm not hard fed with Aatrox he feels simply too oppressive. He harasses you A LOT with a ranged ability dealing magic damages while being a heavy AD focused champion while healing himself with his W (making, in lane, the health cost on his E meaningless). \n\nAnd at the same time, his kit makes no sense at all. He is supposed to be a sustained damage dealing champ but until lategame, he has an excellent burst with a 3rd AA + E + ulti combo. And his base health is SO LOW that you DON'T want to do extended trades with Aatrox in early and midgame ???\n\n**2) How to fix all of that ? By reworking him :**\n\na) Make his W an active ability that deals damages AND heal him but gate it by a CD (10+ imo). Each time Aatrox deals physical damages, he applys a debuff on the ennemy (same as Kalista, but no infinite stacking, something small, like 5 or 6 stacks) and when he press W, he deals physical damages and heal himself for a FLAT amount depending on the number of stacks each ennemy had and how much health Aatrox is missing (healing is reduced on monsters and minions and no AD ratio on the heal). It would emphasize the \"sustained damage dealing champion\" part while at the same time giving him much more counterplay even if he starts snowballing like crazy. Also, get rid of the MS slow on his E and put it in his W (the more the stacks he has on an ennemy, the bigger the slow is).\n\nb) Get rid of his bonus AS on his passive and give him better base AS and AS growth (if you are scared of him being too strong in early game, just nerf his base AS and buff even more his AS growth) even if overall it would be a nerf, but at least he would always have a good AS even after reviving.\n\nc) Makes his E an ability that modifies next AA (like Renekton's W etc) that has less base PHYSICAL damages than current E, but can apply Blood Price and On-Hit effect in combination (think Lucian's Piercing Light, for the sake of balance, Sheen proc and On-Hit effects are only applied to the first ennemy struck). Less base damages, but better reward if you can land it properly with Blood Price. Also it would prevent him from harassing you in lane like crazy without any form a counterplay. \n\nd) Keep his current W damage passive (Blood Price) but nerf its base damages and AD ratio. Put this passive ability on his E. You want heal and sustained damages ? Max W. You want to harass / push ? Max E and use it in combination with Blood Price.\n\ne) Nerf heavily his ultimate damages (or event get rid of the damages part). Now, it increases his AS (unchanged) and makes his AA deal 50% AOE damages to ennemies surrounding the target. When combined with a Hydra item, the damages are increased to 75% (does not stack multiple times). The increased range during his ultimate also increases his E range.\n\nf) Buff his base health and change his health costs accordingly since has no more permanent sustain.\n\n**3) Consequences :**\n\na) Better build options => Since he has now a 3rd active ability and new E that modifies next AA, Trinity is now a viable option for him and therefore, Sterak too (Titanic Hydra too btw). BC is also now a viable option because his R will give him AOE physical damages and combined with his W, he can apply stacks to multiple ennemies if they are near each other. BOTRK is still a good option, this build is not dead, but AS isn't anymore the \"best option 99% of the time\". CDR is also now a viable option for him (and not just \"Take a Spirit Visage for the awesome passive even if you don't care about the CDR\").\n\nb) Less oppressive in lane and more counterplay => no more hybrid damages, no more infinite harass in lane and no more permanent sustain. He has now clear moments of strength and weakness. And no more \"sustained damage dealing champion that prefers to burst in early and midgame because his base health is awful and he has to choose between healing and dealing damages\".\n\nc) Better kit with synergy => his ultimate synergizes with everything : by dealing AOE damages, he applies stacks of his W to multiple ennemies then press W for extra-damages and extra-healing and slowing the ennemies. His E synergizes with his ultimate and his W (AA timer reset to apply another stack quickly) etc.\n\nd) Thematically, it fits perfectly => Aatrox is still a champion with sustain (core identity) with a \"Blood Theme\" but now he THRIVES when is in the middle of a big bad teamfight. With his ultimate he applies his W quickly to the ennemy frontline (or backline if he can reach them) and the more ennemies he fights, the bigger his heal will be before unleashing a wave of energy with his E that is increased by the blood of the ennemies he has taken (new E + Blood Price combo). Think of Aatrox as a big bad Darkin who fights multiple ennemies at the same time, cutting them with his sword then stealing his ennemies' blood from their wounds in order to heal him up and fuel up his E and Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2015-10-26T19:37:36.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a suggestion for a quicker fix that'd put him in line with most other melee carries:\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/bwAOjA6w-what-if-aatroxs-ult-turned-incoming-cc-into-dots","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pokeprof","date":"2015-09-17T09:18:58.507+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"My thoughts on here would be this:\n\nGo hyper charge on his 'Drain tank' idea.

Let's take a look at the characters you listed.\n\nSwain: Heavy CC, but scales better with AP then anything else. Even the tankiest of the Swains are squishy compared to some other natural tanking heroes. Healing as a major focus of his kit does not a drain tank make.\n\nVlad: No CC outside of his Pool, which is more of a defensive ability then anything else. Scales, again, with AP instead of anything else. He works heavily in draining life, but it fits him more as what he is, a freaking VAMPIRE!\n\nWarwick: Closest thing that we've got to a drain tank currently, and when he STILL goes assassin, then there's soemthing wrong here. Besides, if you're legitimately saying that Warwick is a good example of a Drain tank champion, you need to go see someone about that.\n\nDarius/Morde: A healing ability DOES NOT A TANK MAKE! Just because someone has a healing ability does not make them a tank based hero set up to drain the life from their foes and survive a long time in battle. Darius and Morde are BOTH bruisers who are designed with their current healing in mind so they can have more counter play, considering before hand they were OP as heck because their set ups made them either WIN or LOSE.\n\nHecarim: The Pony IS about control, cuz the entire Idea is for him to either set up a fight or to farm the jungle like no bloody tomorrow. He's also more about damage then being a tank because, as you pointed out, he's got a great deal more scaling. Which, as was pointed out before, a tank doesn't have.\n\nJust because a champion has a heal doesn't make them a DRAIN TANK. The Idea of a drain tank in the game as it currently stands is best fulfilled by TRUNDLE. He steals away the health of his enemies, as WELL as their stats, and becomes nigh unkillable because of it. Trundle is also a much more DEFENSIVE creature then Aatrox, which is why I suggested for Aatrox to be similar in this respect, since Aatrox's kit by it's very nature is more offensive. And even then, Trundle fits far better as a buriser then a tank because Trundle doesn't have the CC to protect others, where as Aatrox DOES.","replies":[{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-09-18T02:51:03.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"The act of \"drain-tank\" and a tank are very different concept","replies":[{"poster":"Pokeprof","date":"2015-09-18T05:39:37.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"And you've just proven that you won't listen to anything but your own ridiculous notions.

This continued into gameplay suggestions:\n\n##_Aatrox initiates, emboldens and his blade encourages teammate to keep fighting._\n\n* **All about the Blade:** Instead of Blood Well revive, Aatrox drops Darkin Blade for a teammate to use (buff). Depending that teammate's success with Aatrox's Darkin Blade buff, Aatrox's death timer reduces. (compensates removing Blood Well revive). When buff ends, the Darkin Blade drops from ally and dissolves.\n* **The unlikely Juggernaut:** Thorough suggestion to change him into a 'thin juggernaut'. Carefully kept within learned methods of gameplay to assure Aatrox mains. Converts Life-Steal & Spell Vamp. into one unit named 'Blood Lament' duct through some or all of his abilities.\n* **What were Darkin?:** Idea suggests Darkin weapons were tools among demon army formations in ancient times (imagine a Trebuchet poking out of a military formation). That ancient war ended (Kayle's background) but The Darkin Blade persisted and developed inklings of conscious (facial expression to Trynd). **So he's a _demonic_ weapon and not a being**, and so his murmuring could be expanded upon. He may not speak dialogue: he's a thing. In fiction, characters may still fail to understand Aatrox.

Depending that teammate's success with Aatrox's Darkin Blade buff, Aatrox's death timer reduces. (compensates removing Blood Well revive). When buff ends, the Darkin Blade drops from ally and dissolves.\n\nI love this. Even if it was never used on Aatrox, I greatly want something like this on another champion.\n\nAatrox is an avatar of war and violence, turning the tides of battle as he inspires an unparalleled bloodlust in his \"allies\". Even after he disappears back into the shadows of history, his mark is left on those he has \"helped\". I like the suggested concepts of moving him more toward a team-orientated Fighter, who pushes his team to fight harder; not for silly things like family, duty, or the protection of the innocent, but in anger and fury. \"Rage! Rage, against the dying of the light!\" A passive (or passive on his ult) that allows Aatrox to have a continuous effect on the battlefield or his on compatriots would fit this idea, I believe.\n\nPerhaps something like this: \"Aatrox fuels his allies lust for blood and violence, emboldening them to continue fighting forever-more. Whenever  Aatrox and an ally (or allies) contribute toward a kill together, those allies are given a stack of _Darkin Fury_. For each stack of _Darkin Fury_, said allies are given bonus (X). All stacks are lost from all allies if Aatrox is killed.\"\n\nAatrox is encouraged to fight alongside his teammates (as he was want to do in the tales of history), and leaves a lasting mark upon those he has fought with. Defeating the Avatar of Violence would obviously knock his allies down a peg morale-wise, and this is reflected in the counter-play of taking down Aatrox. This further encourages the Darkin to stick with his team.\n\nJust my two-cents of an idea, anyway :)\n\nAlso, unrelated to what I said above, but I have to agree with some that Tryndamere's absolute decimation of Aatrox in-game doesn't feel right :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YZYisX7mYr","date":"2015-09-30T13:12:53.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8T5QcndN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-17T06:47:45.318+0000)\n>\n> I'm with you that Aatrox has some issues, and that means he sometimes doesn't feel very satisfying to play, I don't personally feel it's because he's weak though.

He can't dive as well as Vi, true, but his split-push is much better than hers. His split-push isn't as good as Tryndamere, but his teamfight is much better.\n\nOne thing I think hurts him as a drain tank though, is that he's set up so that his spells cost _percent_ health while he returns only _flat_ health. This encourages building a small measure of AD+lifesteal on him, followed by a lot of raw defensive stats. So, Spirit Visage to synergize with his W, Thornmail vs AA-heavy champs, GA forever, and so on. A health-intensive build does not do well for him, since it boosts his spell costs but not his sustain or his revive pool. This limits his build paths. He's almost like Riven, except attack damage isn't giving him as reliable of a defensive measure as it does her (though, in exchange, he does get scaling magic damage...). This wasn't even that big a deal a year ago, but now? Now, you're incredibly likely to run into champs who deal true damage, which means that his only efficient build path can trap him into a situation where he can't win duels, which is supposed to be his thing.\n\nAnother big issue for me is that the typical Aatrox build relies heavily upon Blood Well being full to gain the AS bonus needed to stand and fight. This isn't unusual for champions with red-bar secondary resources. Tryndamere's main goal in lane is to fill his rage bar so he can win trades with the blessing of RNGesus after all. But the thing is, when Tryndamere cheats death, he fills that bar up. When Aatrox cheats death, he loses that extremely valuable attack speed, just when he needs it the most.\n\nThere are a few things that come to mind when thinking of Aatrox's core character:\n\n-He's meant to be an extremely powerful duelist.\n-He's a war leader who specializes in rallying a lost cause into a bloody victory.\n-His kit and attitude point towards standing and fighting where most people would run away.\n-He's a very calm and collected individual, possibly the _only champion in LoL_ who _never raises his voice._\n\nI think setting him up as an \"offensive offtank\" while giving him a sort of rallying power in teamfights would work best for him. Let's rattle something off here...\n\n**PASSIVE: Blood Well**\n_Damage dealt to Aatrox (including from himself) fills his Blood Well. Blood Well increases Aatrox's auto-attack range by 1 for each 2% filled. When Aatrox is dealt lethal damage, Blood Well restores a percentage of his health. This percentage is increased by 1% for each 1% of Blood Well absorbed. Upon revival, Aatrox gains a large boost to armor and magic resistance that decays quickly._\n\nPretty self-explanatory. Aatrox has a slight advantage in range when his Blood Well is completely filled, and it's a bonus that doesn't hurt nearly as much to lose at a crucial moment. His revive also scales with max health, opening up juggernaut build paths, and the defensive stat boost is purely so people can't insta-chunk him as soon as he comes back to life...because it ALWAYS sucks to have your passive be negated by that.\n\n**Q: Dark Flight **\n_Aatrox leaps into battle, damaging and slowing any enemies he hits upon landing. Dark Flight has a range of 650/725/800/875/950, but the farther you leap, the smaller his damage radius is. Dark Flight's cooldown is reduced by 60% if Aatrox deals damage to an enemy champion or an epic monster._\n\nNow Aatrox can jump around in fights and not need CDR so long as he's using it offensively.\n\n**W: Blood Price**\n_Passively increases all healing done to Aatrox by 1% for each 1% missing health. This bonus is doubled for lifesteal effects._\n\n_Active: Aatrox awakens his blade, ramping up his attack damage and selecting a large % of his health bar. For the next X seconds, his autoattacks ignore a percentage of armor and cleave the area around their target. Each time a target is damaged by this auto or cleave effect, they receive a stacking mark that increases Aatrox's damage to that target for each stack. Damage that Aatrox does during Blood Price reduces the selected section of his health bar. When Blood Price ends, Aatrox loses any health still marked by the Blade._\n\nI don't know how true this is, but I always felt like Aatrox's blade is alive, and maybe even partly or wholly responsible for him being who he is. I've often wondered if the blade is the actual Darkin, not Aatrox (it would be rather interesting to find out that Wukong is holding a benevolent Darkin, since his staff is definitely alive, given his death animation). Regardless, I think this change is fitting--Blood Price is very literal, because SOMEONE is going to pay it. Aatrox's goal is to make sure it's not him. The cleaving I put in there because with this setup, I haven't given Aatrox any natural sustain, and I wanted both to keep his preference for standing and fighting as opposed to running (by making it so that Aatrox can do a LOT of damage in a 1v2 jungler gank) and to emphasize that Aatrox is meant to be a team fighter. Meanwhile, the enemy team can punish him with heavy CC by making him eat his own Blood Price, thereby keeping one of his current weaknesses in a different form.\n\nThe passive is to let him keep that \"why don't you DIE\" thing he currently has in a lot of duels, which I feel is important to his identity.\n\n**E: Darkin Strike**\n_Aatrox launches a blast of energy in a direction from his hand, dealing damage to enemies hit before returning to Aatrox (deals no damage during return flight). When it returns to him, Aatrox's next attack is empowered, dealing magic damage in an area around him. This magic damage is increased for each enemy champion hit during the first part of the spell._\n\nMore emphasis on AoE damage, while keeping Aatrox's ability to scale a little bit of mixed damage, which I think is something important to keep. He's meant to be a dangerous duelist, and things like mixed damage from this spell and armor bypass from Blood Price actually make him dangerous.\n\n**R: Turn the Tide**\n_Aatrox raises his sword to rally his team, boosting the attack damage and ability power of all allies within range by a percentage. For X seconds, any kill made by Aatrox or an allied champion affected by Turn the Tide gives a global boost to allies, healing them for a flat amount and giving them a flat increase to movement speed until Turn the Tide ends. These kill bonuses are doubled for shutdowns. Turn the Tide ends early if Aatrox is killed._\n\nThis one is 100% lore-related. Aatrox does what he's supposed to do best, boost his team to win a fight. The actual damage boosts would only affect people relatively close to him, as they rally to his call for battle, but the healing and movespeed would be global, as his team's morale increases as they spill more and more blood, but of course, the blood has to be spilled by Aatrox or someone who rallied to him--anyone under the blade's influence.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAnd there you have my interpretation of a niche for Aatrox--a diving fighter who specializes in dangerous area-of-effect autoattacks, who absolutely cannot be ignored because his damage only multiplies for every champion in his range, and who can quite literally turn a losing teamfight around.\n\nGranted, I'm sure there are a ton of problems with it, but considering I came up with it on the fly, I expect that. This is just in hopes of inspiring someone :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"53436278DEL1","date":"2015-09-17T11:13:19.743+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8T5QcndN,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-17T06:47:45.318+0000)\n>\n> I'm with you that Aatrox has some issues, and that means he sometimes doesn't feel very satisfying to play, I don't personally feel it's because he's weak though.

That's like the complete opposite of what I'd expect.\nQ: Flawless\nW:  I guess rushing recklessly into battle to the point of hurting yourself to hurt as the enemy as much as possible is okay but frankly that ability stinks out loud in terms of being interesting.

Give Aatrox Grey Health.\nHow would grey health work on Aatrox and how does it make him fight more?\nInstead of that boring revive passive, drop that. As long as Aatrox has grey health left, he can fight. As in. He doesn't die. At all. As long as he is attacking he can keep going, even with his hp at 0. How to work this out?\nUpon taking dmg, he gets the grey health. Same functionality as Tahm. The difference is that he doesn't consume it to heal himself after a while. After not attacking for a while it just decays and is gone. If he attacks however he prevents it from decaying. If his grey health hits 0 he dies.\nHis abilities would be something like:\n> Passive: \n> Aatrox converts 100% of the dmg he takes into grey health. The grey health decays at 10%of it's maximum/second\n> As long as Aatrox has grey health he won't die.\n\n So if you had 1000 grey health max, it would decay at 100/s, even if you only took 200 dmg. This would also fix this really counterintuitive consuming of your Ragebar, effectlively making you even weaker upon reviving.\n> Q: Unchanged\n\n> W:  basically unchanged\n\n skirmishing Lifesteal, all-in Blood Price. If you already sit at 0 HP, might as well use bloodprice for that full on berserker mode\n\n> E: can only be cast if Aatrox has 50% or more Fury\n Aatrox deals magic damage to nearby enemy champions and fills Blood Well by 20% of its maximum value for each enemy hit.\nAdditionally he gains attack range and a short burst of movement speed\nIf Aatrox's hp falls to 0 this ability becomes permantently activate as long as he stays in combat\n\nBasically Aatrox's Ult. The difference would be that he doesn't get atk-speed but instead gains a small burst of movementspeed and ofc lower numbers except on the range.\nI think he needs a sticking tool in fights and a good one. This is part one with a ms boost. His current E, as fun as it looks is pretty bad, unreliable and simply cant be good because a free longranged aoe skillshot that isn't blocked by units can't be healthy when good.\n\n>R: Create a warzone\nCreates a big static area on the ground. While in that area Aatrox and his allies are inspired to fight while demoralizing his enemies. Aatrox gains increased attackspeed and movementspeed and his allies gain a reduced effect. Enemies in the zone are slowed by 10%.\n\nAlly effect debatable, but felt like it would fit into his lore, inspiring his \"allies\" to fight ferociously, overcoming stronger armies.\n\nThe basic idea is to put his lore into the way he plays and I think this kit catches it quite well?

Forget the bonus attack speed and AOE damage. Instead, nearby enemy champions are demoralized, reducing their attack speed and movement speed by 30%. During the same 5 seconds, nearby ally champions attack speeds are increased by 30%, and further away allies move with increased movement speed towards Aatrox's location. For 12 seconds, every attack activates his bonus life steal, and all life stolen beyond what his blood well can hold spills over and heals nearby champions.\n\nNow he will live up to his description in lore.

Don't really remember his lore, but he feels like he was destined to be some sort of life-steal tank or modeled after Illidan (from Warcraft).\n\nHe revolves around health and the thing about him that sticks out the most to me his is W which has life steal built in to it. Of course, you called him a dive-fighter. On the other hand, Aatrox lacks things commonly associated with tanks (namely cc). When he was first designed, I always felt Riot wanted Aatrox to be another melee-adc type like Yi/Tryndamere/Fiora. \n\nThematically, Aatrox's unique characteristics are really about lifesteal/blood/life. So why not just shift him to actually be more of a tank?\n\nI am thinking his R can actually be a form of an engage. Aatrox Q's in, pops his R and it gives him a substantial damage shield based on damage done. Think of like Evelyn ultimate crossed with a weaker Malphite ultimate (in terms of aoe, not knockup).  Not just a larger sword/autoattack range, but a bit more tankiness while he's in there.\n\nShift his W to be less reliant on pure attack damage and more reliant on having more health.\n\nI am thinking there is a unique space for this sort of character between Mundo (who is a regen tank) and Vladimir (who isn't really a tank, but focuses a lot on lifesteal).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dan Squared","date":"2015-09-17T08:16:30.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think perhaps instead of looking at what his gameplay already brings to the table, we should instead look at what was missed with his character concept.\n\nHis lore presented him as a legend known across Valoran in various forms, with different cultures remembering him differently.  He would appear and change the course of battle not only by joining in himself, but by rallying the losing fighters and spurning them into eventual bloodlust.  His quotes all glorify war and encourage others to take part in it.  Aatrox was all about war, and turning people in rage-o-holics, thinking battle was mankinds true nature\n\n\nI think rather than making him a diving fighter, what he could instead become is something of a fighter + team buff.\nI'm thinking maybe something akin to old-sion ult....something that really encourages the rest of the team to go all out, even at the expense of their own safety.\n\nRemove current W...but put some stupid lifesteal number on his ult.  This keeps his lane sustain gated somewhat as he could still be forced out pre-6 and while the ult is on CD, but when its up he has the option of turning into Leagues best drain tank, only temporarily of course. \n\nBut in addition, allies in the area get some kind of benefit and encourages them to attack....maybe attack in general, or maybe as long as they attack his target.  Not sure on the specifics but some options might include:\n-increased movement towards enemies\n-increased armor/magic pen\n-lifesteal/spellvamp\n-attack speed and CDR boost...which has the potential to break the current cap.  (example: ult provides 10% cdr, but an ally under the effect of the ult already has 40% cdr.   Aatrox ult would allow the affected champ 50% cdr for the duration of the buff)\n\nmaybe add a debuff to affected allies after the ult ends.  Meaning when he activates it he better be sure his team can clean up, otherwise they will be weakened when its over.  Also allows enemy counterplay, bait the Aatrox team ult, kite it out, then re-engage when it ends and the team is vulnerable.  Perhaps a short duration but sizable slow that can allow the enemy to easily pin down the backline","replies":[]}]}
