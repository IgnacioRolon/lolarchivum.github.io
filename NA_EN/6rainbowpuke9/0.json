Because from the given suspension i was given a list of my chat history of the recent games I&#039;ve played, and this i respect in every way i was wrong for saying those harsh things to my fellow team members. But it seems to me that the administrative players who reviewed my chat log did not take in consideration of what the other team members said to me. It is absolutely unjustified that those players who HAVE also conducted certain criteria of Verbal abuse, Feeding , negative attitude, and etc walkaway without any penalization like i am facing right now. Truth be told this is not my first offence, but based on my previous punishment of the same level (same reasons) i was given a lighter punishment (a chat ban). As a result, i would like to know how the banning system works in this system as well because it is very unreliable due its inconsistency (from what i have experienced). To conclude this description, this is more of about how this punishment was unfair due to the fact it did not consider the other party members of what they have done wrong and also the question about the inconsistency of the punishment system.\n\nMoreover, this is not me &quot;crying&quot; about my punishment as i am accepting it but the unbalanced toll of punishment is just too much without a right of question. 2 weeks of suspension is too harsh but i would like to proposed if its too much trouble that the community should kindly revoke this decision with another form of punishment such as suspending me from chatting or 10 to 20 low priority ques instead. However, if the proposal is rejected i am more than happy to accept the punishment without any insult taken.\n\nIt is also really insulting that i have been constantly given a really bad teammates that are usually feeding, verbally abusive , and has a negative attitude. I&#039;m in Silver 5 (laugh all you want) but is it possible that riot hates me ? and doesn&#039;t wanna give me decent players for once like for e.g. players who knows how play safe, ward , knows how to lane and not complain, and doesn&#039;t flame but lane instead of attacking people for their mistakes ( i&#039;m a jungler main and i usually get the blame for not ganking a losing lane because i would rather farm than give the enemy more gold)\nLike i get how the ELO system works but it doesn&#039;t make sense that the ques I&#039;ve been getting is all bad once. E.g after winning one game i will more likely lose the next game and probably win the next one after losing the other (this is solo que)  and the cycle continues. I know this may not relate to my ban at all but still there are so many good players out there that don&#039;t deserve to be in ELO hell. I&#039;ve been trying to get Gold ever since i started this game and that was roughly 4 years ago ! . I just can&#039;t seem to get out of Silver. ( this for the Gameplay pole but i&#039;m just putting it out there). If my KDA is just bad then ill just work on it and KS more lol. \n\nIf the advice for this is to create a new account then i rather just uninstall i have spent so much money on skins in this game. And all i have to do is to get a better rank is to create a new account and start all over again ? i rather not thank you, it seems to be a huge waste of time. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\nAdmins of League of Legends NA your compliance is appreciated as always \nThank you and sorry in advance for this description if it has offended anyone from your side of perspective. \nP.S : I&#039;ve recently purchased a $40 worth of RP and it kills me that I won&#039;t be using the 3 epic skins i recently purchased for 2 weeks :( \nNot that its important or anything lol. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n\nUPDATE: \n\nFound a comment from another forum with a similar case: \n\n\"Riot doesn't fucking care if you fucking swear.

I thought you had climbed the tiers to get to a 14 day suspension. Escalations are for gameplay related offenses (trolling or intentionally feeding), hate speech, racism, or encouragement of self harm. I don't see anything like that in your chat logs, so unless you did it in a pregame or post game lobby (which the IFS can see but can't send you automatically currently) then you should make a support ticket and see if your account was inaccurately escalated, which is very rare but has happened in the past.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=6RainbowPuke9,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EwAbqZ5p,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2018-03-31T12:53:26.181+0000)\n>\n> So you&#x27;re also telling me that i&#x27;m on the last tier of punishment ? if so \n> This is ridiculous really. Just because i called out someone for being stupid and useless they&#x27;re gonna ban me permanently\n\nGenerally someone at this tier of punishment has ignored warnings twice or has done something Riot has zero tolerance towards and Riot is trying to tell the person that if they can't immediately cease all toxicity and negativity then Riot is no longer interested in having them in their community.\n\n---\nAs for the update to your opening post, I would rather have one person flaming someone who muted them on my team than two people flaming each other.","replies":[{"poster":"6RainbowPuke9","date":"2018-03-31T14:58:43.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After 4 years of playing i'm pretty sure I've never been chat restricted for maximum amount 35 times..... yes it's not my first offence but like i said it does not add up at all.

I believe it counts both games played and timed passed weighing towards game played.\n\nBut yeah, like I said if your punishment was escalated and it wasn't supposed to be then support can lower the punishment.
