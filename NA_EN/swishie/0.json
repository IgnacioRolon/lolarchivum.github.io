I'm an illustrator on the Champions team.  First thank you for your kind words, and you ask a good question!\n\nIts pretty standard to use Adobe Photoshop - I use CC 2016, at home and at work, with a Wacom tablet.  I also think a program called PureRef is really helpful for organizing reference materials.  There are dozens if not hundreds of reference images for each splash - from pose and character model to materials and lighting.  Sometimes I like to sketch on my iPad with Autodesk Sketchbook Pro.\n\nWhen it comes to polishing, Photoshop is just too powerful to use anything else.  I think the 'magic' comes from studying things like film, movies and environments and replicating believable effects like depth of field, atmosphere, dust motes, vfx, etc.  It's not dissimilar to photo processing in Photoshop.  Check out some youtube videos about really cool things like the color lookup and selective color tools.\n\nHope that helps! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Magicks","date":"2018-01-11T23:30:29.309+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI just wanted to let you know you are my favorite Riot artist [(This is you, right?)](https://www.artstation.com/jessibean).

The things you think about as an artist like color palettes and forms and compositions will translate as you get more familiar with any of your tools.  It does take a little bit to get comfortable with a digital art program, but I don't think its that bad.  Plus, tutorial videos are the best!  You can find one for anything...\n\nThank you so much! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Elohaven","date":"2018-01-12T13:33:08.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, how did you learn to draw like this?!\n\nYour art style is my dream.

It comes as no surprise, they all looked really good, high quality, detailed, colorful, vibrant, good color selections. I specially enjoyed Masquerade Evelynn shades and details on her clothing, very appealling and her pose totally catching her personality, lore.\n\nAlso the <3 on her hip in her basic defualt splash art, her Thiccc lips, her eye line of sigh (orientation) I mean, where she is looking towards to, it all seems to come together so well.\n\nAnd on MF, all too seem so good but I want to talk about the Waterloo skin because I like that skin a lot and I liked its former art too and this new one ilooks soooo good too, she is clearly \"under the spotlight\" and we have a focus on her and she has also the most colors, these many planes of which we focus and objects and her gun and arm feel closer to us, it feels satisfying to look at. \nCowgirls perspective/viewpoint is very nice and reminds me of Leopard Nidalee spash which is one I also like, Xmas MF's hair looks wild and I like the poros and what seems to be a volibear plushie in the back, Secret Agents overwhelming shiny Dress catching the glimpse of a female fatale, road warrior MF's booty (I'm am ass man), again the detail on her and blurrier motorbike feels so good and leads the focus to her which is what is being promoted, the and last but not least the Rain on Mafia MF, her badass pose and the rats being extorted/robbed in the background (rats which I suppose that could be Twtich's partners of the same gang as him, as he also has a Mafiaskin, so it could be a nod to the an universe with both Mafia MF and Mafia Twitch)\n\nThat was the very short text about what I liked about some of the splashes, having started with the ones I liked the most for each champ: masquerade eve and Waterloo MF. That followed by a couple of comments on what are my first thoughts and what does draw my attention on the other newer splashes\n\nGood work and may you be responsible for more splashes to come!\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \n\nPS: my gramar sucks but perhaps I could make my poin accross","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2018-01-11T23:07:33.478+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/yEQErlEE-what-software-does-riot-use-to-make-splasharts\n\nI also commented on this with some advice, lol.
