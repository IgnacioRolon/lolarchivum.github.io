Once his ult locks onto a target he'll go through anything, walls or terrain, until he hits that target he locked onto.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mokuto Bunshi","date":"2017-07-05T09:13:11.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"liked!

What is sounds like is that kled locked onto whatever champion and although Yorick used his wall as long as kled locked onto that champion he will follow them until he collides with them. So Kled this means that kled can go through any terrain as long as that lock on is present.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silly Neeko","date":"2017-06-06T17:15:38.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did he actually run through it?
