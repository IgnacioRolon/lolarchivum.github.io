The difference is that Evelyn \"forces\" you to buy pink wards. This makes it easier for her to keep hiding because you're limited in vision tools, but that's the point of her passive.\n\nIf people can guess a lee/rek sai/graggy's position without ever seeing them, they can track evelyn too. \n\nAnd that's just evelyn, shaco should never be invis in jungle when there's noone around neither should Rengar or twitch.\n\n\n> A big part of the problem of stealth is that the champions who have it all happen to be assassins.\nThey always hurt, there damage is in burst, and they scale off snowballing.\n These champs also always seem to have lower counterplay kits full of targeted abilities and low cd's\n\nStealth naturally \"attracts\" assassins. Thematically it's an assassin/thief/scout/hunter type of ability. \n\n{{champion:107}} is a hunter who strikes with precision (afaik) + being an AA range buff seems to me like a much easier way to keep it bug free/functional.\n\n{{champion:29}} As an ADC/Assassin hybrid twitch is a bit special, his burst isn't as hard as something like syndra/lux but he has a small window where he's somewhere between DPS and Burst (you know the \"Burst DPS\" bs people are talking about) but unless he's Fed as Fuck and built like an assassin he's not gonna oneshot you.\nThe only way i actually wipe people in about 1 sec is when i'm fed and built {{item:3147}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} but then i'm building assassin/single target and While my stealth is a reset escape it's not as good as classic assassins.\n\n{{champion:28}} i barely know her kit. but she's pretty much just the \"infiltrator\" archtype.\n\n{{champion:91}} only has 2 seconds and is the \"assassin\" archtype of this game.\n\n{{champion:121}} {{champion:67}} have in combat invisibilty which imo is alot worse to deal with. As adc/AA based champs i'll often find myself clicking on them when they roll/stealth making me walk into them instead of AAing. other than that they can't leave a certain range before reappearing\n\n{{champion:35}} Probably the best stealth in the game. It's got decent duration locked behind lvls, has a blink attached to it AND is actual invisibility. **BUT**It's both his engage and escape tool, if you can't kill your target you'll most likely die. \n\n{{champion:17}} The most balanced one i guess, it's incredibly strong but also incredibly gated. Honestly it functions just like twitch's. Personally i play APAS with runaans and thus have a reasonable burst with AA Q AA. Some people play him as an ap assassin and will oneshot you from stealth but lose alot of dps.\n\nImagine a tank appearing out of nowhere and then not doing any damage. What's the point? **In general** it's only usefull on dmg classes. Stealth being a surprise tool you need some form of enhanced dmg at reveal.\n\n\n\n># **TLDR**\nIt's a strong addition to your kit but it does have counterplay.\nStealth favours Damage classes, especially mobile Burst classes. Thematically it's also better suited for these kind of characters.","replies":[{"poster":"Squey","date":"2017-08-22T22:22:47.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thematically better and balance wise better are going to be different in a pvp game though.

There is less cc follow up but even if you get away, the damage is done.  \n\nI cant say i agree with everything you said but alot of it is true.

When these champions are fed, there's basically no point in time where their targets can be at all expected to react to them, so dying to them feels completely out of the player's control. In order for these champions to keep their stealth, they _need_ to have their damage gated so hard that it's impossible for them to apply burst levels of damage for at least a second, if not more.
