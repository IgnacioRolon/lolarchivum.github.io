I want those champs to get skins more than anything. That was just my comical response to Riot being able to milk Jhin's popularity for money.\nBut to be honest, if they give him another skin before one of the above champions, I'm not buying it. I may be a very loyal Jhin main, but I play Taliyah and A.Sol a lot as well. I want other champions to succeed as much as Jhin did last year.\n\nMore people would probably play the above champions if they had more skins. They're extremely fun to play, but no one wants to play a champion with little to no customization options. You either have the release skin or don't, and that's not very appealing to people who like variety in their champion's looks and want each game with them to be different. It also doesn't help that some of them, like Taliyah, don't go on rotation very often, and Jhin is every other week.\nIf I were any good at art I'd totally be an artist for Riot so I can work on skins for those 5 champions.
