I agree that Kindred doesn't feel the best, and for several of the reasons you mentioned, though I don't think it's their itemization that's the issue.\n\nI may not be the biggest expert on Kindred, but from what I've seen their biggest problem right now is that they feel high-risk yet low-reward. Getting marks on enemy champions or in the enemy jungle can be very difficult, and is so heavily telegraphed that it's easy for an organized team to predict their movements and kill them. Getting help from teammates saps influence from the lanes, which is currently not an option at a time when leaving lane for even a short while can risk having the opposing laner deal massive damage to their tower. It's very easy to shut Kindred down, and even if they do manage to successfully get enough stacks, there are many more marksmen out there who can scale harder and more reliably.\n\nI also think a large part of the current issue with Kindred is that they simply do not fit at all well in the current jungling meta: right now, we're back to an early-heavy, gank-heavy meta where the most successful junglers are those who can abandon farming for the entire laning phase, and gank lanes non-stop in order to get the snowball rolling. Kindred, by contrast, can't afford to do that, and in fact needs the assistance of their laners in order to not fall behind. They do gain some decent bonuses from their stacks, but that currently pales in comparison to the stat advantages laners can get if they snowball early on, particularly in bot lane. Because of this, buffing Kindred may not in fact be the most efficient solution, because once the meta eventually shifts and leaves more room for junglers who can take the time to make themselves scale, they're likely going to end up becoming far too dominant.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2017-12-25T21:54:10.219+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"The issue is that crit items that are needed like IE are still expensive on a jungler since they need multiple parts to come online.

Its not that much about the itemisation. Kindred is not the only jungler that uses marksman build. For example Graves also uses marksman items yet he does not have any problem and is better than Kindred in almost everything. Assassins also use similar builds as marksmans, Kha, Rengar, glass Nocturne, yet they are all better than Kindred.\n\nThe major problem with Kindred is their weak early game in combination with their passive  that forces them to be agressive early game. Also, getting marks is not anything speciall as well, you aint gonna notice any major ramp in power untill you reach 6+ stacks. Kindred's first 4-6 stacks are just a simple QOL and 4 stacks kindred should actually be Kindred without stacks imo. \n\nWhen you play against Kindred you should feel the same tilt as you feel when playing against Shaco, you should feel countered as you are playing jungle against gardcore counterjungler you.....you can easily counterjungle Kindred without any fear. \n\nEven as a hardcore jungler I still hate Shaco, when I see him I know that my jungle is gonna be in the mess unless I WORK HARD TO COUNTERPLAY AND PREDICT UNPREDICTABLE SHACO while Kindred is so damn predictable.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaìju","date":"2017-12-27T19:07:53.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Define marksmen build?

In this respect, making Kindred more dependent on crit, rather than on-hit damage, as was previously the case (which also allowed them a smoother transition through Bloodrazor) definitely made their power progression much more awkward. I also agree that Kindred's jungle bounties aren't implemented in the best way, because contrary to Riot's thoughts on RNG, in practice they often end up having their mark linger on camps that either cannot be reasonably captured, or have already been taken long before they had a chance to take it.\n\nTo some larger extent, I think there is also a fundamental contradiction in Kindred in that their innate is all about making them scale, yet they were designed from the ground up to be this very early game-focused marksman, with tremendous kiting power and even sustain to let them clear and gank properly. Right now, they're in this middling state where they're not really dominant enough early to compete with hyper-gankers, but don't scale well enough into the late game either to justify picking them over a tank or most other marksmen. I think Riot may end up being forced to have to pick a direction and make them either an early game bully, in which case they should have another passive, or a carry, in which case their kiting power should likely be made to scale over game length as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZapMyHeart","date":"2017-12-26T09:09:28.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teridax68,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Rr5Ec257,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-25T14:39:20.429+0000)\n> \n> I also think a large part of the current issue with Kindred is that they simply do not fit at all well in the current jungling meta: right now, we&#x27;re back to an early-heavy, gank-heavy meta where the most successful junglers are those who can abandon farming for the entire laning phase, and gank lanes non-stop in order to get the snowball rolling.

Kindred is not considered a top-tier farming-type jungler (e.g Shyvana, Ivern) that would suddenly explode in popularity if the meta shifts to farming jungle instead. She just happens to be forced to stay in the jungle because it's easier to get marks that way + she needs a lot of farm in order to not fall behind. Her marks are a hinderance because it has a lot of power tied to it that it forces the rest of her kit to be sub-par. On top of that, it's extremely restrictive to acquire said marks. \n\nUnlike other feast-or-famine type champions, her famine is extremely god awful and you might as well stay in the fountain because once you are behind, you won't be coming back ever. When feasting, you are still barely ahead of a champion who only have 1 or 2 kills under their belt. The reason is because Kindred's kit doesn't reward your good plays; only making you somewhat playable. \n\nMain issue with Kindred is that she can't farm marks easily enough. Jungle marks are alright, but champion marks are disgustingly difficult to obtain. The CD to activate is way too high (makes Eve's W look quaint in comparison) and the downtime to remark is just pathetically long; might as well not gank because if you mark someone wrong, you're shit out of luck for the next couple of minutes. Even if you play well, you can't remark the same enemy champion to camp them out because hurr durr needs counterplay (meanwhile, the enemy jungler can camp a lane all day long and gain a huge benefit out of that). Kindred is the only champion in the game that dissuades camping.\n\nIf Kindred doesn't get her 4 Marks ASAP, she's useless. When she gets her 4 marks, she's still behind.

Let me give you one tip. When you play against her just do your 1st buff and 1 small camp than go ASAP for that 1st scuttle crab mark before Kindred finishes their 2nd buff and than go do your own 2nd buff.

Lamb (the player) chooses what jungle camps to mark, while Wolf (RNG) Marks the champions?\nThis, I'd think would work out much better- Lamb marking means no more LOL RNG paths where Kindred ends up having to go from top Raptors to bottom Krugs back to right-side Wolves before heading to Left-side Gromp when Faker is sitting mid with Zoe, and Wolf means instead of being telegraphed 'hey I'm coming to gank you!' it might be more 'hey I might gank you ooor maybe your top lane is overextended and I'll go grab him because I'm closeby.'\nGranted, there still can be badtimes where Wolf asks you to gank a enemy Renekton when your lanes is GP, but now the onus for dealing with marks hopefully is more on the laner since it's less likely that Kindred will have planned to go for them as opposed to being a bonus objective.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2017-12-26T07:36:08.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're cheap, but come on.

Kindred is really weak without marks even after the rework and getting marks is hard even tho I always manage to get up to 6+ stacks. I will list some problems with Kindred as I have a lot of experience on that champion.\n\n1. Their early game is weak for the amount of risk they have to take in order to properly execute early game. Coubterjungling wast majority of junglers is a suicide for Kindred as they are simply stronger.\n\n2. Getting marks on champion kills and assists is fine and satisfying, but farming marks on camps forces you to abandon an open gank on a lane. You cant blame Kindred as marks are still so important for them. You can skip 2-3 marks at max.\n\n3. Her base stats are complete garbage and they easily fall behind after a slight misstake and theres close to no comeback. \n\n4. Eadily countered if enemy jungler knows how to play and it doesnt matter if you are good or bad on Kindred. When I play against Kindred I always do my 1st buff and predict their first scuttle, take it berore they reach it and than do my 2nd buff. Can you imagine Kindred seing that their 1st mark....yea 1st mark next to their 2nd buff is GONE before they killed that 2nd buff? Its devastating. \n\nHow to fix Kindred and make them jungler that is rewarding to play? I have 3 solutions. \n\n1st one: Give them 20-30 seconds lead on the camp marks. I dont care if enemies can see their camps marked but Kindred should be able to see it before anyone else. Its already risky to go for that enemy kruggs or gromp, let Kindred see it 30 seconds before anyone else so they can plan it, gank or a mark. It could also encourage enemy junglers to ward their camps often which offers good counterplay. \n\n2nd solution: remove kindreds passive on enemy camps and neutral monsters such are Herald, Dragon and Baron, as a compensation, buff their base stats and slightly increase range on their Q. As for champion marks, leave them as they are, they are fine and its just 5 anyways, you aint gonna get all 5. \n\n3rd solution: Same as 2nd, remove camp marks, compensate Kindred the same way as in 2nd solution but when it comes to kill/assist marks, give them something unique, similar to Kaynes passive. If Kindred gets 4-5 marks on kills or assists on melee champions Lamb abilities (Q) get increased range and her R should in that case give bonus MS to all her allies inside of it as well as Kindred, but if Kindred gets most of their marks against ranged champions, her W and E get something special, like root, fear or something that could help them hunt ranged champions. That also perfectly fits Kindreds theme as Eternal hunters and junglers. \n\nLong storry short, passive is what makes Kindred hard to balance, the rest of their kit os fine as it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thunderneedle","date":"2017-12-26T12:40:47.777+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good thing marksmen items are ridiculously underpriced","replies":[{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2017-12-26T16:59:22.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still not for a jungler.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-12-26T05:10:52.586+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main issue with Kindred and the issue that they've had since release is that there's no reason to pick them outside of just liking their theme or when they're overpowered.
