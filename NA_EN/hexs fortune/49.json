But not the early game part.\n\n the early and mid game times are when assassins are the best, they have to snowball to get a good mid game and a not that shitty late game. In the early game all of the tanks and juggernauts haven’t built a lot of resistances yet. The tank and juggernauts weakest states are usually the early game, at this point the tanks don’t have enough resistances and health to easily survive in all-in’s and juggernauts, on top of the low amount of resistances and health, don’t have their damage items to reliably fight. \nAssassins are supposed to take advantage of this time to snowball and get a lead on their lane opponents, no matter if the enemy laner is a tank, squishy, or juggernaut. The assassin is supposed to use their early game-mid game power and powerspike points to get try and get ahead to win the game. If the assassin can’t do this then he has failed and his/her team will most likely lose.\n\nBy nerfing the assassins early game damage (in general or just against tanks/juggernauts) you would unbalance the game and make assassins even more shit. Then assassins would be so bad that juggernauts would again see a ton of play in mid where they can dominate against assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-12-13T16:18:54.278+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"So how do you plan to nerf just the assassin damage to them then?","replies":[{"poster":"LTK KoRo","date":"2018-12-13T16:23:31.553+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"By removing duskblade and halving electrocute damage-Boards, probably","replies":[{"poster":"22 Caliber Rifle","date":"2018-12-13T16:26:23.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Duskblade is both a unique and main item for most assassins.
