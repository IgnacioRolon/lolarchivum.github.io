It may not help you too much mechanically, but mechanics are a practice thing and watching a replay isn't for that anyway: but it will absolutely help your game sense. After so many replays you can pick up on the general timings of the game and heroes involved, you can start noticing patterns to let you attempt to predict general movement even when the enemy isn't visible on a ward, and that is a very powerful thing to pick up on.
