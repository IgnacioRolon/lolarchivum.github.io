I feel the same. Duskblade stays the same all game, while IE/crit gets better each item. The crit user will see more gains later in the game as the items synergize. \n\nRight now it seems that game times are fairly short, and there arent as many tanks as there are some hierarchy damage dealers. This also favors burst (storm/dusk) over crit builds. \n\nIf you're set on crit, try stormrazor into zeal items perhaps, then ie third?
