It had it&#039;s moments but i&#039;m over it.\n\nStarcraft 2- Wings of Liberty was awesome....I couldn&#039;t be bothered with the other two expansions as the story grew more predictable...maybe i'll see them through one day\n\nIt's interesting how both players and devs have migrated from Blizzard to Riot over the years","replies":[]}
