I'm not on the League balance team or anything, nor do I have influence over any gameplay decisions on the MOBA.  I chill here - talking to fellow lore-heads about lore stuff.  Mostly maps, but sometimes other things.  It wouldn't be my place, nor would I be at all informed enough to answer the threads you're probably referring to.

I greatly value and appreciate the fact that I can have a discussion with another member of the community (laughing fish) and quickly go to the appropriate board and have a Rioter provide some insight on the matter. Stuff like this always makes me feel the community is coming together.\n\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lordk0z","date":"2018-10-01T05:08:44.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to poke at you randomly here, but has there ever been thoughts of creating a \"Noxian Immigrant\" of sorts?
