Ranked shouldnt be influenced by quests like that, and I dont even play ranked.\n\nWe already have two similar systems that could already be affecting Ranked play by a small extent: Champion Mastery and Hextech Crafting.\nIn Champion Mastery, players might not want to play already mastered Champions or Champions that they already have all the Mastery Tokens for  for the current level because they want to progress in Mastery. This could cause players to play Champions they're worse at.\nWith Hextech Crafting, players might simply want to not play Champions they already got Hextech Chests on if they have a Hextech Chest available. EDIT: Additionally, they might try to do weird stuff like farm a ton or play Champions in off-roles to get S ranks.\n\nI'm curious, do you support these systems as well?","replies":[{"poster":"FutureCreator","date":"2017-05-21T16:10:07.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The two systems are not similar enough.

I can&#x27;t say so much about those champion-cenetered missions.\n\nIt broadens your gameplay experience overall, but for the duration of the ranked match, you will be playing on a Champion you have less experience on. How much less experience - that is up to the player. Some player might his fourth best Champion, and another might play a mastery 1 Champion to get Mastery or a Hextech Chest. I know it's unlikely, I'm just saying that because the system exists, there is encouragement (however minor it may be) to play for alternative rewards instead of for the win.\nIt most certainly could affect ranked. You're assuming that players are going to play their better Champions, which will be the case most of the time, but because of the system, they have something that could be pushing them off the goal of winning. A player could go first time Azir in Ranked because she thought he was a counterpick to the enemy laner, or she could go first time Azir in Ranked because she wanted a Chest on Azir. You see?\n\nLastly, you did not address my point about Grades and Hextech Chests. Grades _generally_ align with winning actions, but sometimes players do stuff that is counterproductive to winning because they want a high grade. They'll farm side lanes and not group, they'll steal kills, they'll ward in inopportune areas, they'll never take risks to avoid dying, and more. Whatever it is they're doing, they're focusing on doing _that_ and not on focusing on doing what is right for the team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2017-05-21T17:31:11.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait a second.\n10 kills/assists doesn't sound like much.

Many ranked players dont play normals anymore because its a less serious environment to them, if missions were only normal, then u force ranked players to play normal for rewards, or they ignore it.
