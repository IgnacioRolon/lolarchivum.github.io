You can use your silence to stop any ability reliant champs to use their spells to kill your back line. And even better if the assassin is the villain you can ult them after q to basically 2 shot them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Okamikazi","date":"2018-06-22T18:06:49.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen and Mundo are bros now. yay.
