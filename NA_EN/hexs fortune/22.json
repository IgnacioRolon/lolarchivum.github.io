This works by both isolating the threat from your team, and countering their AD damage, while scaling well yourself. For example Rammus. Your E+W combo is excellent at stopping AD heavy carries, with a few exceptions, and it allows the squishier damage dealers on your team a chance to do their jobs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-24T19:23:21.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks with good peel who are good at sticking near squishy dps units. {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:111}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2017-01-24T19:19:30.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't let him get fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aptest","date":"2017-01-24T19:37:04.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

I would start by warding your flank, and putting down a control ward during a team fight. I would also try to stay with your carry if you're support, or if you're a carry head towards your support.
