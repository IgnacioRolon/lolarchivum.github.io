Her eyes reflect that same vicious look she wore when making her move against Gangplank.\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k_0wtieGBf4/Va2naRUZf9I/AAAAAAAAt6U/oe9SghPy21g/s1600/cs_bg_champions%2B%25281%2529.png\n\nI pondered why Riot is going backwards in regards to MF&#039;s timeline and eventually Riot Scathlocke&#039;s comments came to mind.\n\nRiot Scathlocke made the point that this event was _all about Pyke_ and not necessarily Bilgewater. \n\nPyke may be an unreliable narrator, but in the audio drama Lars did add validity to Pyke&#039;s story of being betrayed by his captain and left to die.\n\nPyke&#039;s tragedy is mirrored through MF&#039;s killing of an innocent and his &quot;Gangplank affiliated&quot; brother. One brother was drowned into the sea paralleling Pyke&#039;s doom, while the other brother was left to rot on the pier unburied, suggestive of Pyke&#039;s undead fate.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/GlW6CYq\n\nThe artist goes through great lengths to almost cast MF as the villain in certain frames. Without any prior knowledge she would seem positioned as the antagonist, being centered on the right side of the frame and driving the action.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/qM69LNO\n\nSome folks asked why Riot would give more Miss Fortune lore as opposed to other Bilgewater legends. Pyke&#039;s dialogue &quot;No more Captains&quot; highlights his current focus on that class of Bilgewater above all else.\n\nOf the two major lore Captains, Miss Fortune is typically expressed as the sympathetic character, thus featuring her at her worst holds more weight. Brothers are being murdered over a quarrel between Captains and our heroine is holding the smoking gun. \n\nMy theory is that the purpose of this story is to unapologetically display some justification for Pyke&#039;s rationale \"No more Captains\".\n\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-champion-reveal-pyke-bloodharbor-ripper/en_US/04b473e458b975a3ca9569ae93715245406fee65/assets/img/content/wallpaper/base-splash.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-06-04T03:24:01.675+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, Miss Fortune's color story, [Down Among the Dead Men](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/story/missfortune-color-story/), isn't new - only the illustrations are newly added.
