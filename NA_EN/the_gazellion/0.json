The mastery change made her lose tankiness and offensive stats so she's pretty balanced atm.

Marksmen are significantly stronger now, and deal almost as much burst damage as she does from longer range. This makes her niche somewhat difficult, especially as the resolve tree allows passive damage soaking from everyone peeling just from standing nearby.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-11-17T04:40:51.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top Lane is basically a tier list right now.

A champions win rate, while it does provide some insight, does not provide the full picture of her ability to perform. Having said that I am sure I have not faced the best Fiora players so far, but what I do know is I have faced many of them who were competent enough to give our team a good butt wooping both in lane and, obviously then, in the team fights.","replies":[]}]}
