My ult was first to show issue then my Q. Neither keyboard or mouse function could get them to set off.","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Theater","date":"2014-11-01T06:15:02.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me on Hexakill just now, but only my R.  Right before the end of the game, it wouldn't let me cast my ult.  I tried clicking, too.  It didn't appear to be on cooldown.  My W still worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alkyan","date":"2014-11-01T05:49:54.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me multiple times now.  Most frequently Q quits working, just completely.  I have also had R stop on one occasion.  Quitting the game and reconnecting fixes it temporarily, but just tonight I ended up quitting 3 separate times because my Q kept quitting on me.  My observation in the game tonight, it seems like it happens if you get stunned at that right time during charge up of Q.  I have no idea how R gets f'd up though.  \n\nPlease fix this Riot, it's hard to play with 1/2 your abilities!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Land Baron","date":"2014-11-01T01:22:25.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me.  Was in a Hexakill game and all worked fine until I hit level 6.  Once I hit 6, Q stopped working although I could still type the letter q in chat.  I never got to use my ult (r) at all.  It had the same issue.  I thought it might be tied to a item.  I had boots of swiftness, Black cleaver, and I think armor.  Super annoying.","replies":[]}]}
