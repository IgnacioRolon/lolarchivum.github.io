Her winrate in other game modes is fine, handing around 50%, but in ARAM is 69-70% now! A champ with that win rates means the Sena has have utterly horrendous teammates or an afk, possibly both. Please cut her soul gathing in half at least, she shouldnt get double souls in ARAM like Nasus or others. Nasus has to put his neck on the line get his stacks, and fight both teams, she doesnt have to do ether.

She gains stacks constantly in a mode that's basically teamfighting nonstop in a single lane, so she gets all mist sources covered. 2 attacks on a single champion gives her a stack, plus killing/assisting that target gives an additional stack, now like I said, convert that into constantly attacking 5 enemy champs. Additionally, missing minions have a higher chance to drop mist stacks, and cannons drop them 100%, so she never misses those as the game is a single lane of minions. And on top of that, the stacks are doubled because stack gains in aram are buffed.\nIt was the exact same problem as the old Dark Harvest stacking way too fast from constant enemy + ally deaths and enemy + ally cannon minions. DH got hotfixed, and they already mentioned Senna is getting the same treatment in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Boomer","date":"2019-11-19T11:00:48.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also agreed that changing her stack mechanic would help, though I didn't know how much.

It might, but I'll have to see it to believe it.

Any target who's immobile and squishy. You just engage on them, they die. Rinse and repeat. In bot lane, grab a Leona or Alistar. Every time you come into lane after 3, if they're not under the turret, dive her. It's the same method you do when going against a Sona or Zyra. Don't let them poke you down. Get to lane and immediately kill them, push under tower, go B. Come back, jump them, push, B. Kill, push, B. Kill, push, B. This has been how you deal with supports without insta-stuns for ages. Sonas and Zyras know the bane that is a Leona or Ali who can W+Q combo. If they're within range to AA you, they're within your engage range. Leona E range is 875, far exceeding even the highest of AA ranges. Ali's W is 650, which outranges Senna for 40 stacks of mists. They go to poke, you immediately engage. They die, you win.
