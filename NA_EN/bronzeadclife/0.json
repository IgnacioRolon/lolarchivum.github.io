I have another question now people say its because of hidden mmr and all that stuff which i was like well okay then cool but i literally have a 30% wr atm and i lose 8lp per loss gain about 35-40 lp per win. Normal games wr as a whole is sitting at like 40%. so how is the mmr calculated atm in terms of the que system. this is out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nBefore you all saying that I am inting and throwing games or something like that (to those who hunt down stats). No. No i am not im a top main that got tired of top and found out tanks have easier matchups in mid so i decided to move to mid and this is me learning.","replies":[{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2019-08-13T05:44:06.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New champion. As far as I can tell based on just recently getting lvl 30 on EUW, you start around gold 4 MMR in placements. While getting 10/10 wins wont get you in gold, 10/10 losses also won't get you into bronze. You may get placed there, but your true MMR is still going up/down at the same rate, so imagine your main being gold and losing 10 in a row. You're still what maybe Silver 1 at that point? That's also why the MMR gain vs loss is so skewed. It hasn't normalized yet.\n\nIn short, Riot is super super forgiving to new players, rather they land higher than lower and work their way there. It also makes them feel better about losing less and gaining more LP. Basically softens the \"yeah, no, you actually suck\" blow so to speak. Also offsets potentially getting placed too low off bad luck.\n\nThe other side of the coin is players at high Silver trying to break into Gold get super inconsistent gameplay, but I think Riot sees that as part of the challenge that you have to break through for the rewards for gold. By the time your MMR is legit gold you start seeing more consistency, and if you're good, things start getting easier before they get harder.\n\nOn EUW I landed in Silver 4 after my 10 placements and by the time I got to promos it instantly placed me in Silver 2 for an example of just how skewed the starting MMR vs starting rank is. I was like \"okay next game is promos to S3\" and at the end of the game it was just like \"grats on silver 2 homie\" \n\nI'd imagine if I win 100% to S1 it'll skip promos as well, but I think it'll force me through gold promos regardless cause gold rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"reprot","date":"2019-08-13T07:34:32.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive had the same experience and observations. But honestly i think the default MMR for new players is entirely wrong. Unranked players tend to divide itself in extreme measure from the standard Gold 4 MMR. Its extremely rare that a genuine new player is able to compete in this elo. Usually genuine unranked players will singel handedly loose games for their team as a result of playing in an elo far superior to their capability. \n\nThe system need to be reworked!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Like Teemo","date":"2019-08-13T05:51:06.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If i remember correctly its impossible to fall any lower then iron 1 and even then once you are in iron you can only go up in rank","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-13T04:34:47.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty easy.
