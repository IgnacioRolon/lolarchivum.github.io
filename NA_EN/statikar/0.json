This problem shows up more often when minions are around, and only when I have my game window settings to Full screen and Border less. The issue does not exist when on Windowed mode.

I've tried: locking and unlocking frames, smooth camera option, tinkering with pretty much every graphical setting, reinstalling the game, and updating my video card drivers. I didn't change anything about my settings to cause the issue a few days ago, as the game has always run flawlessly for me on very high settings capped at 60FPS.\r\n\r\nHas anyone noticed this issue recently?

Let me know how that guide works out for you.  The steps includes steps in case your game files might have become corrupt too, since the issue seems to be exclusive to League.

Did registry cleanups, repaired LoL client and everything to possibly fix corrupt files. Unfortunately, nothing seems to solve the issue. I even put the game onto lowest possible settings, shadows off, and tried everything that way too.. Still having the problem. The in game FPS counter shows that 60FPS is constant even while the stuttering is present, so there must be something else going on.  \n\nAs mentioned before, the only apparent fix I've found so far is to play in Windowed mode. Unfortunately, there is a white band on the top that shifts the HUD and UI downwards, and is quite annoying.\n\nI have always played this game with \"very high\" maxed out settings, and locked at 60FPS, since there is no need for 250+ frames. It's been smooth and problem free for three years. It's just the last few days since 7.3 that this has been an issue. \n\nHopefully this helps explain some more of the issue at hand!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-11T17:07:38.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this detailed info, though it sucks the issue hasn't been resolved.

Micro-stuttering in game but things like Plays.TV were stuttering in a big way post 7.3. I play at 144hz gsync on with vertical sync turned on in-game. I have a 6700k, gtx 1070, 32gb RAM, 512gb NVME ssd set up with a 144hz 1440p gsync monitor (asus pg279q). I turned off g-sync and that solved it, but why would it work pre-7.2?\n\nUnrelated note: I'm considering just leaving gsync off for league, turning up my monitor refresh rate to 165hz (my monitor's max setting) and capping frame rate at 144hz in game settings... would this give me good results?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sold Your Girl","date":"2017-02-13T02:46:29.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having exact the same problem.
