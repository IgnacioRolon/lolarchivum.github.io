It's probably not all that funny to most people, but the intention of calling sy out for assaulting their readers with that kind of writing should be clear. My best hypothesis is that the downvoters don't know how to use punctuation either, so they feel it's a personal attack against them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2018-11-27T14:10:57.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"...really?
