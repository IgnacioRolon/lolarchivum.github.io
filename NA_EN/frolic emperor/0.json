When you say you can't open the launcher, are you able to sign in and the client never loads? Or is this an issue where you can't even get the patcher to launch?\n\nI'll be able to give better context once I know when the game stops working exactly.","replies":[{"poster":"Frolic Emperor","date":"2017-03-21T00:10:11.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry it took me so long to respond, been busy with school.

When you launch a program, your pc needs to have certain permissions in place to allow the program to load. If it doesn't, the program may disappear without even giving you an error. Go through our [Permission Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to make sure this isn't the case.\n\nLet me know if this helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
