We get 30g bonus for last hitting a large jungle monster.  This includes the scuttle crab\n2. The small camps are on a 1:40s cooldown.  Yes, 100 seconds.  There is no way you take my raptors midgame and I don't go by wanting them before they respawn.\n3. Let us last hit the scuttle crab if it's uncontested.  Again 30g difference between you last hitting it and your jungler last hitting it.\n4. AoE junglers clear raptors and wolves better.  Sorry midlaners, we need these.  Gromp and krugs are much harder for us to take.\n5. Single target junglers take krugs and gromp easier.  Less of an issue, but keep it in mind.\n6. The wolves smite buff is almost like having your entire blue side jungle warded.  If it so much as moves, someone is in that side of the jungle.\n7. Raptor buff is better than red trinket.  Leave them up for us, as it's really useful to gank with.\n8. Pay attention to the camp's level.  If you're above it, you get reduced xp.  If it's above my level, I get a large xp boost.  If I'm amumu and you want raptors, please consider leaving it for me.  \n\nI get it, you want extra farm, but keep in mind that we need it too.  We need levels to gank early, and items to be useful later.","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-10T19:27:41.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol. \"But Im the CARRY!\"","replies":[{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2015-03-10T20:44:05.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck that.  I get substantially more gold than you for the scuttler.  Seriously though, you can carry in any role, it's just that carries need to have the highest damage by late game.
