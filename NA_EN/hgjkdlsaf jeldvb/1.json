Also, Cho'gath can control the Dragon more-so than Nunu, yet I don't see the same complaints. If you're complaining that he's OP because you can't steal a dragon from their control, then perhaps you should retain control of the pit.

You complained about not being able to steal it from Nunu when he already has control over the objective, when you could have been setting up to take better control of it. Also, he doesn't have good duelling potential, and you have over-exaggerated his snowball laughably so. A single target slow isn't so strong as to \"fuck one person over consistently\". That is like saying that Karthus's Wall of Pain is so strong that he auto-wins every fight he uses it in. It's all hyperbole.\n\nThe damage that Nunu deals in any fights is actually quite low, and relies on his team-mates for him to do well. His ganking potential is actually quite poor aswell. But it seems you like to ignore every weakness for your own argument's sake.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FantasySniper","date":"2015-04-13T23:01:54.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How?\n\nHe's always been a menace in high-ranked games, but there needs to a way to accomplish a nerf effectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-04-13T09:22:20.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gives up a large amount of his \"power budget\" in order to secure his place as a strong counter-jungler, objective-secure..er.\n\nHe has an entire ability that *only* damages minions/monsters, and he has one of the longest channels in the game that can be easily avoided, especially given the amount of mobility in the game.

Nunu is very strong 1v1 in the jungle - even if he loses, he can just Q your face and run away, boosting his speed while slowing you. But if you coordinate with your nearest laner, he has a much harder time when he's focused. He can only slow one target, so he's more vulnerable in a 1v2. Call for your mid or top to come assist if you see him in your jungle. Vision becomes vital against Nunu; use smite to get the Wolf ward/seeker/thing, use your wards at objectives, and when you see him wander towards a buff, gank him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadow Gilgamesh","date":"2015-04-13T00:03:34.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So... don't try to take drag when Nunu is up? or put extra effort into keeping the pits warded since he's an objective control jungler? any jungler with a super nuke that can be used on drag isn't smart to try taking drag or baron while they're up..","replies":[{"poster":"hgjkdlsaf jeldvb","date":"2015-04-13T22:27:36.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to be confused about the situation.

You have to kill the nunu to secure it, because you can't outsmite a nunu unless he fucks up.
