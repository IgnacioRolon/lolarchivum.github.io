Silver 1 and Gold 4 are virtually the same.\nAre we forgetting that Gold 5 doesn't exist anymore?\n\nThat isn't even all there is to it:\n\n- Kennen and Rengar were premades; Both Gold last season\n\n- Twitch and Lulu were premades\n\n- Kayle is Gold 4, 0 LP, 50% win rate.\n\n- No one on your team was premade\n\nAs far as \"match fairness\" is concerned, both teams had approximately the same chance of winning.\nThe only odd ball there is Talon: Silver 2, 48% winrate, peak Silver. That said, he had the best performance in the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-04-09T08:16:38.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Silver 1-2 is only a couple divisions away from Gold 4.

That really isn't the case. mid/high Silver (Silver 3, 2, 1) and low/mid Gold (Gold 4, 3, 2) are virtually the same thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thingamajig","date":"2019-04-09T08:36:39.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colte","date":"2019-04-09T10:19:33.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrismalDawn,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qAm42AQG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-04-09T08:19:09.963+0000)\n>\n> A silver player might have the same mechanics as a gold player, but the Gold player will better manage an advantage and out-rotate the silver once the laning phase is over.\n\nnot true there are plenty of golds and platinum players that still have terrible mechanics due to being carried by a smurf or a experienced player that doesn't belong in the elo. 1 to 2 (perhaps even 3) could get carried be sheer luck.\n\nwe also can't forget that there are people that buy boosted accounts just to feed in a higher division \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-04-09T09:06:46.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plat players are just as bad as silver players sometimes and i say this as a hardstuck mid plat player\n\nso no that isnt a huge difference in elo","replies":[]}]}
