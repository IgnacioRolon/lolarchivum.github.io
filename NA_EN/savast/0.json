I have called frontier communications, and we have both figured out that only league is causing the packet loss. I sent in a support ticket. However, I've always talked to a lot of people that are experiencing the same problems as well. It has come and gone in the past, but it has never been this bad before. \r\n\r\nSocal region (verizon bought out frontier)\r\n\r\nFrom,\r\n\r\nPun","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-28T21:49:55.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty strange that your ISP is only having packet loss when going to one specific server. Since you said you already had a support ticket, make sure you attach some network logs so those techs can look through and see what might be happening if it's not packet loss. It'd be good to attach a traceroute showing any packet loss as well for extra data.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Savast","date":"2017-11-28T19:23:08.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure if we're allowed to bump or something to get a reply","replies":[]}]}
