I used to have 55-57 ping, but last few days it has been 63-67. Every other game is fine, and I do not have lag issues. Every so often Verizon fios had issues with league where i lived ( socal). However, Frontier bought out Verizon's systems, and I think the problem is coming back.\n\nThank you\nPun","replies":[{"poster":"Savast","date":"2017-05-14T05:19:52.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt seem to be on my end after checking things. do you think you could look at your side again?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-13T20:57:40.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically a gray play button is a good sign that your network can't get a stable enough connection at that moment to let you play any matches. Since you mentioned Frontier, I do know that they were having some issues with their peering a few days ago, so that may, in fact, be the main source of the problem. \n\nLet's go ahead and run through the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) just in case though!
