I just bought the Sion skin (all the Mecha Skins rock) and it worked fine in a Twisted Treeline bots game when I was trying it out. However, this last game I just played my w appeared to be glitching. The passive did not seem to be registering on jungle camps correctly. For example, as a jungler at 51 CS I had only 98 health bonus. What I noticed was happening was that I would look at my health and at the bonus before each monster kill. It would properly go on by 2 on small monsters, 2 on lane minions, and 10 on champions. However, the Gromp, Scuttle Crab, Large Wolf, Large Raptor, and Large Krug were betraying me. I did not check red and blue buff (had to a game to win after all!) This was a normal matchmade game. I did die on the first camp without a leash and then selected my w to level for the first time when dead, so maybe that set up the glitch? Anyways, I love the skin and I think that Sion can be strong in the jungle, but without the w passive working he is unplayable in the jungle. He really depends on that health scaling. Please fix the bug or explain how I might be able to do something different. I want to play my $15 skin! :-D {{champion:14}}","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-18T23:31:35.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Xandres - \n\nThanks for the report! Issues like this generally aren't related to skins. I'm going to pass this along to Champion Update, as they last touched Sion. They'll be able to take a look and see what's going on. :)\n\nEDIT: Talked to them, They said monster camps should also be giving HP. We're digging into it. ","replies":[]}]}
