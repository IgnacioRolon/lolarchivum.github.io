In fact, I used both of them, discussing Riot's stupid policy with my colleague about 8 hours ago. It's socially acceptable down here. Probably yes.\n\n>  Common sense goes a long way. \n\nBut Riot lacks it.\n\n> #From Riot Support:\n\nPunishable retaliatory behaviour is not specified.

More than that, you get punished for them even if they are not made towards other players, which is omitted. What a coincidence.\n\n> ALSO from Riot Support:\n\nYes, they specify that there are tiers and that they can be skipped. This information is unusable and, hilariously, you have to dig to find it.
