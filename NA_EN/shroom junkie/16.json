I mean, I don't know about anyone else, but I could sure use more Mastery pages. Bunch of characters that use pretty unique aspects.\n\nLike, Yasuo and Gangplank. Pretty much the only two characters that use abilities with their basic attacks, have AD, and use critical strikes a lot.\nSo, what other champs use Spell Weaving, Blade Weaving, Frenzy, and specifically use the AD tree? I can't think of any. Maybe Corki and Kog'Maw for Spell and Blade Weaving, and AD, but not the Frenzy.\n\nNow, another example.\nRumble.\nWhat other champs are like him? There's probably one or two, but I myself can't actually think of any or find any. He uses AP, he's melee and has his passive so he uses Spell and Blade weaving, as well as Arcane Blade(But a lot of AP champs use that).\nLike, maybe you could compare him to Teemo or Kayle, but they still have a lot of differences.\n\nEither way, there are a lot of different types of champs, a lot of champion-specific aspects, and if we're being honest here, masteries and runes could literally save your life by the small amounts of damage, attack speed, cooldown reduction, and so on that they give you.","replies":[{"poster":"LazyGlue","date":"2015-05-12T01:29:46.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just create 19 pages for the main champions you play and if you arent playing one of those champions clear the 20th page and choose depending on the game/champion???

Aside from that, I generally just think its easier to pick a page specific to said champ(and maybe a few others) and stick with it. Much easier and allows for more communication in the character selection, though I will admit its good for making masteries specific to your enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-05-12T10:26:27.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know you can use your scroll wheel to add masteries faster?

Most generic pages cover 95% of the champs anyways.

They keep releasing new champions and as far as I can gather the limit hasn't changed in years.\n\nMasteries are more important here then runes IMO, for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, masteries are a lot specific than runes, because masteries mostly sync up with champion kits (especially the offensive tree) whereas Runes really sync up more with items (since they cover simpler stats whereas masteries are more lined up with stuff like autoattacking a lot, or mana regen and such).\n\nMasteries are free, runes aren't. Runes cost IP, meaning they take longer time to branch out, meaning that for new players the need for mastery pages expand with each champion you pick up, whereas the need for more rune pages scale much more slowly.\n\nThere's also the point of being able to make more mastery pages for other game modes. I'm much less likely to need certain masteries in ARAM or Dominion (specifically the ones which helps your single target minion damage and rewards your CS) simply because in those modes they're not very useful.\n\nBut yeah, both masteries and runes need a higher cap for max # of pages. Especially masteries, seeing as even two relatively similar Champions might require different mastery pages (like one with spell/blade weaving and cdr and arcane blade vs an identical page with spell/blade weaving and attack speed but with expose weakness or double edged sword instead of arcane blade).\n\nThe restrictive max number of pages probably works fine on a high level of play, especially pro play where you specialize into only one role, since the further up you go the more important and higher the benefit of specialization into a relatively small champion pool. When you only have to worry about picking from a pool of your 25-30 most played champions then pegging down mastery pages that fit your needs for all of them ought to be doable.\n\nWhen you're sampling periodically from the entire 120+ roster, things get a little bit more tricky.\n\nMaking pages that fit 3-5 champions well isn't a real problem.\n\nMaking pages that fit 5-8 is often quite a bit more tricky.\n\n---\n\nP.S.\n\nAnother reason why more mastery pages are needed as Riot releases new champions, is that newer champions have more complex kits, so they're less likely to synergize well with the same page as other champions. As kits get more diverse and unique, more and more cases of \"yeah this page also fits this Champion, except I want those points in CDR instead of spell/blade weaving and that point in more AP instead of arcane blade.\"","replies":[]}]}
