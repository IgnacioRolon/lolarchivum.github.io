The only exception to this is the AD ratio, in which is only 25%, and only bonus AD, not base. His heal also works while using the active, and when its on cooldown, however Aatrox&#039;s only works when Blood Thirst is on, meaning he has to LOSE health to deal more damage, while Xin Zhao GAINS health.\n\nAatrox is based upon health regen in combat. Why does he have less ability regen than Xin? Aatrox even uses health, as Xin uses mana. How is this fair at all?\nI say either buff Aatrox&#039;s heal, or remove Xin&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"bbanana","date":"2015-06-08T20:17:33.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Every third attack, Aatrox restores 20/25/30/35/40 (+25% bonus Attack Damage) Health\n(+25% bonus Attack Damage)\n\n- heals himself for 30/35/40/45/50 (+70% Ability Power)\n(+70% Ability Power)\n\nOther than that it's rather useless, 10 health ;p","replies":[{"poster":"Thanotos Omega","date":"2015-06-08T20:22:17.768+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly {{champion:266}}  get's more healing for building his favorite stat which also tends to come with Life Steal, {{champion:5}}  has to add some AP to gain more,","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-11-19T19:56:44.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Xin with Devourer isn't too bad either.
