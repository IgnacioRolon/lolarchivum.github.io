I get in the game, first pick locks in top, 4th pick(picking with me, last pick) says he&#039;s going top too even though he never even called it, I figure its just some troll and I&#039;ll let him take what he wants out of the last picks. Then it goes to the next who are mid and sup, and then we go to me and the other guy who picks with me. I ask him if he wants jungle or ADC, he doesn&#039;t answer, so I&#039;m like whatever and pick jungle, lock in after a wait to see if he&#039;ll take it, then wait for him to pick, and he specifically fucks with me and picks jungle. Nobody dodges so I have to.\n\nThis needs to be blocked, Riot, I don&#039;t care how. I can&#039;t even get a good game by trying to cooperate with the ass hole. There are these people that just troll us and do whatever so that someone has to dodge and lose LP, because why not? Not like they lose anything unless we actually go in, in which they just AFK, most likely being a smurf that doesn&#039;t care if they lose LP or not.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2015-07-26T22:47:25.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, they don't care.  Trolls spend money too so they're just going to let them troll.  It's apparently our fault for getting bothered by being locked in games with them.  I guess we're just supposed to enjoy the trolling and griefing, because Riot \"can't predict what someone will do\" and that's as far as it goes with them.\n\nOnce other games have taken serious steps to improve the community and Riot still hides behind Lyte politics, this game will either die or descend into a raging sociopathic nightmare where only assholes exist.  Maybe that's what they want, I dunno.  Sure seems like it sometimes.","replies":[]}]}
