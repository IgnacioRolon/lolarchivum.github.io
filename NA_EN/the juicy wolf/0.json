Gentleman Yorick skin, i think this would be fantastic give him the whole tophat and monocle look plus! his ghouls could wear suits and tophats too or something like that. Another skin idea i think would be great is jack the ripper, just an idea but please riot for the love of the Rift give him and Urgot some love there are people who like those champs you know.{{champion:83}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-19T06:32:47.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick has been on the chopping block for a rework for the last three years. Sadly, not long after he was started, the one who started it had moved onto other things and passed it onto another team that was working on Sion and Poppy already. They recently picked him back up this year, but with Poppy being the next one up, we won't be seeing Yorick until MAYBE the middle of next season.\n\nWe will not be seeing a Yorick skin until his Rework since he's a Sion-level rework, just like we won't be seeing any new Taric or Poppy skins. Yorick has it the worst though with him not even being on the free week roto for the last couple of years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"71389310_DEL","date":"2015-10-19T05:53:41.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as if Riot has abandoned Yorick. When I stopped playing LoL once upon a time there was intent to rework him but so long. Now I've returned to the game but nothing has been done.\n\nAlas, poor Yorick...","replies":[]}]}
