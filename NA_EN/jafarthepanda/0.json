(SEEMS) easy enough to adapt to, and I&#039;m working on how to properly build kind of a hybrid build (Balancing MR and resistance to armor pen.) if you want to call it that. \nHowever - counter jungling (if applicable) with rammus - how does one go about it? What&#039;s the bullshit matchups? (I know someone&#039;s going to say &quot;mobafire gtfo&quot; or something. I&#039;m asking on here, shush) and I guess, what do you do as rammus when you&#039;re behind, or just not as ambitious as the more solid junglers?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-04-11T06:20:59.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trickiest thing is to keep accumulating gold.  Find a way to do that, either by repetitive ganks or clearing the jungle and you should be golden.  He doesn't tend to be a great counter-jungler in my experience. He's not fast enough, he doesn't have a ton of solo kill potential, and his buff/objective secure is pretty low.  But, at the end of the day if you really want to, I'm sure you can make it work. :)","replies":[{"poster":"JafarThePanda","date":"2016-04-11T06:40:05.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone I saw did a Q + Flash (bonked a group.

Buy banshees if you NEED the cc reduction, forcing the enemy to waste 2 cc effects to stop you, reducing their power in short skirmishes.\nRanduins omen and frozen heart are interchangeable, trading HP for mana and CDR.\nLocket can be swapped out for something else if your team is already building one, as the auras don't stack, reducing gold efficiency by a bit.\nHope this helps!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2016-04-11T19:41:25.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't pick him first or the enemy will just pick AP champs. Don't buy AP items because he scales badly. Instead buy magic penetration items if the enemy has tanks. If you have blue buff you can taunt the jungle camps to lower their resistances. Consider ghost instead of flash. Also he is fast enough to gank through lane unlike most junglers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fanny Forecast","date":"2016-04-11T06:33:23.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From thinking of how his kit works, good people to invade would be people who have weak early games, have minimal cc, and are very auto reliant.  One that comes to mind, that fits 2 of the 3, is Evelynn.  She MIGHT out dmg you, but I don't actually know.\n\nAs for just counterjungling, the easiest way to counterjungle is map awareness.  Bot getting ganked?  Steal his top side jungle.  Enemy taking their krugs?  Take gromp.  In early-mid game, gromp WILL be back up by the time they take krugs, and they're unlikely to go right back over there before backing.  You have a decent window of opportunity at this point to steal their stuff and run.  Make sure to ward, smite Raptors, and maintain scuttle control as those are more important than counterganking, and you kinda need these to do it safely.\n\nAs for a build, I THINK rammus scales off AP with his abilities.  If so, Abyssal would be a good pickup.  Other than that, MR-based items good on Rammus would be ZZRot, GA (if you're fed and wanna be an ass), and Spirit/Banshees (Banshees only if u wanna block CC like Morg Q).","replies":[{"poster":"JafarThePanda","date":"2016-04-11T06:44:36.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus does work off AP.

If they have a support and a mid laner, both are doing average, go Abyssal.  If they have an Udyr jg who is fed as well as an ap mid, grab Spirit.  It's a situational pickup thats basically a matter of how much do you actually need the MR and how well are you personally doing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jungle Lux God","date":"2016-04-11T14:14:07.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How you counter jungle with Rammus is that you don't counter jungle with Rammus. Rammus naturally has extremely slow clear speeds that make it hard to take a camp in an efficient amount of time and really poor dueling potential that leaves him in extremely bad positions if he does get caught out in either jungle. If you see the jungler gank a side lane while you are taking scuttle crab on the other side of the map then maybe you can steal a camp, but know that you are probably going to need smite to get the camp, which isn't always optimal depending on the camp.\n\nRammus generally has bad matchups against anyone that can bully him during the early game and has good matchups against those that can't. There aren't a whole lot of junglers that outscale Rammus in the late game, and if the enemy jungler can't bully Rammus it's extremely likely for Rammus to hit that late game, but champions that can bully him out early can prevent him from reaching that late game.\n\nIt's really hard to say what Rammus should do when he falls behind because I've personally never found myself in that kind of situation when playing Rammus myself, and when I have I haven't really been able to have much of an impact, but what I think would be ideal for Rammus is that if there's an enemy trying to dive your carries, like an assassin or a bruiser, then I would personally just stand by my carries. If they engage then I would Q-E them upon them engaging to peel and it would essentially offer a free kill while not requiring too much defenses. You can also try your hand at trying to engage with Rammus either through flanks or through brute-forcing it through Q with Righteous Glory, but it's really hard to do that consistently without having mastered Rammus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-04-11T12:51:51.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a rammus jungler....
