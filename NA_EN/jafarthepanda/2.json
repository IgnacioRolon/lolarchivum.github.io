What happens in some games I end up ulting myself like an idiot instead of my ally, because I misjudged my range, because of this particular set up.\nOther than that I think he is a beast, I remmember playing a game where enemy had multiple carries and a {{champion:26}}  ,it was legit impossible to win. They had {{champion:26}}  mid, {{champion:84}}  top, and {{champion:11}}  jungle , with {{champion:18}}  adc, all of which need to be hard focused, but every time we would focus down 1 dude he would just get revived  at the last second by {{champion:26}} and we would lose every teamfight.

For one thing most those players don't realize they have a guy on their team that can temporarily place a guardians angel on them so a lot of them don't take fights they can win cause of this or run away instead of continuing to fight. Most don't understand how to position properly or who to prioritize. Having Zilean means that your frontline can just slug it out with the enemies frontline with yours winning since you can bring back one of yours. So basically if your team sucks, then your fucked unless you some how get really fed early. This is all for mid Zilean though. I think support Zilean is in a awful spot right now in comparison to other supports. He is extremely squishy, his only damage ability usually ends up pushing the lane/stealing CS, and his utility outside his ultimate is matched or surpassed by almost all the meta supports for at least the early to mid game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renascent","date":"2016-09-14T17:40:09.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he suffers from the same popularity issue as someone like say, Malphite or Ziggs. These champions are all very powerful and can be a defining factor in winning games, but they will always be crowded out by the popularity of champs like Yasuo or Lee Sin who never seem to be able to fall out of the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2016-09-14T15:06:50.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Zilean a decent amount and I'd say that it's because it's really difficult to solo carry with him. In ranked, most people (midlaners) go in with the mindset that if they don't win their lane, the game is lost. Zil requires your teammates to be good, you need that 12/2/5 jungle Shyv or someone similar that can really disrupt their team, and give them your speed boost and ult.
