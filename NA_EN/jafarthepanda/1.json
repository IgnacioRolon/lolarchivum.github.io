There really isn&#039;t.\n\nLast 6 games I&#039;ve done:\n{{champion:150}} {{champion:8}} - vlad won\n{{champion:74}} {{champion:84}} - donger won\n{{champion:2}} {{champion:432}} - olaf won\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:122}} - ashe won\n{{champion:91}} {{champion:14}} - Si-won\n{{champion:90}} {{champion:245}} - Ekko won\n\nAll of these matchups are /all GG the moment you pop up on the map. I spend 20 minutes just waiting for the game to end knowing there's no chance, or, my comp stomps them and they just open mid at 6 minutes\nI know 6 is nothing in sample size, but it takes 6 games for me to realize just how fucked this game mode is for anything other than your first win of the day bonus. This mode really needs some kind of rework.\n\n[edit] people still play fotm champs or just flat out broken champs in this despite all of them being available.

Further some champions still near hard counter others (which the hard counters can't be helped despite Riot's best efforts.   Heimer will never not near hard counter most melee and be hard countered by range for example).  Some champions just have absurd amount of ranged CC like Zyra and having 5 of them just makes it so a majority of champions are unviable against it.  Champions that are one dimensional are near useless for the mode because you can just stack against them and still do the damage necessary to kill them.  A champion such as Fizz is what the mode is really best for as the champion can go full AP, AP bruiser, on-hit, tank, or AD and still have it work.

If you don't think a Viktor, a Vlad, an Azir or a Malz counters him, then you got some things to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"specter424","date":"2016-08-08T17:45:56.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is why you max rockets and not turrets against champs that kill turrets easily.
