Where you misunderstand it is that it does a horrible job in letting you know someone got punished.\n\nCurrently, the system just notifies you that someone got punished if the game you reported them in was the game that you reported them in.  If they get punished the next game (or down the road), you'll never know.\n\nThis indeed makes people feel the system doesn't exist (cos they never \"see it in action), and some people think you can do whatever with it and never get punished. Mean while, there are others that think people are getting away with toxicity and the system does nothing.\n\nThen there are also people (like me) that understand the system a whole lot, and know what is punishable and what isn't. When people threaten to report me, I really have no fear cos I know I haven't done anything wrong thus won't get punished by the system.\n\nBoth instances, this can be solved by increasing the system's visibility. Riot is aware of this problem, but they currently have other priorities such as finishing the new client. The next thing that comes is the new honor system. Maybe after that we'll be getting tools to increase behavioral visibility like [this](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/aFmEtAVK-riot-should-add-monthly-status-cards).","replies":[{"poster":"HMS TERROR","date":"2017-04-19T00:42:08.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you tell me that what is more offensive ? targeting one person in the team or  complaining to those people about toxicity . i mean im the victim here and i get punished where is the justice in that ? . or is it just blind faith in the system ? and i see this every other match where even my own teammates target one of our team players that they are feeders and trolls and noobs and what not and that poor guy has to tolerate this nonsense . how is this kinda behaviour tolerable why there is no punishment unless you get more than 2 people  to report that person . i think most of the cases that arent reported are more toxic than the ones that are  reported .","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-19T14:57:07.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you tell me that what is more offensive ? targeting one person in the team or complaining to those people about toxicity .\n\nhmm .. that is actually a wrong argument in the context of Riot's behavioral system. It would be the proper argument if it was like a court system and said \"this is the game, a bunch of these are toxics, this guy is just defending himself, therefore we should punish these other guys and not the dude defending himself\".\n\nHowever, the behavioral system doesn't work like that. It takes in account for your toxicity history alone (and no one else's) and when it passes a certain threshold, it deals punishment. \n\nFor example (note, numbers are hypothetical):\n\n* Each game you are (validly) reported, the system marks you on a toxicity scale of 1-10, where 1 is small stuff like calling for reports / gg ez and 10 is hate speech / homophobia\n* it takes 25 points to get yourself punished\n* if you played 25 games and asked for reports every game, then you'll get punished.\n* If you played 3 games with hate speech you get punished.\n\nThey can be at 1 point, use hate speech and they'll be at 11 points. Whereas if you were at 24 points and asked for reports, BAM, you'll get punished (and also feeling that they got off scott free). \n\nSo with the example above, you'll see that people are punished for their own history and how offensive other's speech will be irrelevant to your own punishment. \n\nAlso, multiple reports within the same game don't get people punished faster.","replies":[{"poster":"HMS TERROR","date":"2017-04-20T13:19:05.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"what do u think is more believable  ?  that when one person reports 5 others , the 5 others will be punished becasue of that one report ?  or  the case where 5 people are reporting that one person and even when theyre lying about it that one poor guy gets punished bacause 5 people cannot lie about one guy while one guy who is fighting those people must have done something wrong so they wont think twice about punishing him .","replies":[{"poster":"o Maui o","date":"2017-04-20T13:25:44.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Multiple reports of one player in one game are treated the same way as a single report by the system.

That's not okay.\n\nThink about it this way: if you are in a grocery store, and someone starts an argument with you and calls you names, you are a victim of toxicity. If you respond by screaming obscenities and hate speech, then you are making the problem worse and not better, and now everyone within earshot is a victim of your toxicity, because they just wanted to shop in peace.\n\nIt's a team game and you're matched with nine strangers. Even if it was okay to lash out at someone who insulted you first (it's not, but I accept that you think it is), you have to remember that there are a bunch of other people in the game, and by retaliating you're making the toxic situation worse, drawing it out, and creating more unpleasantness for the innocent bystanders.
