Considering no other spell has the same interaction , i think it counts as a bug?\r\nSteps to reproduce (if you haven&#039;t watched the replay) :\r\n1. Player 1 press E with Nocturne.\r\n2. Player 2 press Zhonya quickly after that.\r\n3. Fear continues to stay on target and fears you inside the zhonya.\r\n4.

But about the whole fear thing being applied while still in the zhonya. Meaning what should happen imo :\n1. The fear is applied before the zhonya ends => negated.\n2. Tethers still stay but if applied after the zhonya ends (not sure if the durations even allows this to happen) => fear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2018-03-13T04:09:21.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tethers aren't broken by Zhonya.
