His conqueror winrate is high, but thats due to people taking it into matchups you don't need fleet for, which ofc gives him a good winrate. We can tell this is true because electrocute has double its pickrate while also having a higher winrate. Kassadin already gets enough healing from W and lich bane proc with single target ravenous hunter healing anyway. Conqueror Cassiopeia is actually OP though and conq should be nerfed for ranged.","replies":[]}]}
