It doesn't feed the discussion and just hurts my little feelings {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\n      Recently I've been on a massive downward climb in ranked, since about a month ago. I was in platinum I for a long time, but just couldn't get the lucky streak required to break the promotional's wall. Lately I've noticed that teammates in this area are not showing the signs and/or attitude that a high platinum normally has. Is the system unstable due to the new Master tier? Or is there some kind of popular boosting corporation that gained popularity in the recent months? I'm honestly clueless to how some of these players got to where they are. That being said, no I'm not one of those \"WOW noob teamm report dem all plssss\" kind of player, ask Rito we're real tight. But I'm really curious to what's going on right now. Does anyone have an explanation?","replies":[{"poster":"oh you wanna die","date":"2014-10-11T01:01:51.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also you said it yourself, boosting has always been a huge problem from plat to about diamond 4?\n\nits only gotten worse, and nowadays you can just get boosted with references, its quite lame, it used to be people got boosted just to never play ranked again, and just spam aram or normals and when people saw they sucked it was lolwtf cant a guy just take a break in aram or normals and not try hard?\n\nnow these kids really believe they are good enough to hang in that boosted elo, and just ruin the games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"oh you wanna die","date":"2014-10-11T00:57:02.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"current match making reflects the current state of league, and its as bad as the servers.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1577267047/200069224","replies":[{"poster":"Bread Bee","date":"2014-10-11T02:03:21.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad games like that happen here and there though, I'm talking about continuous bad matchmaking","replies":[{"poster":"oh you wanna die","date":"2014-10-11T02:54:55.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like i said, elo boosting has gotten worse.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bread Bee","date":"2014-10-11T02:44:59.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump for answers","replies":[]}]}
