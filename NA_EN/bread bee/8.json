As someone who&#039;s never been chat restricted or banned, I can say it really isn&#039;t hard to NOT be a douche. You don&#039;t need to say \"...\" every time your {{champion:432}}  makes a mistake and dies for it. It only makes him do worse. You don&#039;t have to give him the classic \"Why would you X?\" Because its almost always painfully obvious why he did it, and you&#039;re trying to gratify yourself by making your teammate feel worse. \n               So here&#039;s an idea. How about you just... don&#039;t? Next time your mid lane doesn&#039;t pressure the lane while his opponent is roaming and you REALLY just wanna give him a \"lol this mid\", Just... don&#039;t! Instead, maybe a \"Azir could you please push the lane while Zed is bot\". Or heck, you could even just ping the turret and save time altogether. Next time your support engages at a bad time and gets killed for it. Just... don&#039;t. The \"...\" isn&#039;t necessary. It doesn&#039;t help. \nBring on the downvotes, I&#039;m gunna standby my nigga Lyte.\n**tl:dr, Lyte&#039;s just doing his job extra well** _mods r still trash tho_","replies":[]}
