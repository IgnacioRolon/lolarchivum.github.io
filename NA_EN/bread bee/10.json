He&#039;s basically forced to go bot lane, thanks to his new W. According to his W passive, he&#039;s supposed to replace the ad carry. But is it worth it? His E and Q scaling is decent, but you miss out on a large amount of reliable physical damage. It just seems like a massive hit or miss, either your team is able to assassinate the enemy adc and get a ghost of it, or your team suffers from a 4v5 after Morde gets completely blown up by CC and an actual adc. \r\nMaybe I just don&#039;t understand his strengths. What are your thoughts, GD?\r\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:82}} {{item:3070}}??","replies":[]}
