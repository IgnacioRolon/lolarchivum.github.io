I'm a mac user and I'm from SE Asia. I've been playing League of Legends in my mac for awhile but its lagging. I think it is because I'm from another region. Is there away to play in the SE Asia server in mac ? If not, can the LoL developers think of something for this problem ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-02T16:48:02.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In general, you do have a bit of physical distance reaching the game servers in NA region so routing will always be an obstacle.  You can still tune up your network though to make sure it's in the best shape it can be and keep your connection steady.  For that I suggest using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help.  Make sure to select Mac for instructiosn specific to your OS.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Oksanaandjoy","date":"2017-10-24T15:54:55.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a fairly naive response. You can only tune up so much but the reality is we are stuck playing 1/4 second behind everyone else. Why don't you put some pressure on Garena to support OS X? You already build the game for it. Or open up the Korean or Japanese servers?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DanialvsGames","date":"2016-11-04T07:32:09.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, will the LoL developers be making a server for SE Asia suitable for mac ?","replies":[]}]}]}
