If you can&#039;t do the math, that&#039;s 100+ people. Of those 100+ people, I have reported more then 80% of them (if you can&#039;t do the math, that&#039;s 80+ people) because of hate speech, and bad sportsmanship. Whenever I play, one player or the ENTIRE TEAM is trying to put me down, blaming the DUMBEST things on me that didn&#039;t happen, or make up fake scenarios where I played horribly and did nothing and they got killed (i.e. playing bot with ashe, both were low hp. Enemies killed me first (ashe ran) and then followed up to kill her. Afterwards, she blamed me for not helping her even though I repeated that I had died first. This resumed for the rest of the game and we lost) Please help, and also, as a side note, please add a feature where if you report someone and they get punished, notify the reporter if their report was successful and what the punishment was. Whenever I report someone, I don&#039;t get any notifications that it was responded to, and feel like the 3-8 minutes I put in to it was a waste. Does anyone else feel like this should be added? And is this happening to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2017-01-07T14:42:36.873+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plot twist: OP is apart of the community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T06:17:40.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you report too often your reports start being flagged and ignored. \n\nTry using /mute all at the start of every game.

I guess it can't be helped then, I'll have to hold your hand through this. Ok let's get this done with. \n\nIn a game, there were 3 people, you, A and B. B was a toxic person, and both you and A reported B. Because you often misreported, your reports were flagged to be ignored. Player A, however, never misreported, so his report holds weight. The system completely ignored your report, but because A's reports aren't flagged, player A's report triggered a review on B, and B was banned. As per practice, a feedback message was sent to everyone who reported B after that game, namely you and A. You got the message, but your report wasn't even considered. Had A not reported B, B wouldn't even be reviewed because your reports are weightless according to the system. \n\nIs that clear now?","replies":[{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2017-01-08T12:37:29.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's clear is Player A thinks the same as I do but is afraid to use the report system because down talkers like you make it seem like your votes don't matter.\n\nIf I report people and I get messages then it works, I don't care if it takes a long route to the destination it still gets there.\n\ndrops the mic","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-08T16:54:39.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't even grasp that hitting the report button on literally every game is gonna get your reports flagged, it's no wonder you can't even hold a microphone without dropping it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2017-01-07T03:09:21.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you report some one and they get reprimanded they you are notified, you can't cripple an account in 1 single report so I don't know what you're expecting.\n\nI agree though way too many people are toxic on this game, one game I played an enemy draven was a douche bag ass hole and he said \"it worked in football, so it should work on on league too!\"\n\nHe had the mentality that some how playing this game is a sport so he treats every one like he does when he plays sports, like a toxic piece of shit.\n\nI think when this game shifted from being a game to a \"sport\" it gave the community a bad taste that they've never been able to shake.\n\nI don't believe this is a sport though, it's just a video game.","replies":[{"poster":"Cardiac Arhaast","date":"2017-01-07T17:29:23.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I can't totally destroy an account, I just want to know that the report went through.
