(I'm not seeing infinity edge or deathcap being a smite-only item)\n\nThe %HP being on a jungle item is important because many tanks have laning phases that are so weak that they can only be played in the jungle. Top lane Sejuani/Nautilus/Amumu will get eaten alive by 99% of the top laners in any given meta. So naturally, when those champions don't have something that makes them playable in the jungle, then we see Lee/J4/Vi jungle like we did earlier this season. \n\nHowever, putting the %HP on an item that isn't available outside the jungle (and most importantly, ISN'T AVAILABLE WITH WARRIOR ENCHANTMENT) prevents the Warrior-enchantment rushing junglers from being \"real\" tanks. Not only did they take a damage item over a bulk item, their bulk items give them less bulk than the junglers who have committed to building full tank. Now full tank is defined as Cinderhulk/Randuins/Spirit Visage +25% HP as opposed to Randuins/Spirit Visage/Locket or some other reasonable equivalent. \n\nI bring this up in every Cinderhulk thread because people seem to understand that Cinderhulk is why tanks are strong, but are completely wrong about WHY Cinderhulk being a jungle item is so important. Since Cinderhulk and its %HP are a jungle item, the bruiser champions who, historically, have been able to have the best of both worlds in early game strength and late game bulk **must now CHOOSE whether they are going to be early game pubstompers or late game tanks**. \n\nWe can see this phenomenon even better with the Smite top laners that have started showing up. Champions like Shyvana are giving up Flash (substantially reducing their early game safety) in order to take Smite, which doesn't help them at all outside of allowing them to eventually purchase Cinderhulk. The fact that we've created a situation where **bruisers are WILLINGLY SACRIFICING their early game in order to be tanks** instead of having tanks just be eternally outclassed by bruisers is incredible, and we shouldn't just kill that choice by taking the %HP to a non-jungle item. \n\nBasically, the reason Cinderhulk is smite-only is because it's the only way to compensate tanks for their substantially weaker early game compared to bruisers. If the bruisers don't take Cinderhulk, the tanks get an insurmountable late game bulk advantage; if the bruisers do take Cinderhulk, they lose substantial burst on their early ganks, essentially putting the tanks and bruisers on a level playing field. All of these advantages are lost if %HP appears on a non-jungle item.","replies":[{"poster":"kunkudunk","date":"2015-04-20T20:33:06.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the most important part of what you said has to do with the warrior enchantment.

It would take a while to get the bonus %health and even longer to get effective use out of it.\n\n\"Smite, which doesn't help them at all outside of allowing them to eventually purchase Cinderhulk\" is actually not true though.  Challenging Smite is great in duels (as it was designed to be), and top lane is full of duels.  Smite doesn't help in the *really early* game, unless you're taking the meta changes all the way and double jungling, but as soon as you get that Sabre, you can already use it on your lane opponent.\n\nAnyway, I think concern about bruisers snatching up % bonus HP is a bit overdone.  Any %HP item will always work better on a champion that is actually building multiple items with bonus HP on them.  Sure, there's a *little* bonus HP on triforce and cleaver, but building those with any %HP item isn't going to give near the results of Randuin's or BV/SV (or Sunfire, if you're assuming a non-jungler who is building some other %HP item instead of Cinderhulk itself).\n\nI think the big thing is that a % bonus would normally make it a late game item (similar to why deathcap second or third is more common than first), but because it's a jungle upgrade and jungle upgrades *as a category* are so strong and useful, you actually want to rush it.  So 1 damage item, 2 other tank items, then %HP item is actually not that great a buildpath for Cinderhulk because you're delaying your other jungle power (and that burn) too long -- whereas it might be perfectly reasonable for a non-smite Shyv if you put %HP on something like Warmog's (swapping out some of its current flat HP).\n\nIDK if it's really that horrible for a top laner to get a BOTRK/hydra/gunblade/triforce/etc. first and then build semi-tanky with a late game Warmog's, though.  They would have a long time of a lot less tankiness than a Cinderhulk rusher (or for that matter a full tank Warmog's rushing Mundo or something like that) before finally approaching the toughness of a true tank at 30+ minutes.\n\nAnd since Warrior junglers would be rushing, well, Warrior, which gives 0 HP, a hypothetical %HP Warmog's wouldn't be at all an attractive second item for them either -- hitting real tankiness wouldn't start until at least the third item, and then they still have the problem of probably having 0 (well, their base amount) in at least one resist.  Something like {{item:3714}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3083}} on a jungler's income, you're probably looking at *at least* 30 min, during which you've been substantially less tanky than a real tank (although you have of course done more damage).\n\nAnd even once they do have four full items with only one being damage, they're still nowhere near the tankiness of {{champion:113}} {{item:3717}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3075}}  or {{champion:36}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3068}} .","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loken Stoneheart","date":"2015-04-24T07:25:40.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mi ramfan,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=r3Gib0Z3,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-04-20T15:22:23.265+0000)\n>\n> I agree with pretty much everything in your post except this:\n\n\nAnd it all goes out the window when they sell their Warrior enchantment late game to get Cinderhulk anyways, the point of the game where Cinderhulk is actually good.

Or don't focus the tank, like you're supposed to.\n\nWithout tanks, your whole team just gets melted before you can do damage, but without a team, a tank can't reasonably kill anyone unless they go bruiser. \n\nIn the assassin meta, it's kill instantly or die instantly. Everyone has mobility so you can't catch shit. Your chance to kill them is the vanishingly small chance that a carry survived lethal burst and the assassin blew all their mobility, stealth, and flash without their team nearby.

Additionally, Challenging smite gives tanks a degree of dueling potential they have never had.\n\nEven in the previous season, tanks were not particularly weak either. Rammus for example, had an absurdly high win rate (54%+) just because of how difficult it is to kill him. ADCs would literally die themselves first from trying to auto him.\n\nNow with the introduction of the new Jungle, everyone can essentially get Rammus's defensive curl with Gromp. Hence, an overwhelming majority of the top win rate champions are tanks.\n\nBuilding MR to counter tanks is a valid tactic; however, ultimately one should not have to build defensively just to fight someone else also building defense. This will lead to a cycle where tank items dominate everything else. \nFor the record, when Talon and LB were dominating mid lane, people also said to \"build armor/MR\" to survive their burst.\n\nAssassins were unkillable partially because of their abilities, but the player behind them must also be decent as well.
