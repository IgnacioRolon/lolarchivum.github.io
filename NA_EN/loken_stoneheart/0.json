Unless you're in Challenger, being good with a champ means a whole lot more than how 'meta' a champ is. There was a guy in Diamond 1 who played Teemo in every role. He made it to Diamond 1 doing that. There's no reason you can't do the same with any other champ except that you're not good enough with them.\n\nThe difference between the best and worst champs is realistically very small in terms of overall power.

You removed the \"outliers\" which are the definition of trash-tier champions to begin with, and even when you're ignoring them its still 20% which is massive. 20% isn't tiny no-matter how you cut it. 50% +/- 5 is a roughly acceptable winrate. That can be explained away by the variables. Anything more than that means that there is something fundamentally weaker/stronger about that champion that massively skews their winrate, and even within the 45-55%, 55% champions are simply better to pick if you can play them. They, for whatever reason, win more. The data pool isn't a small number of matches, its thousands upon thousands, its statistically sound.\n\nNow, onto your point about the low-pickrate, high win-rate champions. They have the highest win-rates because one person plays them and wins 60% of his matches for a day. The next day he might win 40%, but the stats are skewed for the day. Maybe he wins say, 55% of his matches because he's still rising up the ranks. This isn't a fair assessment of his skill, because he's against people currently worse than him. Its a small handful of people playing that champion, all with a potentially similar case as above. That is such a... just a bad argument. First you say that 20% winrate is nothing which is so beyond wrong I can't even begin to explain, and second everybody who has ever taken even the most basic statistics course knows that statistics are useless when the sample size is like, 50-100 matches. It's actually an unfit sample, it **cannot be used.**\n\nAlso, I'll say again-- anyone using a trash-tier champion and doing well, would have easily been several tiers higher if they picked a god-tier champion and learned them instead.\n\nIf you disagree with these claims, you are an irrational person, and truth be told arguing with further will be a waste of time, because you're off in the land of fairies and anime.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2015-03-26T19:44:12.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Loken Stoneheart,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=LWtWAsnG,comment-id=0000000100000000000100000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-26T19:31:09.018+0000)\n>\n> First off, I didn't change my argument, and I wasn't wrong.

There's a reason Riot doesn't do it... because it is ONLY PART OF THE PICTURE. Winrate is one piece of data, if you're ignoring the rest of the data... you're just twisting statistics to try to prove your own point.

Both of these things are just my opinion tho.\n\nThe issue is riot has given plenty of champions horrible tradeoffs,for example if your champions hard counters plenty of champions(for example,lee shits(or shat? not sure about this new jungle item) on plenty of tanky junglers,zed/ahri/le blanc shit on plenty of utility mages),it only follows suits that this champion should have plenty of horrible matchups of his own(you can call it rock-paper-scizzors logic),and if a champion counters little,it only follow suits he will have no counters of his own(or he needs to be a bit overbearing to offset that,orianna is a solid example of how this can work),however this logic is never follow,nobody wants any weaknesses,only strengths,no tradeoffs,kayle counters zed? fucking nerf kayle then,can't have that,then the meta gets stale and we wonder why.\n\nwhen I said \"SHOULD NOT be able to do that\" I mean the champion shouldn't have such amazing strengths without proper weaknesses to offset them,which they never do.(as in,you want to have fizz's amazing mobility,elusiveness and immunity to skillshots? welp,no damage then.)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-03-21T20:54:01.378+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"FInd it odd that some people are STILL complaining about yasuo when currently he's actually considered weak in the meta because of how much Riot nerfed him.","replies":[{"poster":"Loken Stoneheart","date":"2015-03-21T21:11:36.753+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's only weak because of number tweaks.
