We needed new technology, but in this change you damaged the community. Fine, at least we got new tech out of it, right? The boards are... overall more functional.\n\nThen, reworks. So many reworks that messed with what the players loved about the champion. Veigar still only has two abilities, Cass players are **still** waiting for their champion to be added back into the game.\n\nThen, it was changing the \"boards.\" I haven&#039;t seen any developments that didn&#039;t involve generally wrecking what they just forced everyone to. The organization suggestions make no sense, you&#039;re removing GD, so many other things are just _wrong_ with this \"upgrade.\" You opened feedback, we responded. You opened a new thread later, saying you read our feedback. Clearly, you did not, or you did not care for our suggestions. It will be pushed live just as much of a mess as it is now, as with most things.\n\nYet again, another change -- What the hell is even going on with Fiora&#039;s new look? Even if Fiora wasn&#039;t a champion up until now, how is that new **mess** even considered passable? Now, go back, and remember that Fiora is a champion, she already has a look, and people like it. You&#039;ve screwed up two fold here. She wasn&#039;t in need of a Visual Update, you&#039;re just doing it for fun, and you&#039;re destroying her look in the process!\n\nNow, the HUD update. Seriously. The HUD was fine, but the new one is genuinely difficult to use. The proportions are messy, the focus is in the wrong place, key information is hidden in the corners and shrunken to points that it&#039;s practically impossible to make out. Yet **another** absolutely needless mess, where Riot is absolutely ignoring the \"don&#039;t fix what isn&#039;t broken\" philosophy. [This post covers the topic in far better detail.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/VMnYeBhO-the-new-hud-is-an-absolutely-terrible-and-counter-intuitive-addition-to-the-game-here-is-why?show=flat&page=10)\n\nWhen you break things, you&#039;re responsible for fixing them. When you break things just to break them, you&#039;re at fault.\n\nI love this game, but what you&#039;ve been doing to it lately is just wrong. I don&#039;t know whats going on, but there is some serious cleanup to do here. Get your act together, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-23T09:20:57.016+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":10,"body":"I'm not sure how many reworks you can point to and say \"Riot f@cked up\". Veigar was pretty good and is still pretty balanced for a champ who can block dashes and 100-0 a champ with a targeted spell, and while most people agree that Cassiopeia's rework was bad she still isn't the shit tier she was and isn't some no counterplay poison mage who can W Q you and just watch your lifebar tick down to nothing. It's hard to come up with a good idea for balancing poison mages, so they did the best that they could for the moment with the one cool mechanic she had. Even Ryze ended up in a really good state.\nFiora's rework was to bring her in line with a lot of other champions with more pronounced visuals. When they changed the hair and face they discovered that they'd gone too far and hit a nerve with the community, and they've already started changing her splash art.\nThe HUD is mostly a matter of opinion and an aversion to change. Most people will get used to it quickly, the same way they got used to the old HUD when they started playing. I sincerely hope they will add more customization later, but the new HUD is still an improvement with new features, overall better aesthetics and more open space by moving things to focus points on the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-07-23T10:09:47.082+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"**Tristana** - Removed from the game.\n**Cassiopeia** - Rework accomplished nothing and at the end of the day was just a HUGE damage nerf.\n**Zilean** - Removed from the game.\n**Veigar** - Severely gutted, needed multiple changes to become even half as good as before.\n**Mordekaiser** - Was he even reworked?\n**Soraka** - Became more obnoxious than before.\n**Nidalee** - don't even get me started here.

The only thing anyone notices is that he can't just get a Q W Q off. They also reduced his E from 5 seconds to 2.5 sec............HALF!? His Q is also absurdly absurdly bugged. If you literally cast it in the exact same location, 30% of the time it will not trigger. If you cast it twice on a unit/champion who isn't moving but suddenly moves at the very end of the second one landing, it will not attach. They made him unplayable, completely. He is so buggy it hurts. It's no longer about skill, it's becoming about luck.\n\nSoraka's Kit has only recently turned into \"pure healing\". When she was first created, Sona actually had much better healing. But Soraka was the one who could heal **everyone **and restore mana. She used to give passive MR and reduce enemy MR. She can't reduce resistances now, she doesn't give her team any, nor can she regen mana. They've tunneled her into a pocket she must fit into, which is a shame because I was in love with the first.\n\nAlso the Soraka you're referring to was her **FIRST** rework. Her Q originally had MISERABLE damage. They buffed it in season 2 because they wanted her to be an aggressive support instead of a passive one. Morello has always disliked Soraka, so he pushed for her to be more bruiser. And then because of that they removed her self target E, her mana restore, her MR passive, and her MR shred........","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loken Stoneheart","date":"2015-07-23T11:31:54.903+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheFirstGokun,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=1YwIU3ZE,comment-id=000000010001,timestamp=2015-07-23T11:17:35.953+0000)\n>\n> Tristana - No longer removes other champions from the game with two buttons\n> Cassiopeia - Yeah, it's pretty bad\n> Zilean - Can no longer instantly Q W Q for half the opponent's health\n> Veigar - Blocks dashes, can't instantly stun the entire enemy team with E and 100 - 0 half of them with one W cast\n> Mordekaiser - I don't even think so\n> Soraka - No longer spams Starcall to shred an entire team's magic resist, can heal better which is her entire identity\n> Nidalee - Don't even remember her, current presence is just so strong\n> \n> They didn't become competitive picks, but most of these reworks added interesting mechanics and extra strength as a trade off for killing enemies with two buttons.

I don't care that they removed \"toxic\" gameplay, they also nerfed EVERYTHING else about him in the process.\nVeigar's rework is terrible. He was fine. Again, this \"lets remove toxic gameplay. While we're at it, lets nerf everything else, and remove the champion from the game!\" trend hits home. He has a Q and an ult. **His E stopping dashes doesn't mean anything whatsoever because champions will dash BEFORE his E appears, and then they won't be in it anymore. It was a useless buff. Completely. Useless.**\nMorde got a \"rework\" that didn't change anything.\nSoraka's rework was alright, but she isn't picked anymore so was is really a good rework? All they did was make her unviable.\nNidalee was weaker before the rework. They reworked her because she was too strong. See the problem here?\n\nThey didn't become picks period. Almost all of these reworks except for Trist's and Nidalee's, took the champion either out of the standard game, or out of both the standard and professional play. They weren't good reworks. They might have removed \"toxic\" gameplay, but they **also** completely destroyed the champion. They didn't fix the problem, they just removed the problem champion from the metagame entirely.\n\nLets not pretend that **always** being able to escape Veigar's E and W is meaningful gameplay. Its awful, that's what it is.\nLets not pretend that making Nidalee stronger and more versatile was a good decision. It just made her dominate even roles she wasn't picked in before.\nLets not pretend that removing Soraka, Cassiopeia, and Zilean from the game entirely was a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-23T11:46:02.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"In return for using skillshots (and this applies to Ryze too) Veigar and Zilean both got range upgrades.\nVeigar's E got a range upgrade, and the time it takes to appear means you need to use it in situations such as A) your team gets a pick but the enemy team is coming in fast.

Barely anything, especially considering they tripled the amount of time it takes to appear.\n\nYour team gets a pick -- you've already won the fight.  Screw them, they'll get from one end of the event horizon and out the other by the time it drops. Every other zone mage in the game could toss something in there to slow the enemy down, too. It'd probably work better too.\n\nAny of those three coming in to wreck your carry? They aren't coming in alone, the enemy team can **walk around the event horizon, or even through it in many cases.** Again, other champions have better zoning skills anyways.\n\nAllied CC going down? Well. This is the ONLY use of Event Horizon in the game. Shame that it's required for his W to work, too. Guess you can only use 2/4 of your abilities (one of which is a long CD ultimate) until an ally comes along and hard CCs an enemy champion for you!\n\nIts not a skill you can use at all, unless other champions do all the work for you. That is a bad skill. Its only applications are follow ups. I don't know why this is a thing, it makes the champion useless until teamfights, and even during teamfights he has to waddle into killing-range to do anything anyways!\nThe enemy has to actually screw up for you to use more than half of your kit. That is just straight up awful.\n\nNow Zilean. Zilean is a mess. His only damage skill, his CC, and half of his W is all wrapped up in his Q. His Q that he has to land **twice** on the same person to stun them. His Q is too slow to land once, let alone twice. Even when the enemy is slowed by your E, they can still dodge your Q because mobility skills are a thing thrown onto almost every champion in the game anymore.\nHis speedboost and ultimate both got NERFS. His speedboost is no longer capable of making you permanently faster, and his ultimate is no longer affected whatsoever by his W. All of these changes combined made him actual trash.\n\nThey aren't competitive picks, they aren't standard picks. Are you actually suggesting that game balance doesn't matter because you're not a pro? Maybe to you, for whatever reason. The fact that I can't play my favorite champions without **knowing** that without a doubt there is a better champion for the job, that will guarantee me at least another 10% winrate, without the stress of farming for 40-50 minutes to be useful, capable of making plays by myself in ranked SOLOque?\n\nVeigar used to be one of my favorite champions in the game, but he isn't even worth picking anymore. It's disgusting what they did to him.\n\nYeah.

Veigar was pretty good and is still pretty balanced for a champ who can block dashes and 100-0 a champ with a targeted spell, and while most people agree that Cassiopeia's rework was bad she still isn't the shit tier she was and isn't some no counterplay poison mage who can W Q you and just watch your lifebar tick down to nothing. It's hard to come up with a good idea for balancing poison mages, so they did the best that they could for the moment with the one cool mechanic she had. Even Ryze ended up in a really good state.\n> Fiora's rework was to bring her in line with a lot of other champions with more pronounced visuals. When they changed the hair and face they discovered that they'd gone too far and hit a nerve with the community, and they've already started changing her splash art.\n> The HUD is mostly a matter of opinion and an aversion to change. Most people will get used to it quickly, the same way they got used to the old HUD when they started playing. I sincerely hope they will add more customization later, but the new HUD is still an improvement with new features, overall better aesthetics and more open space by moving things to focus points on the map.\n\nViability or not, Veigar and Cassio's playstyles were severely damaged by these changes (especially Cass's. Veigar lost two skills, Cass isn't a champion anymore). Those are really the two reworks I have problems with, but they were really disgusting reworks.\n\nFiora's rework is alright. Her Visual Update is actually awful. Even the updated splashart is awful, and her in-game looks didn't change since the update anyways so its almost a pointless change. Minimal effort to try and appease an angry crowd, rather than actually fix the problem.\n\nThe HUD is not a matter of opinion or resistance to change. It genuinely downgraded the at-a-glance ability to figure out the going-ons of the game. It almost takes genuine **studying ** of the HUD to discern the same information it offered pre-update. It wasn't a good update, it damaged clarity and readability. The old HUD was genuinely better.

Is it really that much harder to read? I know I've been having a perfectly good time with it.\n\nNot only were their playstyles damaged, but the champions are generally useless.\nI'll give you, Veigar is much more playable than Cass. As a standalone champion, he's not even terrible. But, y'know what? He's worse than every other mage I can think of. If he had a W at all, or a faster/better E, he might be worth picking. But he doesn't.\nCurrent Veigar-- you're better off picking a poke/zonecontrol mage. Xerath comes to mind. Because that's all Veigar is good for, poking with his Q, zoning with his E. What happened to punishing people who were stupid enough to waddle right into the tiny master of evil? What happened to picking up a banshee's Veil so that he couldn't stun you? What happened to reacting to the fact that he walked like 100 units toward you, and then used a spell that already had a .25 second delay on it?\nHe lost his ability to even remotely laning phase, and an even remotely competent opponent not only will never be damaged by Veigar, but will in-fact kill him over, and over, and over again because Veigar has no form of self-defense as an immobile mage. Why even pick him? His damage is lower than other burst mages, his poke is worse than poke mages, his zone control is alright but on such a massive CD that he isn't worth picking for that alone, he midaswell not even have CC-- its turned into the previously mentioned \"zone control.\"\nHe is forced to farm all game to become _equal_ to all the other popular midlaners. He's virtually worthless.\n\nCass's rework is actually far, far more toxic than it was before. She takes less skill to play, and there are less ways to play against her. Once she hits the 40 minute mark or whatever point of time she automatically gets her passive, she just mashes E and kills everybody on your team. Such skill, wow! Oh, just kill her! Wait, no, they gave her a heal on her E. Never before has freelo only cost you carpel tunnel!\nBut wait, you say! They nerfed her! That they did. Right back into unviability. Back where we started, with a more toxic playstyle and a similar winrate. Good rework, 10/10.\n\nI'll leave Fiora be. Enough other people have railed this change for me in other posts.\n\nHUD has made:\n* Teammate's status smaller\n* Hidden important information in the scoreboard (TAB)\n* Cluttered the screen with pointless, distracting, \"fancy\" artwork and frills\n* Made everything hard to read because its either smaller, or there is a lack of contrast\n* Everything is crowded together\n\nJust a few things off the top of my head.\nHiding ANY key information whatsoever in the (TAB) scoreboard menu is an AWFUL decision.\nDo you know how hard it is to open that menu while playing the game, without being punished for it? Its impossible. A good opponent will punish you for it, and if they don't its because you backed up to open it up first and punished yourself by losing positioning, and likely CS.\n\nTeammate status is SO small and crammed together in the corner with the minimap and everything else that its practically useless. It isn't viewable at a glance, its far, far too small to do so.\n\nAgain. This new HUD is a travesty. The link in my OP covers it much better than I, myself, am capable of doing off the top of my head, however.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-07-23T10:13:19.718+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Thank you for writing what I would have written if I thought Riot gave half a shit what their customers think.\n\nAnd to the dude saying Cass isn't shit tier, tell that to her 45% win rate, it was better than that pre-rework and didn't require playing a bullshit stacking game for 45+ minutes to have access to her power. http://champion.gg/champion/Cassiopeia\n\nAnd don't tell me it's because she's high skillcap, she was 10x higher skillcap pre-rework, requiring constant attention to the passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-23T20:11:48.443+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that they never really finish what work needs to be done in order to make all of these champion's reworks playable.

Zilean was reworked for simply being toxic, Veigar because of his stun as a support, and Cassiopeia for reasons I don't know.  Coming up ideas for fixing these champions wouldn't be too difficult, it's implementation and reiteration that is hard.  I could easily come up with ideas for each of these champions to spice them up, make them less boring, and allow them to be viable but not toxic.  Examples:\n\nVeigar: Give abilities extra effects when shot into his E.  Q could bounce off the walls, W could be aimed during its flight (paint a path for it?), and his R could deal a big burst of AOE magic damage if it kills the target.\n\nZilean: Needs a new passive.  Q also needs to have a priority for targets it hits rather than closest thing (Champions > Minions > Monsters?).\n\nCassiopeia: There's a whole mess of stuff wrong with her machine gun E and her poisons doing little to nothing.  Right now her and Azir occupy very similar niches (which isn't good imo).

They lowered the cast time on his E a couple weeks after the initial nerf, and then they made it so you can't jump through the walls of his E, which was actually a feature that skill was missing prior. Let us not forget he wasn't a very highly played champ before, it's just that now he has such a bad reputation because of the huge nerf nobody plays him.\n\n If you can give some other examples I'd be glad to give you my opinion on whether or not they righted that wrong, but as far as I'm concerned the majority of what they're doing is positive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I Am Abømination","date":"2015-07-24T01:25:34.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen, the boards, the VUs, now the HUD... when will they stop making this game shittier and shittier?
