He said that he would give it a try and I went to go make his account. But the account I would try to make him would come up as FAILED. So I told him that once we get the game installed then I'll help make his account. We got the game installed but every time we try to open it to get the patches downloaded \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\" would always pop up and asking to close the program. I downloaded it just fine on my laptop and I didn't get this. All I got were slow updates on the patches.\r\nI even uninstalled it, then reinstalled it to see if that we the problem. It's doing the same thing. Same for the creating his account, it keeps coming up as failed.\r\n\r\nSo, can someone help me out with the problem here.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T18:18:54.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, I'd be interested in seeing [a screenshot](https://gyazo.com/) of the error when he tries to create the account. As for the patching issue, it sounds like there may be missing system permissions that League heavily relies on so it can interact with certain files or software packages outside the League folder. I recommend working through the steps in our [Permissions Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) as a first step.\n\nLet me know if anything changes.","replies":[]}]}
