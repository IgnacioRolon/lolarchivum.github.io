Emotion can be expressed through those in-game emoticons if you want to (which has the big advantage that Riot decides what you can and cannot say through it).","replies":[{"poster":"nelogis","date":"2018-04-05T16:24:53.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me how you are going to ping:\n\n\"Hey jungler can you gank top, it's an easy dive\"\n\"I'm going to split bot while you pressure baron\"\n\"Let's do 2 - 0 - 3\"\n\"Wait until bot super minions push then get the turret when they send a guy to clear it\"\n\"Jungler COULD be top side / Jungler has left mid lane to bot side\"\n\nYou can't replace everything with pings and it's going to be too much when you actually could.\nPlus there are a lot of funny fellas out there which use the chat to have a good time with their team and without chat this is going to be so much less fun.\n\nRemoving the chat seems like a terrible idea to me.","replies":[{"poster":"It Hertz When IP","date":"2018-04-05T20:04:53.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nelogis,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LLwqcamR,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-04-05T16:24:53.060+0000)\n>\n> Tell me how you are going to ping:\n> \n> &quot;Hey jungler can you gank top, it&#x27;s an easy dive&quot;\n\nPing: \"Need Help!\"\n\n> &quot;I&#x27;m going to split bot while you pressure baron&quot;\n\nPing: \"On the way!\"\nPing Baron Pit: \"Need Help!\"\n\n> &quot;Let&#x27;s do 2 - 0 - 3&quot;\n\nYou got me there.

Not worth it.\n\nI have played Destiny 2 (a terrible game by the way) which doesn't have a standart chat (seriously it doesn't even have a clan chat).\nEven though it is an MMORPG, I felt so lonely in that game.\nI could have played the whole game in offline modus and it wouldn't have mattered much.\n\nI think the same would happen in League. If there is no chat whats the difference between playing online or with bots? (the skill level yes and your occasional rager with spam pings but lets say the bots are so advanced that they play like actual humans).\n\nIt's the little things like the guy saying \"gl hf\" at the start of the match followed by the \"lol ur mom gay\" that puts a little smile on your face. \nTake that way and it feels so... empty, kind of hard to describe it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riot Decided","date":"2018-04-05T17:46:21.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top Tier Advice","replies":[]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-04-05T12:30:17.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lawl i type that before the announcer can finish saying \"Welcome to Summoner's rift\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"xPhantomDancerX","date":"2018-04-05T09:26:20.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then you also mute yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warlord Scrap","date":"2018-04-05T09:19:07.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"man i thought this was gonna be a git gud post take my upvote","replies":[{"poster":"Sydney26","date":"2018-04-05T09:19:49.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":) i honor your upvote u are my hero","replies":[]}]}]}
