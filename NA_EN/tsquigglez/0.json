Yes, I understand how it works, but why would you tie chest achievements for individual champion performance, and then give out chests to those who didn't earn that performance rating? \n\nIsn't the point \"Earn an S, you get a chest\". Inspiring people to play better and learn more champs?\n\nRather than, \"Earn an S, you get a chest... but earn a D we'll still give you one anyway cause your teammate carried you\". This is like getting a \"A for Effort\", or \"Participant\" trophy. It completely diminishes the sense of pride you get from playing well on that champ and earning your reward.\n\nEarning chests should only be unlocked by individual performance on that champ. Rewarding players for a stellar performance, and rewarding players for expanding their champion pools.\n\nPS: This also dramatically reduces your store revenue. You are giving out more potential free products, to those who haven't earned it, and creating an unsatisfactory experience for those who have.
