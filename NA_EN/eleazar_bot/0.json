Each time I log in it says \"Logging into chat services...\" but it never connects.  I have tried more than a dozen supposed fixes I have seen posted on here.  To include - Hextech repair tool, clearing DNS, repatching, uninstalling and reinstalling, playing around with the date. checking and unchecking the login sound/animation, disabling virus software temporarily, restarting computer, etc.  \r\n\r\nI am not sure if it is just my computer or if it is a wider problem due to a recent patch.  Regardless I would appreciate support from Riot to resolve the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-11T23:09:15.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen another post about this recently.

I know for a fact it's not my internet or my pc and in game shows me at 60ish ms which is standard but the game is playing like i'm on 5k ping. It even disconnects me while in game (my character goes back to spawn). I'm streaming multiple things at the same time and there are no cutoffs anywhere else. Just league.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-12T15:47:17.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any high-ping issues on NA. I'd say that if you're having an issue connecting to chat, it's still a good idea to work through the steps in that guide, even if you don't suspect your network to be problematic.\n\nLet me know the results of those steps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gr1zzz","date":"2016-09-12T14:18:58.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a similar issue that resolved itself after a couple days","replies":[]},{"poster":"BluePenguin98","date":"2016-09-12T14:15:04.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue when I went for a vacation in Tbilisi. The Internet at the hotel was for some reason not allowing me to connect to the chat service. I was able to fix it by connecting to VPN. Though sometimes using a vpn can cause certain issues and might higher your latency, but surely it worked for me with no issue.","replies":[]}]}
