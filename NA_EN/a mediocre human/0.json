This is only happening with league, I think it has to do with the last patch update, but, what do i know. Also, it doesn't crash when it's in the loading screen, just when i go in-game (for example I alt/tab out of the game before it starts, it starts, and i alt/tab in the game and it crashes. Hope somebody can help me, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T15:50:53.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this issue happening for players who recently updated their Windows 10.
