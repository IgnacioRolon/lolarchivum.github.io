It feels too quiet(?) without those lines","replies":[{"poster":"PentaJuke","date":"2016-07-09T05:18:57.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want everything for LeBlancs voice back, everything plz","replies":[]},{"poster":"SylvanasWrunner","date":"2016-07-09T02:15:46.150+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a LeBlanc main, it has been bugging me big time as well.

You can say that she just got Sigil'd of Silence :P\n\nI hope Riot can fix this. I think it might be working as intended though in Riot's part because for Elderwood LeBlanc and Ravenborn LeBlanc, I think it would be better for her to not say her lines and just have the ability's sound play on its own. But then again, classic LeBlanc is much more noisier.\n\nEdit: and as you stated, she is also missing some of her movement and attacking quotes.\n\nAlso, I feel like the implementation of these skins made these bugs exist.","replies":[{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2016-07-09T04:07:38.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SylvanasWrunner,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=1EwtgiWb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-09T02:15:46.150+0000)\n>\n> As a LeBlanc main, it has been bugging me big time as well.
