Her last skin Elderwood was release TWO years and 4 months ago! It&#039;s like Riot is completely ignoring her after the revert. I am starting to think Riot has petty vendetta against LeBlanc. Meanwhile Katarina gets like 2 skins in one  year. \r\nDon&#039;t tell me that there are others who didn&#039;t get skins either. Go ahead and complain about those champs, but I don&#039;t care about them.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaspers","date":"2018-07-18T10:36:35.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:74}}\n\nA lot of champs deserve skins.
