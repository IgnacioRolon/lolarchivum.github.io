She has a barrage of CC: slow, stun and snare. She is really good in team fights.\r\n\r\nHowever, I always felt that she is significantly weaker than other top/mid mages. \r\n\r\nFirst, her total AP scale is 2.35, but you don&#039;t really use E(scale 0.6) for attacking. It&#039;s rather used for escape or teamfight initiation, so the the only effective AP scale would be 1.75. Even AP malphite is more than that(1.85). Of course people don&#039;t play AP malph, but he deals a lot of damage with just two AP items due to high base damage. Blitzcrank has MORE AP scaling by 0.25(again he doesn&#039;t go AP but if he gets 2 Ap items he CAN melt a squishy adc). Because of her relatively low base damage in her Q,W and especially, R, it&#039;s almost not possible to 100-0 your enemies. \r\n\r\nAlso, because of her mediocre scaling and base damage, even if you go full damage build(no RoA and no Ionian boots), your damage output is lower than many other AP mids. Not only that, if you go full damage builds, it&#039;s going to make you very squishy, meaning she has to get one or two utility item for better survival. \r\n\r\nSecond, because of her mediocre AP scaling, she is VERY weak against MR. This is a main reason that I don&#039;t like going to top lissandra unless I am sure I will win. Lissandra has a very formulated item build: RoA-&gt; Zhonya like Swain for the most of time. Because of that, when the top lane oppornents stack MR early, she can&#039;t deal enough damage and push the lanes. Also, when they get MR boots, it makes Lissandra&#039;s CC weaker. Also, since the season 6 started, everyone except AP mages get Malmortious Maw, and to me, this is a particularly huge nerf to top Lissandra. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s think about Velkoz and Brand for example. Both have not super high AP scaling, but Velkoz passive stack deals true damage, and Brand passive stacks deal HP % damage(correct me if I m wrong). They are kinda anti tank. They all have good CC. Lissandra doesn&#039;t have any way to kill tanks. \r\n\r\nThird, her ranges are short compared to AP ranged mages. Q is 725, Wis 450, E is 1050,  and R is 550. \r\nLet&#039;s think about Annie . She has short ranges too(her Q is buffed but whatever), but her scaling is crazy high, and she can AOE stun with her passive+R or passive+W. I think it makes up for her squishiness and short range. However, it &#039;s not the case for Lissandra. She has to approach to her enemies, and one mistake can melt her in milliseconds. Even if you don&#039;t die immediately, if you cast R on your self, you STILL die. \r\n\r\nOverall, she has a very low carry potential. Honestly, I would think she can be a good support if her Q doesn&#039;t interrupt the ADC&#039;s farming, but it both steals CS AND push the lanes without intending it. \r\n\r\nI hope Riot gives her some buff. In current meta, she is very weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2016-07-09T05:39:08.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're picking Lissandra to be a primary carry, you're playing her wrong. She's a mage who brings a shit ton of utility to a team with her CC mixed with a fair amount of burst. I agree that she isn't bringing ENOUGH utility to a team (her Q slow is mediocre and can't even be applied to more than one target, W root sucks early, and what the hell even is her passive?) but I think any attempt to buff her should be looking at what she brings to a team besides damage and buffing that.","replies":[{"poster":"fancyassgrits","date":"2016-07-09T17:55:48.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Doctor Jarvis,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=mP9szEcz,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-09T05:39:08.003+0000)\n>\n> If you&#x27;re picking Lissandra to be a primary carry, you&#x27;re playing her wrong.

I pick her for utility and countering top, but even when I do that Lissandra is not bringing enough damage and utility in current meta. If her damage has to stay same, her CC should get some buffs, like increasing range, stun time, heal amount,etc.","replies":[]}]}]}
