It costs like 3200+ and you are better off getting rabaodn(35% extra AP) or even Lich bane(10% CDR, 8% MS, 80 AP). I mean, you have no reason to get any AD stat. \r\n\r\nSecond, it doesn&#039;t really go with Leblanc&#039;s concept. Her job is to kill enemies and poof back to safety, but getting hextech gunblade means youa re oging to stay near the enemies for prolonged time...but unlike Akali or Kat, LB can&#039;t do that because hse doesn&#039;t have any skill cooldown reset mechanism.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock MD","date":"2017-04-10T06:05:43.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got a few Korean pros and my own match history telling me that you're wrong, bud.\n\nAlso, Gunblade has a 2 second slow.

Its just a different playstyle. You poke hard, then heal up. Poke hard, heal up until the enemy just can't keep up with you. Plus the burst active obviously works well for it. That is why everyone, including the pros use it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2017-04-10T05:55:28.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im not really sure who said hextech gunblade was good on lb... first time hearing of it...
