Should have noticed mid went missing.  Should have noticed my adc was running back because mid said missing in voice communication.\n\nGot rekt in the jungle and no one backs you up?  It sucks but maybe I should have warded.  Maybe I should anticipate getting cheesed and start somewhere else.\n\nGot rekt top cuz their entire enemy team dove?  What the hell was I doing top alone?  I should have noticed everyone was missing except my enemy top.  I should have been suspicious enough to play safe and ward, and refuse getting baited by \"mistakes\" my opponent makes.\n\nMy point is that it's possible to climb, even when it seems everything is against you.  Don't get too stressed out and realize somethings are out of your control.  Enjoy ranked for what it is, a chance to improve.\n\nI've reached as high as D1 86 LP solo-queuing, so please take my words with a grain of salt knowing IT IS POSSIBLE TO CLIMB!!\n\nGood luck to you ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cursed Aegis","date":"2016-05-22T19:40:38.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ What this guy said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeedTits","date":"2016-05-21T14:12:30.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So when you have a good game with another player, do you not add them and try to play with them again?","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-05-22T19:36:35.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.  A large part of this community dont enjoy playing in parties, myself being one of them. It makes the game way too casual and takes away the thing i enjoy most about this game....the serious nature of it. Getting extremely good at it and always practicing to get better. When playing with a group of ppl it turns into everyone dicking around and doing stupid things...which i dont find fun at all. Example.....diving your lane opponent under his turret when its clearly a bad idea...playing with friends you are more likely to do that dumb stuff, whereas if you were playing ranked alone you wouldve never done it b\\c it was a poor decision. Ppl just tend to goof off way way way more when playing in a group....and that isnt fun to a lot of us.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-05-22T19:28:36.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play ranked. Riot has made it pretty clear they dont care about the solo playerbase anymore. They want league to be a filthy casual game you screw around with friends in. I dont have friends who play this game, nor do i want any. The game turns into a dick around playstyle when ppl play with friends, and it ruins what this game is about. Sadly Riot thinks they know best, when its pretty obvious they dont. Dynamic queue is an epic failure and the community hates it.  Theres nothing they could ever do to make me want to play with a party, its just not fun to me like that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-05-22T19:21:47.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"avoiding ranked unless I am in a full premade group.\n\nYes Riot has rendered ranked to only full team games for me this season.\n\nThat is seriously what I am doing since Dynamic is not an enjoyable situation for me as it stands going solo in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fovere","date":"2016-05-22T19:17:31.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just have to accept the situation for what it is before you queue in.\n\nQuality of life has taken a huge hit in ranked, and either you find a way to enjoy playing with/around these groups or you don't play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrDiaga","date":"2016-05-21T14:42:54.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Easy. Because its not really the exaggerated issue people pretend it is, till maybe past gold.\n\nI've not once seen premades. E an issue in my games. On the occasions I've seen them, they lose as much as they win, because they aren't all ultra coordinated voice chat teams like everyone pretends.\n\nMy winrate is just over 50%, so I don't see an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"World Ender","date":"2016-05-21T18:20:45.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, I've only run into premades in ranked 2 or 3 times, and of those times they were no more of an issue than standard solo players.
