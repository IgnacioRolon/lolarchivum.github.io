It is impressive and preseason looks more exciting every week.

It seems more like a supportive rune that, ofc, a support would take.

Like, electrocute can be 3 autos or 3 abilities or whatever mix, for one thing, making it easier to apply. And if electrocute does significantly higher damage then I wonder if the bonus damage taken will exceed the difference in proc damage in many cases. It might be better on champions that aren't building damage, but I don't know why a tank would want precision much anyway (though a tank keystone in the tree could be the whole point for all I know) and for a damage dealer it seems as someone who has not played with it to be inferior to most alternatives.  I'm sure some people will like it and I don't hate it, I just am not sure I would get any use out of it.\n\nFor Dark Harvest, the increased buff duration after 100 stacks is the change that made it look awesome to me. I think it will be really fun on reset champs, whereas in the earlier version it seemed unsafe vs electrocute because it was awkward to enter a fight with the buff so you couldn't burst a person to get your resets going.\n{{sticker:katarina-love}} \n\nFor Guardian, the change to proccing off proximity or ally-targeted skills as well as the addition of the haste are great. I look forward to playing with this on Braum and maybe even Thresh. When it was right click application only and you had a (reduced) cooldown even if it did not proc (which I gather from current tooltip is no longer the case) it seemed too pattern warping to use. Now that it isn't annoying it looks awesome. I might even take on some enchanters if I am not feeling Airie at the time.\n\nFor Arcane Comet the addition of cooldown reduction on successive ability damage changes it completely. I hated (and am still not thrilled about) the unreliability of the damage, but now that the cooldown is going to be lower in nearly all cases it is less punishing to miss. Also, if I am reading correctly, dot champions like malzahar and machine gun champions like ryze can get a noticeable dps increase out of it now instead of just an occusional puff of frustrated wishes.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nFor Zombie Ward it was the addition of your own wards returning as zombies as well. I love vision, but I am more excited by getting more out of my own placed wards than the previous soul purpose of gaining an advantage from the hopefully-usefully-placed-yet-detectable wards of my enemies.\n\nFor eyeball collection this might sound mean but I am just happy it was changed twice, and in my opinion both changes were nerfs. The first iteration was uncapped which annoyed me since between that and gathering storm I expected every single damage oriented champ to have absurd late-game damage even against tanks, which I was afraid would make all melee champs (without untargetability/stealth) required to get the the hp scaling options in resolve in order to survive. The next version was capped thankfully, but it offered pen at full stacks which seemed too good to pass up. Now that it is capped and only AD or AP it can be balanced against absolute focus or waterwalking and also lets me feel that taking zombie ward or ghost poro is an option.\n\nSudden impact I am happy about the current version of because I play a lot of Annie in rotating game modes and ARAM. Moar painful flash-Tibbers = a merrier me {{sticker:sg-syndra}} \n\nI am a little worried that the inspiration keystones (all of them) might be too good in higher level play and get nerfed down till goldies like myself can't make real use of them, but for now they look really neat too.\n\nAnyway, I check surrender at 20 and the forums every single day to see all the changes.  I am just that excited!\n\n{{sticker:vlad-salute}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-10-13T14:06:23.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I were to be designing a damage amp keystone like press the attack (which would be a bad idea because my logic is poor) I would probably make the amp itself slightly larger and significantly easier to apply and then restrict it to either only damage dealt by the champion applying it OR only damage dealt by champions other than the one applying it. In either case I would remove the proc damage.\n\nI believe buffs and debuffs are poorly viewed by riot designers generally because of \"invisible power\" and not being \"visceral\" but a well done visual effect and/or audio queue would make sure the power was visible and apreciable. The ardent fiasco of recent patches has proven that temporary stat buffs at least can be very noticeable, so I expect a debuff could be made similarly so (if hopefully not quite as required/broken).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2017-10-13T06:20:48.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The iteration of PtA currently on PBE has its associated questions, imo:\n\n1. It is rather similar to Electrocute, being a 3-hit effect. It has less damage, sure, but also the general damage amplification that affects all sources of damage afterwards. Also, it lacks an on-target cooldown, meaning that the damage will just keep coming.\n2. Unlike the previous iteration, it lends itself to a more bursty damage pattern - spiking on every third hit instead of getting an increase in DPS every hit.\n3. I take it that it works somewhat like Vayne's W, where attacking a different target resets the counter?\n4. It feels rather generic, being a 3-hit effect (another of these, really?) and a simple damage amplification.\n5. The second effect being a generic damage amplification makes it hit squishies rather hard. Coupled with its bursty nature, it looks quite attractive on assassins. Would there be an argument for the second effect being adaptive penetration instead of a general damage amp?","replies":[]}]}]}
