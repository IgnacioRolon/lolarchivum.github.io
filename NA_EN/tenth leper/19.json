The star guadian skins (esp. Janna), the world breaker skins (esp. Nautilus), the RPG skins (esp. Karthus and Sej) are all very lovely. I also really like the recent splash arts.  I am also one of the people very excited to play with Victorious Maokai, great work there.\n\nAll the non-esports log in screens over the past few months have been pleasant too, and appropriately creepy, crazy, or comforting both visually and audio-wise with regard to the Champs skins or modes being featured.\n\nAnyway, I know that we complain a lot about a lot of things, but you are doing a great job. Just because the botlaneification of Morde made me loathe his gameplay did not make king of clubs less awesome as art for example.\n\nSorry for the ranting, thank you for your craftsmanship and happy Halloween weekend to all you artists there at Riot =)","replies":[{"poster":"Fisher No Chains","date":"2016-10-29T11:08:20.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still thinking about Jhin login screen and \"Mind of the Virtuoso\". \nI mean, that's the best thing I've seen in 3 years of playing the game.\n \nBest piece of music in LoL.
