The addition of a cool down on it tones down the Ezreal/Sona nonsense, and allowing ability hits to proc it opens it to use by all champions, with only slight favor towards poke champs.\n\nMy initial thought on Cool down would be 10 seconds, but it may be better to bump it up to 30 or 40 seconds and make it always give a consumable rather than having a chance.","replies":[]}
