One of those things is this game. It has given me many (many (many)) hours of fun, and has helped me keep in touch with friends that have moved away/married/gotten busy and so on.\r\n\r\nThis year especially you are giving us almost everything we wanted; even things we never expected to actually receive. From Baker Pantheon, to replays, to solo queue, the gifts are most welcome and much loved.\r\n\r\nMost particularly I thank you for Kalista and rageblade buffs.\r\n\r\nI hope you are all enjoying your time this season, and I hope elemental lux is a great hit for you (because though I cannot afford her, she is really beautiful work)\r\n\r\nThanks for the good times rito.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: All I want for Christmas is for rework WW to still track low health enemies, as passively as possible!","replies":[]}
