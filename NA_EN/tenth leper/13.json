If you dont win you arent having fun. And if you do win the enemy team is not having fun. No matter how much you deny it, this is the truth for every competetive long match time games. This is also one of the reasons why they introduced 15 minute surrenders in the first place. If you are losing you have to tryhard or you will keep losing the game and never be able to do anything for 15 minutes. \n\nHey they have 8k gold lead on us in 10 minutes on normals might as well leave and get on my other account and play there. Nope you get reported and banned so you have to sit there and wait until 15 and if even one person says no you go 20 (:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2017-10-26T18:16:13.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think people have trouble having fun when a lot of things in the game are anti-fun. It's not necessarily because of things that are strictly imbalanced in terms of winning/losing. A lot of imbalanced games are really fun. Look at SSBM.\n\nIt's because the design team at Riot keeps putting things in that piss people off, and it's been going on for years. Look at Galio right now. Regardless of whether full AP Galio actually wins more games than other champ, _who the fuck wants to deal with that shit?_\n\nI think the design team has goals that are disconnected from the gaming experience players want to have. It's hard to explain what I mean... it's like, their idea of \"game health\" does not necessarily align with players actually enjoying the game. It can overlap at times but the goals are actually unrelated.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-10-27T08:34:47.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think part of the issue is that, as a long-duration game where you're not allowed to leave, League does generate more frustration than most other games. If you're not having fun in, say, SSB or CoD, you can easily just leave the session on the spot and return at another time. The same goes for any singleplayer game. With League, though, you have to grit your teeth and essentially force yourself to be exposed to a very frustrating experience until the match ends. In the game's current, very snowbally state, where the outcome of a match is often known long before the Nexus actually blows up, this can be particularly anti-fun, as the time between the outcome being decided and the match ending does not at all feel like any real enjoyment can be derived from it.\n\nI also think the issue with Riot's design decisions in the past few updates is often that they try to address a legitimate problem, but do so with a series of unproven, untested mechanics that are kept in the game even after they've proven to be not so great. Much of the Tank Update I feel could be reverted and have a beneficial effect on the game, and I think large portions of the Marksman, Mage and Assassin Updates have had pretty negative long-term consequences as well. Part of the issue I think comes from these updates being rushed to work on a regular content release schedule, as many of the concepts in those updates weren't really explored well (I think stealth needed a bigger rework, for example, and more generally many of the reworks felt incomplete or unnecessary). Really, the issue often ends up being not so much that Riot makes questionable decisions, but that they push them to Live and refuse to really address them until they've done a lot of damage already. We've seen this not so long ago with Dynamic Queue, which generated intensely negative feedback over a whole year before Riot was finally pushed to remove it. Roster updates are also being stopped, so thankfully this kind of issue won't happen in the same way in the future, but I also hope Riot takes a bit more time to delve deeper into the mechanics and systems they want to update, as they're doing with Runes Reforged, so that we don't get half-baked content releases with dubious longevity in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2017-10-27T01:00:15.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope that Summon Aerie keystone makes buff and damage supports more interactive and fun to play, I need to hop on PBE and see how it works so that I don't mess anything up when I play Sona and Rakan.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-10-26T20:48:40.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":". . . Well said, and I would like to get this trend going again like the launch of league.\nI used to take time out of my day to play over 10 matches each day, but more recently I can't do more than a few a week. It hasn't grown stale to me, I still go back to replay much older games that have good story or gameplay, I don't need both to enjoy a game as long as one is great, likewise I don't want better graphics if they get in the way of functionality. \n\nHowever I'd have to agree that riot hasn't been keeping much reason to stay; so in no particular order of importance.\n - Speeding up the game to the point, whoever dies first, about always looses. \n - Towers quickly become inconsequential thanks to even the minions snowballing.\n - Neutral objectives are often trivial to take, but offer game-changing power. \n - Right hand vs left hand ignorance when it comes to balancing. \n - Client stability coming into question almost alternating months.\n - Matchmaking has gotten worse in recent years, ranked and normals, rift and abyss.\n - Severely selective limited time alternate game modes.\n - Mishandling of the increasingly hostile social environment.\n - Blatant focus on their esports above all else.\n - General disregard for feedback on the pbe unless it's money related, like the store or skins.\n - Rewriting lore just to make champions popular, removing what made them interesting.\n\nThe issues weren't nearly as bad when the game started out. They didn't drag their feet for months to fix something significantly out of place, they had very few favorites when it came down to game design; they also listened to and implemented fair fun, to keep outliers from being frustrating to fight, but keeping them great to play as. Sure they still screwed up time to time, and had added some bad ideas, but they weren't so inept about fixing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Dyment","date":"2017-10-26T19:48:33.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play often, but when I do it is with my friends.
