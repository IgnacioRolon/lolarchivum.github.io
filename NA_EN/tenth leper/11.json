Who against? Is a support item even a support item without cdr? (These are the jokes people)\r\n\r\nAlso, what about banner? I only built it when I needed both AP and MR and either already had or for some reason could not use abyssal. I suppose it has always been good against all AP teams on aram too now that I think about it. I think it might actually see more play rather than less with these changes.\r\n\r\nAre you guys and gals happy with the new direction?","replies":[{"poster":"Irelia Bot","date":"2016-11-04T05:36:02.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering I am guilty of buying Banner of Command on Irelia in it's reworked form, anyone who is building somewhat tanky could consider locket or banner now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-04T14:52:41.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hadn't even considered I reliable for banner but I can see what you mean now.

Its got better stats now and the active i think will be better for enguages and disenguages. Sort of a \"pick and choose your team fight\" tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2016-11-04T14:51:41.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really interesting thank you for helping me.","replies":[]}]}]}
