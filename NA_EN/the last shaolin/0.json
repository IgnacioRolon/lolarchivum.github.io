The afk part was because 3 of the players were premade and went afk because ''they were high and had to feed their fish'' which explains me wanting to report them and not bothering with an un-winnable 2vs5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eggzoski","date":"2017-08-21T19:54:38.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a Rioter but it seems you are lucky that it was only a chat restriction punishment. Judging by these chat logs, you spent more time chatting than playing the game and focusing on yourself instead of your teammates. Not sure if troll post but you totally deserved every bit of this.\n\nWhich part of Verbal Abuse report option you didn't understand? You can't go around and calling your jungler retarded, and then acting like a child (which you probably are) by saying \"gg I go afk\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-21T22:28:59.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, it doesn't necessarily look like you were going over the top with what was said, that doesn't neglect the fact that your comments weren't the shining example of sportsmanship either. From your side of things alone, it looks like you might have been arguing quite a bit with your teammates which may have led to them reporting you. Overall, you're still more than welcome to reach out to us in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) where we can go over all of the context of those chats with you.","replies":[]}]}
