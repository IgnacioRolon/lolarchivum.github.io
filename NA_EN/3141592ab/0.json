Because the mission says that brand may be on either team and it doesn't specify that it has to be pvp, I thought this would complete the mission. However, it is still listed as incomplete in the quest list. Am I reading something wrong or is this unintended behavior?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-22T03:48:01.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That mission doesn't state that it needs to be PVP, but I believe it does mention that it needs to be a matchmade game. Bot games aren't considered to be matchmade, since the opposing team is comprised of AI, which is why that mission isn't completing.","replies":[{"poster":"3141592ab","date":"2017-08-22T06:35:38.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, its just confusing since for previous missions, co-op vs. AI counted as matchmade games","replies":[]}]}]}
