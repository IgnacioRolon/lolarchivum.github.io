I recently had to reinstall league since i couldn't go into games anymore and my resolution was messed up. I tried to fix it by doing the instructions below.\r\n\r\nSure thing! Go to the following folder: C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and edit Game.cfg with notepad.\r\n\r\nThere you'll find this two lines:\r\n\r\nWidth= 664(My specs of hdtv)\r\nHeight=  1176\r\n\r\nAlthough the game now fits the screen ( I can see the scoreboard at the top and sides aren't cut) other things seem to be weirdly proportioned. Names on top of champions heads, the health bar is bigger on champions and minions, the minimap has huge circles for towers and inhibs (bigger than normal) and champion circles in the minimap are huge.\r\n\r\nEverything is just not right. Does anyone have any idea what I can do?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T23:33:16.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, this isn't a standard resolution. TV's generally don't make great monitors because they often run slightly different resolutions than regular computer monitors and can cause issues such as this. I'd recommend trying a normal 16:9 resolution such as 1280x720 or 1024x576.\n\nLet me know if either of those resolve this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lahcus","date":"2016-09-30T04:44:30.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I tried to change my resolution to one of those two and the first one doesn't fit the monitor (cuts off all edges) and the latter resolution makes my screen more yellow even though it fits the screens. I've played a few games with it like this, I suppose i can try to get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-02T15:48:11.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes it more yellow? That's really strange. Make sure your picture/display settings such as colour tone and backlight/brightness are properly set on your TV. Sometimes changing resolutions can reset these settings.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gear Jammer","date":"2016-09-27T01:36:15.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"grab your remote click the pic size button... fixed (it may be under options but does same thing)","replies":[{"poster":"Lahcus","date":"2016-09-30T04:47:16.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont havea pic size button on my tv remote. what option are you suggesting i should change?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nachocheeseeeee","date":"2016-09-25T00:59:39.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, I've been having the same problem since last week.","replies":[{"poster":"Lahcus","date":"2016-09-25T17:08:05.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and no luck? no solutions? did you try anything to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"nachocheeseeeee","date":"2016-09-25T22:02:30.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lahcus,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=NMx6Ej6t,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-25T17:08:05.976+0000)\n>\n> and no luck? no solutions? did you try anything to fix it?\n\nnope.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
