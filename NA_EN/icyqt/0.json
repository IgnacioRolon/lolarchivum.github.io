I still cannot find a post anywhere with a solution. I'd love to have riot fix this issue soon so I could play with the new content. Or give me the old client back because I didn't lag at all with that one. (I don't have a toaster for a computer either, the lag is entirely because of their client). \n\nI sit at 60-70 ms the entire game with around 150 fps, yet all my abilities are slightly delayed and I lag as if i have 500 ms or 30 fps. It's in weird small bursts. By late game it's less severe ( if I can sit through a game to late game ).\npls help, riot. {{summoner:7}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T16:59:55.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing packet loss which can appear as input delays, lag spikes, or unresponsiveness without impacting your ping.

This makes the game unplayable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXWarrior898Xx","date":"2017-11-27T00:20:53.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a problem similar to Corigg's. I will still be able to move and use abilities, but no animations will go on and new units won't load in, so if a champion comes into my view I won't see him until I catch up. My champion will appear to glide around and take damage from nothing. I have had lag problems before but nothing like this, so I don't believe it is an internet issue.

Before the first game I noticed it in, the only out of the ordinary action I did was run \"Logitech Gaming Software\" for the first time on my computer. Needless to say the game was horrible. Initially tried re connecting and such. \n\nIn my searches I came across this post by Riot\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761934-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Issues\n\nwhich recommended I uninstall any 3rd party gaming software so I did that. \n\n\nI hope this helps.
