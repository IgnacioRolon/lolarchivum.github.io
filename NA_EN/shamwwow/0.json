I was able to get the following ports unblocked and I was told this was what is needed.\r\n5000 - 5500 UDP\r\n\r\n8393 - 8400 TCP \r\n\r\n2099 TCP \r\n\r\n5223 TCP \r\n\r\n5222 TCP \r\n\r\n80 TCP \r\n\r\n443 TCP \r\n\r\n8088 UDP and TCP \r\n\r\nI tried the other week and I was able to get into a solo custom game, but I didn't try any other game modes. This week we attempted to get into a custom but we were unable to connect. What was weird though was that one of our players was able to get into a solo custom game, but was unable to connect from there. What happens is we are able to get through champ select and get to 100% in the loading screen. From there though we are disconnected. Why was I able to connect last week and why was our one player able to connect once? What should I do? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-03T21:39:59.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a school club for league sounds amazing, and I really want to see this come to fruition!  Your school likely has the rules set for security, and I wouldn't encourage trying to bypass that.  Your best bet would be to reach out to your school's IT or administration, and be direct with them.  Let them know what you need and win, and I'm sure they'll be able to assist.","replies":[{"poster":"Shamwwow","date":"2017-02-04T22:11:22.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! Sorry that I didn't make this clear in my initial post, we went through our school's IT department to get the ports unblocked. We learned that out IT department is willing to do whatever we ask, but we don't know what to ask in this situation. Is there something on our that needs to be done? Or does the IT department have to do something? Assuming the IT department has to do something, what should we be asking them to do? The fact that we were able to connect sometimes is what's really throwing me off.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T22:15:46.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for following up, and I'm glad to hear they're willing to work this out!
