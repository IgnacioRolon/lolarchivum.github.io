Riot plz address this finally.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"So lets be real Riot. I love the changes in 6.6 to things like shyvana and Yi to make them choose about if they should go full damage or a sub-par tanky damage, it puts an option on the table for those players. I just feel that you missed the mark by not addressing the tank Akali build. \r\nFar to many times I have seen an Akali build nothing but boots and 5 tank items and become unkillable no matter how much she is focused  (to be fair this seems like it should work)  but the fact that she can still out damage every other champion in the game who is building full damage is just ridiculous. As you have nurfed/buffed other champions to make a situation like this impossible for them I am shocked that Tank Akali is still a thing that has yet to be looked at.\r\n\r\nOne good (not even epic) Akali player should not be able to tank and kill an entire team single handed. When you add in the other 4 players on her team its GG, with no way to stop it.\r\n\r\nPlease put some thought and effort toward this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(also posted in Gameplay. didnt know which it fell under)","replies":[{"poster":"the Anarchit3cht","date":"2016-03-30T05:35:22.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hoLeee shit. i got wrecked by an akali who build sunfires, titanic hydra etc. she was brutal as shit man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alasarcher","date":"2016-03-29T22:18:46.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing to address, her tankyness comes from items.

Her E only deals 130 damage on max rank. Her Q 115, 260 total when procced. Her ulti deals 100 damage on first rank 175 on 2nd. Her base full combo does 490 damage. With MR it goes down to 350-400. Her damage as \"tank akali\" came from Sunfire Cape and Hydra which got nerfed. Also if she builds Thornmail she will do some damage too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AkaIihoIic","date":"2016-03-30T00:47:27.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like they did with Master Yi.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AkaIihoIic","date":"2016-03-30T00:46:27.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick Darius, Nautilus or Tahm Kench TOP vs Akali.

Akali in general is pretty busted as a character; if she is too strong she dominates, and if she is too weak she is useless. It makes her a nightmare to balance, as converting her base damage to ratios would make her even more feast or famine as a champion, and flat out nerfing her would gut an already struggling champ.\n\nI imagine she will not be touched much unless metagolem akali continues to be out of hand. I suspect riot wanted to see how the 6.6 changes indirectly affected her instead of just switching her base/ratios around.\n\nReally she just needs a rework.","replies":[]}]}
