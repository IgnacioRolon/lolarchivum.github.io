This does extend to searching in champion select as well; but as far as marketing goes, when somebody is looking for a new champion to buy, pointing them toward champions for the role they are looking for is useful. *(Personally, I think the system as a whole should be updated. If I were to create a new system right now, I would use a 2 tag system: Primary roles/lanes would be the first, and would label someone as a Jungler/Top, or as Mid/Support, or as Bottom Lane Marksman, ect. The second would list strengths of the champion; for example. Ziggs can be tagged as having/being Safe. Pusher, and Harass. I would like to consider letting players vote on tags, as well, to keep up with the meta, but that has its own issues*\n\n* **Whats the possibility/likelyhood of seeing more types of goods to purchase? Or something else to dump IP on?** As you can probably tell by my account name, I have much IP to spare; and I'll always find an excuse to purchase more RP.\n\n* **So if you handle icon rewards, what kind of decision power do you have on rewarded events?** I'd really like to see more LoL events like the Ionia, Frejlord, and recent Shurima events, of course; but I'd like to see more cool stuff for both lore and Riot interaction in general. Everything from Riot vs Community games/Arams/tourneys for glory or icons, to permanently instated events/icon rewards **(Basically achievements of a sort)** for things like gifting, level milestones, owning every champion, X number of normal wins in a game mode, playing every mode X times, owning all the skins for a champion or a skin set (Commandos, for example), and so on. I just feel there is more that can be done with this without ruining the experience for people\n\n* **This suggestion is a stretch; but I think it may be needed. Is there a possibility of awarding a free runepage and X amount of IP for reaching level 30?** This is mostly for ranked play; I don't feel like 2 rune pages and a tiny champion pool are often enough to jump right into ranked play; and this can benefit people who will play with both newly 30 players and smurfs alike; it may help reduce the number of people who run into ranked at level 30, and can only play 1 role and 2 champions reliably\n\n* **Runes suck.** I have 3-4 digits spent on this game, and thousands of games over 3-4 years; I still don't have a 'complete' (IE, Useful) set of runes with runepages. On top of that, there are plenty of runes that are noobait (Gold quints...), runes that are basically still mandatory (HP instead of armor, now), runes that are either broken/mandatory or useless (% HP runes on heavy HP tank jungles), and general inconsistency in pricing while still managing to cost a small fortune. **Runes are probably my last major gripe with the design of this game, outside of the gameplay.** I like the general business model, I'm happy with progress made in graphics, Im happy with the direct of the client changes and upgrades, I like the store, I like the skins and release schedules; but I hate runes. It has so much potential as a way to \"Customize\" your gameplay, but ends up being ruined from imbalances and cost of the systme as a whole **Are you guys looking into this at all?**\n\n> * **New Irelia and Thresh skins pls kthx**\n\nThat's it; apologies for the word wall and thanks for doing this AMA!","replies":[{"poster":"Hippalus","date":"2014-10-01T22:03:51.952+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of great comments/questions here - your thinking is pretty aligned with ours and I think you'll be happy about changes you see in the next year.","replies":[{"poster":"QuestForDankWeed","date":"2014-10-01T22:19:20.970+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":2,"body":"> A lot of great comments/questions here - your thinking is pretty aligned with ours\n\nHire me pls\n\n> you'll be happy about changes you see in the next year\n\nMy hype train is loaded with coal and ready to leave the station.

Not attending those is in most cases a monetary problem the same as not buying RP is.  Will you do that and stop giving stuff out at those events if the surveys comes back like that?  I bet not and I don't necessarily think that's the right thing to do but I do think you should be consistent.

For example, people with lots of lifetime RP could receive a discount on any content purchased with RP (maybe 5-25% off) or during the regular sales of skins/champs, they could get a 60% discount or something. This doesn't mark anyone special to the public, but still reciprocates the loyalty that is shown by some customers who spend a lot on the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jame Gumb","date":"2014-10-01T21:19:30.226+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to give thoughtful responses!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yuchino","date":"2014-10-01T20:58:23.460+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Though I would think that having a summoner icon to be recognized and appreciated would be better than none at all, if the buyers knew the alternative was that there would be no lifetime rewards.\n\nWhen was this survey conducted?

We're focusing on fixing up some of the foundational problems in the store right now but we've been exploring the concept in some new layouts.

Like cards or mobile purchases because, I have to get someone to buy RP FOR me, it would usually cost me DOUBLE the usual cost cause of currency difference AND the buyer's interest (30 % ) and it's just not something I'm happy about to be honest, I WANT to support you guys and spend some money on the game if I'm buying something I like but spending DOUBLE every single time I wanna get something is pretty inconvenient don't you think?","replies":[]}]}
