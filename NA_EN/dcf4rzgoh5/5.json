There was no real thought put into making that game. it is just here you go some stuff that does some stuff.\r\n\r\nit's not brilliant in design like dota2, and league is ok. league is better than smash atleast in terms of brilliance. but league is not as brilliant as dota2.\r\n\r\njust not enough in smash to interest me. it's just too kiddy, and not enough there. it's good for the younger audience i guess. i remember when i was like 12, i played smash brothers for n64 and loved it. not any more. the 3ds doesn't feel as good.\r\n\r\nthe 3ds itself gives me headaches after only a few minutes of looking at it's screen. and the design of the 3ds is dorky looking. i don't look cool holding that. i do look cool holding an nvidia shield. 3ds doesn't match that. also my phone has much more entertainment and fun than a 3ds could give me. my phone is even better than the 3ds. which is sad for the 3ds.","replies":[]}
