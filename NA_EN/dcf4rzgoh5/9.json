Hooked it up. Then I couldn't click on things with precision, it actually drastically made using my computer alot harder. Then I went into mouse settings made it slower, still was annoying to use. I think the only thing a razer naga is good for is the appearance, but that is shallow, and no one really cares about that. I honestly don't care about the 70 dollars being spent, as I am rich but, I am still going to return it. As for the numbers on the side. They mimic the number pad. I already have great dexterity in my left typing hand where I can hit a wide array of buttons with ease and precision. I set my in game buttons so my left hand is in typing position which alllows me to reach more keys than if my pointer finger was on the e or r. with my pointer finger on f. i can now reach every key my hand would as if in typing position. so there is little need for me to use the number pad on the Razer Naga mouse. I guess if I was a bad typer, or played with my left hand in bad form, then yes I could use the Razer Naga number pad, but then again, why would u do that, when u could just learn proper left hand positioning, which also translates over into regular typing skills.\n\nMy old cheap crummy dirty logitech mouse feels so much more smooth and easy to use. and fits my hand so much better. that is another thing about the Razer Naga, is that I didn't like the way it fitted my hand. My hand so much more comfortable on my old crummy dirty logitech mouse.\n\nTommorow going to go return my Razer Naga, but I am glad I purchased the Naga and used it to remove any thought in my mind about a Razer Naga being desirable. I am too tired today to return it. as I go to bed for the night at about 2pm. i get up at midnight every day. right now it is almost 2pm and i am tired. cause i woke up at midnight.","replies":[]}
