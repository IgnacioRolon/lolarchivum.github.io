That means his Q is on a 5 second cooldown. You are not drain tanking with that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-20T13:44:14.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone can be a drain tank because anyone can build lifesteal and attack speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2018-06-20T13:32:46.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?","replies":[]}]}
