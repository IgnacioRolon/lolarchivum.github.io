Thought it was a 1 time thing so went in que again and it happened again. Played a custom and it was fine, played doom bots and it was normal, played ranked and it worked.\r\n\r\nThen today I come home form work and que up for ranked and again it crashes so I have 3 leave games now (all were remade) because for some reason league is crashing on some ranked games but not all of them, what gives? My computer hasn't done any recent updates except a windows update that happened earlier in the week but league was working fine then.\r\n\r\nPretty pissed that I have 3 game losses and am now stuck in low priority que because of this, trying to get gold 5 and I'm silver 1 and now silver 2 from crashes","replies":[{"poster":"Ball Vinny","date":"2016-10-22T18:37:57.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a recurring issue that I have also posted about.\n\nIt seems to happen more often when you change your preferred pick as soon as someone else locks in. The game will just crash completely and you will have to restart the client. I have had a few 5 minute wait timers because of this. This happens across several computers and connection types. There are others with this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Ball Vinny","date":"2016-10-22T18:38:31.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Posted about this on a different account.*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-22T17:47:49.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you currently running any third party programs?  Apps like play.tv, recorder, overlays, etc can cause crashes in champion select and don't always play well with league.  If your issue continues, then there may be other problems like network issues losing connection to the game server.  I'd recommend going over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide as well to be sure.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
