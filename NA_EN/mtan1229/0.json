I think what you're looking at is a capture from a Skins Spotlight video/screen caps, which is likely PBE coverage. The textures that originally went on PBE weren't what shipped to live. So, the textures were changed, but it was during the development of the skin itself, but not post release. \n\n*Left is original, right is what shipped.* These are just the flat textures, so the normal map lighting isn't applied. ^^  The left texture was submitted in late June of 2014, and the right was submitted in early July of 2014, which is around when this guy was shipping. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/FZqziP2\n\nI didn't see anything post release - I checked for things like texture rebalances/any changes when the chromas for this guy came out, and nothing appears to be changed.\n\nPlease feel free to call me out on anything if you think it's incorrect, this is just what I've found from checking out the file history for this skin. :)","replies":[{"poster":"mtan1229","date":"2018-04-17T01:12:20.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the correction.
