I haven&#039;t noticed if other particles/effects were missing other than this one. I haven&#039;t tried for any of his others chroma skin since I don&#039;t own them.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-01T19:45:34.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! \n\nThanks for reporting this! Unfortunately, it's been an issue since the launch of these (super sorry about that!) We have someone looking into this issue today. Thanks for your patience. <3","replies":[]}]}
