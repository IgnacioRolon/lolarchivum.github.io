He'd bug splat, but then he'd be able to play the game through but would have to restart once the match was over.  Deciding to reinstall, he's now been hit with an issue of just not being able to do it. Usually he gets to 30-40% before bugsplating and then it restarts at a lower percentage. \n\nWe've been trying various 'fixes' and ways to install the game all day but still no dice when it comes to getting it to work.  Any suggestions about approaching this?\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} \n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-20T17:16:26.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito Board here!  It's hard to say why your friend is bugsplatting, but I appreciate you reaching out for him.  Sometimes this can be caused by bad drives, bad game files, or a hardware issue.  Have him go through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to rule out any possibilities and get it fixed up.  I hope that helps!  \n\nRito Board out!\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dalderam","date":"2016-08-21T00:10:20.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Porocles and thank you for getting back to this! \n\nFrom what he's told me, he's already seen that and been through the entire thing but still no dice when it comes to  installing. After he uninstalled yesterday, we had him go through it and tried other things that people on the boards/reddit have said and still nothing. Still gets stuck at 30-42% bugsplats and then gets knocked back to 30 or lower.\n\n{{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}]}
