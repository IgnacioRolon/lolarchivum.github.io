I&#039;m a huge lore fan, my favorite character is Jhin, and we know that he was sent to Noxus at a certain point !  So I went on the wikia and I read as much as possible about Swain, Noxus, Boram Darkwill, and I know a lot of those things aren&#039;t canon anymore, but a theory came to my mind : **Jhin was sent to Noxus to kill Boram Darkwill**\r\n\r\nI was not sure at all if Boram Darkwill will be kept canon, but in [Swain Special Interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaGaqTW6QPQ) we learn that he is still canon !\r\n\r\nSo here&#039;s my theory :\r\n\r\n&gt; - Boram Darkwill decides to invade Ionia;\r\n&gt; - Ionians fight back;\r\n&gt; - Khada Jhin is freed;\r\n&gt; - Swain looses is arm to Irelia;\r\n&gt; - Swain found the demon (Beatrice ?);\r\n&gt; - Noxus is defeated and they head back to Noxus Prime;\r\n&gt; - Swain is ashamed of Darkwill and he wants to take control of Noxus;\r\n&gt; - Jhin is sent to Noxus to kill Boram Darkwill (and 3 other people)\r\n&gt; - Swain then takes the control of Noxus and becomes Noxus Grand General.\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nI&#039;m pretty sure I can be wrong, but this theory hypes me too much !\r\n\r\nThank you for reading ! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2018-01-24T16:07:03.137+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm a huge lore fan, my favorite character is Jhin, and we know that he was sent to Noxus at a certain point !\n\nWait.

Knowing Jhin, if Draven was killing stuff I imagine Jhin would watch it atleast once. So I feel as if Jhin went to Noxus but according to Urgot's lore who was Boram's headsman/executioner I imagine Jhin went to Noxus after Boram's death. And when Jhin says, \"I've been asked to do performances in your nation.\" He (if you didn't know) is referring to assassinations as he is an Ionian assassin freed by a shadowy council. So with the evidence there is a sort of 50/50 chance that Jhin may have killed Boram or if Boram was killed by Swain. Swain has obvious motives for the death of Boram to claim the throne in a 3 leader position and break the hierarchy. Although Boram's death may have been circumstantial which I imagine is unlikely. All we can hope for is that Riot sheds some light on Barom's unconventional death.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2018-01-24T14:36:23.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bit hard for Ionia to beat a huge empire that's actually in control of most of Shurima even... Plus with the new lore Ionia has issues with Vastanians, and if Noxus sees them as strong enough they might actually aid them and in that theory, Ionia would be a huge ruin in a war between them and the Noxian empire, no matter in which period. Especially in the Darkwill period as he was a pretty strong Grand General and Marcus Du Couteau was still present in that time and could of made Irelia like a joke... Just saying. And Jhin doesn't actually fit in the whole thing as the Tyrant needs to win his throne by cunning means, not by hiring a paid gun. \n\nAnd C'mon. We speak about Swain and LeBlanc... Jhin is like a total joke next to these two, especially while they are a duo.  LB literally took Demacia's throne and pretends to be Jarvan... What's Jhin got to show compared to that cunning?","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2018-01-25T06:17:31.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">What's Jhin got to show compared to that cunning?\n\nArt.
