I can&#039;t move up because of these afk&#039;ers or feeders. My last game there was a player that chose riven to go against a nasus. That player rage quit and left the nasus fed. I can&#039;t move up because of afk&#039;s, feeders, or bad players. But usually due to afk's. I lost my series because i got 2 afk's in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-17T06:24:39.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Since you are the only constant in the game (assuming you solo queue) you have a higher chance of not having an afk or feeder on your team assuming you do not feed or afk.\n\nYou just don't notice it as much because you are not upset with the person doing it.
