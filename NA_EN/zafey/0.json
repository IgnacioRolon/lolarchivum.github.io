I brought up task manager and closed the program, but when I finally entered the game the team was voting on /remake. I pressed no on the surrender vote with at least 25 more seconds on the vote count. I was moving around but the game still ended and I got penalized for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-07T17:52:37.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're seeing such a long time to connect to games, it's likely you're experiencing a poor connection to the server.
