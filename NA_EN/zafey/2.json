I don&#039;t condone toxic language in game or in real life, so I often report a teammate ( probably at least once a day. Yeah lots of toxic people. ) or someone on the opposing team if the person is using /all.

Basically if you keep reporting falsely the system goes, \"Eh, this guy again? Probably more junk.\"\n\nThere isn't like a ban or restriction or anything. Something like that could easily backfire and punish innocents.","replies":[{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2016-08-19T21:56:47.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But does the punishment system read that?
