Like 2 days ago it was the \"Bad Image\" which I fixed at the hands of some help form the devs. But now this dreaded error has come back to haunt me. This little \"Network Warning\" pops up every time I'm in the loading screen of a game, and I've spent all day looking through here, the Reddit, and it seems as if people have had this problem before. But Riot hasn't really come out with a solution for it. This has happened to me before, but last time I just uninstalled and re-installed, but now that doesn't work and I can't find a solution to it. If anybody has help or has had this problem before, or is going through it right now, please let me know. I know it's happened to others before, I just want to make sure that I'm not the only one going through this problem right now. (Also I DO have the HRT but it's not working so please if don't suggest that, but any help will be appreciated.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-06T03:17:46.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That HRT probably won't be able to help much in this situation since this seems like your network is simply losing it's connection with our server while it's on the loading screen.

It didn't work and i almost got a leaverbuster because of this. Looking through the boards this problem has been occurring since season 5 and you guys haven't realized and absolute fix. If you go to your browser search bar and type \"Network warning league of legends\" You will find that many have had this problem. Please find a fix to it and when you do please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-07T03:02:52.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you definitely shouldn't be trying these troubleshooting steps in a live game knowing that your client is a little screwy.
