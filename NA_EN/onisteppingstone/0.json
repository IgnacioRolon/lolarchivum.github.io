All of his other skins had a unique pillar..\r\n\r\n...I feel like for this skin it might be a good idea to have a  red british phone booth pop up for his pillar. Any thoughts on this and possibly tweaking the skin?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-07T16:22:34.172+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think of the traffic cone? ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Turrant","date":"2014-11-07T17:03:00.323+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOVE IT","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2014-11-07T17:20:21.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you use Constable Trundle for the name of the skin?\n\nI mean, come on, it's clearly a Bobby, so why not Bobby Trundle or something who mix both :p","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-11-07T18:21:32.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why did you use Constable Trundle for the name of the skin?\n> \n> I mean, come on, it's clearly a Bobby, so why not Bobby Trundle or something who mix both :p\n\n'Cause Trundle and Volibear are meant to be captains, not just any old officer! Besides, Trundle's name is Trundle, not Bobby! (Bad jokes are funny, right?!

I'd make a witty copyright joke about Dr. Who, but I haven't seen enough of it to do so.
