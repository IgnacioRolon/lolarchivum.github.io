Let me know!\n\njust had another incident within 30 seconds ago where the game client counted down to zero for the game to start - then it freezes and says i left champ select so i lose lp for nothing\n\ndidn't even have any youtube tabs open and yes i was running on low spec mode, why does the league client keep crashing? it's been like this since i first started using it so i'm always going back to the legacy client where things worked properly","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-14T20:24:50.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info.  There could be quite a few reasons causing it, like an unstable connection or if you have any third party programs running.  It sounds to me like your network is failing to transition from champion select to the game server and leaving you behind.

I know it's a long list, but it's really important to go through each step because they help rule out possibilities with local network issues.
