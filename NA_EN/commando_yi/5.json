Devourer has been removed and rageblade has been reworked into a mediocre item he can&#039;t make use of anymore.\r\n\r\nI think he&#039;s due for some buffs. For those that are worried he&#039;ll start terrorizing low elo again, his performance appears to be mediocre in bronze/silver right (45-46% respectively) over the past month so I think we have plenty of room for buffs without breaking him in lower brackets.\r\nhttp://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-08-08T00:29:27.961+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yi is not an assassin\nhttps://champion.gg/champion/MasterYi\nhe's a little on the low side but eh. more champions deserve buffs than him","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-08T01:22:12.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is room for a total yi kit overhaul.\n\nHis kit and playstyle are too binary to ever be truly balanced.","replies":[]}]}
