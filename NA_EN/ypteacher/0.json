This has also happened to me on 2 separate accounts of late. I would like to point out that I have never scripted at any point in my 2 years of playing, I don&#039;t even know how to do it or what it involves, the only thing I knew was the term as it basically applies in low elo all the time because if you dodge any skillshot you are scripting (this was a genuine comment i had from an opposing adc when I played).\r\n\r\nNow you would think riot would be quite respectful here because they have permabanned someone for something they haven&#039;t done, you would think they would have the chance to defend themselves and actually make it clear that this has not happened. I mean you can watch any games on the YPTeacher or ErAtran accounts (both EUW) and it&#039;s absolutely blatantly obvious that I am not scripting. In all the time I&#039;ve been playing, I was only accused of it once, and that was a vayne on the enemy team going up against my miss fortune, now I run heavy lethality investment on my rune pages (24 lethality, 216 scaling health and 27 scaling mr) which means at lvl 3 (at which point i have 2 points in my q) I can do around 40% health as damage with a q crit. I was accused of scripting buffing my damage output all game (which is kinda dumb because everyone knows that MF has a safe and decent laning phase). \r\n\r\nBut this is it, Riot do not. The response I got was &#039;we do not go into the specifics to compromise any future investigations&#039;. The reality is this is complete nonsense. The truth is they can&#039;t reveal any evidence because there isn&#039;t any because IT NEVER HAPPENED. Riot simply do not want to admit that they messed up and after a couple of weeks of back and forth all I get are copy paste answers of &#039;we believe you scripted and in order to protect the integrity of competitiveness in our game, you were banned for scripting&#039; and links to terms of service and god knows what information as responses to questions that were not asked. I even said well ok tell me the exact games where you found &#039;evidence&#039; and then watch the games, I even offered them to look through my computer for any files or programmes which compromise my client, but that fell on deaf ears to riot&#039;s support team.\r\n\r\nSo it would be bad enough if it was just one person this was happening to right? Well I have had several friends contact me via social media who also play the game who have had the same nonsense happen to them, including one trick ponies and even people who main janna support. Now I get the theory that some high elo players have where they say &#039;you can script with every champion&#039; well i have no idea. But either way I know for a fact these people have never scripted at any point yet they have been punished with a permanent ban based on Riot&#039;s inability to get things right.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is that Riot need to start being transparent about their &#039;evidence&#039;. Put it this way, if a scripter was banned for scripting (I take this as an example from a youtuber called Ghost To Lane who had a scripter in one of his videos) and you ask them how they feel, they would probably be like &#039;well it&#039;s about time Riot i&#039;ve been doing this for ages&#039; and simply just make another account and carry on. However if that player was banned for scripting and in fact they actually were not, that is potentially years of game time, and even possible financial implications as well that have been unjustly treated by Riot Games and their so-called support team. So this transparency should include the exact games that showed &#039;evidence&#039; of scripting and what scripts were claimed to have been found. This would mean that a player has the opportunity to defend themselves. I was talking to a higher elo player about my bans in particular and we watched games together and he turned round and said &#039;if you are scripting you are trash at using them because you are missing a shed load of skillshots and eating a load more just like the noob that we know you are&#039; (tbf he&#039;s not wrong). \r\n\r\nSo where does this leave me? well so far due to Riot&#039;s inadequate support system and moderation banning innocent players from the game (not just me I know of around 30 different accounts that have been incorrectly banned) I have had my 2 only accounts permabanned incorrectly under false allegations and despite trying to prove my own innocence as I have done nothing wrong, Riot do not listen and in fact do not even care that they have messed up, in fact currently they criminalise innocent players instead of actually punishing the toxic players or real scripters and unless I get my accounts unbanned as I have done nothing wrong, I will no longer be playing this game as the company behind this game cannot moderate their game properly.\r\n\r\nHonestly my only real motivation behind this post was to make people who have probably ended up in similar situations like this that they are not the only ones, and it would certainly be interesting to see if other people come forward here and say &#039;yeah this has happened to me too&#039;, because if there are more than I even know of, then Riot has a serious case to answer about their so-called system for detecting scripts. It makes me mad that I have put a lot of time, effort and even a bit of money to support riot&#039;s designs through skins and I get the ultimate disrespect of losing that account for nothing, but if this is happening multiple times then Riot need a new system and or approach.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-23T16:29:13.631+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't reveal any details of it because for all they know you are part of it.

Its they havent done what you wanted them to.\n\nBeyond that, strange how the EUW got hit with the bot wave ban.
