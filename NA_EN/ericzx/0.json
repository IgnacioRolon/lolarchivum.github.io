Even if they are bronze how is it fair. They have simply played the game more. With me being lv 40 it makes no sense to me. The fun of the game is gone for me. I had so much fun playing this game before ranked but with the toxic people in ranked flaming me its just gone. I am quiting league. I just wanted to steam off a bit. Dont care if i get downvoted","replies":[]}
