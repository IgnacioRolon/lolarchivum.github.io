It's one of the main reasons I stopped playing HOTS.\n\nDaily quests are like chores. They become to consume you and kinda force you to play just for the sake of gaining a little boost towards your next champion. Games are about you deciding when to play them, and the main reward is fun not virtual currency.\n\nIn addition, they make players, who can't finish them, feel like they missed out on something or \"failed to accomplish\" something. That's not a good morale boost for a competitive game like this. Look at what's up with Hearthstone. They have a lot of quests that ask you to win to gain reward, but with limited amount of good cards for new players, it is freaking hard to do that. You have to go through 5 losses to some rich-ass legendary card collector to get a single win. That's really frustrating.\n\nThe best way to reward people, is to do so without forcing them to play, and the reward must not be known.\nI played DOTA2 starting from beta and I loved the way they rewarded a cosmetic item every time you leveled up account. The beauty of that was the fact that you are not forced into a time frame of when you accomplish this, and the reward that you'd get was not known to you. It might've been common or an legendary, or even arcana......you never knew. It wasn't like a job you had to do to get paid. It was just a gift for spending your time having fun (or raging, in some cases).\n\nOverall, I think it would be a bad idea, and I am fully against such \"rewards\".

Now your team's Ashe is focusing the enemy Sejuani in teamfights, your assassin chooses to go over the free kill on the enemy adc to try and get their assassin. Also bear in mind that people will be more likely playing champs (or roles) they're not comfortable with, increasing the chances of the player doing poorly and getting flamed because their team, which might want nothing to with the quest, also get burdened.\n\nThe only way people can be incentivized to play, without risking people intentionally playing sub-optimally, would be to tell them to win. Even that runs the risk however of increasing toxicity, people leaving queues if people play non-meta champions, flaming people for doing poorly, people playing more games than they want to simply for the reward.\n\nIf Riot did want to experiment with and expand upon the idea, the way that I see raising the fewest problems would be giving each map it's own Daily Win. People would play The Crystal Scar and Twisted Treeline more, increasing fervor for those modes and compelling Riot to keep a closer eye on the balance of those modes (to their probable dismay). It still does run the risk of increasing toxicity as mentioned before, but I've seen no alternative with more preferable consequences.","replies":[]}]}
