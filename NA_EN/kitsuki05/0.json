Since there&#039;s a feature to mute players&#039; pings when they get spammy, I can&#039;t see people being able to abuse the VO to just become obnoxious, and having some audio feedback to what&#039;s being pinged other than just &quot;ping pong poong&quot; could provide more helpful information to the players about what&#039;s going on. (ie: I hear midlane say &quot;hey where&#039;d he go&quot; and I back up and check my wards for an incoming gank.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ampson","date":"2017-04-08T18:17:32.039+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for bring up the conversation! Ping VO is something we definitely wanted to experiment with in general for League.

We currently don't have plans to have Ping VO on if either Xayah or Rakan are not in a game together.
