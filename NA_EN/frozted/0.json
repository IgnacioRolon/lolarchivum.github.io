How the addiction affected me so badly that I can't seem to see the light of what I am doing. From being depressed to losing my appetite, it truly was a dark time. While I was on tilt and irritated, you guys responded patiently and calmly and gave me advices on how I can improve my own moods. I took your words seriously and I tried extremely hard to change. It has changed. I went from Gold to Platinum. Though I think that was my hard work and effort bearing fruit, I felt and still believe that I would not have been able to achieve this without you. Platinum is a big check point in my eyes and I'm very proud of that. Season 5, and I just got Platinum again. \r\n\r\nDearest Riot Support team, you guys are patient and hard working and deal with hundreds of thousands of angry youngsters like myself, yet you didn't let that negativity affect how you handled my distress. Currently, I eat before I rank, I take breaks after my games, and I analyze what I can do better. I start focusing on myself and stop letting the negative atmosphere get to me. It's been a humbling year. From the bottom of my heart, thank you very much. You've changed my perspective and outlook on life. My achievements on League of Legends is definitely from the support of you guys. \r\n\r\nThank you. I hope times for you guys aren't as stressful with the ever growing popularity of the game. I hope you guys aren't stressed out by the ungrateful brats like myself. I hope the summer heat in California isn't too big of a trouble for you guys. I live nearby, I'd know. So I hope this year will be bright, and I'm happy I made the decision to follow your advices.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFrozted","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-27T16:58:25.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Frozted! \n\nIt's awesome to hear that you're doing much better - both IRL in game. :] Reaching plat is a pretty solid accomplishment in itself! \n\nLuckily, the weather out here hasn't been too harsh just yet, but saying that probably just jinxed it. :P","replies":[]}]}
