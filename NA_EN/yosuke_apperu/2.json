Let's give him this build and see how fun you have fighting him. {{item:3091}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3006}} . Just these 3 alone give him enough damage and tankiness to make your life hell especially if he ever uses his dash to minions and starts the traded in your face.

It means he can get off all the damage he's supposed to do with one easily hit spell, rather than going OOM trying to poke as people like Lulu do with their EQ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-09-06T16:09:02.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lxHl0HIP,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-02T01:26:06.599+0000)\n>\n> Back in 5.12 we buffed both Braum's mana cost and damage on Q.
