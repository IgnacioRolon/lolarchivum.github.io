I want to learn how to play him, build as far as build paths/ tips on what to do to be a good bard,  I have no clue. I also am unsure as to when I&#039;m supposed to get my chimes, how far should I realistically travel to get  a chime(s)? When is it okay to leave my teammates for them, or am I not supposed to do that? Anyways I&#039;m an extreme rookie to bard so please, any and all tips appreciated. Whether for support bard or some other bard build quirky or not let me hear it =] Thank you all so much for your time! ^_^\n\nEDIT: Not really sure why I was down voted for wanting to learn a champ... :\\","replies":[]}
