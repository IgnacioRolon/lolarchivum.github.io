Now i am here sitting and thinking how can that happen ? i mean do i not get a warning first after not playing the game for 6 months ? surely during that time i could not have been toxic since i did not queue up for any games ? Under the ban policy it says player can be banned for a number of reasons, feeding and not contributing being one of them, but i can guarantee that those two guys a played my last game with are just fine, how is this fare ? My account has been suspended by a fucking algorithm, the so called \"Instant feedback system\" or whatever. Those two trolls in my game deserved what i said, they wore wasting my time, and the time of two other players on our team, not to mention the elo, etc. I can assure you that most people who are in their right state of mind and like competitiveness would have said something. Anyway, this is a joke, instead of actually having the decency to investigate the matter properly, i get banned, ignoring my side of things and getting straight to the solution, AND with no possibility of an un-ban even if you do explain yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-07-15T01:53:12.952+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"> all i did was say three words, three bad words %%% x2 and dick once, that's all it took\n\nOr %%% 5x, telling them to do things with a dick, and calling them retarded .. after having 2x chat restrictions.\n\n> have not played the game for 5 - 6 months\n\nNot playing isn't a way of getting your account back in good status.\n\n> Those two trolls in my game deserved what i said, they wore wasting my time\n\nYou should seriously consider what you are saying here before you come back from your 14-day ban.
