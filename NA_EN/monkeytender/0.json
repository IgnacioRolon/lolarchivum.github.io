I believe this started when gifting notifications were turned on on the new client and I figured I would just ignore it until the client came out of beta, but alas, here I am however many months later and I still get notified about my Blitzcrank icon every time I log on. If a friendly neighborhood Rioter could swoop in and unplug a couple wires or whatever it takes to fix this, that would be super. If not, I guess I'll just consider it a parade of trophies every time I log on.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-12T03:22:40.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typically those notifications will keep popping up unless you hit the little 'x' in the upper right-hand corner of the notification window itself. Make sure you're hitting that when it pops up. If you *are* hitting that 'x'. go ahead and hit me back up and I can do some digging and see what we could do to stop that!","replies":[]}]}
