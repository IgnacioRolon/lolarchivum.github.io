The pop up tells me I need to contact support to reinstall the game. So I was like \"great, I have to sit through the install process again\". So I go to Riot's official reinstall instruction page following both sets of instructions. After doing so, the game stops giving me the pop up, and I get to what should be the login screen. Now, when I get here, instead of the usual login screen, I get this page with the new client's logo saying that I still need to do a few things to update my client. Now, this wouldn't bug me so much if \r\n1: they'd tell me what I need to do.\r\n2:  I hadn't just downloaded what riot claimed on their website to be the most updated version of the game.\r\n\r\nSo I thought I'd just redownload again from a different link (also endorsed by Riot) and I got the same results. Then soon after a few cycles of this gained another pop up saying my files were corrupt. -_-\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had either of these problems? If so can you help me out? I feel like I'm just not finding the right place to download league. Like, surely the patcher is not the only place where you can get the new client. I must be missing some webpage on Riot's website, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-22T02:09:56.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The download link should give you the latest version of the client itself, but with patches rolling out pretty regularly you will still need to patch after installing. After installing, let the client continue to patch and update until you're on the latest build and then you'll be good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Paydirt73","date":"2017-05-28T23:36:47.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tip Broporo, but I figured out that the root of my issue was that the Date and Time on my computer for some reason was about 5 months behind what it shoulda been. Once I switched this back to the accurate date and time settings everything worked fine. Thank you for the support though, and keep up the good work :-)","replies":[{"poster":"declouxa","date":"2017-11-14T17:36:50.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for this info, got mine working right away. merci{{champion:53}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
