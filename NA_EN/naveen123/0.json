Placing doesn&#x27;t lock you into the tier or division, so you can totally climb the ranks as you continue to play.  Best of luck!\n\nI just want to say here, that the quote \"so you can totally climb the ranks as you continue to play\" is a SEVERE misrepresentation of the difficulty it is to climb.  I hear time and time again \"if you are good enough you will climb\".  That may be true for a diamond skilled player to climb out of bronze, but much less true for, say a mid silver level player, to climb out of bronze.  This has historically frustrated me to no end.  Currently, in this season, I have approximately a 50/50 win rate.  I may be 1 or 2 games above the .500 mark.  I tried as hard as I could the vast majority of this season to climb out of bronze with support.  I ranged between a 15-20 game over .500 and never climbed higher than Bronze 1.  On the flip side, there are plenty of gold/silver with a much lower win rate than .500.  Understanding their competition is more skilled, but so are their team mates.  Just a rant from years of frustration.  My gamertag is the leper con if you want to review my history.  I have been on major tilt these last games, branching out to roles I may not usually play, and suffering for it, but you can review my history as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Naveen123","date":"2016-07-22T01:45:20.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend just joined this season. He won two games and lost eight. He got placed in Bronze 2.is it because he played good? If you lose all ten games, but if you play good does that place you in a higher rank? Oh, and I played in s2 and s3 ranked, and I kind of sucked. Does that influence my rank in s6?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
