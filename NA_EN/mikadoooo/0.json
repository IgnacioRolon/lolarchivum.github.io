When a spell is cast, that little clock will usually go a full 360 circle around the icon of that ability. However, It doesn&#039;t with Syndra&#039;s ultimate.\r\n\r\nHow to recreate.\r\n1. Start any game and pick Syndra.\r\n2. Get to level 6 and cast unleashed power.\r\n3. The little clock will not tick away.\r\n\r\nThis will happen in every game and any game mode, and has been there for quite some time (think months). I currently only tested it out with the Justicar, Atlantean and Snow Day skins.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve attached an image on which you can see that the little clock is working on her basic abilities, just not on her ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-27T18:23:43.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MikaDoooo,\n\nI've gone ahead and ran through your repro steps. I'm able to see the clock ticking down on her ult. Is this still occurring for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2016-01-27T23:08:57.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It ticks down, but there isn't a cooldown box. In other words, the number is there and functioning, but there no shrinking blue color to indicate the ability is on cooldown. The box just stays darkened instead of being both darkened and having a cooldown indicator. The image up there is showing this; all of her skills have the blue cooldown thingy except her ult.\n\nThis has been a bug since the new HUD and such went live.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-28T01:02:47.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, okay.
