Can you at least make the screen do something crazy like start blowing up and saying \"HEY YOU'RE GOING TO BE KICKED IF YOU DON'T LOCK IN\" or something like that? I don't want to be penalized for not locking in when I already selected my champion. I just don't see any reason for it when I can select my champion early on.\r\n\r\nIf this isn't possible, could someone provide some actual reasoning why you have to lock in at least? I feel like such a dickhead when I get kicked and I'm waiting there like \"ugh why did someone leave the selection\" and then realize it was me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-11T01:39:35.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason we don't have your champion locked in when you first click on them comes down to communication. If you were locked into the first champ you clicked, there wouldn't be much room for talk of who's going to do what. With the system set up the way it is now, you can pick your intended champion which will show everyone who you're thinking of playing. You can then strategize around those choices, and someone could potentially end up changing their pick. For now, once you've decided on who you're playing just make sure to click Lock In.","replies":[{"poster":"Glitch God","date":"2017-07-11T02:11:53.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get not insta-locking, but that doesn't make sense if I have a champion highlighted and the time runs up for me to pick. At that point in time, it shouldn't kick me from the game, it should just let me play that champion. If someone has an intended champion to play, why have an extra step to lock in before selection? It just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe problem mainly is that the alternative is leaving the game -- which I'm sure most people wouldn't want to do. 30-min ban from games because you selected a champion and it was highlighted on your screen, and you had NO WARNING that you didn't select a champion, but you didn't hit the \"lock-in\" button. That's extremely frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-07-11T08:09:28.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, the real reason against what you suggest is that they want to avoid people AFK'ing during champ select and auto-locking something they hoovered during pick intent but being AFK when the game starts. By not auto-locking, if that player is AFK when they have to lock, the lobby is canceled and only them is punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Glitch God","date":"2017-07-10T22:29:10.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seriously...
