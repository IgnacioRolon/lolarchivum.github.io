At least 5 mins as a support, longer in any other role. When I do get in games  it's usually autofill even though I have protection.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this issue today? I don't afk in games so I know this isn't LPQ.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-20T22:50:19.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it doesn't look like you have an LPQ, so that shouldn't be the issue here. You may just be getting unlucky with the number of players currently queueing up for Solo or Flex due to ARURF still being up. Try queueing in a different game mode and let me know if you're having this problem across other modes as well.","replies":[{"poster":"DjinnOfBlkSun","date":"2017-08-21T20:41:55.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick response and looking into it for me. I believe you were correct because when I logged in later on during the day I had no issues.","replies":[]}]}]}
