Or even have it scaling off of his bonus HP; It feels very underwhelming to have it scale with AP when Shen really doesn't build AP, outside of the occasional tri-force/gauntlet. \n\nSpeaking of his shield, someone mentioned before (if I can find where I'll link it) that it doesn't make sense to have it reduce his Ki Strike (passive) by an additional second when auto-attacking with it unbroken, as it defeats the purpose of using the shield to absorb damage. In fact, this behavior rewards players who avoid damage while the shield is up. So I had an idea for how his shield could feel very rewarding: Make it reduce the CD for his Ki Strike every time he takes damage from champions with the shield up. It could be reduced by either a flat rate (perhaps how it is now, at 1 second, as it would give about the same CD to his passive early, and perhaps a bit more late game if how his shield scales is changed), where the time reduced scales with the shield rank (think along the lines of .25/.5/.75/1.0/1.25, this will make it feel a bit more useful when the shield doesn't hold up as well in the very late game) or make it reduce the passive CD by a small amount (somewhere between .25-1 second) for when Shen takes damage WITHOUT the shield up (This would make Shen a better fighter and emphasize his split-pushing power while still giving him strength in the teamfights, though this last version would probably need a limit on how much it can be reduced. Either limit it by something like \"up to 3 seconds\" where it resets each time his passive is consumed, or \"1 second per each enemy champion who damages Shen, up to 5 seconds\".

A flight of kunai with sealing tags on the back (or just the set of sealing tags) would fit here thematically.\n\nOr possibly a shadow clone in the vein of Zed, except this one could eat projectiles? The body swap component would be a dash instead of a blink, and *something* would happen to players he passes through.

Later in the game he could become an extra splitpusher for when you know the teleport of the other team is down, like what reksai is able to do now.\n\nBut for that he needs some kind of buff in the jungle. Q could get more damage against monsters, hitting a monster with Q debuff could give bonus damage (like shyvana E), taunt could hit jungle monsters and refund part of the energy, ki strike could have bonus damage against monsters or the cooldown on ki strike could reset more quickly from attacking jungle monsters even when his shield isnt up.\n\nObviously not all of those things should be implemented, but some help in his jungle clear time combined with the fatter taunt hitbox and MR/lvl people have been asking for would make shen a fine pick again imo.\n\nAlso if you want to make a QoL change to shen ult I would like 2 things for it.
