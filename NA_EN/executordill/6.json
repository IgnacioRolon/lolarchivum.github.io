He would be basically in the same timeline of Knockout Lee Sin and Mafia Jinx in their prime. Coincidentally thier endeavours can be highlighted in the papers he&#039;s selling.\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/weFBCPluDLk/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/C1mYH_eC9Es/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nMinute Hand Slugger- Roll of News Paper\nZ- Drive- Newspaper Bag\n\n\nQ- Ekko throws out his Stopwatch that breaks before rewinding time; repairing itself and returning to Ekko. ([alternative] Ekko throws a Garbage can lid.)\n\nW- Sphere has a new paper theme and projects one of 3 newspaper articles on stun (Lee Sin boxing match, mafia shoot out at restaraunt and ...)\n\nR- Ekko clicks his Stopwatch going back in time. His Newspapers are scattered along the travel and on arrival in a big burst.\n\nRecall- Ekko checks the time on his Stopwatch before hopping on his Nike and riding off.\n\nTaunt- Ekko holds out a Newpaper pointing on the front and saying, \"Here, why don't you let me put your face on the cover?\", \"I'd sell you one if you knew how how to use it\", \"Newsflash, you didn't make thebheadlines buddy!\",  \"Read all about it? How you gonna do that after I knock those teeth out?\"","replies":[{"poster":"Insixia","date":"2016-04-01T22:26:47.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'd buy it.","replies":[{"poster":"xX1SaVaGe3Xx","date":"2016-04-01T23:22:08.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im an Ekko Main I prefer something like ARCADE EKKO!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2016-04-01T22:44:13.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Insixia,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=7zsTPafl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-01T22:26:47.353+0000)\n>\n> Hey, I'd buy it.\n\nThanks for kind words :)","replies":[]}]}]}
