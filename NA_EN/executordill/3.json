The problem is, back when Hecarim's passive was strong, it was **really effin strong.** I'm sure if the numbers were worked out, it would end up being okay, but as it stands, the only example history's given us was more than a little bit too strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yxion the Yordle","date":"2015-01-08T01:47:14.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will just leave this here for you...\n\n{{champion:120}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2015-01-08T02:59:21.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I mean there's Riven with an 11 second 840ish range dash over three parts, or her charge for another boost, so she's pretty hard to gank, so if you added MS scaling i'd cry and just ff every game with Riven, heh","replies":[]},{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-01-08T02:54:05.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I would enjoy if they added move speed as a scalable damage stat, IFF they added more movement speed items and the champions had a low damage to speed ration but with short cd's.
