There are some core abilities and things that he does that are really unique and we want to support:\n> \n> -Split push join team with ult, awesome and unique for team strategies\n> \n> -Ninja tank! Even though this isn't the first thing you think of when you look at a martial fighter like shen, it allows him to differentiate himself in both how he is durable (possibly more dodging/blocking than pure meatshield) and how he targets and disables his opponents.\n> \n> -Shadow dash is a pretty cool high moment, want to build up and around this rather than scrap. \n> \n> Some of the things that we think can be improved:\n> \n> -His laning and play pattern can be made more interesting and interactive for both shen and his opponent. We know that we can do better with top lane gameplay than marking your enemy and trading autos with them. His current pattern leads to a \"stat check\" win loss condition more than we would like.\n> \n> -Overall we can deliver a more clear and satisfying kit for him that focuses his power into more discrete moments that fit shen's character\n> \n> \n> This is just my very rough thoughts, but hopefully it makes sense and doesn't seem totally off base.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T16:34:10.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As mentioned, I'm speaking on behalf of skins, since that's the area I work in. :]","replies":[{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-07-13T17:09:44.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhh I understand, sorry for the hastle then :3","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-13T17:28:30.603+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries. :3 It's pretty common to mix up skins/champ/champ update, since we work pretty closely with the same content.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ExecutorDill","date":"2015-07-10T23:11:40.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, my name is not myolin tho","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-10T23:23:37.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Edited.
