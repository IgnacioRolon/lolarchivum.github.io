No matter your crit chance, the first hit will never crit, and the second hit always will. The only crit item even worth picking up is maybe IE, but even then it's only for the crit damage, not crit chance itself.\n\nIt's going to basically boil down to building BotRK, BT, maybe an IE, and then just tank items.
