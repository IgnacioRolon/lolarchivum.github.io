Lucian and Corki can brust people down pretty fast from what I've seen.\n\nAnd Sivir IS a utility adc imo, but she lacks... the utility the other carries have. All of them up there can initiate with their cc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-10-02T22:41:12.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:85}} - I hope there's some items I can use for him as an ADC.. \n\nHe can be quite handy at bot. he's not too strong but not easy to kill and \"What is oom?\"  xD \n\nI have fun taking him bot. \n\n{{champion:150}}  - also him...  he's fun to go botlane with.... {{champion:201}}  because their's stacks.... stack together.. xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-10-02T22:40:46.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they should.
