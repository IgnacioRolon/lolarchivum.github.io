Here are my concept stats\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n10% Cooldown Reduction\r\n10% Movement Speed\r\n80% Base Mana Regen\r\n\r\nUnique Passive: Grants either 60 AP _or_ 200 HP depending on whether {{item:3092}} or {{item:3401}} or their lesser parts have been built.\r\n\r\nUnique Passive: Cursed Wounds: Hitting an enemy with a _movement-impairing ability_ inflicts _cursed wounds_ for x seconds, causing all shielding and healing to become halved. If a shielded enemy is struck by said movement-impairing ability, The shield will break instantly. Additionally, enemy champions will take bonus damage from all sources from and during your crowd-control effects.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\nThoughts? I would love to see an item thats made for catchers, instead of reactive/protective supports like {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}}{{champion:16}}","replies":[{"poster":"VICKLIUS","date":"2018-02-28T01:04:25.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this would be better on a dmg dealer like a mage/adc/ assassin, you cant just have it destroy,  an grevious wounds already halves healing, so if any thing have grevious wounds lower shield gains.","replies":[]}]}
