I would like to see a champ like this, except maybe instead of a toggle it could be an active ability that lets his next shot deal the damage in the form of magic damage instead of normal attack damage. The active would be on a short cool down (7-9 seconds) and would cost alot of mana or even increasing mana (similar to {{champion:96}}  or {{champion:38}}  ult)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mikk","date":"2014-07-18T18:31:24.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes","replies":[]},{"poster":"bbbbates","date":"2014-07-18T16:04:29.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would have to consider how the magic damage scaled pretty carefully, cuz you can get upwards of 1000AP with a soulstealer and the right big AP items, you're not gonna get anywhere near that much with AD items, otherwise its a cool idea for a DPS ap char other than kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2014-07-18T14:52:19.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what you're saying is you want a champion with all of the strengths of a hybrid champion (Impossible to build to defend against) with none of the weaknesses (No late-game scaling).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orinne","date":"2014-07-18T08:06:37.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the only thing the ultimate does is act as a toggle between physical and magical damage, it'd be a bit of a weak steroid that's okay against general builds (MR itemization is lacking a bit), but wouldn't be spectacular by any means.\n\nWhy not just go full out and have such a champion have a passive that converts all physical damage dealt into magical damage, in addition to converting armor penetration into magic penetration?
