I can understand if i got chat restrictions or a suspension but a permanent ban right off the bat? I think i had chat restrictions one time months and months ago this seems a little random. If i could get a rioter to tell me if this was fair or not it would really help. I used a lot of money on that account and it straight up getting banned with no suspension or chat restrictions seems a little outrageous to me. I truly don&#039;t think this is permanent ban material.","replies":[{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2018-11-10T22:47:17.233+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"While Necromancy may be handy (and sometimes needed) in video games, it's not the case for old forum threads.

It will prevent you from selecting a queue while listing the reason as being banned, but you're not actually banned.\n\nTry logging out and back in.\n\nAnd like YerroFever mentioned, don't necro old threads, especially ones mostly unrelated to your issue.

However, I'll tell you that you'll get the following responses:\n\n - Wait for the email that corresponds to the ban. It can take a few days to get to you and then post on the forums about what is in your ban email. \n - If you don't want to wait for the email, you can contact player support and open a ticket to find out more info.\n - If you have no info on your ban notice, your ban may be a shield ban and you should contact player support anyway. If it is a shield ban, they will ask you a series of questions to make sure you are the true owner of the account and then unlock it for you.\n\nI highly suggest opening a support ticket or do live chat if they're up and running right now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Popstar Bulma","date":"2018-08-10T09:33:03.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ban well deserved. let's see what you did\n\nhate speech\nsuggestion of suicide\noverall douchery\n\nyep... enjoy your ban. and don't bother making a smurf. we don't want you back","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-08-10T10:32:22.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Psst.
