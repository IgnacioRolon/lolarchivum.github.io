Lagging in champ select, bugsplatting at loading screen, being stuck at loading screen, loading screen freezing to the point where I can't even alt tab to force close it. This is just ridiculous you guys have the money and resources to fix this client. I never had this much trouble with the legacy client. All you guys care about is quick profit from skin sales and the Esport scene. There's no excuse for the client to be this piss poor. I know it's not on my end for a fact. I have great internet and a top of the line PC. \"indy company btw\" yeah my ass.","replies":[{"poster":"AidanWR","date":"2019-08-27T05:59:27.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They went from a decent company to an \"all we care about is money and playing games during work hours,\" company. Literally, they don't even really do work at work, and yet they don't fix the fucking bugs that make people want to quit this game. They have a large number of employees, yet they can't seem to get anything right. New champion? Oh, how broken are they, and how long until you nerf them? New gamebreaking bugs? Let's take two or more patches to fix while we give Lux her 14th skin, and make more PROJECT skins that no one asked for","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sharkwhales","date":"2019-08-26T19:55:58.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First time posting, came to report a bug, but then I see this thread reporting similar problem. I attempted to pick smite in champ select, got spinning wheel instead of smite, timer counting down so I exit to queue dodge because i suspected this bug would make the match unplayable. Restart game, client freezes twice. It turns out the client is somehow opened twice in processes, so I close both those and it works. Get in, turns out the match started with me on the previous spell (Not smite) even though I left during the countdown timer. Me: \"Hello client, my name jg can I plz haev a smite\" Client: \"YOu'll TakE wHAt I GivE yOu And liKE iT\"","replies":[{"poster":"ClaytonBiggums","date":"2019-08-27T01:04:07.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep I've been noticing the same thing, in processes there will me multiple \"League of legends 32 bit\" processes running at once. The most i've seen is like seven. And as of posting this I currently have 3 running for whatever reason. My client has been idol in the background for 5 hours so it's not as if I'm sitting here trying to open the client multiple times.

The summoner spells won't change so you might end up playing top with Heal or Smite or whatever, then the game won't even start and I need to restart the whole game, and after the restart the launcher doesn't work so i end up restarting the whole PC. \nYou guys should really focus on fixing these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"ClaytonBiggums","date":"2019-08-26T13:03:04.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's so fucking ridiculous it's almost funny. I can't tell you how many times I've ran with something just downright stupid like press the attack diana because this laggy client wouldn't let me change my runes. Or how many times I've \"dodged a game\" because I couldn't lock in my champion. It feels like they dodge the client issues as hard as they can, which makes me assume that it must be some sort of coding trainwreck.","replies":[]}]}]}
