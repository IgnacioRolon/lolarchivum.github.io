Came back to it today to discover none of my rune pages were there. Went to the runes section and saw that my \"rune inventory\" is empty. The thing is I had a ton of runes and I don't know why they all just disappeared. Is this something to do with the beta? Do I have to start my rune collection over again? Help please!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T04:46:47.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked your account from our end and see plenty of runes. Can you restart your computer to see if anything's changed and if you are still unable to access them?","replies":[]}]}
