I believe you can chose whether to get the locket or the banner now. Omwrecker has also been changed significantly. The mana stat changes should be felt in the support role as well. The bot lane river crab should also warp some things.","replies":[{"poster":"Lwnt","date":"2014-11-10T03:50:43.806+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Those are great changes in itemization for tanky supports who build mostly tanky. Now there are more tanky items that have cool actives but  I see no help for ap utility supports like sona, Janna, lulu, Nami and soraka when it comes to itemization. there are few support items to pick from that have ap and a active well actually just two Frost Queen claim and Twin shadow. And for support items that have ap and a passive are ardent censar and morrellonomicon. These are support items because they are cheap for a support income.  I wish their are more variety of items to choose from especially items with Ability power because I want to scale the utility of those supports. \n\nAlso I believe lulu early game is going to hurt the most out of the changes. Lulu mana regen is one of the lowest in the game and now that it is based on a percentage of it, lulu is going to have even more of a mana problem. I hope they will look at her and increase it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TenSpeed","date":"2014-11-06T02:34:02.338+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"MsPudding <3\n\nThat is all.","replies":[{"poster":"Michicha","date":"2014-11-06T03:13:28.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't she wonderful?

It seems Riot wants to enhance decision making in the game by adding interesting non-pvp interactions that provide huge things like vision. Since they moved away from vision being placed upon the support totally, they've been looking into ways to further emphasize the team effort of providing vision. They didn't want to implement another \"click to place\" vision option, but something that creates good decision making and improves the games fun qualities.

First, why did the team choose to add the little wandering crab? Obviously, the vision and speed buff it grants is a nice little touch, but the inclusion seems a bit unusual. Also the fact that it is hard to kill and wanders around. There is also that the vision circle is visible to both teams. I have my suspicions, but why did they choose to actually add it in its current form?\n\nSecond, how did you guys try to balance the different smite buffs granted from smiting the different camps? Does it have to do with how easy the camps are to do without the use of smite? Is that why the Razorbeak smite buff is so good? Is the wolf camp smite buff supposed to have a real use? Are they meant to be balanced across the board or are they balanced against their relative positions on the map and the relative difficulty of the camps themselves?\n\nLastly, I have a question about the various smites themselves. Do you guys feel that in their current iteration on the PBE that they are all useful in some way? I feel that Quick Smite and the now-improved Desolating Smite have their uses, and I suppose the version of smite that does true damage might have some uses as well, but between that and Challenging Smite, I feel that there is a bit of an imbalance. In the same way that through most of season 3, Ancient Golem was too strong as to push other jungle items aside and how through most of season 4, Elder Lizard was a bit too dominant, I feel that there exists a hierarchy of usefulness in the current iterations of smite upgrades. Are you guys looking towards more sweeping changes to balance this out or are the differences themselves meant to be balanced through diversity? Meaning, is the ability to choose different types of smites for different uses enough that maybe the overall power level difference between them slightly less meaningful since the roles would value them differently?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostStalker","date":"2014-11-06T02:03:36.019+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm really focused on how Tank Junglers will do.

At the beginning the 3 wards per champion limit seemed like a good idea of overall team contribution. But as the season went on, it was discovered that only higher tier players such as Plat+ were shown to buy wards even when they weren't support. It's still put onto the support and jungle to buy wards especially mid-game. Using your statistics on the new Match History it was shown that other players that aren't map controlling oriented (mid, Top, adc) only place an average of 5 wards each, which is usually just the trinket ward (this subject pool have been from my games and games of friends). The old vision system allowed for teams that are behind to come back thanks to a lot of warding from support and jungle as carries are too focused on getting their items. So I believe a change in vision system should be implemented.

Cutting the server population in half would theoretically double the Queue times in both regions, and practically eliminate the less popular Queues like Dominion and Twisted Treeline. Friends on these two servers will be split apart from any division, including Rioters ability to play with the east coasters. Furthermore, It has been mentioned that moving the servers to the middle of the country has been brought up in internal discussion and more news on this was supposed to come some time in November (YAY soon hopefully). This solution would keep the population of the server intact while improving server efficiency and performance because a move would imply creating a custom coded data center like the one recently created in Amsterdam, where both EUW and EUNE are to be run in.

I will supply you with a post about MMR scaling, but it does not directly answer, your question, i need to search deeper for that post. I believe Zileas replies to a summoners concerns over why Normal MMR is hidden, which pertains to the topic of why your are teamed up with such varying players due to the fact it acknowledges Normal MMR and its function. Your awkward placement seems to stem from the hidden Normal MMR. This MMR calculates like ranked MMR, but for many summoners who play mostly ranked and only on occasion play normals, there are large gaps between ranks and match placement. For example, lets assume I am a diamond player who only plays normals once a week. If I tend to lay back and play loosely, trying new champs and build or just plain out trolling, my MMR will be low naturally. Some players don't like the stress brought upon by ranked and dont play it, but do fabulously in normal games.
