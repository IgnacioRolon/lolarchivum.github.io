This has happened previously but i would just launch the client again and it would continue updating.This time when i tried opening the client the LoL logo appeared and after a delay i heard a sound from my antivirus program and it basically said that there might be suspicious file there. After a short while the program couldnt tell me if there a virus or something. Now my logo for the lol launcher looks like an unknown file and when i open it it says that it does not exist anymore. Maybe reinstalling the game will help but i wanna hear another opinions or possible solutions to this problem. Its very weird","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-17T17:49:12.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What anti-virus are you using?  I'm curious your program ran an update that failed to read the client as safe.  I've seen some anti-virus do this sometimes after a patch, and they usually fix it on the same day.  In the meantime, I suggest using the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to add league as an exception and get in-game!  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
