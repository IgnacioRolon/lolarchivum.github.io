First, the problem. I often get into ranked queue and get a player that doesn&#039;t fit the team. I&#039;m not talking about low skill players. I mean that one guy who wants to support twitch or the player who got the mid role but now wants to steal the jungle spot. Sometimes a player is mean or undesirable (makes racist comments, rages on teammates). I could create a list, but its that player we&#039;ve all had that is going to make it a bad game simply because they want to troll. You play at least 20 min, often longer, with this person only to report them after the game is over. The solution. Ranked should have a team lobby before picks and bans. For at least a minute teammates should be able to chat and talk strategy before they are locked in to playing together. If you don&#039;t like the team, you can leave with no penalty or low penalty (no leaverbuster). Riot already has this in normal queue when you group with friends. Before you queue for the game you sit in a chat lobby and then get in line to play. While this would have to be modified I think something similar would help solo players. A second idea would be that with a 4 person vote, you could kick someone from said lobby and get a new player. This second notion is more dicey and maybe you should just let people leave. Either way, I&#039;d like a way to avoid games that would clearly be no fun and, in my judgment, be a loss because of some trolling player. Allowing players to screen each other seems like solution.\n\nThoughts, other ideas, modifications, and salt all welcome.\n\nHave fun in the rift\n\n\n\nFirst Edit: Maybe only adding 30 seconds to 1 min before picks and bans would be better. While it doesn't deal with trolls it allows players time to think and talk before picks and bans. That way, if someone is trolling, you can discuss working around it with the rest of the team.\nVotes for previous model: 4 Bad; 2 Good\n\nVoting should now only reflect opinions on the idea that more time needs to be added to the queue before picks and bans","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-02T18:42:08.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing is pretty much the old teambuilder. My understanding is that it was scrapped and substituted by the current draft system because the time it took to actually find and start a game was huge (mind that if you kick somebody out, the matchmaking system will not only have to find a new player of your team, but also a new opposing team that matches yours), people would cherry pick teams/players to exhaustion increasing the timers even more, and it enforced metas because team captains would only accept the currents FOTMs even when the player was really good with the semi-meta champion and really bad with the FOTM. \n\nMind that this is way before my time (I started playing barely 6 months ago) so it might not be 100% correct.","replies":[{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-11-09T17:11:24.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not necessarily the old team builder, you're not necessarily choosing what champ you want in top lane, you're more just choosing strategies and seeing if your team is going to be able to get their S together....I mean if Top laner is acting like a jerk right off the bat, do you want to spend the next 20-30 minutes with him?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Savage Dreamer","date":"2016-11-02T18:55:37.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had no idea, I'm not a veteran player either.

Someone could act all normal in lobby then troll pick in champion select.","replies":[{"poster":"Savage Dreamer","date":"2016-11-02T16:12:22.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your modification. Such a system could be abused to simply stall games and clog queue times. What about this idea: leaving twice in a row is a penalty but you get 3 leaves per 24 hour period for flexibility?\n\nObviously its not a silver bullet and of course people could act normal in lobby then snipe or troll in queue. But a good portion could be avoided and that would be an improvement at a simple minute added to total play time.\n\nAlso, such a system would improve play by promoting a time to exclusively talk strategy without having to be under of the shorter pick/ban moment. The team could agree to some wombo combo, or whether to switch bot and top lane. The current allotted time is to short for this because you have to pick and ban while communicating.","replies":[]}]}]}
