I have done various tests, monitoring my temps etc, but I cant seem to find any problems there. Other games like gta5 can play on just about full with no issues, I have also played tomb raider and a few other and havent had any issues. I play in 1080 and it is set as my default all round resolution. I have been through the whole ticket process and done all that was asked but to no avail, just hoping there is someone out there with a solution.\r\n\r\nhere is what I have done\r\n\r\n- Updated Drivers\r\n- Unistalled/Re-installed lol\r\n- Used the hextech tool\r\n- Updated all other drivers\r\n- Formatted and re-installed windows\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if it could have something to do with my hardrive being 5200rpm, would an m.2 ssd help ? or perhaps because the 4k screen is set at a lower resolution it casues issues ?\r\n\r\nBelow are my specs \r\n\r\nDell 7559 GRY (4K)\r\nGeForce GTX 960M 4 GB\r\nIntel Core i7 6700HQ (2.60 GHz)\r\n16 GB Memory \r\n1 TB HDD (5200)\r\n15.6\" 4K UHD Touchscreen 3840 x 2160\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T17:58:12.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In cases where your pc is [too good](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs), you could run into fps issues.  You may need to cap your framerate in-game to see if that helps.    There could just be bad game files too, so I recommend double checking our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide to rule out some more possibilities.\n\nShould that not help, grab the logs from the HRT and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
