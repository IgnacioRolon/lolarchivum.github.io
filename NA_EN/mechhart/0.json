When i do play Alistar I play with the Long Horn Alistar skin, which is the only Alistar skin I own. As I load in I say to myself &quot;What the **. I put on Longhorn Alistar &quot; and then suddenly my friends and I in the Teamspeak start to realize that I have a very expensive(500 euro/$544 according to LOLSkin shop) and rare skin equipped. I don&#039;t know how this happened but I would like MY BLACK ALISTAR BACK. JK, just wondering if anyone knows how this happened; would love feedback. &lt;3\r\n\r\nNote: I checked my Alistar skins after this game and I still only had Longhorn. And sorry for the picture quality, it was taken from my phone quickly before the game loaded us in.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-20T00:28:38.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mecha Morris,\n\nThanks for the report!
