What&#039;s stopping us from allowing exhaust to be diverse, in the sense of choosing what it does based off your support items? Very few champions outside supports take exhaust anyway. No one outside supports takes the three gold-income items. It seems like an easy match. That could also lead to more diversity with the gold income items in the support role. For instance, what if you could start the Ancient Coin, then build it into the Frost Queen&#039;s Claim by grouping phase? Granted, the stats of the items would have to be correspondent to which items you start out with and what it&#039;s built into to keep the game balanced.\r\n\r\nCould this work? What are some ways we could use these items to alter what exhaust does to the enemies and for our teammates? Pipe in guys. I&#039;m legit curious about what y&#039;all think about this.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-06T20:49:54.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They added variety to Smite because every jungler needs Smite without exception, so without variety it gets exceedingly boring and unadaptable. You, on the other hand, can pick Exhaust, Ignite, Heal, or even Clairvoyance. That's four options to the jungler's one.\n\nThe Smite variations aren't a sign that other Summoner Spells need their own variations: _It's a sign that there's something fundamentally broken about Smite and jungling as a whole._","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-04-06T20:43:36.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Picking for the lane (Ignite) vs lategame (Exhaust) is already a pretty solid decision.\n\nSmite got changed because it was a PvE only spell and Junglers were always down a combat spell against everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Gare Jordans","date":"2015-04-06T20:47:11.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah but my counterargument with the exhaust vs ignite debate is that supports aren't socially allowed to choose anything except exhaust or they're normally viewed as \"trolling\" by teammates.
