I wanted to have your input about it. I feel like Alistar is keeping champs like Leona, Thresh, and Blitzcrank in a reasonable state, which is why there&#039;s so much out-cry against him. Not only that but he can tank roughly eight or nine turrets shots and live once he hits level six, so his diving potential post-level six is unreal.\r\n\r\nPeronally, I think if you reverted the ultiimate buffs you gave Alistar last season he would still be a decent pick. For those of you who don&#039;t remember, prior to buffing Alistar&#039;s ultimate to constantly reduce damage by 70% at all ranks, his ultimate used to scale based on the ult level (Rank 1: 50%, Rank 2: 60%, Rank 3: 70%). Alistar players would have to calculate when they could go in and for how long they could pull it off if that change went though.\r\n\r\nI also feel like that if his ultimate buffs were reverted that you&#039;d have to compensate by buffing something else about his kit whether that be his sustain or passive.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-30T04:37:03.592+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe we nerfed his Headbutt speed in 5.16, so we'll probably want to give that some time to settle before going any farther.
