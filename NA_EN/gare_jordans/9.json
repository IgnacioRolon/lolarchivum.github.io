Tanks DO NOT need a nerf.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":107,"down_votes":20,"body":"Tanks are hardly in the META right now after Cinderhulk and most popular tanks were nerfed pretty heavily. Some of their kits were nerfed AND their core jungle item was nerfed with no compensation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, {{champion:54}} {{champion:32}}  are the tanks doing well right now. {{champion:223}} is still being experimented with so it&#039;s too soon to decide if he&#039;s actually viable or not. Any other &quot;tank&quot; champion being played is probably just a support utility tank that&#039;s only there to initiate or peel. (I&#039;m looking at you {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}}{{champion:111}}  )\r\n\r\nAt the moment, tanks, outside of the support role, are out-matched as a class:\r\n\r\n1. Devourer is in the META in solo queue. Once someone is Sated and has a BotRK, killing a tank is like tearing through a wet paper bag for them. Tanks can&#039;t simply counterjungle the enemy because most tank junglers have a bad early game while most Sated Devourer junglers have a good one, minus {{champion:19}} and {{champion:102}} of course. The only tank jungler that has a shot at doing anything against a devourer jungler once they&#039;re sated is {{champion:33}}.\r\n\r\n2. Juggernauts are common and Bruisers are coming back top lane, making it hard for tanks to go in a particular lane that&#039;s not support at the moment unless the tank champion is an armor tank. ({{champion:54}})\r\n\r\nSo, I guess, my point in typing all this out is to say that tanks prior to the latter half of this season had three common habitats, or areas where they could be picked viably. Since the nerfs to cinderhulk and tank champions, release of devourer, and  rise of juggernauts, really the only definite place you can pick a tank is in the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2015-09-25T21:14:40.819+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":2,"body":"A tiny addon point to your post; roles are not decided by itemization, but rather by kits.

Your team should have a healthy combination of these three elements, and you should know how to approach the other team with these three attributes.

My reply to you is the tank meta is over for now, and you need to adjust like everyone else did when the meta favored tanks. You should pick a tank to counter burst champions because they are still there, but right now there are so many DPS champions doing well in the meta that you should not just choose a tank because you like playing a tank.

Even before Cinderhulk, the highest win rate champions were {{champion:14}} , {{champion:32}} etc.\nEven after the Cinderhulk nerfs, 8/15 highest win rate champions builds tank, granted 2 of them are juggernauts.\n\nTanks are simply fundamental to a team. They provide the CC and peel that stops their carries from being 100-0'ed in the first 2 seconds in a fight.\nThey are by no means out the door. Just take a look at LCS, almost every jungler builds Cinderhulk even now.\n\nThe current meta is just unfavorable to them because of the sudden emphasis on DPS champions. Sustained damage is meant to be a direct counter against tankiness. But In the future the meta will shift again to favor the tanks, they are just not FOTM right now.","replies":[{"poster":"grimrookzero","date":"2015-09-26T11:31:43.296+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"so much wrong here tanks have never rly been 2 good the fact is most team fights now are just blow up the first person you can tank or not cause they all die fast end game cinderhulk made fighting better it forced trash 2 learn team fighting and stop just diving on anybody now where back 2 the everybody glass cannon derp games its sad","replies":[{"poster":"Transgressor","date":"2015-09-26T21:13:26.146+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punctuation is your friend :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-09-26T20:15:10.584+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanks were never meta, and those who complained about tanks being too strong never looked through itemsets; there's several items for shredding tanks (voidstaff, last whisper, ext).
