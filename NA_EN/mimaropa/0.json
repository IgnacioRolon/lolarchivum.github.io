I'd rather just wait around for the complete lore update instead of Billy, Steve, or Bob making an appearance out of nowhere. That way people know her bio is outdated, and a random character isn't created just to be overwritten later.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2017-01-18T22:42:42.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know, was just pointing out that a bandaid could be used here.
