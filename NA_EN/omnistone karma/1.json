Demacia is said to be declining due to being part of a changed world that it doesn't appear to be capable of adapting. It's still a strong military now but once everything else around it evolves completely, it's a matter of time before it falls behind in its military power. Piltover is pretty much the USA of Valoran. At least living there would feel somewhat familiar. Like Piltover, USA's glory days started when brilliant scientists and inventors were well commited to their ideas, creating advanced Technology that gave power to a progressive nation. Pretty soon Piltover will become the next region to have the most powerful military in the history of Valoran. They have machine guns, rockets, helicopters, all sorts of advanced weaponry. What does Demacia have? Swords? Shields? Axes? Magic Staffs? Those are nothing. Piltover's got the technology to harness magic and make a mere mortal become a one man killing machine. A battle between Piltover and Demacia or Piltover against any other nation would be the sorriest battle you'll ever see. You'll just have Piltover's airships rain death from above.
