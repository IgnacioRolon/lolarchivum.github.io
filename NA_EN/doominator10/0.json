I've had 3 crashes in the past 5 games. Crashes have all happened near the start of the game after getting into the rift within 5 minutes or so. Luckily they were on normal blinds and a co-op vs ai game. I haven't had this problem ever before and the only recent change was the windows anniversary update (not sure if related). Would like to find the issue as soon as possible, since I can't play ranked if I have to worry about this being a  constant worry. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Schwenkster22","date":"2017-05-08T01:01:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happens to me too, it isn't hardware whatsoever, since this new client has came out my laptop has crashed atlas 3 times before entering a game in simply the champion select screen!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"komerczka","date":"2017-04-25T21:27:20.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is happening to me also, once per week, in loading screen computer freezes and I need to restart it, randomly in rank or normals, I think the problem started somehow about beginigng af April...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-06T15:26:39.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your hardware, outdated drivers, or game files are failing to render the game properly and causing you to crash.
