My EUW account doesn't have alpha access, but my NA one does. So I can only log in through NA reigon, when I try to use EUW, it'll say that the account doesn't have access to alpha.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkhan","date":"2016-08-18T02:29:20.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your help.
