Even when i take a 2 week break its still tilting. And the more games you lose in a row the worse the games feel and im not sure why. Anyways guys if you saw the chat its not even my fault here except maybe being a little negative. But this is what happened. At start i said &quot;im kinda tilted guys sorry&quot; Not trying to make anyone mad but just to let them know. I made one bad gank after being 2/1/2 and anvia said &quot; lets report him&quot;\r\nShe literally flamed me in chat all game and i hadnt really said anything and then about half way through we were getting destroyed/i was getting flamed for no reason i started saying ok lets ff. But i never insulted this anvia. I donno man it just seems realyl hard to not get banned. I mean why even have chat ? Like if i ever decide to make another account id have to mute all everygame. Ok i told anvia to shut up for saying &quot;report panth&quot; non stop all game while im saying NOTHING and trying to play. I literally just got instabanned f this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-12-20T03:09:22.573+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, it appears your two week break coincidentally ended and this was the only game you played after it.

Im also good at the game when im not tilted. But too many side things going on to keep me tilted. The biggest issue is the mmr system. The more you lose the  more stressful the game gets no matter if youare in silver 2 or bronze 5. Like i toggled from sliver 3/silver 2 a few times. I even won like 7 ina row once and got promoted to slver 2. Then had a few games where i had people getting dc and we lose and the tilt starts. After i lose those 2 games that felt out of my control i have no way of still feeling positive. Again, if im in b5 or silver 2 when i am like this there is no turning back. Its just a depressing slide all the wy to B5. I just feel like i prove myself again and again that i can play at a certain level but then a few bad games and im in b5. So i dont mind losing lane or making mistakes and owning up to them. Its just all the extra bs that makes this game not fun. \nALSO READ THIS. I have played flex q and it was like 100x more fun, less stress and more teamwork. Its just solo q that seems unbareable but the people i used to play with dont play anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"TheProfezzor","date":"2017-12-20T00:09:44.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the other guy. You’re way too eomotiomal for this game. Can you be any more negative in game? Which is reportable by the way. You took a 2 week break which I assume was a 2 week ban. Then you come back, be negative (again-reportable) then tell another player to “stfu” (reportable-doesn’t matter if they started It). You deserve the ban. Maybe play a less competitive game or play vs boy cause you clearly can’t handle yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheEvilQueen135","date":"2017-12-20T01:38:25.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pantheonyourhead,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2UQNp1AE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-19T22:31:16.429+0000)\n>\n> meh. the game at its core i like.
