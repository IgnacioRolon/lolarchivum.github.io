Seeing as how we had just pushed the fix for Frost Queen's Claim, I hoped it had been resolved. However after seeing your video, I see that it is not fixed :[ so I dug into it a bit more.\n\nI think this issue is triggered by killing a minion to proc the cooldown on Tribute, and then upgrading the item. I noticed when you do this, there's other things that break with it too (like the cooldown timer for Frostfang's passive stops showing up, even though it should be on cooldown after killing a minion). \n\nI think as long as you don't upgrade Spellthief's Edge to Frostfang while the Tribute passive is on cooldown, I think this won't occur. If you find any other repros for it, please let me know!\n\nI'm going to dig into this tomorrow as well and pass it along to the proper dev. :) Thanks for the report.","replies":[{"poster":"Sona FemBoy","date":"2015-08-14T07:12:20.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for responding, this is still happening.  I saw this post mid-game, so I don't know if that's the trigger, but a simple sell & undo in the shop fixes Frostfang's gold gain from 5 back to the normal 10.\n\nYou probably know this by now, but to anyone else googling and seeing this thread on the first link, cheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"condemnedalpaca","date":"2015-08-14T15:46:10.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also noticed the lack of cooldown but I reread the description of ff and didn't see the cooldown, so I thought that went away after upgrading... apparently not.  I haven't played Nami or Karma recently, as Nami is no longer free and I'm not quite ready for Karma in pvp, so I haven't gotten Spellthief's Edge to notice if the frostfang is fixed, but thanks for the info and for passing it along.","replies":[]}]}]}
