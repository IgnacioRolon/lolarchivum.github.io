The first time I saw it activate I started dry heaving and almost threw up. The next time it went off I had the sense to shift my camera away from the fight. Needless to say I was a liability to my team because I physically could not play the game when Urgot&#039;s ult activates. I&#039;m not sure who felt that a meat grinder is within the thematic&#039;s of League, but I&#039;ve never played this game and ever felt like sicking violence and gore had a place in it. So an hour later when I was thinking more clearly I filled a support ticket. I was pleasantly surprised when a very helpful Rioter told me that I should post here as &quot;the developers look at the boards on occasion and might take this into consideration and maybe do something about this&quot;. So here I am, but in the mean time waste I&#039;ll be wasting my ban on Urgot and never playing blind again. I&#039;m not sure why such a gratuitous and repulsive ability even has a place in this game, but them&#039;s the breaks. \r\n\r\nSilver lining in all this is riot&#039;s support far exceeded any of my expectations props to them!","replies":[{"poster":"Nik Nikerson","date":"2017-09-01T02:58:22.411+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is bait, right?

A \"PG League Mode\", if you will, that just changes some of the animations visually. Who knows, maybe that will open up their options to actually make more graphic abilities like Urgot's ult, since the weak-stomached players can just turn it off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2017-09-01T03:57:50.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":". . .
