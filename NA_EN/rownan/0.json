The only time the 2 would be faster is if you lead with a rear hand punch but that is pretty rare and unorthodox in any form of fighting. The idea is you set up with a quick jab/feint and then rock em with the artillery of the rear hand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-14T21:34:19.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they'll retcon it with a comic that says he has hextech or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cpt Teemo 2019","date":"2020-01-14T21:31:24.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punch out was also a game but they did it right","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urbosa","date":"2020-01-14T21:18:25.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's also a video game and not real life","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cpt Teemo 2019","date":"2020-01-14T21:17:51.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess the one that made it up never watched boxing at all, cause Mike Tyson's 2nd punch is the knock out one","replies":[]}]}
