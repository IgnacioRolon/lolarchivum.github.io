Like unplayable lag spikes.  When I'm playing, sometimes my character just stands still, but everything around me is still going at normal pace.  Basically, I can watch my lane opponent just walk right up to me and kill me but I can't move no matter how much I click.  Sometimes I will watch my ping and it will launch up to 800 or so, but most of the time it will only go up to about 80 and I can't move or everything just stands still.  I'm getting blamed for feeding, when I can't even run away.  I have been on the same internet for a while and this has never happened before.  Like within the last week or so this has happened.  I don't know if it is on my side or what, but it is driving me crazy.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-10T22:48:11.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmm that sounds like your network is having some troubles with packet loss. Grab the network logs from that game for me if you can, and let this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them to see what we're dealing with. Take a screenshot and post it here so I can take a look!","replies":[{"poster":"JewsBox","date":"2017-10-10T23:12:07.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/Xcv638s this was just a random game that I picked from the logs.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-11T00:25:10.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whelp.....it's best to check the logs from the game that had the issues like I mentioned, since testing a game that didn't have issues doesn't really help =\\....\n\nLuckily it looks like that game had some major problems as well, since the packet loss spiked up to 70%. Packet loss happens before your connection ever reaches our servers, and happens due to how your ISP is routing your connection or possibly a damaged node somewhere along the way. Take that packet loss data to your ISP to see if there's any current issues or not, and ask them how they can fix this issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
