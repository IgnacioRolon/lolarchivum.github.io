Then the enemy team started to surpass us as far as map progression. (We lost inhib turret) and he basically said: \"Dude please, if you carry i'll get you pizza.\" he's 8 hours away from me. So I had to substitute my Mercurial Scimitar for a Guardian Angel, and that allowed me to survive in the following team fight, and land the ace. I pushed to next turret, and managed to get one down. Once team spawned, we went in for the win.\n\nHe called the Pizza Hut near my house and paid for it online, and I had it delivered. Hahah.
