You believe that. Riot, most of the playerbase, and I disagree. As for what someone \"should\" get banned for, your opinion of the rules is of zero relevance. When a cop stops you for going 40 in a 25 zone, you can claim \"I think the limit should be 45 here\" all you want. You're still getting a ticket. If a librarian asks you to keep your voice down while you use the facilities, shouting that libraries should be loud will simply get you escorted out. If you go to a friend's house who insists that you remove your shoes while you're in their home, \"that's a stupid rule and I do what I want\" will lose you a friend. If you are using someone else's services, facilities, equipment, etc., you abide by their rules or you deal with the consequences. If you think the rules should change, that is a completely different conversation (and I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for your chances at convincing Riot to change their rules to allow behavior like OP's).\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024051193-Understanding-Different-Ban-Types-FAQs):\n\n> We work with the overall community and within our own company guidelines to identify what disruptive behavior is and what the consequences for those behaviors should be.

It has nothing to do with self defense or honor or education or pride or justice system. When you play LoL, your physical integrity is not in danger. Heck, your personal honor is not even in danger either. Nobody forces you to defend yourself in a VIRTUAL game. You may say \"I was educated to defend myself and my honor\", which is great in some real life circumstances, useless in a virtual game with anonymous people.\n\nAlso, I meant \"stfu\" as an example of how little it would take now for you to lose your account permanently in a future game.
