Rumble's flamespitter applies multiple times, true, but moving out of range of the area of effect will immediately stop damage (barring liandry's). As somebody who doesn't play Rumble, I understand the point and would understand if an exception were made for this ability and the slow were trimmed to 20%, but I believe that this would be an exception rather than following the rule.\n\nFurther, Cho'Gath's E would also be an exception.\n\nIn the case of Singed, not only is the poison an AoE effect, but stepping into the poison applies a 3 second DoT which just so happens to be continuously reapplied so long as one stands in the effect. It should, by definition, cause a 20% slow instead of the 40% slow it is currently applying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"straight4free","date":"2015-07-14T11:03:09.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=AW1mvxVJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-14T08:23:41.776+0000)\n>\n> Should be fixed in the next patch.\n\nThank you very much!","replies":[]}]}]}
