You'd need to purchase the bundle. Firefighter Tristana is a Legacy skin, which means she'll periodically come out of the Legacy Vault.

I thought the intent of legacy skins was to retire old, bad quality, out-dated skins.\n\nFirefighter Tristana got completely VU'd when Tristana got VU'd. It is now a high quality skin that should be in the store.","replies":[{"poster":"WizardCrab","date":"2015-09-08T21:25:24.176+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've never brought a skin out of retirement before.

It shouldn't be retired.\n\nI hope you guys fix this lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
