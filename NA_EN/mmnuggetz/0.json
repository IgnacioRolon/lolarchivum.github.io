I have been having no problems until about a week ago when suddenly after a restart my computer couldnt launch the launcher like it normally could. Now i get this fustrating error everytime i try to play the game. The error is as follows\r\n\r\n\" the launcher has a bad image and that C:\\Windows\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft.vc80.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.6229_none_d089f796442de10e\\MSVCP80.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. It then tells me to try reinstalling the program using the original installation media or to contact my system administrator or software vendor for support.\"\r\n\r\nI have tried reinstalling, it creates the short cut, however when i try to launch the laucher to download it gives me the same error.\r\n Now, I've already tried to reinstall the game and it doesn't do anything, the same error message pops up.  Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated. Also as a side note I'm not very good with technologically so if you could explain in simple terms that that'd be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T18:20:43.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error is generally caused by a specific package of software that League relies on becoming corrupted or is missing entirely.

I've also heard that running windows updates can resolve the issue. If for some reason that doesn't work, you should try a clean reinstall using our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367). After installing the app, simply run it, check the boxes for **Reinstall** and **Clean Uninstall**, then let it do its thing for a bit.
