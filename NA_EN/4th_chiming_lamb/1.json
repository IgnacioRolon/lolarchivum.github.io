Your farm seems fairly low tbh..... Im willing to bet that is most of it right there. Depending on the length of the game as well, that really could determine the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"4th Chiming Lamb","date":"2017-05-06T01:36:53.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was 40 minutes long, rounded up. The two factors that I think stopped me from getting an S are my Control Wards and, as you pointed out, farm. Thinking on it again, out of the two, I think my low farm was the big one the messed me up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-05-06T00:27:39.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize rankings are based on averages for the champion, lane and player rank, not some magical value that is the same everywhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Ya≈õuo Main","date":"2017-05-06T00:32:35.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the post?","replies":[]},{"poster":"4th Chiming Lamb","date":"2017-05-06T00:30:12.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes; I've had games where I went 6/4/10 and was behind a level (as Kha'Zix), and got an S flat somehow.
