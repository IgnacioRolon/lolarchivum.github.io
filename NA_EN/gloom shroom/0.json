So I tried to go back to the legacy client but it doesn't work at all. Nothing happens when I click 'Launch Legacy Client' on the new login screen, and nothing happens when I try and use the old launcher. The only way I can get it to work is if I repair the old launcher and even then it will only work once, if I close and reopen it I have to repair again if I want to use it again. \n\nAny help? I would really like to use the legacy client I prefer it much more. I would just like it to work like it used too, without having to repair it every time I play.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-16T04:29:17.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your PC is having a hard time reaching our Legacy Client platform. This is most likely caused by an *unstable connection* as a result of network settings that simply don't play nicely with League. I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are in the clear.\n\nLet me know if you experience further issues with this after taking those steps.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloom Shroom","date":"2017-02-16T05:40:05.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. After I finish up some work I will look at those steps. Thanks, i'll get back to you with the results later.\nPS; last night after I made this post I did a complete re install. It functioned the same way the repairs do, with it only working once and all.","replies":[]}]}]}
