It was fine when I first got online and to the website, but when I tried after playing a few matches nothing showed up. Am I the only one having this problem? Anyone know what I might be able to do to fix this? I've attached a screenshot of what I get when I open the page for reference.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-09-17T22:15:43.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Forest Gem!\n\nUsually this error occurs when a player changes the language settings on their client.  Did you make any changes to your Client so that the client and the game will use a different language or voices other than English (such as Korean)?","replies":[{"poster":"Forest Gem","date":"2014-09-18T00:16:28.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have made no changes to the client that would change the language.

However, the most common reason we see this issue is due to the fact that players have changed the locale files on their client.  If you go to the advanced match history from your client to the webpage, the URL link will break and not properly appear.\n\nThe other common root cause for this issue are issues with the cookies/cache of your web browser.  I recommend that you try clearing out your cookies and cache by following this guide:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/28756024-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies\n\nIf this still doesn't affect the page from loading at all, could you try loading this page in a different web browser?  It would help us greatly in eliminating your browser itself as a possible root cause.","replies":[{"poster":"aimlis1","date":"2014-09-21T10:26:48.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening for me too.

It can be really valuable information to know if it works in one browser and not the other, as you can narrow down what the problem might be. Try it in \"incognito mode\" in Chrome (ctrl+shift+N), and see if you get the problem again. If you really don't want to try it in IE, you can try it with another browser like Firefox.","replies":[{"poster":"Forest Gem","date":"2014-09-17T20:12:28.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, just tried it in IE, and it was the same issue.
