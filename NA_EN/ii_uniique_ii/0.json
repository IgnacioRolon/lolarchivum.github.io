Why isn't that an issue? They have a BS matchmaking system to keep everyone hovering around .500 record wise and now they have followed that up with a BS reporting system. Hard to have trust in something with  so much BS so I tend to believe in a lot of these posts because I have experienced much of what they are saying as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AtheismIsStupid","date":"2015-08-27T15:41:47.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has spoken on this issue numerous times - ONE GAME WILL NOT WARRANT A PUNISHMENT UNLESS YOU WERE EXTREMELY TOXIC.  \nBEING REPORTED BY A PREMADE WILL NOT GET YOU PUNISHED EITHER.\n\nIf you think its bullshit, send a ticket into player support and they will be very candid as to why you got punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ramelznak","date":"2015-08-27T15:20:32.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't there, so I cannot know if you're telling the truth of not. However, I think that player behavior cases that are flagged by Riot's automatic system should be automatically sent to a high priority queue of the Tribunal to be dealt with quickly, not punished by a computer system. While this new system seems to do a pretty good job of getting the really toxic people, it seems that too many \"innocent\" people get punished and then have to jump through hoops to get their names cleared. It seems like at times people are guilty until they can prove themselves innocent.","replies":[{"poster":"II UniiQue II","date":"2015-08-27T15:26:07.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea ...its just irritating, i hope the tribunal will return and soon...i dont want this interfering with my seasonal rewards and such","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2015-08-27T15:24:22.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you get a chat restriction or other such punishment?  If not I wouldn't let it get to you.  The system sends out a warning after your reported even if the report is false as a just in case.  Considering your team may have been blanket reported if they all were being negative its a fair assumption you where selected at the end of game because the reportie was too mad to remember who was who.","replies":[]}]}
