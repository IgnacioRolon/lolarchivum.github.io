His account was hacked on Friday August 19th and in less than half an hour five unauthorized Paypal charges were made for RP on his account totaling $150.00. He immediately changed his Paypal password and created a support ticket. He also created a second support ticket, under a different topic (wasn't sure if he used the right one).\n\nThe tickets in question are:\n(#22977215)\n8/19  20:48\n(#23012323)\n8/22 15:32\n\nYesterday we realized that his account was transferred to EU West by using the password recovery tool on different regions until we got a hit. He planned to change the password so that he could at least log into his account so that he could see his ticket(s) status. Unfortunately, after utilizing the recovery tool he got the error \"Sorry, we couldn't find that combination of username, password, and region\". We are both hoping that this means his account was locked (and not banned!!!) on behalf of Riot, after his first support ticket. \n\nOur questions now are:\n1. How can he monitor the status of his ticket(s) without being able to log into his account?\n2. Should we have made the ticket(s) on EU West, since the account was transferred there?\n3. Is there any chance that he will be able to get the RP (or money) refunded when he can recover his account? (it is to my understanding, that if he does a chargeback then the account will be banned, so we're hoping at least it will be refunded so that he can use it on things he would like - like a transfer back to NA)\n4. Should he do anything else at this time?\n\nThank you for your time. His account was made in 2010 and he would be devastated to lose it forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T15:22:33.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for your boyfriend and see that a specialist has received the ticket (23012323) and will reach out as soon as possible.  22977215 was closed to prevent confusion that could be caused by having multiple tickets open.  I believe an auto-email would be sent out once a ticket is responded to.  Just as a heads up, we have to be pretty strict about account security and ownership so any further correspondence will have to be done directly with your boyfriend, and not any other third parties.  \n\nThe ticket was sent to the right place, so rest easy knowing your boyfriend will be in good hands!","replies":[{"poster":"Internet Unicorn","date":"2016-08-25T01:36:31.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely understandable, we just wanted to make sure that the ticket was sent to the appropriate place (and that he didn't need one open in EU West as well).
