Unfortunately I have yet to understand what is really being said when people say \"farm his Q\" or anything related to this. Now when I google it for results I get a bunch of threads that overwhelmingly talk about numbers in regards to timing (10 min, 20 min, etc.) When I hear \"farm q\" or any of the abilities, I immediately think lvl the \"Q\" ability for example, as quickly as you can. So like a QWERQQWQQ, to me I think get that Q leveled first. Please correct me and/or help me understand this concept. Again excuse me for if I am sounding primitive, just trying to get to know all the ropes of this game, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Old Man","date":"2014-01-08T20:18:06.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using Nasus ({{champion:75}}) as an example; when someone says \"Nasus, go farm your Q\" they're telling Nasus to last hit with his Q, which adds stacks to it. And with that particular ability, more stacks = more damage. \n\nWhen you're talking about farming in relation to timeframes (10m, 20m, etc), that's just referring to the amount of CS you want/should have by that time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-01-10T06:48:02.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello GrizzlyBearDoug!\n\nThank you for bringing your questions here to the Help and Support Forum!  I believe I can step in and help alleviate some confusion you may be experiencing.  First, lets make sure that there is an understanding with the terminology.\n\nWhen someone states that they are \"farming\" or \"I'm going to go farm\", they are referring to killing minions either in the lane, or creeps in the Jungle (wraiths, wolves, Golems, etc, etc).  As an example, the Marksman, will usually be the one mainly farming in bottom lane.\n\nWhen playing Nasus however, people will often talk about \"farming his Q\".  His Q ability, when activated, does extra damage to a target.  But, if the Q ability kills the target, this ability gains a permanent increase in damage.  Therefore, many people who play Nasus will try to use his Q to last hit as many minions in lane as possible in an effort to get his Q incredibly powerful.  To this end, most people will make sure that they max level Q first, before all other abilities.  \n\nI hope this helps resolve some confusion!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"IMgrizli","date":"2014-01-10T17:23:52.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks guys that help a huge amount and makes tons of sense.","replies":[]}]}]}
