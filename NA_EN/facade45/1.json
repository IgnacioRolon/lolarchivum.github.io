The numbers can be changed since it&#039;s not concrete but the idea is what counts. So here it is:\n\nPassive: On top of his old passive \nNew: Reduces cooldown of all allies range of 100 - 600 (range gets bigger based on levels) by 1 - 0.1 seconds (decreases as leveling up) each time a spell is casted in range. For Zilean, the cooldown reduction is flat 1 second but this cannot reduce W or R ability.\n\nQ: Time bomb. Same thing but he has the option to automatically use a 2nd Q at the cost of 35 mana (Like lee sin spells). Then he is unable to use his 2nd time bomb for 14/13/12/10/9 seconds. The original time bomb cooldown and stun duration is the same.\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 55 / 95 / 145 / 210 / 280 (+ 100% AP). \n\nW: Going to the past. Targets himself or an ally to move (go back in time) where the champ or himself was 3 seconds before. This has a 1 second delay. An indicator will show where the target is teleporting to. Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10\n\nE: Time Warp. Zilean bends time around himself, Slow icon slowing all enemies or hastening all allies in range by an amount for 2.5 seconds. This is toggled to either slow/speed enemies/allies so it cannot do both. SLOW/SPEED BOOST:  25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%.  Range: 100/250/400/550/700  Cost, mana, cooldown are the same.\n\nR: Chronoshift. Zilean places a protective time rune or a harmful rune on an allied or enemy champion for 5 seconds.\nIf an ally takes lethal damage or if an enemy does not take lethal damage during that time, they will be placed in stasis, making them untargetable and invulnerable. After 2 seconds, the ally is revived or an enemy slowly loses a set amount of health in span of 5 seconds. The enemy however cannot have lower than 1 hp. \nHEALTH REGAINED/LOSS: 600 / 850 / 1100 (+ 200% AP).  Range, cost and cooldown are the same.\n\nSo basically, I took out his W ability and put it in the passive. He has a new W ability where he lets an ally or himself go back in time. This allows to peel himself or the champ more useful as a support. \n\nHis time bomb spell is the same thing, except now the cooldown for both 1st and 2nd time bombs are automatically reduced when leveled  because you don&#039;t need to level your W to reduce it. The scaling AP is slightly increased but base damage is decreased. The bomb is going to be more used around level 3 and 4 and it&#039;s op when maxing Q. His late game will be stronger however.\n\nFor his E: Time Warp. It&#039;s the same thing except it has a range. Either slow a bunch of enemies or speed allies (like SIvir&#039;s Ultimate but lesser degree). This allows zilean to help all his allies speed or slow down enemies.\n\nFor his R: chronoshift. It&#039;s the same thing except now enemies can be casted as well. They lose health for some time but cannot die. This could result in interesting plays and especially killing tanks becomes somehow viable, giving him a presence in the tank meta. \n\nConclusion:\nI have done some research and concluded that his 1v1 is OP but is awful late game. With more diverse abilities, he will be more useful lategame.\n\nIf you have feedback, then state below but please read carefully as it took a lot of time and thought before you feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-21T22:08:56.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That hasty/slow aura on his E is too OP, its better and less toxic his actual E, the passive its better if you do like the Ryze passive. Q needs a recharge mechanic. the new W have fit very well thematic, but need a internal passive to be more interesting","replies":[{"poster":"Facade45","date":"2015-04-22T06:21:00.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might sound op but it's not. Probably time warp will be maxed second so it's not going to be abused in laning phase. Also, it's not an aura. It's a target ability so the player is bound to miss on an enemy team like Xerath's ultimate. My bad I didn't clarify that.\n\nFor the E ability, notice the movement speed, it's 25% at the beginning. It should be buffed. It's not even noticable. Draven's W has around 40% at level 1 and it's barely visible. Also the range is 100 at the start. Do you know how much that is? That's like 1/6 of Kassadin's riftstep. It's barely any range. It's basically a -self-cast until maxed out. Possibly late game, it is OP but the values can change. I do agree if it is used on allies, it is OP. But I am not sure how to change it at the moment. Maybe adding a restriction of 1 ally can be casted at level 1, 2 allies at level 6, 3 allies at level 11 and 4 allies at level 16. \nThe problem with the old E ability is it's not very useful late game. It slows only 1 person. The new E allows a team to engage or enemy team caught out. \n\nThe Q already has a built in recharge mechanic with the passive. The only problem is it's not controllable like having the old W skill. But people spam W anyway so it won't make an impact. Remember with the new passive, the cooldown goes down along with his E ability. But his W and R does not.\n\nI think the ultimate and the new W ability makes up for the boring passive. His ultimate can be casted on enemies and be gone slowly. And W allows to save ADCs. Changing the passive means completely changing the way he is played. Like nidalee's passive got changed, she was changed completely. Adding a new mechanic is not easy. \n\nI see why riot had a hard time balancing.  His 1v1 is op while late game he stinks. I already have a headache trying to think. This is the best I can come up with. If you have better idea then please post.","replies":[]}]}]}
