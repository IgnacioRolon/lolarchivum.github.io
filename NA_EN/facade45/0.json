Also, some suggestions do not have numbers; this is because I don&#039;t know how much is needed to balance but it still needs changes nonetheless. This is my first time posting so please be lenient. :D \n\nSo to introduce myself, I started to play LoL ever since Season 3 (this is a smurf). I am not going to give an exact rank but I&#039;m around a low plat player with lesser skills since I haven&#039;t played as much because of education.  You know what they say, marks are inversely proportional to ip lol. However, I watch more than I play, especially at higher elo. I have mained top lane back in Season 3 but now I play all roles.\n\nSo first off, here are some champ ideas and reasoning after. Note: values are not permanent but changed accordingly\n\n{{champion:201}} Braum \nReduce cooldown on W and E, OR reduce the mana cost per level for all abilities. pick one!\n**Q: concussive blows**\nIf the Q hits the target, mana cost is reduced by half. \n**W: stand behind me **\nAble to hop and protect an allied ward. However, he cannot use his Q or R for 0.5 seconds after he hops to a ward. (Basically silenced for Q and R for 0.5 s after hopping).\n\nThe problem with braum is his long cdr and mana cost, which means he can only stay in lane for a short time before his mana runs out, especially the early phases. His cdr is unforgiving especially in lower elo where his Q misses more than half the time. Even pro players can hit Q around half the time. Decreasing cdr or mana will make less of a boring laning phase. Biggest problem is that he has no escape other than his W which is not good. That&#039;s why his **death ratio is always high**. Hoping on a ward allows **at least a chance to escape** or make plays and skill. I don&#039;t think this will op as he has such a long cooldown and a 0.5 second silence will gives the enemy a chance to dodge and decide. Choosing to hop on a ward means that an ally is not getting protection so the braum has to think twice before using. \n\nIt is true that Braum is a peeler for the carry which was the intention for the designer. However, he **cannot peel without killing himself** in the process which is why the death ratio is so high. **There is a much better support who does better peeling so he is never picked.** It&#039;s obviously janna{{champion:40}} . With her movement speed and instant knockback with healing, she is much better. The ward hopping mechanic will hopefully open new options instead of peeling for a bit, retreat and recall because of mana issues and it&#039;s a vicious cycle.\n\nIn general, champions with low mobility with little range tend to be less favoured in lcs and ranked. This includes {{champion:114}} fiora, {{champion:122}} darius, etc. Not saying they&#039;re underpowered, but less picked. Maybe adding a ward hop onto darius E and fiora Q is possible but will require a ridiculous amount of tweaks to get them balanced so I won&#039;t get into that.\n\n{{champion:110}}  Varus\nEver since the nerf of bloodthirster, he is one of the lower tier adcs and going ap is not that good either. So..\n**W: Blighted Quiver**\nNo mana cost. 15 s cooldown\n**Active:** 35/40/45/50/55% movement speed for 1.5 s. **Debuffs:** Using his Q during this, will slow him 30% instead of usual 20% at the first cast (his recurve animation). Using his E or R abilities within 1.5 seconds after activation of this, will give him a debuff -10% movement speed.\n  \nOR\n\n**Another Passive**: every 3rd auto attack gives 30% movement speed decaying over 2 seconds. Same debuffs apply. This can be **toggled** like {{champion:22}} ashe&#039;s W ability. If there&#039;s 2 stacks and toggle is cancelled, it will cancel the stacks as well and debuffs no longer apply. If the passive goes off consecutive for the next 2 seconds, it will give -10% less for each time it goes off. So, 30%, 20%, 10% then no longer gives passive at the 4th time.\n\nThe point of this is not increasing kiting potential but** allow to escape**. The active one is like **draven&#039;s W spell**. The reason for the debuffs is to allow him to escape without being OP. The player must choose to use it carefully or it will be their death.\nThe other one is like **gnar&#039;s W spell**. This is more kiting potential but it will give more chance to escape say lissandra or maokai. (although chances are slim). However this will work greatly with his passive which is why consecutive W passives will lower each time to prevent OP. These stats are not permanent but just general, the numbers can be changed around. The reason for no mana cost is because his **mana costs for other abilities are high**. Mana cost per level would be devastating. Most people agree that maxing Q, then E second is not good for this reason. \n\nI am surprised there are little to no toggle abilities in this game. In warcraft 3, it was quite common and works well. \n\n\n{{champion:76}} \nBush trap does 50% damage to monsters. \nRestore her health per level and base health at patch 5.7\n\nI am sure this will solve the problem. Ever since the bush whack starting working on jungle camps, her jungling capabilities were OP. **Before, she was generally fine.** Maybe she needs little tweaking but that was it. She is not that great in the top lane or mid lane without lot of practice, therefore nerfing her health will make her even **less viable mid or top**. In fact, lot of champions are being less viable in top, mid or jungle but it&#039;s another topic.\n\n**Cinderhulk does not replace the juggernaut item**. Both should exist.\nThe cinderhulk item has only helped junglers that **rely on hp** such as {{champion:154}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:36}} but others who **needs utility like cooldown reduction** more got indirectly nerfed. This includes {{champion:54}} and {{champion:60}} and other champions who need tankiness but more on utility. Malphite is **supposed to stack armor not health**. That&#039;s why he&#039;s nerfed because now you&#039;re **forced to buy mercury treads for tenacity**. This is confirmed by TheOddone.  Same thing for elise.\n\nNow for the good stuff, **summoner spells changes:**\n{{summoner:21}} Barrier\nIncrease duration by 0.25. So it lasts total of 2.25 seconds.\n\nYou may think this doesn&#039;t make a difference but it does. Basically, people bait out the barrier then at some point, put on ignite. The ignite will tick longer than the barrier so it will kill the champion making barrier useless. This is one of the reasons why heal is much preferred. Giving longer duration helps to stop ignite and longer trades.\n\n{{summoner:2}} clairvoyance\nPlace an invulnerable ward which reveals stealth lasting for 20 seconds. Has triple the ward range to place it. 90 second cooldown\n\nThis is probably the worst summoner spell. This will prove to be useful especially in the jungle and deciding late game decisions. This might look useless but this has a low cooldown so technically you can guess where the enemy jungler is lot of times. \n\n{{summoner:13}} Clarity\nIncreases current mana regeneration by 3 times and allies for 2 times for a period of 3 seconds.\n OR\nRestores 50% maximum mana to you and 30% maximum mana for allies. Area of effect: 700\n\nAgain numbers can be tweaked around but the point of this is to have better laning phase. Champions like {{champion:101}} could prove to be useful. The instant mana gain doesn&#039;t work because it&#039;s used up so fast. That&#039;s why no one uses this spell. Also, increasing the range could help in team fights and sieging.\n\n{{summoner:1}} Cleanse\nAllies also lower duration of incoming disables by 32.5% for 3 seconds. AoE of 400.\n\nThis stops the cc tank meta kinda. Notice the low aoe so in teamfights, your only going to lower disables to 3 allies at most realistically.\n\n**Revive should come back!** with...\nReduces death timer by 100% starting at level 1 up to 40% reduction by level 18 and allies by 50% reduction at level 1 to 20% at level 18. \nGlobal with usual 540 second cd.\n\nThis might sound OP but again, numbers can be changed. The point is to have strategic uses. This could be stacked if more than two players have it but it will be twice as less efficient if used instantaneously. Also, unless everyone is dead, this doesn&#039;t reduces for everyone on the team. Also, at most, this will only reduce up till 30 seconds of death, assuming you have 75 seconds of death at like 50 minute mark. Could make interesting plays :D\nThe whole point of this is to change the meta of summoner spells, adding diversity.\n\n**Improving Custom Game Interface**\nI actually play a decent amount of customs, in fact half of my games are custom to test out runes, masteries, and builds to prevent unnecessary bad ranked games. Also, lot of times I don&#039;t have time for ranks so that&#039;s why (current state of game).  \n\n1. **All the bots** currently selected for the game can be **changed to intermediate or beginner level with one button **\nSeriously, it&#039;s tedious to select each and every bot to intermediate every time, especially if there&#039;s 9 bots in a game.\n\n2. Also, there should be an option to save a bot(s) selecting a champion when creating a game. For example, I want to play against an intermediate Renekton {{champion:58}} bot and Wukong {{champion:62}} bot so each time I login to play customs, they will already be saved and ready. Now, it&#039;s an option so the player can choose which isn&#039;t going to affect the memory space. This is kind of like saving masteries but much less.\n\n**PBE should have all runes for free to test out different strategies**\nNo one is going to use spell vamp or energy level runes because people don&#039;t know if they&#039;re viable or not. Testing out runes would help developers give direction for new runes or tweaks. Technically, this can be disagreed because most people can buy runes but who&#039;s going to buy energy per level runes? Also, I don&#039;t have time to stack up ip. I remember saving around 8k ip in season 4 and recently saving 12k ip for season 5** just to buy only runes** for the meta. I would say around 25 games to get 4800 ip so that&#039;s ridiculous.\n\nAaaaand that&#039;s it. This **took lot of time and thought to type this** so if you disagree then type below with a better solution.\n\nI will put thoughts on the new black cleaver, reworks on akali{{champion:84}}, diana{{champion:131}}, ezreal{{champion:81}} and other changes to champions if this post has lot of upvotes.  Not the poll though.\n\nPeace {{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T21:33:38.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to see the new ideas of Zilean, pls post soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Facade45","date":"2015-04-21T02:34:18.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I know zilean needs more tweaking but since riot has already reworked him, they're not going to change much.

For Zilean, the cooldown reduction is flat 1 second but this cannot reduce W or R ability.\n\nQ: Time bomb. Same thing but he has the option to automatically use a 2nd Q at the cost of 35 mana (Like lee sin spells). Then he is unable to use his 2nd time bomb for 14/13/12/10/9 seconds. The original time bomb cooldown and stun duration is the same.\nMAGIC DAMAGE: 55 / 95 / 145 / 210 / 280 (+ 100% AP). \n\nW: Going to the past. Targets himself or an ally to move (go back in time) where the champ or himself was 3 seconds before. This has a 1 second delay. An indicator will show where the target is teleporting to. Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10\n\nE: Time Warp. Zilean bends time around himself, Slow icon slowing all enemies or hastening all allies in range by an amount for 2.5 seconds. This is toggled to either slow/speed enemies/allies so it cannot do both. SLOW/SPEED BOOST:  25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%.  Range: 100/250/400/550/700  Cost, mana, cooldown are the same.\n\nR: Chronoshift. Zilean places a protective time rune or a harmful rune on an allied or enemy champion for 5 seconds.\nIf an ally takes lethal damage or if an enemy does not take lethal damage during that time, they will be placed in stasis, making them untargetable and invulnerable. After 2 seconds, the ally is revived or an enemy slowly loses a set amount of health in span of 5 seconds. The enemy however cannot have lower than 1 hp. \nHEALTH REGAINED/LOSS: 600 / 850 / 1100 (+ 200% AP).  Range, cost and cooldown are the same.\n\nReasonings:\nSo basically, I took out his W ability and put it in the passive. He has a new W ability where he lets an ally or himself go back in time. This allows to peel himself or the champ more useful as a support. \n\nHis time bomb spell is the same thing, except now the cooldown for both 1st and 2nd time bombs are automatically reduced when leveled  because you don't need to level your W to reduce it. The scaling AP is slightly increased but base damage is decreased. The bomb is going to be more used around level 3 and 4 and it's op when maxing Q. His late game will be stronger however.\n\nFor his E: Time Warp. It's the same thing except it has a range. Either slow a bunch of enemies or speed allies (like SIvir's Ultimate but lesser degree). This allows zilean to help all his allies speed or slow down enemies.\n\nFor his R: chronoshift. It's the same thing except now enemies can be casted as well. They lose health for some time but cannot die. This could result in interesting plays and especially killing tanks becomes somehow viable, giving him a presence in the tank meta. \n\nConclusion:\nI have done some research and concluded that his 1v1 is OP but is awful late game. With more diverse abilities, he will be more useful lategame.\n\nLooks like I will post this on another post.
