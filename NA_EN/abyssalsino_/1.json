I didn&#039;t realize this myself until the nerf on her plants made it into the live game and it is in this thread i&#039;m going to discuss and clear things out to why she is currently in such a bad position.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s start off with her Passive\r\nHer passive is not all too bad but can it be made better? Yes. The range on her passive should see a big decrease to eliminate useless seed spawns and give her passive a new purpose.\r\n\r\nInstead of waiting and hoping that seeds spawn near the enemy, the range on her passive should be decreased so that seeds only spawn in a medium-sized radius around her which are to be used only defensively.\r\n\r\nZyra is extremely immobile and squishy so running away isn&rsquo;t an option, she has to put up a fight on the spot to be able to get away. As a zone mage she should do what she does best. Zone. This way when assasins dive her and junglers gank her she will be able to put up more of a fight thanks to the seeds scattered around close to her.\r\nSomewhat smaller than the size of Jannas R sounds relevant to me.\r\n\r\nThis is how i personally see it, the seeds on her W should be used offensively and the seeds on her passive should be used defensively.\r\n\r\nAnd her Q\r\nLet&#039;s ignore the fact that the change on her Q from a circular shape to a rectangular shape was a huge nerf and talk about something else for now.\r\n\r\nAs if it wasn&#039;t enough that her Q is currently hard to hit it also has a low range and delayed cast time to top it off and make things way worse for her. Zyra has to put herself in way too much danger just to get a Q off, giving most champions the oppurtunity to jump on and even then this ability is easily dodged due to its shape and cast time.\r\n\r\nA relevant change on her Q would be to increase the range to put Zyra in a safer spot, so that can she can poke without putting herself into too much danger, shorten the delayed cast time to make it somewhat harder to dodge to give Zyra some form of reliable damage and last but not least, this addition isn&rsquo;t neccessary but it did sound appealing to me without taking things over the top. When deadly spines explode, spines should also shoot out to the outer rectangle dealing (30%?) less damage, with this change she will suit the AoE mage title that she has been given way more than she does now and making her plants focus the enemy won&#039;t be as difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd her W\r\nTheres not much to say about this ability other than the fact that it needs buffs. She can only produce one seed every 20 seconds during the earlier stages of the game, you don&#039;t need to be a genius to realize that that is INSANE.\r\n\r\nOne plant that doesn&#039;t target the enemy and dies almost instantly every 20 seconds forces her to be completely dependant on the seeds randomly scattered around in awkward places by her passive.\r\n\r\nZyra has to put herself in awkward and possibly dangerous positions to be close to her seeds, this isn&rsquo;t how it should be. Zyra shouldn&rsquo;t be controlled by her seeds, she should be the one to control her seeds.\r\n\r\nA relevant change would be to make it so that Zyra can now store 3 seeds, however with one exception. Her third seed will be on a 3 second cooldown after she has placed her first two. Also buff her W to 11/10/9/8/7 but make it so that it doesn&#039;t get affected by CDR. This way she won&rsquo;t have to be dependant on the seeds spawned by her passive.\r\n\r\nHer E and last but not least her ultimate\r\nThose two abilities are in my opinion completely fine and don&rsquo;t need any changes.\r\n\r\nLong story short? She&#039;s a midlaner completely uncapable of going mid due to her inferior kit and is also in a bad position in the support lane. Her kit needs work. Pretty please?","replies":[{"poster":"koshkyra","date":"2017-04-09T20:24:34.641+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Everyone complained about Zyra being \"cancer\" so they gutted her from \"slightly op zone control mage\" to \"underpowered low range control support\"\n\nShe is incredibly weak and her only hope is to go support items and get CDR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T20:02:02.830+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's the problem with railroading her to the support position. As soon as damage supports get out of the meta because of itemization she falls out of the meta completely because she can't midlane anymore. Specially after they changed the plants AI to no longer automatically target champions in range.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-04-09T20:43:23.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is one reason why I dislike people who play champions from other roles to support. They are going from a role of damage to a role poking and protecting. The damage a mid lane anyone has will be good enough to deal good damage to the enemy bots. This is true, of course, after the Season 6 Mid year Mage update where Mages got lower AP Ratios and higher base damages. \n\nMaybe we should get Riot to revert that change? But then they have to give AP back into items and seeing how they are into AD itemization, I doubt Riot would do that.\n\nIf it becomes popular and meta enough, we should be seeing a nerf to Camille, not because she is a strong top laner, but because she is a strong support. Camille gutted forever. All the top lane Camille mains will hate that, of course.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frightning","date":"2017-04-09T20:01:10.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How hard did they hit her plants, because unless were talking like 20%+ of their dmg gone, I doubt she's become unviable in mid, let alone sup (which is actually pretty damn good at tbqh).","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T20:05:42.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not the damage nerf so much as the nerfs on her W cooldowns, the randomness of her passive and lastly how the plants no longer automatically target champions in range. The last one was the nail on the coffin, because now she can't use her spells to trigger plant aggro AND on the minions to clear them. That means she has to choose to zone or waveclear, which is unviable when every midlaner can do both.","replies":[{"poster":"Ark Sorcerer","date":"2017-04-09T20:34:04.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I played Zyra, it was nice to see 2, 3, 4 plants target the enemy and punish the enemy mage/assassin/marksmen/support for getting too close. Now I feel like I have to auto the enemy for the plants to go \"Target this champion\" which is risky and should never be necessary.  \n\nI feel like her Q plants (Thorn Spitters are they?) lost a lot of damage, not only from the nerf but from the targeting system. I am tired of my plants targeting the nearest healthy minion and not the enemy champions. I miss out on so much damage from that. \n\nThere were times the enemy duo (when I play support) were afraid of me specifically and I could create a zone where my marksmen can be safe. Place plants at the river entrance (Ward Tri-bush if on blue side) so if the enemy jungler makes an appearance, they will be greeted with 3 or more plants and lose quite a bit of HP that would make them staying long risky.\n\nNow, I cannot rely on the plants to give the damage they should produce.
