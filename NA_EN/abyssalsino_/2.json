Zyra already has pretty comparably low bases compared to most mages, stopping at 200 for both her E and Q alone.\n\nThat's bullshit.\n \nZyra's highest damage ability is her plants. They have a damage of 114+(0.15AP) per hit at level 18. This is upwards of 50% of Zyra's kit's damage at base, slightly less when building AP because the ratio is pathetic. Seriously, the ratio on plant is so bad that it takes 760 AP for Zyra to double the damage. That is unheard of for a mage, almost every other mage doubles the damage on their primary damage ability with between 300 and 500 AP. To put into perspective just how bad 760 AP to double is it takes Janna 560 AP to double the damage on her Zephyr, not even her primary damage ability.\n\nIn short you're looking at the wrong abilities. Zyra has astonishingly high bases, just on her primary damage ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2017-03-02T04:11:35.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So we tone the bases, and raise Ratios on what?

I'd like to see quite a bit of power pulled from plants bases and put back into both her plants ratios and her Q in general.

Universally they reward more AP while the Q and R changes reward hitting levels earlier, which mid Zyra does.

Her plants are stronger and don't die to AoE instantly. Her plants auto target for significant damage, unlike Donger turrets where you can easily avoid the majority of their damage. You can't dive a Zyra when she has seeds because of her R and plants, just like you can't dive a Donger nest. She offers a much better teamfight both damage wise and utility wise. The only thing Heimer does better is instadeleting a squishy with RW. You just have to kill her when she doesn't have seeds, which means in laning phase to kill her as soon as she gets back to lane before she can get seeds as you can't effectively deny her creating her plants.  If you go to kill one, there's a good chance you'll eat Q damage and if you're too slow you'll eat plant damage.\n\nComparing her to Lux, Lux can easily apply E AA but at least her E is one of the highest costing spells in the game. You can safely dive a Lux if she has used her Q, but even without Zyra's E she has the threat of QR into thorny death. Zyra is the epitome of having to kill her before she can do anything.\n\nYes, I understand Ahri's kit is good against her, (W one shots plants if they all target the plant iirc.) and an E means death, but its having the ability to actually get to E her is the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-03-03T14:43:30.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get your point, you just miss one thing that has never been actually spoken: Her seeds are a minigame you have to play around, same as, let's say, Ekko's R damage - you have to play around it. Position yourself to engage on her from the angle she has no seeds in. A good Zyra will watch you and position herself to be always covered. There are many things you can do with it. \n\n**a)** You can pretend to engage where she has the most seeds and immidately back off - you can make her use her Q and thus let her waste all the seeds in the area, which many - if not most - will do, because they're hungry for an easy kill of an opponent that walks in her garden by themself. When the plants die, you can engage. \n\n**b)** You can walk around the seeds to make her move so she tries to position seeds between herself and you and bait her right in the trap of your jungler, that can immidiately CC her so you can follow up with your CC, or a stealthed jungler - that's why Evelynn is a great counterpick. \n\n**c)** If she has suspiciously few seeds in the lane, NEVER follow her in the bush, because seeds are set to spawn there primarilly and she's going to try to stay close to the bush where she has seeds stacked up in. If your jungler ganks, it's actually a good idea to gank FROM that bush, since that cuts her from the seeds and leaves her helpless - only pay attention if the bush is warded, then they would come to a sure death.\n\nThose are just few examples what to do, but it's situational most of the time, as it depends on the seeds spawned RNG and the Zyra player's playstyle as an individual, but if I should generalize it, just play around the seeds, the rest of her kit is rather easy to dodge and anticipate. Also roam, if you manage to catch her when she follows, she has nothing to do, because she has no seeds nearby and is so squishy you can burst her before she manages to cast Grasping roots.\n\nAnd I said I won't tell anyone as I would be against myself below, lul...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2017-03-02T21:16:54.107+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"As an Ahri main, it's surprising to see you feel this way.

Hoping that we can make Zyra more reliable :)\n\nPassive: No change.\n\"But make seeds spawn in close proximity OR have spells be able to reach the same distance as the seeds.\n\nQ: Increase damage OR ap ratio.\n\"NEW\" The size of the spell grows twice at levels 8/16. As a controller this definitely helps with reaching far away seeds, dealing big aoe damage and wave clear too!\n\nW: Holds 3 charges now. (If I'm being chased and my passive is spawning seeds away from me, I NEED to have plants available as quick as possible. It's disappointing that she relies too much on plants but in this case, they need to be readily available). \n\nE: Slightly longer reach for where the vines travel to. No longer summons lashers now as spitters are more reliable.\n\nR: Ultimate will now slow enemies within by 40% or 60%.\n\n#ZyraMain","replies":[{"poster":"AidenJacobs","date":"2017-03-03T19:55:10.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they can't balance her around midlane because the second they do she's an even more god tier support","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NotCounter","date":"2017-03-02T09:21:54.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"making zyra auto attack or land abilities was a pretty welcome change in my opinion, now she has to land abilities to harass/trade which is how it should be. no one liked getting poked by someone who used an ability near them, it's not very interactive for the other person","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-03-02T13:25:22.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just leave it's range, come back and kill the plant tho... ._.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-03-02T14:53:08.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"But my CS!","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-03-02T16:23:56.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I get it's a joke, but if anyone takes this seriously: {{champion:268}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:51}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-02T16:44:06.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see how these champions compare to Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"An Undead brat","date":"2017-03-02T17:04:17.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Go for that CS when you play against them :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
