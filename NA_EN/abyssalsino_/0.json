I've said \"fuck\", \"shit\", \"damn\", \"son of a bitch\", and a good handful of other curses god knows how many times, and I've yet to receive a chat restriction. The IFS doesn't punish solely for curse words, it punishes people for negative, abusive chat.

Regardless, I have plenty of room to talk about sportsmanlike behavior and the competitive spirit. To use your words; You're forced to co-operate with total strangers.\n\nWhich means abstain from arguing and clashing with your own teammates. Infighting is the surest way to lose, so your depiction of \"competitive spirit\" only serves to screw yourself over. Being negative is more likely to lose you games than being positive, so, let's leave with this;\n\nWho wins more? The person who fights his own team, or the person who fights the opposing team? Do you win more by breaking your team down, or building them up?\n\nReply if you will, but, this will be my last response to you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-06T01:50:51.672+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AbyssalSino ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=lw4FpgE9,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-04-06T01:23:24.431+0000)\n>\n> Seriously? lol? &quot;Calling people retards, saying they need mental help, flaming them all game?&quot; You can&#x27;t be serious.

Stating statistics for bans is truth.\n\nYou did not get banned for saying something you, personally, (with zero evidence) believe is true. You got banned because you are a toxic little shit that cant control yourself, respect others, or think about consequences of your actions.\n\nAlso, all bans are reviewed by a human. Restrictions are not, since they are temporary and far greater in number.\n\nYou can of course send a support ticket to riot asking for another manual review, but they will simply say exactly the same things as everyone here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2018-04-06T01:54:11.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off this isn't the competitive spirit.
