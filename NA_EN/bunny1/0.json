I know I have an overqualified system for this game. This isn't the only game I play. Anyway, here are the specs: CPU: Intel i7 5820k (not oc'd)\r\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15 (dual fan tower)\r\nGPU: MSI GAMING X GTX 1080\r\nMOBO: ASRock Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7\r\nMEMORY: Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB\r\nSSD: Samsung EVO 120GB\r\nHDD: Western Digital 1TB Fans: 3 intake and 1 exhaust\r\n\r\nIMO, this is a great setup for the serious gamer/streamer/whatever...\r\nI play all AAA games at max with great results... DOOM, BF4, BF1(Beta), Overwatch etc. all nearing 200-300 fps constant (depending on the game cap).\r\nSo tell me why I'm dipping below 100 fps when playing a game like league of legends... I know the game is old and have read that whatever API they use is trash, but really? I should be slaying this game, it's unbearable. I'm farming in lane and am floating around the 100 fps mark (this doesn't look to great on a 144hz monitor).\r\nEnd of rant. I just want to have a good experience when playing this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T22:57:24.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't list your OS, but I assume you're running Windows 10. If this is true, this could be caused by the anniversary update that enabled *Game DVR* in the Windows Game Bar. I recommend [disabling this feature](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) as a quick check to see if that was the issue.\n\nLet me know if this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny1","date":"2016-10-20T00:24:15.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I am running windows 10.

Anyway, I turned it off and noticed no change. FPS is all over the place ranging from 80-400 fps, with an average of 150. This is very unstable when playing this game. I don't plan on turning vertical sync off, as I don't want to play with delay. This didn't always happen. Somewhere around early path 5.9-6.0 is where this started to begin. Before that I had no issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-23T23:03:39.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In that case, there are likely other settings local to your PC causing the issue.

I did every step in the FPS Guide and took my laptop to 2 different computer repair places. They performed PC diagnostics and both places said my hardware and software checked out. Even when I set my in-game video settings to the lowest settings, I still get drops as low as 3 fps. It's actually gotten more frequent in the past week. So...what do I do now?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
