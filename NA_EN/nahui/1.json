Players who pick a champion could have their pick between the various classes to gain access to those class specific items, and then in-game champions who are hybrid or who switch would either be given access to a second class's items or they would be given a choice to switch (like in Kayne's case) if they are forced to change or if they want to change.\n\nMaybe people could even be given the freedom to build items outside of their chosen class, but until they select a different class, they don't get the full benefits of those items.\n\n> Step 4: Balance champions/items accordingly.\n\n> This process would probably have to be a pre-season thing given the level of back-end work that would be involved.

Sorry for not taking it as a joke before, I was a bit on edge the other day from dealing with stupid stuff elsewhere.\n\nThis actually would make a lot of sense and I see why it could work well. I do really like the idea of moving the passive bonuses to the class system because it reduces the burden on players of trying to pick rune trees in the right order to get the stats they want, and it makes runes and class selection much easier for Riot to balance because it would be separate them from one another and put stat selection in a much more comprehensive place.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2018-01-13T23:51:04.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HalcyonDweller,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pe5pEb04,comment-id=000c000000000000000000000002,timestamp=2018-01-12T18:22:27.921+0000)\n>\n> I like the direction of this, but I&#x27;m not sure I agree with how many items you are locking out. In particular, I think that items such as Randuin&#x27;s Omen and Adaptive Helm offer extremely important counters to otherwise very obnoxious or powerful builds/champions.\n\nI agree they are powerful counters. I listed them specifically because of *why* they are counters. They contain unmitigateable resists. Specificly, 20% reduced crit damage and 20% reduced repeat magic damage. Personal philosophy, those type of defenses should be restricted *from* squishies. One perk of this concept is the ability to mitigate arms races. Items get resists, then resist shred, items get health, we get BotRK, Riot gives us omen, then gives us Dominick's.\nUnder this example, Fighters get a lot of health which works against AP and AD equally (in theory). Everyone has access to resist items. Tanks have access to additional defense steroids. I imagine a scenario where the tank specialized items have more of these effects and reduced resists (than current). This lets Riot give the class the durability it's players have been crying for without everyone else abusing these unreducable effects.\n\nI chose the other examples for similar reasons.\n - Mages: During the class update, Riot stated they wanted the class' itemization to focus on raw mana and tons of AP, while leaving regen to supports. Hence, they get the single biggest mana and AP boosts.\n - Marksman: Same as above. During their update, these are what Riot said should be the defining characteristics of ADC itemization. Crit for damage and MS/kiting for survival. Which is basically all the crit items these days. (>_>)\n - Fighter: While the class update was canceled, Fighters tend to get spread pretty thin in terms of stats. They need every stat under the sun and don't have the luxury of specializing (unlike everyone else). So the idea here here is to simplify their options. Health works against AD and AP roughly equally, so shooting that through the roof *at the expense of* other durability gives them a bit more flexibility. In a similar vane, letting them have health scaling bonuses (Titanic Hydra damage and Sterak's shield) lets them further specialize. Unfortunately, you can't really put a lot of MS in this class because of juggernauts, so they would have to rely items like Dead man's plate and maybe a specialized proto-belt. It's also important to remember that Rumble and Vlad exist, so health-scaling AP (or vice-versa) items could also be looked at.\n - Tank: See above.\n - Assassin: Itemization here is all about the windowed effects. Dusk blade, Luden, and mantle all have very potent non-stat steroids. Focusing more on these play's into assassins' \"windowed\" play patterns, where they will blow everyone out of the water all at once, then be a sitting duck for a while.\n - Support: The biggest problem with support itemization, historically, is the mandatory cost efficiency to be viable with their income stream. So other classes (especially when games get shorter) will poach their items to build an early lead while still getting core items later on (See pre-nerf FQC on mages and current Targon on ADC's). Riot tries to adjust this be adding powerful effects and Dumpstering the stats, but then we get actives that synergize too well with other class items and they get poach mid-late game (see Knight's, Locket, adn redemption on tanks). Or they just become too awkward to be viable (see Ohmwrecker). Isolating support itemization means that anyone going into this class is forced *out* of the core itemization provided other classess, making this a much bigger trade-off.\n \n> As such I would either want these &#x27;counter items&#x27; to be available to everyone or want certain classes of champions to have access to items from multiple categories, for example fighters or juggernauts should be given access to at least some of the tank items as well.\n\nI'm fine with some items being cross-grouping if they only need to be restricted *from* a specific group.\n\n> Yeah, I imagine that it would work best if the system were based off of a player choice of some kind. Players who pick a champion could have their pick between the various classes to gain access to those class specific items, and then in-game champions who are hybrid or who switch would either be given access to a second class&#x27;s items or they would be given a choice to switch (like in Kayne&#x27;s case) if they are forced to change or if they want to change.\n\nEvery champion should have access to every class. I see this as a pre-game choice just like runes. Letting champions switch classes during the match would likely cause all kinds of back-end problems; more so if we tie the  passive bonuses to it. Admittedly that does make Kayn the outlier in this system. But I'm not familiar enough with him to suggest solutions.\n\n> Maybe people could even be given the freedom to build items outside of their chosen class, but until they select a different class, they don&#x27;t get the full benefits of those items.\n\nThat could be interesting, but it is asking Riot to create multiple unique instances of all affected items. It would take the same amount of work to just create something entirely new targeted towards that class. \n\n> I personally think that by limiting choices by category or class, and by giving newer players recommendations, we could actually see the new player experience improved, and people would be less likely to do things like buy Rabadon&#x27;s Deathcap or Randuin&#x27;s Omen while playing something like Ashe.\n\nYes, in an Ashe it could be helpful, as long as they know she's a marksman and should take that class.

I listed them specifically because of *why* they are counters. They contain unmitigateable resists. Specificly, 20% reduced crit damage and 20% reduced repeat magic damage. Personal philosophy, those type of defenses should be restricted *from* squishies. One perk of this concept is the ability to mitigate arms races. Items get resists, then resist shred, items get health, we get BotRK, Riot gives us omen, then gives us Dominick&#x27;s.\n\nOkay, I see what you are talking about. It does make a lot of sense to prevent squishy classes from being able to build unmitigateable defenses. So long as it gets gated by our idea for class selections then I am okay with it. I would prefer if some of the characters countered by these items be nerfed to make it a little more fair for opponents. Or if characters in similar classes gain access to them, for example: Bruisers and Juggernauts, but not Assassins, Mages, or Marksmen.\n\n> Under this example, Fighters get a lot of health which works against AP and AD equally (in theory). Everyone has access to resist items. Tanks have access to additional defense steroids. I imagine a scenario where the tank specialized items have more of these effects and reduced resists (than current). This lets Riot give the class the durability it&#x27;s players have been crying for without everyone else abusing these unreducable effects.\n> \n> I chose the other examples for similar reasons.\n>  - Mages: During the class update, Riot stated they wanted the class&#x27; itemization to focus on raw mana and tons of AP, while leaving regen to supports. Hence, they get the single biggest mana and AP boosts.\n>  - Marksman: Same as above. During their update, these are what Riot said should be the defining characteristics of ADC itemization. Crit for damage and MS/kiting for survival. Which is basically all the crit items these days. (&gt;_&gt;)\n>  - Fighter: While the class update was canceled, Fighters tend to get spread pretty thin in terms of stats. They need every stat under the sun and don&#x27;t have the luxury of specializing (unlike everyone else). So the idea here here is to simplify their options. Health works against AD and AP roughly equally, so shooting that through the roof *at the expense of* other durability gives them a bit more flexibility. In a similar vane, letting them have health scaling bonuses (Titanic Hydra damage and Sterak&#x27;s shield) lets them further specialize. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t really put a lot of MS in this class because of juggernauts, so they would have to rely items like Dead man&#x27;s plate and maybe a specialized proto-belt. It&#x27;s also important to remember that Rumble and Vlad exist, so health-scaling AP (or vice-versa) items could also be looked at.\n>  - Tank: See above.\n>  - Assassin: Itemization here is all about the windowed effects. Dusk blade, Luden, and mantle all have very potent non-stat steroids. Focusing more on these play&#x27;s into assassins&#x27; &quot;windowed&quot; play patterns, where they will blow everyone out of the water all at once, then be a sitting duck for a while.\n>  - Support: The biggest problem with support itemization, historically, is the mandatory cost efficiency to be viable with their income stream. So other classes (especially when games get shorter) will poach their items to build an early lead while still getting core items later on (See pre-nerf FQC on mages and current Targon on ADC&#x27;s). Riot tries to adjust this be adding powerful effects and Dumpstering the stats, but then we get actives that synergize too well with other class items and they get poach mid-late game (see Knight&#x27;s, Locket, adn redemption on tanks). Or they just become too awkward to be viable (see Ohmwrecker). Isolating support itemization means that anyone going into this class is forced *out* of the core itemization provided other classess, making this a much bigger trade-off.\n> \n> I&#x27;m fine with some items being cross-grouping if they only need to be restricted *from* a specific group.\n\nIt seems we are mostly in agreement here. People would be free to choose a class at the start of the game (or switch when talking to the shopkeep – more on this later). And they would have access to buying the items specific to their chosen class but they would also be locked out of buying any items that were deemed unhealthy for their chosen class to use.\n\n> Every champion should have access to every class. I see this as a pre-game choice just like runes. Letting champions switch classes during the match would likely cause all kinds of back-end problems; more so if we tie the  passive bonuses to it.\n\nYeah I see it too, most likely it would best be a pre-game choice. Switching would be too complicated to allow everyone to do it. But maybe if it forced players to sell their class-specific items it could work. Maybe they could select a class when they are talking to the shopkeep, and doing so allows them to lock themselves out of some classes’ items but unlock access to the items of their selected class. Not super attached to the idea, just exploring how to make it feasible.\n\n> Admittedly that does make Kayn the outlier in this system. But I&#x27;m not familiar enough with him to suggest solutions.\n\nI think that maybe it would work for Kayne if he simply got to delay that choice until later in the game. He would forgo the base stats (or get half of each for bruiser and assassin) until he gets to activate his passive, then he would choose one or the other, or another class entirely, and he would instead be given the new chosen class’s base stat boost.\n\n> That could be interesting, but it is asking Riot to create multiple unique instances of all affected items. It would take the same amount of work to just create something entirely new targeted towards that class. \n\nYeah, I see why that would be impractical. Ok I’m abandoning that idea for now at least.\n\n> Yes, in an Ashe it could be helpful, as long as they know she&#x27;s a marksman and should take that class.

Imagine if it were a choice that players could make in-game while using the shop? Players could make that choice at the start of the game or put it off until later, giving them the freedom to choose between different classes after having time to gauge how the match will go.
