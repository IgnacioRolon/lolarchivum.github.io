I enjoy mechanically advanced champions and I know Cass is up there when it comes to those. So is she worth learning? I&#039;m currently gold IV. I include this because  I know there are lots of great champions like Orianna who do poorly low ELO because of how much they require organized, team play which one does not find in Yolo-queue. Is Cass like Orianna in the fact that she needs her team to be able to carry, or is she a well built mage? I know I&#039;ve seen lots of QQ threads about Cass getting destroyed by the rework, however (Not to be the player fan riding pros), I&#039;ve seen players like Faker do exceptionally well and exceptionally high damage with her. Now I understand the pros play a much different game than us, but the actual damage output can&#039;t change that drastically, right? Is she worth learning or should I stick to Viktor, Xerath, Vel Koz, etc?\r\n\r\nI want to learn a solid mage because I mainly play Assasssins (Zed, Talon, Ekko mid, Diana mid) and assassins are just havung a rough time lately and I&#039;m not finding myself having as much fun with them as I used to both in their meta and out of it. I want a mage and already can play Viktor fairly well, but I want another one. I know Cass has a very kiting playstyle that can unload damage, but is she worth bringing to the rift or is she currently not too good and someone like Vel Koz or Xerath would outshine her? \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch for any positive/constructive feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2015-10-06T22:53:01.489+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely not worth picking up if you're looking for a fair trade.

That's horrendously expensive. Also the mana-refund was HALVED during the last nerf thus making it almost insignificant. You already need to cast your poison abilities to trigger the reset for your E otherwise you won't be able to clear waves anyway. In the end you spend more mana than you actually gain by lasthitting all of those minions. \n\nThe issues get a lot worse once you're expected to kill raidmonsters like drake and baron since those require a full manabar from you if you want to do anything before hitting 500 stacks and amassing a considerable amount of ap. Literally all of her ratios and numbers were nerfed during the rework and the nerfs after that only made matters worse for her. What good is a so called hypercarry if she dies as fast as her targets while lacking their inherent tankyness or safety nets (see Nasus and Vayne). She is the most disappointing champion to play as if you ask me just for being so damn frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"khorney","date":"2015-10-07T02:14:50.712+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her rework is a huge nerf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot King Cobra","date":"2015-10-07T20:40:59.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass is a fine champion to pick up. She has a high skill cap but no hard counters in lane so if you play her enough you have the potential to beat every champion in lane which is something that I like about her. While there are probably stronger mages at the moment, I don't think Cass is anywhere near bad. She is mechanically demanding as well as mentally, for lack of a better term. I think she teaches a lot of important midlaner gameplay concepts. Her vulnerability to ganks means you need to be on top of your vision game and her skill shot reliance and spacing reliance calls for on-point mechanics. Her reliance on sustained damage means she can itemize differently depending on comps (Do I want raw damage to carry or something like Rylai's to bring utility to my team and help THEM carry?); same deal with her summoner spells (Is running Exhaust or Cleanse more optimal than Ignite against the enemy comp? Is Ghost a good choice here to aid in re positioning during team fights?). \n\nShe is definitely a complex champion, but she is very rewarding to play if you learn how to play to her strengths.

The fact that she can spam her E over and over while simultaenously healing seems to be a huge boon in her favor. I feel like when you get close to Xer and Vel, they lose a lot of their intrinsic power, being range, but getting close to Cass works more in her favor.
