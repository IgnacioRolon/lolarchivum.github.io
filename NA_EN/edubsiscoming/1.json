This is unique to my machine, as I can use the exact same account on other machines, and it works fine.  I am able to log into the legacy client, but my pre-game chat and friend invites do not work at all.  In game chat works fine.  I have tried shutting off all firewalls, and I've tried everything on the connection issues help page.\r\n\r\nThis issue began back in October, I think, right after my computer got a new Windows 10 update, so I blame it on Windows.  I've tried running in compatability mode to fix the problem, but it doesn't seem to help either.  Any suggestions that I haven't tried yet would be helpful.","replies":[{"poster":"EdubsIsComing","date":"2017-04-01T03:15:56.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah...that's another thing.
