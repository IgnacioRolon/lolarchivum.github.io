I'd post this in \"support\" but it won't let me log into that page.  I've been trying to log into the new client for several weeks now, and every time I try, I get this message \"_The Client has failed to communicate with the Login Queue.  Please check your network connection and try again_.\"  I get this message whether I enter the correct password or not.  My legacy client logs in just fine, although the chat doesn't work pre-game once I get in.  Has anyone else been getting this message in their new Client?  I've let it through my firewall, and tried it with compatibility set for Windows 8 and Windows XP (I normally run Windows 10).    Has anyone else seen/dealt with this?","replies":[{"poster":"EdubsIsComing","date":"2016-12-16T03:27:00.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the suggestions have been helpful.
