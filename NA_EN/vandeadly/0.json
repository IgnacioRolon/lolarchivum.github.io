A massive ban wave. AFKs, Trolls, people that intentionally try to ruin the experience for everyone else, we need to clean house because there is no room for them in this community. Everyone I know that USED to play League quit because of the trolls. They are literally killing the game by pushing away great players and a massive chunk of this game&#039;s fan base. I&#039;m not talking about people that arent very good, or try but just feed accidentally because they dont know any better, the trolls are incredibly easy to identify. They tell you they are going to AFK in chat for some reason or another (and not because something urgent came up). They admit to not trying, sitting in base, letting the other team win, etc... Any time someone admits to trolling in the chat, I say ban them. If it was a one time thing, sure give them another chance, but it should really hurt to intentionally ruin the game for everyone on your team. \r\n\r\nThe second part to my suggestion has to do with the Ranking system. I totally understand it being team based and forcing people to work together. I get it. But it only takes one troll or AFK to lose a game, and does it really seem fair to punish four people who were trying their hardest to climb the ladder? What about the person who is carrying his team fighting out of bronze with a 10+ KD? Should he get demoted in his final promo game back to Bronze when he just played like a Gold or Diamond? How about rewarding people that play well and punishing those who dont? I&#039;ve seen terrible teams win against a team of four good players because one person inted or just AFKd. We need to promote good players, whether they got a good team or not. There has to be a way to make it fair and balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Malachipt","date":"2018-11-11T09:23:37.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, would be great if the the rating system somehow translated to to more LP or some such.  If you got an S score and lost, you would only lose 10 LP.  But if you win (get carried hard) and only scored a C then you would only gain 10 LP.  I would think this would minimize boosting as well?  Food for thought.  \n\nI also think a system where you're account and reputation are more sacred and hard to replace would go a long, long ways.  Make it much harder to create an account to play ranked games!!  Or better yet, tie your account to a credit card or something so every raging 10 year old or basement dwelling troll can't make a new account to level every day (exaggerating obviously but you get the point).","replies":[]}]}
