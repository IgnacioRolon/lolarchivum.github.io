I found out a new entire way to make League of Legends more balanced. Have you noticed when someone with more CS than you, you are more likely to lose, correct? Well,I think that if minions were ***removed***, it will make the game more balanced and possibly more fun. This will take League of Legends to a whole new level.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-01-23T02:45:57.747+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's an item for that. {{item:3301}} .
