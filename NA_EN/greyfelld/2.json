All the action is fast paced. Where is the game for an older generation of PC gamers. Where is the strategy to League anymore? Games have got gradually and gradually dumbed down as time has gone on... I mean Fornite is the most played game in the world now. Says something about the attention span of this generation, doesn&#039;t it. Can we have BOTH elements of League, the slower, more methodical gameplay and the faster paced elements of this season? \r\n\r\nI had hoped with Nexus Blitz, they would turn SR back into the slow paced war of attrition it was in Season 1 and 2 but it seems they have no plans to do that.\r\n\r\nIt just seems the League turned their game into Overwatch just to compete with Blizzard and its just not working. When you radically change the direction of your game, you piss off your loyal fanbase and this has happened with so much recently, but Star Wars is a classic example. When you change a loved product, you get backlash and League is having that now.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2019-01-20T02:55:49.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I could come to you with the answer to most of your problems, but then I would get my post deleted because you would probably report it for \"rank shaming\".

So perhaps this person doesn’t like League for whatever reason, sure we could make an argument and be “right”, but I guess it doesn’t mean much unless they actually want to find joy in playing the game, maybe they just want to rant and get it out of their system, but regardless I don’t think we can say anything meaningful unless they’re open to hear our opinions...","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-20T03:02:55.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I recently learned mentioning rank in any context is \"Rank shaming\" and gets your post deleted.\n\n\nOne or more mods are power-tripping idiots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDevice","date":"2019-01-20T03:14:40.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Overwatch is more fun even though I dont have a character im super fond of.
