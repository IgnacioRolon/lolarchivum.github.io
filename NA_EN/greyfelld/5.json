I understand they want flashy, visually exciting plays in the LCS but to be perfectly honest, mobility has become somewhat ridiculous, with champions that can outright ignore walls... {{champion:141}} and {{champion:91}}.\n\nThe problem with mobility can be traced directly back to 2013 and one particular champion... {{champion:157}}. Because he has no mana, he pays absolutely nothing for his mobility and it serves to charge a shield that can block a {{champion:43}} ultimate for example. This design, unfortunately, proved popular enough for Riot to completely go bananas over mobility without the limiting factors that they used to give it. (For example, {{champion:18}} can only use her rocket jump again if somebody dies etc). \n\n{{champion:69}}'s rework was when I thought Riot were going to start fixing the mobility issue as she was able to stop people from using mobility based spells but years later and we still have an over-abundance of mobility in the game. Simply put, this game is not street fighter and mobility should not just be \"given out\" to every champion these days. (Same thing has happened with CC). \n\nYou used to take pics to counter other champions.\nHowever modern champions are coming out of the gate able to do everything and its extremely difficult to counter pick these champions. \n\nSo, maybe mobility in general should be looked at as well as the summoner spell {{summoner:4}} as champions that already have mobility take it for an extra level of safety and thats not what it was designed for. It was designed to help champions that don't have access to dashes/blinks/teleport etc.\n\nWe need more support based champions that have the ability to create AOE anti-mobility fields. I think its the best way of solving the mobility issue.

But then they want to wonder why the squishy immobile ADC's are constantly raging? They want to know why tanks are PO'd and never wanting to be played?(abundance of true damage much?) and why most of us never even touch the forums. (People like this). \n\nMobility is soooo far from balanced it's been a joke for over a year now. And now we have a crapped out ranked system.\n\nWhat's the worst part of it all? Riot never listen. They don't care enough to revert changes that were bad ideas. They just try to sweep it under the rug like they have with their little \"experiments\". (Magma chamber, anyone?)\n\nOh and if you don't conform to this new generation of hate wagoners that don't offer constructive criticism but instead just spam \"I hate everything\" over and over and over again, you get that same hate thrown your way and just throw your hands up until you're finally ditching the game.\n\nOh and let's not touch the awful automated ban system. What happened to Tribunal, anyways? Why wasn't that brought back after they realized how bad the automated system is? You get banned just because a kid reports you for being constructive on your criticism but if he goes 0/20 and says \"Lagging\" it never touches them?\n\nThis entire game has become a joke, man. It's not even worth my attention anymore after this post. I'm just ... done. I'm going to join the other \"geezers\"(25+) in better gaming communities that don't flaunt a hysterically toxic piece of ------ (Tyler1) but then ban everyone that mimics what he does.. but not him, right?

I prefer that there is less hard counters in the game and it's more about how well you play your champion.\n\nI don't think Mobility as a whole is a bad thing; the overabundance of it is.\n\nChampions that have gapclosers that are either targeted or are single use are fine. This applies to most ADCs like {{champion:81}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} that have the option of using it to escape or to engage, but have to stay committed to that choice. {{champion:268}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:62}} are all good examples of non-toxic mobility as well.\n\nThe problem is that there are an incredible number of champions who have three (or more) dashes / mobility skills, or non-conditional mobility. {{champion:141}} feels disgusting to play against as an immobile main because 1. Walls literally don't matter 2. He has a non-targeted short range dash that can be used to gapclose or dodge skills 3. If you manage to peel yourself or a teammate his R is essentially also a dash to the target as well. {{champion:84}}'s old ult was completely unfun to play against and made her feel like a statcheck, and her rework completely failed to alleviate that issue and even gave her a fourth dash (her backflip that can be used to not only dodge skills, but then instantly close a gap no matter the distance) + 2 ult dashes that also, for some reason, stun. It's why she's had to be gutted to her abysmal win rate: she's simply not fun or interactive to play against when she's even remotely playable. {{champion:240}} and {{champion:39}} both have the double / triple mobility issue as well. You can successfully land all of your skills and peel yourself or an ally and it essentially doesn't matter because of their dash resets. Irelia used to be fine because the reset was only on kills. Now it's on \"marked targets\", which comes from pretty much any of her other skills. {{champion:164}} has (I believe) the longest dash in the game which can both scale walls and stun. Once again, if you manage to peel her off of you, her R is not only an arena that keeps you from escaping, but also another mobility skill as well.\n\nWhat do all of these have in common? They're all recent reworks / champion releases. Nearly _every single_ release or rework from the last two years has included some form of mobility, even giving previously immobile champions like {{champion:28}} and {{champion:3}} dashes as well.\n\nI'm an immobile mage main, so I'm definitely biased against the amount of mobility we've seen added to the game. However, I can say this: it feels fine being outplayed by champions / players because of mistakes I made or excellent plays they made. It feels like shit dying after I've positioned myself well and landed every skill simply because I'm playing against champions with three or four gapclosers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hrooza dota ","date":"2019-02-18T11:46:55.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure {{champion:22}} started the (mobility) problem due to the fact ranged champs have no turn rates so she just kite ppl until they die or at least thats what i heard.\n\nanyway due to the fact lol lack of mobility items most champions got build in mobility instant to be viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2019-02-18T19:07:54.688+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"we need more anti-mobility abilities in the game so these champs cant just dash their way out of everything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2019-02-19T03:21:21.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mobility is a strength, the same type of strength that Tanks have with CC, Mages have with Range, and that ADCs have with DPS.
