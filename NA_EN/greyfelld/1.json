I mean for christs sake his kill pattern is spamming Q at you until he gets a free knockup and... theres the kill! I hate it. fighting the fucker gives me a brain aneurysm.\n\nthink ive figure out the core of why Yasuo is so Annoying, its his passive shield and ability to just sit on your face and just 2X Q you then knock you up leaving little room to react. Riot has stated that it can be unhealthy for melee champions to ONLY be about getting on a target and sticking to them no matter what to deal damage, thats why recent melee champions have been given ways to encourage them to his at a distance. Yasuo can and will stick as close as he can to a target to damage them, and his 3rd Q, in addition to E affords him the stickiness he needs. If his 3rd Q encouraged him to move back to get the most out of it it would offer opponents a chance to breathe against the slew of not only damage but CC and defense that he can put up.\n\nIve come up with some appropriate changes\n\nYasuo: 3rd Q only knocks up a little or not at all at close range and more at max range.\nR deals damage based on the amount of time the targets have spent in the air. Basically the higher they get knocked up the more damage it deals. Yay more skill!\n\nThey could also put the 3rd Q on its own CD, if it misses an enemy champ it goes on a longer CD.\n\nAnother reason Yasuo feels unfair IS the amount of defense he has for the damage he can put out. His passive shield is especially annoying for a few reasons, unlike other champions he doesn't have to cast abilities (that normally cost something) or hit enemy champion to charge it, he just has to move which can be considered uninteractive since the opponent doesn't get to do anything about it. Also it doesn't feel skillful for the Yasuo player to get the shield, all he has to do is move around, now sure you can move around alot to charge it at the last second IF there are enough units near by...but does is moving around using E or right clicking REALLY all that skillful? Not only that but if a Good Yasuo player IS moving around using E or moving they can ALSO use that to dodge skillshots/avoid enemies, and then they have a shield that they can use to tank the next ability or AA, and its passive so Yasuo ALWAYS gets to charge it, and theres NO CD. And once its up it stays. AND tower shots don't even make it go away, not saying the shield should block a tower shot, but its weird that Tower shots dont just destroy the shield. Other passive shields are just consumed based on the damage dealt to them and dont stick around once destroyed.\n\nhis passive, W, ult to refresh passive (and keep him out of tower range, this is TOO much safety for all the damage he can dish out, he gets to play like some sort of situational tank)\n\nhis passive should should just be deleted instead Rework W so it has a longer CD but it gets reduced by moving and change it so it acts more like a directional spell shield (its up for 0.75 sec and then its gone).\n\nless annoying + a bit more skill = less skilled people playing Yasuo + less hate","replies":[{"poster":"The Goodest Boy","date":"2018-07-12T02:21:55.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your thesis is solid, your statement on why Yasuo's kill pattern is so annoying is very true and well put.

I like your recommended changes to W as well. \n\nDid u know that initially Riot wanted make Yasuo's W a short horizontal slash that would negate what it intercepted? Bascially it was a short duration directional spellshield/shield. But they didn't have the tech to make it work how they wanted so they developed the Windwall instead. Betcha u want them to try for that \"_Wind Cut_\" again now don't ya?\n\n> I think another excellent change for Yasuo would be to remove the ability to piggy back off of allied CC with his R; that would allow major buffs to his kit and his R especially. \n\nNo i think its unique and allows for some fun teamwork and plays, but the mechanic addition (R gaining or losing dmg based on knock up height/time) that I suggested would also effect allied knock ups so depending on the ally, the Yasuo player may NOT want to just ult on any allied knock up because it may not be that high. Another way increase the incentive for Yasuo players to use the own knock up is to code the 3rd Q to have the one of the highest knock ups at max range. Now it doesn't NEED to actually have a longer/higher knock up, but his R can just _treat_ it like that's the case (so Yasuo doesn't get unnecessary additional utility). This encourages Yasuo players to use their own knock up skillfull at max range to max their dmg output. This way you won't have Yasuo players using their ult off Vel'koz E's, they _could_ but the dmg would be MUCH lower.\n\n> And I think it needs to be said that, in the end; because of Yasuo&#x27;s massive popularity and the money they make off of fanboys buying skins, it&#x27;s unlikely Riot ever gives him the nerfs he deserves :( it sucks but thats how they think.\n\nidk maybe just wait for leadership to change or for some cataclysm to happen, or for player base to start dropping.","replies":[{"poster":"The Goodest Boy","date":"2018-07-12T23:00:56.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that W thing sounds super cool, and...idk... actually skillful?

(note, this chimp of a champ can get 85% armor pen now, before conqueror)\n\nThe shield is fine, it can be poked off. the windwall is fine, its cooldown is long af. The mobility should not be unconditional but eh whatever. The tornado is fine when its not point a click -.-. the issue comes when you can use his low cd e and low cd q together with no real drawback being resource less.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CodeNightFall","date":"2018-07-11T04:17:32.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the champ is supposed to be hard.

He also has a lot of outplay potential, but is also vulnerable to ganks without his E. His playstyle is either to get fed or feed, since he's very squishy. In teamfights you have to weave around the millions of CC abilities enemies have because you die instantly without something like QSS. Yes, he may get 100% crit easily, but with new crit changes he also gets them later than usual. He is hard in his own ways, but easy in other aspects.\n\nSo is Yasuo hard?\nYes, he is difficult in a general stance. But is he the hardest in League? No, since champions like Zed or Azir are more mechanically difficult to just learn.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-07-11T15:10:00.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CloroxBleech,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=LwrAqwaf,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2018-07-10T18:11:27.293+0000)\n\n>-Yasuo\n>-doesn't have a great laning phase.\n\nall my wut.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaddyFantome","date":"2018-07-11T15:07:07.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">HOW is this champion hard exactly? \n\nBecause apparently requiring more than 3 inputs is hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CppL","date":"2018-07-11T06:25:09.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget his ultimate puts him out of turet range ,so you can easily tower dive champs without any consequences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-07-10T23:39:17.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you seen their APM though?!
