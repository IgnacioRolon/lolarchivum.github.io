(Incoming downvotes... but read on anyway) An example of why Riot should fire the creator of {{champion:157}}. He obviously does not understand mages at all. Her kit is a total powercreep, giving her mobility equal to that of {{champion:7}}, with a BETTER {{champion:99}} passive. It seems that this guy just looked at other mages and borrowed parts of each, power creeped them and then combined them to create Zoe. \n\nNow, when any changes are proposed to help struggling AP immobile mages such as {{champion:161}}, {{champion:101}} and even {{champion:127}} (She is not mobile because her E cooldown is massive compared to most modern champions), people get scared that such changes to AP items will make {{champion:142}} more uncontrollable and they are totally RIGHT to fear that.\n\nThis is the reason why AP Mages cannot really be saved at the moment in League or made viable BECAUSE of {{champion:142}} and her badly designed, power creeped kit. She either needs to be removed or reworked to make her far far less powerful but she should NOT be the modern benchmark for any of Riot&#039;s next mage designs because she is just NOT a mage.\n\nShe is an assassin disguised as a Mage, in the same way that {{champion:555}} will NEVER be a support, he&#039;s an assassin pretending to be a support. Riot have completely forgotten what attracts people to different roles in the first place. People do not play support champions because they like to have massive damage without an ADC, some of us like to protect and help our teammates. I feel Riot has really lost touch with their own game.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-27T17:41:35.972+0000","up_votes":59,"down_votes":4,"body":"I agree that Zoe is unfair, but her mobility is not equal to Leblanc's.

She'd eventually blink back to her starting point, but during the time in-between, she'd have moved, and so in a manner that let her have an impact. With just the current ult range, this is enough to have her redirect her Q, and apply a fairly painful passive + Lich Bane-enhanced autoattack, neither of which she could do if she had remained in the same position. As such, Zoe's ult is mobility, even if it's mobility that operates a little differently from most other abilities.\n\nI may be reading too much into this, but Zoe's kit feels kind of pernicious to me in how it almost feels like it was designed to be more easily defended on paper. Because Zoe's ult blinks her back, and because she can't reliably obtain Flash from her W, she can be said to have \"no mobility\" (and even Rioters have said that on her release). Similarly, because her W can't offer _any_ summoner spell or item active reliably, she has been said to have little CC or utility, and only one real source of damage (i.e. her Q). The end result is that two of Zoe's five ability slots get completely discounted from discussion of her gameplay, which leads to the false impression that she's this champion with very heavy limitations and a strict power budget.\n\nIn practice, however, Zoe frequently zips around fights thanks to the Flashes she steals, plus her ult, and is notorious for screwing over other laners if she gets an early Redemption, or just her own if she gets Ignite or a similar effect. It's easy to pretend that Zoe has nothing in internet arguments, but in practice she has access to _everything_, even if it's not entirely reliable, which is why I think she actually has one of the most poorly-defined strength/weakness profiles in the game, among many other flaws.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-06-27T21:27:01.699+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"###### upvoted to counter whoever downvoted you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have lots of problems with Zoe's design, but the OP is not making a good case for why she's problematic.

Zoe can burst from a far distance while Lissandra is forced to be close-range to complete a full rotation and burst.\n\nI understand how Lissandra's and Zoe's mobility cannot be accurately compared, mostly because Zoe's mobility is reliant on the environment around her (with people flashing and all), but if conditions are right, Zoe can jump with R, collect a flash, and escape easily. But to agree with the top post, it cannot be similar to LB as her mobility is guaranteed whenever she wants. Zoe, again, must rely on her environment for her _impactful_ mobility to be present.\n\nI hope this doesn't sound condescending, I apologize if it does.\nHave a great day! <3","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2018-06-28T00:01:23.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah your correct.

It reminds me a bit of {{champion:101}}  Hit E? land the WQ on them. For zoe its land E? throw a Q back wards for distance then RQ auto. \n\nWhen ya miss that e on both champs you can still Q for some damage as you wait for it to CD.

Zoe is not Highly mobile. To max her W for Ms you give up CDR on Q or E, With out SS or items to use she gets nothing. Her own SS... we talking bout mobility on CD = to her SS that's not gross, the items and SS need to be used, she is gonna be at a bit of risk for Point and click short range options. So situationally Yes she can enjoy a window of great mobility from her W, realistically its not the ability that's going to be maxed by most players, she does not have that window with reliable up time.  Her R is not mobility, its a relocation yes but shes unable to use it to excape, shes unable to use it to chase.  Its telegraphed, its very predicitable. It functions as utility, because its very immobile for it to be called mobility.\n\nSo far as OMG MS.

Most burst mages can blow her up just as soon as she gets in range and the mobility does not mean much to them. She is actually a joke to lane against when i get her, if i can play a burst mage like Annie or Syndra. The problem is those said burst mages then have to deal with the rest of her team.\n\nI get {{item:3111}}  for example, she lost the ability to burst me early and will never be able to do a max dmg combo on me. If i get {{item:3102}}  second or third item she will never be able to kill me till she both get {{item:3135}}  and burn the passive from my banshees.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
