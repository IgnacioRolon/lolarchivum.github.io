Its def hard, but I don't think its on purpose. Depending on what que you're in it could simply be that people are concentrating hard, and typing while playing league is pretty difficult. I took out the Riot tag in my name cause I felt bad about not being able to talk with friendly players mostly cause i was top lane in ranked, and frankly im bad enough at the game that it requires my full attention to play. Sorry it feels this way tho, hopefully there are other avenues that help! I've really enjoyed meeting friends of friends in game. Voice chat helps to meet new ppl :D.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-02-08T01:14:27.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HEYYY !!! you appeared !!\n\nWhats been happening?
