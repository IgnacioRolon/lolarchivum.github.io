I mean PBE was created to actually test things, not to farm I cant even buy bundles to get all champions. The only difference between PBE and normal servers is that daily  8000 rp. And its only new skins that are at 1BE the others cost RP, I mean i dont want to come everyday to buy those skins and champions. I just want to know why Riot made those changes or try to bring back the old PBE with kind of unlimited IP ( or now BE) and RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-29T05:10:32.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE is meant to test specific new things that are slated to be released soon. The goal is to make sure specific things are working correctly, not just have an account where you can unlock everything for cheap/free. It's very likely that they are only trying to test certain skins/store mechanics/or how the BE system works with new additions.","replies":[{"poster":"momo346","date":"2017-11-29T23:45:10.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean to test new things you need to have the RP and BE to buy them with only 8000 and 0 blue essence i cant buy the new skins because i dont have those champions...","replies":[]}]}]}
