As in get one at level 5 and another from checkpoint? \r\n\r\nAlso are more skins gonna be added to the lineup? Maybe UFO Corki could see a return with some polish? \r\n\r\nFinal question, when is this reset coming?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T02:31:55.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like the [**updated FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148) mentions those rewards are no longer random! They seem to all be tied to ranking up or hitting new checkpoints. \n\nThe Rank 5 Capsule is guaranteed to give you either Grey Warwick or Medieval Twitch, but I don't believe you can get both. These skins were chosen for how rare they were, and I don't have any info on new skins being added but it's pretty likely down the line I would think! \n\nThat reset should be happening once the 2018 season starts as well ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-12T02:42:55.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you obtained one randomly from the honor capsules during preseason, does that mean you are then not guaranteed to get the other from those guaranteed rewards? If you're supposedly guaranteed to get one, and you already have one of them, people might assume they would then be given the other. If you meant that you can't get both of them from a single capsule, as opposed to obtaining both of them in general, that would be more reasonable.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-12T02:57:55.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Slight confusion in my wording, I can see that now XD!\n\nBasically, I *think* you'll only get one or the other in a season. You for sure won't get both from the same capsule, and it seems like the wording on the new honor update pages are saying that you'll only get one or the other each season. I'm gonna do my best to try and find some concrete info on that though, might have just missed it somewhere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-12T02:08:29.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would assume that they would be given as they are now, but with additional rewards upon reaching those checkpoints. ** But it turns out I was wrong! Broporo has the info.\n\nGrey Warwick and Medieval Twitch both have rare chances to be obtained through honor capsules, even now. Whether or not some old skins will be reintroduced, I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be against it! Season 8 is expected to start on the 16th, so be ready! :)","replies":[]}]}
