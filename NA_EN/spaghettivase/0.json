This is NOT the same as Closed.  You can continue responding to the ticket and continue corresponding with your specialist until the ticket has been set to Closed.  No worries!  I double checked your ticket and it does show as Open, and in queue for our tech team to investigate.  Hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"SpaghettiVase","date":"2017-06-28T18:51:40.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the reply!","replies":[{"poster":"Son Golin","date":"2017-06-29T00:19:34.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SpaghettiVase,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=bABv1IaU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-06-28T18:51:40.350+0000)\n>\n> Thank you so much for the reply!\n\nHey Spaghetti Vase,\n\nSorry about that, can you give it a try and see if you can use the \"request a human\" button successfully?
