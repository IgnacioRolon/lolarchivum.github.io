Let's try doing a [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) to ensure nothing else is running in the background, try recording that highlight again, and let me know if the noise is still there.","replies":[{"poster":"SpaghettiVase","date":"2017-07-09T06:29:41.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did a completely clean boot, opened up league, clipped the highlight and still no audio but crackles.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-09T20:16:09.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm well dang.
