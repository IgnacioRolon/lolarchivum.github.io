I am not the GREATEST player, and with that being said, I do the best I can, and consider myself average.\n\nAt champ select, our Ryze player (Bottom/ADC role), in champ select says, \"I am trolling\", his name was, ..Removed by Moderation..I would have dodged, but I had to dodge two other games prior to this, and that would put me on a pretty large waiting period. So I was in hopes of him just joking around. So he continues and bans our SUPPORTS champ that he highlighted prior to our pick phase. Then he picks RYZE to go bot lane.. heck in this elo anything can be played ;p\n\nHere is his stats too, ..Removed by Moderation..\n\nI just don't know what to think of this, hee has played 2 games. Seems like he just got it to 30, and trolls people? I just don't get it.\n\nWe get in game, the first thing he does prior to minions even spawning, he runs right down mid lane, right in to the turret, and in to their mid laner (Yasuo). He instantly flashes out, and starts using emotes. Then runs bot lane and gives up first blood, then he runs around, comes mid, runs up, doesn't snare, and just does a few attacks, and runs off, dies, etc... and does this all game. Sometime in the game he also just stands there, and lets them kill him. The guy was a complete jerk/troll, and in chat talks about me being a troll. So I had to mute him, and the other team, and myself talked about this kind of behavior. Nothing derogatory was said, and I get a chat ban, and he gets nothing? Usually we get a pop up if someone was punished, so I know he has had no action taken against him. \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nHeliøx: i just report trolls =)\nHeliøx: i just report people and they get banned if they troll int\nHeliøx: please report ryze\nHeliøx: no u said ur trollign in champ select\nHeliøx: and first thing u did is run to turret, and flash out\nHeliøx: then u jsut int'd\nHeliøx: ur being reported\nHeliøx: i am\nHeliøx: pls report bot lane =(\nHeliøx: he purposely doesnt snare\nHeliøx: how am i trolling>\nHeliøx: 100% agreed,\nHeliøx: im muting him and just reporting he will get a ban\nHeliøx: ya, makes no sense, they should ib pan people like that\nHeliøx: see he wont snare\nHeliøx: there is no way duide, 2 trolls who fed, im behind\nHeliøx: gj ww\nHeliøx: you type more than me garen ;p\nHeliøx: i muted ryze, so what more is tehre to say\nHeliøx: gg guys, free win for you =(\nHeliøx: yup\nHeliøx: just mute him too garen\nHeliøx: no\nHeliøx: gg wp\nPost-Game\nHeliøx: sigh\nHeliøx: just report this ryze please\nHeliøx: lol garen\nHeliøx: just stop dude\nHeliøx: ill report you for toxic in a minute if u keep talking dude\nHeliøx: i played, and did what i could\nHeliøx: thanks ww u2 man\nHeliøx: go ahead\nHeliøx: i did nothing wrong\nHeliøx: ill report you now reach","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-06-02T07:36:12.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey OP,\n\nJust a reminder that Boards doesnt allow for the naming of individuals in order to shame them or comment on their in game behaviour negatively.

There was no negative environment being created at all. Someone was asking something, and I was in turn telling them what I do, and not argue. I was actually doing quiet the opposite, and de-escalating the situation as others were getting upset about the troll (minus the other team, since they get a free win). So it is NOT against the rules to help someone out, and tell them what to do, or give an example as I have, \"I report trolls...\", instead of arguing, or tilting them. \n\nSo if this is punishable, then Riot should not have a chat system at all in the game. Also, every SINGLE game I have ever been in, someone always says something negative, and when I report it, nothing happens to them. I know because you get a warning when someone gets punished. I know Riot makes money like this, they get accounts banned for unjust reasons, and a player that likes the game creates a new account, and buys Riot points.. I get it, its a business model, and it is very disgusting how they do it, but hey, it is what it is, and we choose or choose not to continue to play the game. The people who promote their game, like streamers etc.. I have watched some streams, and quiet a few of those people are VERY toxic, and yet nothing ever happens to them... i'm sure we can ALL figure out why =)","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-06-02T01:37:14.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing you said in game contributed to the game in any way.\n\nYour teammates had to deal with the guy bothering you, AND deal with you begging for reports and being negative as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Heliøx","date":"2019-06-02T02:23:27.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GatekeeperTDS,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=t25uoixq,comment-id=0000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-06-02T01:37:14.370+0000)\n>\n> Nothing you said in game contributed to the game in any way.\n> \n> Your teammates had to deal with the guy bothering you, AND deal with you begging for reports and being negative as well.\n\nPlease explain to me how I was negative?  The lines you see me talking are in response to people asking me a question mainly. As for asking for a report, and it isn't begging, is fine. I have never seen anyone get reported for asking to report someone who is causing me a bad experience in the game because they are literally trolling, and throwing a game on purpose. \n\nI think I am finally starting to understand, that the majority of people playing this game have ZERO concept of what NEGATIVE/TOXIC really is. This is part of the reason why this game has the WORST community of any game in history, and I doubt any other game will ever de-throne this game from that title sadly. I like the game, and I play well, and I do my best, and treat people with respect. \n\nI don't see a reason this game should even have a chat system, no matter what anyone says, it can be reported.\n\nExample:\n\nIf a player assumes they are offering someone advice as followed, \"Hey, you are dying too much, because you are over extending\". If I wanted to, I could report him for being negative towards me, and he should be punished. Who determines if that is, or isn't negative? Riot? If so, they have to be fair across the board with everyone, and if I feel it is negative, they have to treat it as such. There is no ToS on this planet that will allow someone to be discriminated against, or treated differently, just because they choose to. Just saying, yes...

You nailed it right on the head. This game has gone down the hill so fast over the course of the last few years.

I never got in to DoTA myself, but my friends keep telling me to.

I myself was once banned for calling my teammates “weak, fleshy underlings.” Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I’m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.\nSometimes it’s best to ignore the mewlings of your teammates and only focus on what you can control. If teammates anger you, try saying so out loud to yourself, not in chat where they can report you. After an annoying game, find a satisfying way to blow off steam. I’m told humans find catharsis in music, so try listening to Mozart or the dulcet sounds of “LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR.”\nI hope I have been useful to you.
