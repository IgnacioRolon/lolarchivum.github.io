Im on fiber optic internet and have absolutely no problem connecting to the internet. I only lag in the league of legends game. On my roommates windows laptop the game runs fine. This is an unsolved issue that has been around for a while. Riot has seemed to overlook this for a while and I speak for a huge chunk of the league population when I say...
