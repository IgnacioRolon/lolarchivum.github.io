{"poster":"UghThatGuyAgain","date":"2016-10-06T02:13:08.608+0000","title":"Unspecified Error while installing Patch 6.20","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I woke up this morning before heading to school, I opened up the launcher to check for a new update as I always do. With my horrible download speed of 350kbps, I kind of need to, I don't feel like waiting 3 hours with nothing to do. So, upon coming home, I checked the launcher and received this error: https://gyazo.com/de0cc327fe040f460ce0f919262b8e71 (link to screenshot)\n\nSo, I decided I'll try again, suck it up, and wait for it. I switched on my music and decided to just sit and roam the internet. After about 5 minutes, my music stopped for a brief moment, and switched back on. The icon for the launcher on my taskbar lit up, and the error came up again. I tried this a few times with music still on, and the same things happened. I presumed it was a network error, so I restarted my internet to see if that would help. Multiple attempts haven't had any effect on it. So, after consulting the Network Troubleshooting, I used the steps and still didn't have it work. I decided just to uninstall League and reinstall, and of course, that didn't work. Using the Hextech Repair Tool did nothing either. I'm sure other players might be having the same issue, considering the help thread for Patch 6.20 contains something about it. None of the steps worked, so I'm wondering if any other player/staff member could explain further as to what could help.\n\nThanks in advance,\nAquaro\n\n**_EDIT-_**Today, whatever happened while I was gone, it was fixed. If you guys are having troubles, I'd recommend doing the Repair built into the launcher. Other things that I did was physically go into %appdata% and other folders to physically delete all data that had to do with Riot Games or League of Legends, in order to uninstall manually. If none of that works, I apologize and wish you the best of luck with fixing the game, and hope to see you back in the Void!","replies":[{"poster":"Spicious","date":"2016-10-06T04:13:57.269+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same cant patch help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volsong","date":"2016-10-06T04:06:53.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same for me, I've tried multiple suggesting fixes but nothing has worked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bisquelleté","date":"2016-10-08T18:38:48.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same for me i typed to support he told me 3 ways to do it and still none didnt worked .....i should stop play this game right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KomunalniRedar","date":"2016-10-06T14:44:23.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here, cant update","replies":[{"poster":"East Carolina","date":"2016-10-07T11:09:26.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just disabled my firewalls, and uninstalled AVG and it finally worked after 2 days","replies":[{"poster":"w3ath3r","date":"2016-10-12T13:06:56.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=East Carolina,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=KgpxJb3o,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-10-07T11:09:26.846+0000)\n>\n> i just disabled my firewalls, and uninstalled AVG and it finally worked after 2 days\n\nme too :P{{item:3187}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RoyalConflict","date":"2016-10-07T04:37:25.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yoooo wut the helll is wrong with this patch saying error unspecified check logs. i spent too  much money and time for these things to be happening .

At this period, the patcher is trying to connect to the patching server to download and update game files, but is being blocked.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot and sort this out.  Specifically with the HRT, see if you can use it to configure your firewall settings.  Make sure to go over each step in the guide to rule out any possibilities.
