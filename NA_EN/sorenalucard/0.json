Im not the greatest player, but I accept my mistakes in game and move on. The typical players I encounter in rank on the other hand don&#039;t give a flying fuck about your rank, their rank, or the game mode.\r\n\r\n1. You can&#039;t talk to these players, friendly or otherwise. Typing anything warrants them being worse for some reason in their minds.\r\n2. I report at least 1 player on either team damn near every game, I&#039;ve seen 4 &quot;you&#039;ve gotten a player banned&quot; this year. Considering I play at least once a day, thats a stupid amount of people going unpunished or not receiving enough punishment to deter them from ruining games. \r\n3. I spend most of typing in game just trying to stop people from fighting and doing basic things like grouping, but most of the time they just want to fight and farm\r\n\r\nIm not asking for elo help, or to be boosted above my current level. Im not blaming these players for my own lack of skill to carry them (im sure there are plenty that could do much better than me), **but I am blaming them for making games be miserable af. **\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care that I can mute them, NO ONE WANTS TO FUCKING PLAY WITH THEM. Mute button isn&#039;t going to stop my morde from last game deciding he needed to go straight down a lane every time he spawned and just keep pushing til he dies to gank. Try to group with him? He leaves and goes to another lane to do the same. \r\n\r\nIm asking players like this get banned from rank, temporarily then permanently if they offend again.  Make rank punishments swift, harsh, long lasting and with a queue up warning saying **&quot;If you&#039;re gonna play this mode, language and behaviour will be severely scrutinized and any trolling will be considered intolerable, resulting in immediate account suspension from rank&quot;**. Zero tolerance. \r\n\r\nBreak away a group of moderators for rank only, keep the automation on the other modes, but make a team of people that can hunt these players down and make their attempts at playing rank so fucking uphill that they just lose motivation. Until the negative impacts of throwing a game outweigh just playing it, I do not see it ever stopping or decreasing.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-05-27T16:54:43.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only time you get a notification that someone you reported was punished is if you were the very last person to submit a report on them. Like, the last person from the last game that they played. If someone else from that game reports them after you do or if the game you played with them did not set off a punishment but their next one did you won't get a notification.\n\nI don't know why everyone says they encounter so many trolls. I don't play much ranked, but very rarely is it that I have a troll in my game.\n\nEDIT: Also, splitting the punishments between normals and ranked is something Riot is hesitant to do. The punishments are quick and severe enough in both modes right now.","replies":[{"poster":"SorenAlucard","date":"2017-05-27T17:35:00.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the information!\nThat does clarify a bit. \n\nI play a lot of ranked, and most games there's at least 1 guy, either team, who just tilts into oblivion, costing his allies the whole game. Usually its the first person to die. Ive seen so so so many 3 or 4 min \"GG\"s lately where the person just gives up on really trying. They'll type all game that we will lose and don't make any real effort to win. They'll split push, ignore pings, get ganked and spam surrenders. Its not really cool in norms, but its extra frustrating to deal with in rank. What usually happens is someone else will mouth off to the guy saying GG at 3, the rest is typical league bs for 20 min. its just old and something new should be tried so people don't walk into rank with shrugged shoulders.","replies":[{"poster":"andy595","date":"2017-05-27T23:46:49.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I AGREE WITH YOU, i'm unranked (solo/duo) but played 6 games and in 4 of them, there was a troller.
