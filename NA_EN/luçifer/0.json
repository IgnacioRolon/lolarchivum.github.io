I am having the same issues. Luckily I have a decent computer and I can still play but my FPS has gone from 160 down to 80-90 which is a significant decrease. And sometimes I get random lag spikes that cause the screen to black out for a millisecond and lag which is really annoying. I have been looking at the R3D logs and there are THOUSANDS of errors. It's not our computers at all that are the problem. They messed up on some coding in that last update.

On the new map just after the swap I had around 450-480 with sometimes low 300s. Now I roughly ~150 FPS with no hardware changes and no drops in performance in other games. This is on a GTX 770 OC and i7-4770k OC @ 4.6GHz and 16 GB RAM @ 3200Mhz and no thermal issues. There are clearly issues specifically due to something Riot screwed up and the mass amount of complaints about FPS performance only further supports this statement. Simply repairing the client doesn't fix the issue. Might want to give a higher priority to the problem considering how severe it is and due to the fact that the new map was supposed to make performance better rather then significantly worse. The fact that a solution has not been found begs the question, why are you guys not keeping proper logs for changes committed to code? Would certainly have helped pinpoint the issue much sooner.","replies":[{"poster":"BamBamxxxx","date":"2014-12-30T06:16:21.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're just sloppy.

They don't appear to follow any proper coding standards or basic concepts like object-oriented design. I had been planning to upload any bugs I found once I realized Shadowplay would let me catch them without consuming absurd amounts of space unlike Fraps, and such, but after accumulating so many videos of various bugs (and only keeping the ones that were blatantly obvious/indisputable, sniping across map with Syndra's E, projectiles flying through multiple players, ward blocking my path when it should have zero physics, WW ult continuing despite stuns, kill timer bugs still catching kills despite 15+ seconds later, tower aggro bugs, etc.) I quickly became overwhelmed despite only playing a handful of games and have been too lazy to upload them due to the amount of videos were dealing with (some 30 in less then 70 games, really?!).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Luçifer","date":"2014-12-19T10:25:58.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I will do that after work today.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ofalling","date":"2014-12-19T08:11:05.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"COMPAINCOMPLAIN.\n\nBy that I'm not mocking y'all, but saying I am having the same problem.\n\nThere are indeed tons of errors.

I've also already tried all the fps trouble shooting and deleting that one config file thing and reinstalled etc and am  currently a couple days in with no help past those suggestions on a support ticket. I'm anxious to be able to play ranked and have been unable to play a single game all the way through without unplayable lag due to random fps drops for weeks so I don't wanna risk it.  When they first switched the map everything was fine then suddenly this. I seems like I can play the game normally for about 30ish minutes at the start of the day then the fps drops to unplayable lows and stays that way. \n\nEarlier I thought I'd test and see if it's just my computer and tried to spectate a game on my husband's computer (which is much better than mine) and his also just crashed on attempt. Haven't tried to play a game on it but based on that I figured it's likely not just my computer's problem.","replies":[]}]}
