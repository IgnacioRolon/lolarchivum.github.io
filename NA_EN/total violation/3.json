You have been given the ball and instead of deciding to pass it to someone else, someone who intends to kick or play off with the ball, you decide instead to walk up to your opponent, put it on the ground near him, and claim that you don't need the 'advantage' of starting with the ball.\n\nPeople have brought up many disadvantages, your putting your own team at a ban defecate, your allowing one more problem champion to be present in this game, your giving your opponents to opportunity to pick something powerful or strong, or pick something your team will struggle against, all because of a refusal to simply pass on your ban to someone else, to try and help your teammates, and while you can argue its available to your allies aswell, the statistical probability that your ally is going to play something, something you may of banned, is rather minute, since people tend to hover champs now to indicate their picks so that everyone knows not to ban a contested champ then. Once again your forcing your team into a disadvantage and wasting a resource because you personally dont have a champ you want to remove, or under the tiny chance you might accidentally ban a unhovered champ that your ally was maybe going to play.

He can only ban one and the support auto bans pike meaning your adc really could use another ban to help him out.  Why not do it?  Or let's say because your top laner is a OTP and has 2-3 champs that hard counter his intended pick because riot can't balance top.  Why not give your top laner an easier lane by knocking out one of the other hard counters.\n\nBasically minimizing the number of champs that hose your ally's picks increase your chances of winning and decrease the odds of you having a toxic teammate.  And if you don't know what counters the champs in other lanes then just ban riven, yasuo, or pike.  No one will complain if you ban on of those three.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2019-10-07T02:36:22.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"in ranked yes, but in norms its best to no ban so that you can improve your game by playing against all champions and not just the ones you do better against","replies":[]}]}]}]}
