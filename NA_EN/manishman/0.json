I would love to hear otherwise if possible. I have a great desktop computer I never had these issues before I tried everything lowering my settings, going into game files and checking boxes. When I'm in-game It starts out at 40 FPS which isn't normal for me then when I try and go to the edges of the screen with my cursor to move my camera the FPS starts to drop to 20 then when I move it in the opposite direction it can drop as low as 11 then 4! IT DROPS TO 4 FPS ROIT! I don't know what to do I cannot play your game like this please I need a fix, I am not the only one whos having these issues.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-13T05:00:05.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is just weird.\n\nWhat hardware, OS, and window mode (fullscreen, borderless, windowed?) are you using?","replies":[]}]}
