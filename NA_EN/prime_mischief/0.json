Double check that your OS has [**permissions**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) setup to allow League access, and also make sure you're running the installer with admin rights.","replies":[{"poster":"Prime Mischief","date":"2017-11-15T03:36:27.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried this and it didn't work.
