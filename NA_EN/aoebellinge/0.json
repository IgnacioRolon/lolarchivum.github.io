He changed the summoner name and im pretty sure he changed the verification email too.\r\nI made this account about 3 years ago.\r\nI tried submitting a request to Riot games, and it would ask all sorts of questions like - \r\nWhat was the first 3 champions you bought?\r\nWhat is your account signup email?\r\n\r\nOfcourse i don't remember any of this.\r\nMaybe i can find some of the first purchases made on my old credit cards, but it will take hours.\r\nI have now used 3 hours of my life trying to recover the account, with no luck.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-27T22:45:04.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet for recovering that account is going to be taking some time to look over those questions.
