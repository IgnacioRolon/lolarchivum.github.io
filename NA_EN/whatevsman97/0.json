Which is the problem. In the time I was playing, I told myself I&#039;d learn from my loses and get better. But I never did. Or at least I never felt like I did. I always wound up making the same mistakes over and over again. I never knew what to look for, what needed to change, what needed to stay the same. Now I wanna try getting back into the game, and I want to avoid making this. Anyone else ever feel like this? Any advice? Anything I specifically am doing wrong?","replies":[]}
