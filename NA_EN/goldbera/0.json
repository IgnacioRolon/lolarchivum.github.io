Riot has a difficult time with schedules as it is, so expecting a high quality effort on a regular basis might not be the best thing from this company.\n* **How many resources can Riot dedicate to this project?**  Every comic series has from six to twelve people working on it, from a writer to any number of artists, editors and other important tasks.  And remember, while these people are working on the comic, they're not working on League.\n* **What style of artwork do we want?**  Japanese manga, American comics, photo-realistic, \"whatever best fits the story?\"  Not every artist can work in every style.\n* **Which stories are we going to tell?**  Do we want the focus on what's currently being worked on or do we want to explore older or untold stories?\n* **Who is the target audience?** There are more non-English speakers who play League than those who do.\n\nI'd love to see the occasional comic, but I'd also like to see just as much of an emphasis on \"walls of text.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Goldbera","date":"2017-04-25T10:06:58.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* **How frequent a release schedule are we talking about?** Well, I do believe once a month would be pretty enough to have them created and not to make fans wait too long.\n* **How many resources can Riot dedicate to this project?** Here I am unable to give any answers, I think Riot would know it better...\n* **What style of artwork do we want?** There are online Camille comics and I just loved their style, so i think online free comics are the best way.\n* **Which stories are we going to tell? **I think LOL fans know a lot about bios of champions (through cinematics and just reading bios), so no need to tackle the basics of their stories. {{champion:164}} Camille's comics were just some story related to her that made us get to know her better. The comics could tackle the relations between champions and just stories of their on going life. \n* **Who is the target audience? **Well, I belive this is the most minor trouble - LOL content gets translated within hours, so I am sure if the comics are digital then they can be easily translated.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GenoXx","date":"2017-04-19T06:07:29.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They wont, they stated they want to use various means of media to get their stories out.....a consistent comic might feel limiting to them.","replies":[]}]}
