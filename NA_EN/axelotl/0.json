It was easy to miss things on the skin when we weren't also working on the base, then they'd pop up as problems at the very end. I worked on the launch skins for TK, Jhin, Camille and Xayah (and now Zoe) before joining Champions team and it was something I think we all wanted to address.\n\nSo we tried it out, allocated resources and time for the same team that made the champion to also tackle the launch skin. I think it went really well and I think we're going to make it a new standard practice moving forward. It makes sense really as the champ team at that point understand the champion better than anyone else and every time they make a change to the base they can also update the skin so they both turn out top notch.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-11-07T19:46:22.885+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you thought about similar practice for VGU champions who might need a new skin right after release of their VGU?","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-11-07T23:11:51.468+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"With VGUs the champions team already handle all the skin updates.

Earlier this year I was on a thematic dev team for skins and one of the goals I had there was to try and get more of the 'Alt Universe's organised into a manageable amount that made sense and provided more storytelling opportunities; Project + Program, who are Battlecast fighting, is Super Galaxy and Star Guardian related or not cuz anime etc.\n\nMy understanding of skins tab is that it's primarily for players to organise and view their collection, but there is a secondary opportunity to share a bit of the ideas we have internally about skins and how some fit together - just enough to spark the imagination. I think there is also a goal to further expand upon this in the future, so that lore and grouping might continue to be refined over time.\n\nIf you have skins questions keep asking, on the boards, twitter, reddit etc. Sorry I can't commit to answering a big list myself as a) I'm not on skins any more and b) that's not really how I want to spend my free time.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2017-11-08T18:01:07.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, no problem.
