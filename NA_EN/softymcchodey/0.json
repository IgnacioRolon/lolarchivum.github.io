Unfortunately because it possesses a large amount of processing power this is my gaming computer as well. Will doing a full encryption slow league down or should i try to find a way to encrypt everything but league?\r\n\r\nAlso how will this work with updates? I&#039;d assume they would work as normal once i give permission but am not entirely sure.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"skoulker","date":"2018-03-23T01:22:10.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like something... less than legal","replies":[]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2018-03-23T01:24:52.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i think it would be easier to buy a different computer to encrypt..","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-23T00:41:56.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disk Encryption is just a really bad idea unless you are doing something incredibly sensitive, which you should not be doing on a networked home computer anyway.\n\nIf the disk becomes damaged, corrupted or files are deleted, they cannot be restored by any means.\n\nBasically the only reason for it is if you fear a drive being stolen, and there is nothing preventing someone then decrypting it unless it has an on-demand password; some do, some dont.\n\nLoL wont care much if you have a decent CPU, since it does not load files during the game.","replies":[]}]}
