Master Yi has seven \"eyes\" (goggles), whilst Jax has six of this feature. I think it is more likely to be Jax than Master Yi judging from the image alone.\n____\n{{champion:24}} \nDefault uses a lampost.\nTemple uses a double-edged poleaxe.\nVandal uses a nailed club of wood.\nPax uses a bamboo staff.\nJaximus uses another double-edged poleaxe.\nNemesis uses a morningstar.\n\nA blade addition to these weapons is not a bad idea.\nThey all have one thing in common, they are weapons stuck to poles or are long ranged melee weapons. Maybe the weapon has hidden features, like an extended handle to allow Jax to use it two-handed/long-ranged?\n\n**What works:**\n• \"Multi-eyed.\" Jax has six \"eyes\" just as the character in the PROJECT image. \n• He also wears headgear that has the tail feature.\n• He holds the title of \"Grandmaster at Arms\". His lore expands upon that with mentioning that he has mastered the use of every weapon available and this could include the style of weapon that the Hyperlight Blade is.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n• \"Alpha\" isn't something I'd personally use to reference the identity of Jax. Alpha of all weapon masters? Maybe.\n• \"Multi-target\" would only reference Jax's counter-strike ability, all of his other abilities are either a feature for himself or for a single target. I wouldn't use this to describe a characteristic of Jax's identity.\n\n____\n{{champion:11}} \n\n**What works:**\n• Default uses a bladed weapon.\n• \"Multi-eyed.\"\n• Double-edged nature of the weapon may reference his Double Strike passive.\n• \"Precision balance\", sounds like Master Yi's philosophy.\n• \"Alpha\" and \"multi-target\" seems like his Q ability, Alpha Strike.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n• He has seven goggles/\"eyes\", the character has six.\n• The main blade of Hyperlight Blade is not long enough for standard sword use. Unless it is intended to be a complete visual rework. \n____\nThe weapon description, heavily favours Jax; highly unlikely, Rengar or Renekton.\n\nHowever the character description favours Master Yi, quite heavily. \n\nI can't really decide, I would go with a chance:\n48%                Jax skin.\n37%                Master Yi skin.\n12%                Other Champion skin.\n3%                  New champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-08-20T16:47:26.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Jax also has hair showing, like the image, where as none of Yi's skins do.","replies":[{"poster":"Wero34","date":"2015-08-20T16:49:10.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"That picture is zed duh","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-08-20T16:51:14.477+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zed doesn't have multi eyes so doubt that.","replies":[{"poster":"Fat Ezreal","date":"2015-08-20T16:54:46.179+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not a picure of zed, but there is a zed skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wero34","date":"2015-08-20T18:05:14.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its a techno helmet, is like ironman HUD, and if u look the main page, that image have a red mark, like the red mark on those plasma strikers","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-08-20T19:26:27.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but they are still in place of the eyes as it's now confirmed that it is infact Master Yi.\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4I4aymUstk/VdYjipWUbxI/AAAAAAAAwE0/B91qqJIcoTQ/s1600/TXNKqUk.jpg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3k7hQzqb0l4","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SSJ5 BlondeBunny","date":"2015-08-20T19:05:16.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, Headhunter Master Yi has 6 eyes\n\nSo its not a stretch to think they could or would do it again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Parallelity","date":"2015-08-21T02:25:33.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a leak earlier, the last character is Yi, and it's also a legendary skin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fat Ezreal","date":"2015-08-20T15:52:32.499+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"OOO EVERYONE THEY JUST UPDATED THE WEBSITE TO MEMORY RESTORED 98% PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR ANY OTHER UPDATES, PROBABLY GOES TO 100% BY THE END OF TODAY, PLEASE POST A COMMENT TELLING ME IF IT DOES, TY ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"NightstalkerX7","date":"2015-08-20T15:33:49.557+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a blade and a sheath, similar to rengar's blades.\n\nAlso, trace lost might be a reference to his stealth.
