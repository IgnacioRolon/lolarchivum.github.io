Based on what i've heard from other players it something to do with the servers, but considering how bad it seems. I really would of thought the Riot team might of taken the time to actually 'remedy' the issue ASAP.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T20:52:50.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your client is having a hard time establishing a stable connection to the server.

I have never had the client itself specifically lag or the game itself unless something was causing it to bug out, like some server issue.\n\nI have tried 'repairing the client to fix it' via the start up menu's ? repair option, but it does not seem to have fully resolved it. Plus it does not seem to occur when im actually in a match itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T15:46:45.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patches only modify local files inside your League directory, they're *extremely unlikely* to affect your connection.

Which makes sense since i've seen a few people talking about having the same issue amongst the forums and in the game too. So i would suggest you might want to take it up with whichever group you have that handles server upkeep/maintenance to check for any similar errors to 'corrupt files' that might be the result of why multiple players could be having this synchronization issue.\n\nIf that's not the case then i really wonder what's causing it, since i would think 'repairing a client's files' would be the same as fresh installing the game. Plus do not think it might be some issue with a firewall because i never had that issue before and i would not be stupid enough as some net'cafes do with tacking third party program add'ons onto games for people. I may consider some in MMORPG games that make information easier to read or tidy up a HUD, but for MOBAs its something that should never of been tacked on, even in regular mode games.\n\nAt this point i hope that Alpha client gets pushed a little quicker because i really don't want League of Legends to go the way of Wakfu, which still even for 5 years, that french MMORPG has ran in Java, but it had memory leak issues that became extremely visible once the game was 'officially' released and it required tweaking the Java settings to just mitigate it partially, yet it still had the issues even then.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\n\n\"\"ADDED NOTE ON 8/16/2016\"\n\nOk now i'm really getting annoyed, im trying to arrange my item sets and masteries to clean them up and add some more for some recent champion additions to my roster i got. But the client synchronization is so horrible, i literally can crash out of league of legends while waiting it to load, 'literally' multiple times. Sometimes end up with repeated 2 to 8 second delays while moving some things around. This is getting silly.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T23:13:42.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you confirm you've tried all the steps in the connection guide that I linked previously?
