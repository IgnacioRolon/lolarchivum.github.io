(please read)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I decided to jump into a game of nexus siege. Nothing out of the ordinary but when I got in the game the visuals were completely different than normal. I havent been able to fix it since. Its like some one went and messed around with my graphics setting which to my knowledge have not been touched. I also havent messed with my moniter settings. During the loading screen, all text is insanely sharp so much so that it hurts my eyes to read. I turned down the sharpness on my moniter so its not an issue any more. In game my hud is much smaller now. Its very hard to understand my mini map quickly because its so small. The scoreboard in the top right-hand corner also look very small. In the bottom left corner their is a gigantic gap of no hud which makes everything seem terribly disproportioned. I know this is kinda vague but any help would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-26T20:52:03.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Out of curiosity, do you have a screenshot of this?
