I played normally on Friday 22/09/2017, and when i tried to play on 23/09/2017, i couldnt. No toxic speach was on last games, so im betting i got hacked.\n\nCan you help me know why am i banned?? Its urgent please.\n\nFYI: Someone erased my other post about this matter, i thought that was not possible, and if someone did, at least move the thread rather to delete it. Even tho, i want an explanation of the unjustificed permaban and why my other post was deleted.\n\nAs a very old player of League of Legends, May/2011, I am very angry that not a single answer was provided to solve my issue, it has been more than 24 hours.\n\nIf you need to contact me privately, let me know to provide an email. The email in my setting is not the correct one, I assume i got hacked. If you dont believe me, i have original email in which i recieved the &quot;Welcome Email&quot; when i created the account back in 2011.\n\nSorry for being so harsh, put yourself in my shoes to understand me please.\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIssue Solved!!!!\n\nLove League of Legends, Love the Community!!\n\nNothing better than a good, old, happy and loyal player!\n\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE UPVOTES AND YOUR COMMENTS!!!!\n\nThank you very much PapaBear, Ahri, Tantram and Chermorg for your help!
