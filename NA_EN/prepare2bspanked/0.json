On top of that I did not receive any notice about how long I will be subdued to these delays. Hopefully this bug can be cleared as I rarely ever afk from games and when I do I always return (afks due to needing to restart computer for whichever reason).","replies":[{"poster":"Dexisions","date":"2015-01-15T23:34:45.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing man..

The data your system gathers for you to make this judgment is what the community is saying  is flawed but just ignore everybody and write them off as morons and liars. Point and case, I get a free zombie brand skin for good behavior, then literally 2 days later get a leaverbuster penalty with lagging out of a game once (like normal).    \n   In math we say for every value of x there is only one outcome y for it to be a FUNCTION, your function determined my behavior(x) = (y1, reward) and (y2, punish).
