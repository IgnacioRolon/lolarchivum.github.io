I paint most of my paintings with copic markers and watercolors. It would be amazing if you could take a look and tell me if you like and suggest more characters to make in the future.\r\n\r\nSorry if my english isn&#039;t very good. Thank you so much for watching.\r\nBye! :D","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-06-22T21:09:16.967+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love watching speed painting videos, and Lux is one of my favorite champions, which makes this even more exciting!
