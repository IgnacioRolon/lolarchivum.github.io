I&#039;ve heard so many differing opinions from my friends and from other people, but the two most common ones I&#039;ve seen are max q, evolve q first and don&#039;t evolve w or r (preference) and max w, evolve w first and don&#039;t evolve q at all. I&#039;ve done the former for my kha&#039;zix games and have had pretty consistent success  but I&#039;ve never tried the latter and I want to make sure I&#039;m not missing out before trying it in a game and potentially feeding.

I was struggling with him until I stated evolving his ult 1st. I was evolving his Q 1st. It did more damage but it was harder to get a chance to do that damage.
