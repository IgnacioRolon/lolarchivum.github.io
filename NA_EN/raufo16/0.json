I meet all the requirements to join the PBE (Not toxic, have been an active players for a long time, have an account on the NA server).  However im having an issue with the application. When i click \"i want to help\". I do get the confirmation that my application has been received. However when i come back a few days later to check on the status it appears the application has been removed as i have to click the apply button again. It gives the feeling my application isn't submitting properly or is being reset. Possibly it is getting rejected again and again for some reason and i just don't know. \r\n\r\nAm i doing anything wrong or is my application in fact submitted correctly?\r\n\r\nRegards","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T19:37:28.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the account you're posting from, I'm unable to see that your application has been received.
