To dig into it a bit deeper, use our [Log Reader Guide.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664)  It'll analyze the last few games and let you know if there is any type of connection issue.  If it does find one, it'll give you some steps in order to resolve it. \n\nIf the tests all come back perfectly fine and its still happening, make sure to reply back and let me know!","replies":[]}]}
