There's literally no room in his kit for ap anymore and converting the ap ratio to %hp would promote building him tanky. \r\nIt doesn't have to be anything insane even just 5% max hp at all levels would be a major improvement. (base heal of 110 + 10% max hp over 4s)\r\n\r\nThat'd take his heal from a base heal of 110 (for a maximum base of 440hp total max of 880hp) to a base heal of 110 + 27 (for a maximum base heal of 440 + 108 and total max of 880 + 216)\r\n\r\n*Ratio's are based on Master Yi level 18\r\n\r\n*HP ratio's as assuming no additional health points are built","replies":[]}
