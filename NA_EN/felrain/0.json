Was it the influence from that new horrifying fizz skin?\r\n(http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nCwaLnCv-rM/Va7GwORX2TI/AAAAAAAAFIQ/UYUQs3QjjWo/s1600/fiora1compare.jpg)\r\nJust look at it. Does this look like an upgrade to you? Her model looks like an old guy in drag. She&#039;s not graceful and she has a bunch of fluff on her clothes. This was definitely not the skin I bought. Why is everything so oversized and flamboyant?  \r\n\r\nIs this where the hideous old Miss Fortune model went? Into Fiora? I don&#039;t understand how you did so well on Miss Fortune&#039;s model/Captain Fortune&#039;s art only to come up with this for Fiora. Is this some thinly veiled attempt to just piss over Fiora fans some more? Wtf?  How did your team&#039;s art direction take such a ridiculous turn? It wasn&#039;t just the splash art, but the model too.  Honestly, I&#039;m not even sure why you decided to fuck with Fiora&#039;s visuals. She didn&#039;t need it. \r\n\r\nAnd I&#039;m not even going to go into details on how a duelist is now a support bruiser. It wasn&#039;t even that bad until I got to the ult. Oh, and I love how she still has mana costs with those CDs. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a little hard to be constructive, because there&#039;s ...nothing to change other than to go back. You started well on the skills and then just... 8 second window to hit 4 places to get an AoE heal.. Right. Good luck getting that before you get blown up/CCed or they escape. And again, her visuals DID NOT need to change. I&#039;m usually excited to see Riot&#039;s new visual updates and splash art because they&#039;re usually good, but I can&#039;t believe this is what you came up with for Fiora?  I already know you guys won&#039;t change anything based on your player&#039;s opinions once it hits PBE, but still. Ugh.","replies":[{"poster":"MarkedOfKane","date":"2015-07-22T00:00:28.189+0000","up_votes":56,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Michael Jackson face though..","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-07-22T01:22:32.638+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just deal with all the other negative changes so long as they didn't go through with the Michael Jackson face.

If what they say is true (it does sound plausible) and a wast majority (don't remember, but I'm pretty sure it was over 95%) of refunds were issued to people with almost no recent playtime on the champion; people who obviously were just trying to get a free refund on a champion they no longer play, it's understandable that they stopped doing that. Their support already takes a lot of time to answer tickets... doesn't seem sensible to increase that time further, merely to deal with people who want to exploit Riot's refund policy.\n\nEdit: Just as it's understandable that people with legitimate concerns are upset about this change of policy.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-07-22T21:07:50.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the question is this: Did people stop playing a champion because s/he wasn't fun?

But as for whether somebody deserves a refund because he stopped playing a non-fun champion, my opinion is very clear. Test out champions before you buy them or live with the consequences of being impatient.\nAs a sidenote: I never really understood why people would buy champions with RP anyway; and likewise I don't get why people would want a refund for IP that badly.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-07-23T12:26:25.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, the free week thing is wonderful.

I was merely trying to explain Riot's thought process behind changing their refund policy. According to Riot the majority of people that were using the refund policy stopped playing the champion way before the rework/VU happened. Seemingly people didn't really care about the rework/VU as much as they were just trying to free up some RP by refunding a champion/skin they had already stopped using.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2015-07-22T03:12:57.117+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kit is fine.\n\nThe new model and splash suck","replies":[{"poster":"dramatic banana","date":"2015-07-22T16:05:35.437+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new model is KIND of bad, but the face on the splash?
