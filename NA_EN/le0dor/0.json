I played ranked in S2 and S3 and fell into bronze, or as many call it, ELO HELL. Back then we did not have fancy ways to denote lane preference, and I ended up supporting too much, which I suck at, and could not climb out. This demoralized me, and even though I liked the game, I quit and played no ranked S4 or S5.\r\n\r\nSeason 6 rolls around, and during this past summer I decide to jump back in, and see if the new way to que for roles will allow me to move up. I start solo queing from Bronze 4 following my placement matches hoping to make it to silver 5 as a season goal. Not too difficult right? Win more than you lose? So I do, I go 100-70something, both solo and some team queing. I do best ADC and que mostly bot/mid. I climb mostly on Miss Fortune, Caitlyn, and Ashe. And by the end of the season I make it to Silver 3, and even though it is quite low in general, I felt a sense of pride that I had climbed out of &quot;ELO HELL.&quot;\r\n\r\nS7 starts and duo queing with a friend who plays support we go 5-5. By no means outstanding, but hey, it is a pretty balanced game. He was Bronze 5, and climbed to Bronze 2.  I am now Bronze 2, he is Bronze 4. We lost the vast majority of our progress in 10 matches. Sure, a big warning came up telling us most players will place lower, but seriously? \r\n\r\nI now have no desire to play, because the hard work I put in was erased in 10 matches, that I went 5-5 in. Another 170 games to just get back where I was? No thank you riot. And no money for Snowdown for you. Couldn&#039;t have come at a worse time.\r\n\r\nPS. I am 7-2 in my first 9 flex matches only solo queing, and my teammates have been mostly gold last season.\r\n\r\nAs I type, I just heard someone on my friends list just fell from Silver 3 to Bronze 5... In 10 matches. I am Flabbergasted.\r\n\r\nGLHF. I will not be joining you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Screw the reset.","replies":[]}
