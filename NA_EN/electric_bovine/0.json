I load in and am instantly hit with ping spiking between 450 - 750. This gave me about a 1.5 to 2 second delay on all my inputs, although i could see everything at real time. I assumed that it would pass but it didn't. I tried to reconnect with no luck of it working. I gave it another minute or two, and decided to restart my computer. I let my team know what was going on and then restarted it. This took between 5 and 8 minutes, of which my team lost a couple of towers and map pressure. When i got back, some were mad, especially my ADC who flashed and healed on top of me while we were in fountain. This reconnect and restart did fix my ping and I was able to come back in and help with a baron and numerous other team fights after being almost 10 levels behind. We ended up winning the game by getting picks and then controlling the map with Jax and trist taking towers. I get to the post screen lobby and find out there that instead of gaining LP, I lost 18 of it. I want to be clear when I say I HAVE NO HISTORY OF AFKing, GRIEFING, prolonged toxicity (everyone has, and i have flamed a couple of times in game, but nothing over a period of multiple games ) OR ANYTHING AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN BANNED (that i can recall since i started playing at the end of season 4). Why do i get slammed for this when there are plenty of other out there that do this or other thing just as bad on a daily basis and dont get penalized. Why does the system crack down on a player like me? I cant afford to buy a new computer with insane reliability or upgrade my wifi, all i have is a generic laptop thats 4 years old. I can understand if it gave me 0 LP, but why do I get hit as hard  as someone that leaves a game fully and screws their team over? This wasnt out of anger or for revenge, it was so I could ** HELP MY TEAM** rather than screw them over. And yet im treated as a greifer even though i didnt feed and did all I could to help my team win. Someone please help","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T03:45:11.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're out of the match long enough to be marked as being AFK, you'll end up losing LP regardless of whether your team pulled through and won or not. If this weren't the case, more people would bail on ranked games knowing there's a chance of them still getting LP even if they weren't in the match.","replies":[{"poster":"Electric Bovine","date":"2017-10-23T05:08:04.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just dont understand since I cam back and continued to play, in the example you brought up it seems as though you expect that people who dc do not rejoin expecting to get LP. Whereas i rejoined and played a decent role in teamfights and ending the game positively","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-23T20:25:25.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not that we expect everyone who dc's to never rejoin, but think about it this way. Say someone was dc'd for 25 min of a 30 min game. They do come back and their team wins, but did they really deserve the credit for that match? Being out the game long enough has an effect on the overall outcome, whether you win or lose, the match was still affected.","replies":[{"poster":"emailsupport1","date":"2017-11-02T15:07:47.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"great idea  xd \nwhat about the dudes who goes like 2/15 and winning game cause they got lucky\nthose guys get the lp while the one that had net issues cause of great servers lose lp","replies":[]},{"poster":"AyyLmeow","date":"2017-10-25T00:27:20.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How do you expect people that were having disconnection issues to want to rejoin the game if they were guaranteed a loss, what sort of incentive would they have?
