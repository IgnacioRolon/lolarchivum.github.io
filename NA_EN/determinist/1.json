Unfortunately, its spiraled from the tribunal, to what we have today. And then they get TONS of players who support it, so they keep it going, thinking its the right thing to do for their business. \n\nLess players quitting the game because they get flamed all the time and cant do anything about it (something i can understand, but really dont care about), and possibly new accounts being made by players who were permabanned, and may even buy shit again for their new accounts.

It is a sudden change if you consider since season 3 when I started playing.\nWhen they announced the honor level 2 requirement in october, there was simply not enough time left for players' to get back there. If it was announced at the beginning, they could have announced it earlier than when there was simply not enough time left.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAEQAWAWARF","date":"2018-11-01T21:34:47.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, ranked rewards had not bee like that. It was simply an active chat restriction or 14 days ban that will cause the rewards to be missed. For old players, its also Riots responsibility to make it transparent because old players tend to follow traditions.
