Probably the best addition to the game in a long time in my opinion. That said, as a support, why am I looking at trying to increase my CS per minute or my early CS advantage against the opposing support? It's fun trying to increase your grades across the board, but the wonky income stats as a support has me doing the wrong things simply for a higher grade. Could it be made so that support income stats can be linked to their AD's gold advantages?\n\n\nEDIT: Here's a picture of exactly what I'm talking about since apparently there's confusion.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/yKev7Lv\n\n\nNitpicky, I know, but if this was ironed out I think stats would be perfect.

All enchanters will have a deficit and you will average about the same deficit.  The problem comes when you don't take relic on champions who normally do.  Good examples are Taric taking coin and Blitz taking spellthief.","replies":[{"poster":"McBeaver","date":"2018-08-15T18:57:46.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem comes in when if you want to improve that income stat beyond the average of your champion, you are stealing a creep more often to be \"above average\" in a 100% irrelevant stat for supports. Supports just shouldn't have to think about that stuff. Encourage supports to enable the AD's CS per minute and CS advantage. Do this by tracking the appropriate stats.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2018-08-15T17:23:22.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"because you dont use targons, if your adc leaves you alone to defend the lane and goes mid then you increase your cs that way...but when I play supp and my adc leaves and no one defend the tower I have to do it.
