Ever since 4.20 with the huge issue with the store, it's been nothing but a black screen for me. It was \"Session expired\" or jst plain lag in the early 4.20. As stated in the status back then. But ever since it was \"fixed\" all I could get was a black screen. I can't even go through my champion list to buy 'em. I can't see the price, I can't see \"buy\" buttons. And i don't understand why.\r\nI waited for 4.21. repaired my client. reinstalled. resynchronized my computer clock. I even made IE my main browser AND updated it all the way. updated video drivers, downloaded a fresh copy of LoL and reinstalled...\r\nNone of the archive link works. Google doesn't help (nothing but 2012 posts) and everything store-related seems to have vanished from the website world. troubleshooting only talks about the patcher, and when it talks about the launcher, it's still about the patcher. I don,t have issue with patching the game...\r\n\r\nI'm about to reformat my whole computer, even though I know it won't help me at this point. \r\n\r\nI've joined a screenshot of my issue. it's been like that for what seems like forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2014-12-15T20:27:13.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Nach,\n\nSince you've gone through the Wrenchmen's toolbox with no success, you should [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as it may be an issue on a deeper level since it's happening randomly!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeroyJethr0Gibbs","date":"2015-04-05T02:23:14.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello nachthemel, I see this issue you WERE having, and was hoping you have info on a fix.

Ealier i said it was working (for a very short time) then it went black again. but now it works as if nothing ever happened. I did nothing today to help fix the issue, it was all saturday and sunday (for the latest attempts, at least) and even then it didn't work. \nHow come right now it has no more issues? This is the same thing with LoLMath... I'm completely lost as it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nHas restarting my PC 4 times since saturday helped? Is there a sequence to follow?\n\nEdit, yep, broken again and all I did was click on the runes tab.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2014-12-15T19:10:18.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this same issue.
