Unlock all the champions for everyone.\n2. Remove the ability to reroll the champions.\n3. People would be obliged to play the champion they are assigned to, even when they decide to dodge. This means, that person has to play an ARAM game with a particular champion, to get the ability to get another champion in the next game (people still can swap champions between each other in champion select). \n\nAs a hardcore ARAM player, I like the idea of it being random but I would love the idea of it being TRULY{{champion:44}}  ALL RANDOM -experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2018-06-11T20:19:48.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. yes\n\n2. no.\n\n3. what is wrong with you.","replies":[{"poster":"P A C C S U","date":"2018-06-11T22:14:38.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Speak to me when you are a true ARAM player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterDClone","date":"2018-06-11T22:24:42.369+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how you put this out and whenever someone disagree you say : \"Speak to me when you are a true ARAM player.\". Which is kind of dumb because what is the definition of a true aram player, is it an aram only player or someone who enjoys it and plays it a decent amount.\n\nNow for the actual post, i completely agree with the first two because i feel like it would add the spark of complete randomness to the gamemode, which i am dine with cuz i play aram to just mess around with weird builds on champs i don't play( which is a lot being a otp). The last one is kinda confusing, because do u mean that after the dodge he has to aram or can he play other modes. And if one chooses to dodge he has to wait 5 min, then 30 if he wants to do so again so let them have that dodge for reroll system.","replies":[{"poster":"P A C C S U","date":"2018-06-13T22:06:40.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that he has to play that specific champion in ARAM to get another champion in ARAM.
