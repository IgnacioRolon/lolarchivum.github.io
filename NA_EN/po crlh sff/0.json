Like Aurelion sol, he strives by roaming bot or top picking up kills/assists talon will most likely want to do the same. In a sense somewhat of a secondary jungler, not killing camps but definitely ganking.","replies":[{"poster":"po crlh sff","date":"2016-10-21T19:43:58.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but what about actually being a midlanner? he is definitly too good at moving around but what about his actually in combat performance? If he is only good at roaming around and not actually lane, there is nothing stopping from shitfting to jungle","replies":[{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-10-21T19:50:34.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then that could be said the same for A.sol then right? Talon doesnt have amazing camp clear, and being an assassin he can be bursty. He has a gap closer and a slow for trading in lane plus the d.o.t., I think he'll just perform better in a lane but simply roam more then others. With so much mobility with his E and probably still getting mobi boots early he can roam get a kill and then come back to mid quickly, plus once getting a few kills/assists under his belt that can give him early advantage over his mid and just roll over them. \n\nBasically a roaming mid laner is still a mid laner, they just get fed in different ways.","replies":[{"poster":"po crlh sff","date":"2016-10-26T21:11:33.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not quite, they are diferent champs with diferent strenghts, however A.sol is definitly more suited for mid than jungle. First of all he cant even hide in bush, secondly his roaming tool has a long CD and his jungle clear is probably worse than new talon. As a mid however he has decent range, decent cc as well as constant dps that doesnt hinder his movement comands, more importantly aurelion has a high skill cap and a relatively complex kit, basically aurelion has acess to flexible option while lanning, he has the tools to play ofensive and defensive depending wheter ahead or behind. \n\nNew talon however has a simpler, shorter ranged and mechanically weaker/less complex complex than his previous combo, they basically mashed his Q and E togheter but made it weaker by having shorter range and being a dash. This is incredible unhealthy because either he has damage to cheese or he is useless, he cant play around this, old talon barelly could use is E for outplays and his in combat mobility just got even more binary and predictable, he still has nothing to fall on if behind. Plus he is about to be re released, he is probably gonna get nerfs on top... Basically he is weaker mid than before and a lot stronger jungler, what's gonna keep him from being discount kha'zix weaker brother?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2016-10-21T19:35:27.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only problem will be low sustain and im not sure how good his jungle clear actually is, especially with the new krugs/raptors","replies":[{"poster":"po crlh sff","date":"2016-10-21T19:41:18.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his new Q actually gives sustain now so he has that going for him... plus his passive works on jungle monsters","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2016-10-21T21:02:39.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how is his mana sustain?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Commit Sudoku","date":"2016-10-21T19:55:58.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"talon isnt suppose to lane in the normal sense of trading and keeping up wave control like other laners he is a special flower because riot leaned on the idea lets make him a big roamer. here is why he wont jungle though, sure he wont be actually looking to win his lane but win other lanes like a jungler.
