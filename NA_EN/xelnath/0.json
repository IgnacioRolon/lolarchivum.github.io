When my passions flare up, sometimes I go direct into hyperbole and extremities.   Still, while you are correct that they don't help, the fact remains that there is a disconnect between the Narrative team in charge of the story and the president of the company that team works for.  \n \n> I totally get it that you're frustrated by our history, but just look at how much Jaredan and his lore team have been trying to help recently. \n\nAre the efforts of Jaredan and Carnival Knights appreciated?  Yes.  They're doing much more to communicate than the previous lore teams did, including the one that \"debated\" and announced the retcon and short bio changes before being replaced with the current team.  (Note:  *The word \"debated\" is in quotation marks since I wasn't there, there's no proof that a debate happened, and Narrative **lost the right** to expect my trust after three years of silence and forced changes, like the Freljord*.)\n \nIs it enough?  I don't think it is.  There are still a metric ton of unanswered questions and the last meaningful conversation took place just before Worlds.  Also, two people out of an entire team of who knows how many members doesn't seem like much to me.\n\nI mean, if I was put in charge of a team that had a history of not communicating with their most passionate fans, I would talk to them until they were sick of reading my posts, starting from the first moment I sat at my cubicle.  While I couldn't answer every question posed to me, I would at least acknowledge the problems.\n\nMaybe that's just me, but that's the level of effort I feel would need to be shown, just to at least start repairing the bridge of trust the other Narrative/Lore teams destroyed over the past two years .\n\n> Having met you I know that you can be polite and considerate, while being passionate. Prove that here too :)\n\nI'll be honest.  When I try being polite and considerate about Lore or any other topic I care about, I haven't received many responses from Rioters.  Even then, those responses are more to the tune of \"We hear you\" and \"Please trust us,\" or they include inappropriate movie quotes and dismissive statements.  It's getting repetitive, to be honest.\n\nI wish I *could* be more polite and considerate, but Narrative isn't giving me much reason to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-02T22:09:12.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak for Terra, but as for me, I'm not even sure that anything I say will even matter. The president of the company himself said 'We won't please everyone, but we're sure that the old lore fans will like this eventually!'\n\nThat feels incredibly dismissive. Every time I write up some sort of post about my feelings on the old lore, trying to keep constructive and not devolve into angry rambling, I have a voice in the back of my head that's going 'You're wasting your time. It doesn't matter what you say, so don't censor yourself and say what you REALLY want to.' I have half finished essays on why this is bad thing for the story, without the motivation to finish them because I don't think it'd matter.\n\nRiot's been pretty bad at official communication, lately. There's always a bunch of responses to 'can you play with me' and 'this is a good skin idea' and 'Rammus threads are still funny, right?', but not many for actual discussion. And I get that Worlds was on recently, but as someone who couldn't care less about professional play, that's not much of an excuse.  Even the only big discussion thread that's up feels like typing into a brick wall at times. Stashu's actually communicating, and that's great, but I feel like I've had this song and dance before, with the Sona rework. It worked out fine eventually, but 'eventually' is a long time to not be able to play your favorite champ.\n\n(Incidentally, I'm looking at how much the lore team has been trying to help. The last post was six days ago, and they still haven't responded to any of the myriad 'What the hell is going on?' threads in any way besides the patented lore team'Be patient, we'll start on them eventually!' that we've been hearing for years.

I had few friends and the friends I had were constantly far away from me - or only connectable online. \n\nThankfully, both my parents and I got counselling. It was... rough. Honestly, I had a great upbringing, but there were a lot of scars from previous experiences that were being transferring into trust issues in our family. I won't say it all got fixed, but bringing visibility back then helped me start looking at myself and how to grow. \n\n... it helps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"weihe123","date":"2014-11-01T04:58:41.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an other brother with little brothers and they just went trick-or-treating.

Chemistry is something you both choose to create - often founded on, but never exclusively based upon, common interests. \n\nRule #2) \n\nInvite her to do something fun or casual with her. Don't pretend it isn't something though.  \"Hey, I know you weren't expecting this, but I think you're cute and we should hang out. Interested in coffee thursday?\"\n\nIdeally, this should happen *after* having normal human being conversations. \n\nThen if she says no.... just drop it and move on. If she's not super enthusiastic then you don't want to be constantly trying to \"wear her down\" - that's no fun for her.  Think about what will make her life better. Having yet another dude constantly harassing her? Not better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2014-10-31T07:13:14.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"A tad sad. Got a PG278Q but was suffering an apparent widespread issue where in motion half the red led's dim down so it creates a checkered effect (very noticeable in League).
