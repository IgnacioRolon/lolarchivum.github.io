Mid should play control mages, adc should play meta picks. We have practice 12-5pm central time on weekdays but that isnt set in stone.

I’ll get back home in a couple hours and I’ll be able to play then if you guys are still looking for people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Velcrow","date":"2018-01-12T20:37:51.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ROFLMAO","replies":[]},{"poster":"F G","date":"2018-01-12T18:49:55.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://discord.gg/dcEk27","replies":[]}]}
