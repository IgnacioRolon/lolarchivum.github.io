A LOT.\r\n\r\nIv'e started as a support main but slowly got bored of getting carried whilst doing the boring work / getting my butt kicked because the adc and I struggle to fight our enemies. So I figured- Why not try another lane?\r\n\r\nI looked online and saw a \"Bard Top build\" and decided to try it myself, and to my surprise I was pretty consistent with cs/kills/objectives and so on. Iv'e even gone on a 12 win streak which has never happened to me before with Bard.\r\n\r\nA day ago, Iv'e played with a Tristana on my team that decided she has given up on the game from the start, and I quote: \"We're against plats and golds and we have 1 gold silvers and unranked, plus this Top troll, GG\" (more or less what she said, I muted the chat a second later).\r\nLater on that game I decided to unmute the chat just to find out that Tristana was toxic towards me and Vi, our junlger (who she claimed to be feeding just because of her play style, which I could understand because that Vi wasn't willing to take part in team fights and got in only when their entire team was low on health).\r\n\r\nToday, after playing a few ranked games with my friends I relog to the game just to find out I was suspended for 14 days because I was being offensive toward other players in that game. I haven't cursed anyone, I wasn't disrespectful, was I pissed off? yes, the game didn't go well and having tilting teammates affects me as well in a team game.\r\n\r\nSince I was muted most of the game I had a bit if misunderstanding as to who was flaming me and I accidentally asked them in the chat to report Tristana and our mid laner, Syndra (soon later Syndra was freaking out because she actually didn't say a thing the entire and even Trist backed her up, I immediately said sorry and as a joke \"report me ;-;\" she seemed cool about it tho).\r\n\r\nNow.. was me saying \"report me\" the thing that got me suspended that game? Because I'm really confused as to what's the actual reason I got suspended.\r\n\r\nWould like some feedback regarding this matter, ty.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkorion","date":"2017-10-23T17:48:44.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs:\n\nGame 1\nDarkorion5: ./mute all\nDarkorion5: :)\nDarkorion5: ?\nDarkorion5: very\nDarkorion5: Vi let's get him\nDarkorion5: ._.\nDarkorion5: 7 hundred stuns\nDarkorion5: gg\nDarkorion5: end game\nDarkorion5: I'm done\nDarkorion5: thanks for the ks earlier Vi\nDarkorion5: You da man\nDarkorion5: yep\nDarkorion5: Vi\nDarkorion5: PLEASE\nDarkorion5: HELP ME TOP\nDarkorion5: TEAM?!\nDarkorion5: gj\nDarkorion5: troll pick?\nDarkorion5: who buys armor against ap?\nDarkorion5: Are you drunk?\nDarkorion5: Armor boots as ap I mean\nDarkorion5: herald\nDarkorion5: no\nDarkorion5: \"troll pick\"\nDarkorion5: report Vi ty\nDarkorion5: only knows how t ks\nDarkorion5: yep\nDarkorion5: gg\nDarkorion5: yep\nDarkorion5: Report Syndra for flaming\nDarkorion5: And trist of course\nDarkorion5: Was it you or trist .-.\nDarkorion5: I was muted half the game ;-;\nDarkorion5: I'm sorry ;-;\nDarkorion5: It was trist ;-;;;;\nDarkorion5: report me ;-;\nDarkorion5: k\nDarkorion5: 2/10\nDarkorion5: once trick champs\nDarkorion5: one* :D\nDarkorion5: lux ult back?\nDarkorion5: .-.\nDarkorion5: kog 0 hp :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\nDarkorion5: :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))\nDarkorion5: k\nDarkorion5: gg\nDarkorion5: report Trist <3","replies":[{"poster":"Drugoth","date":"2017-10-23T17:55:20.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asking for reports to the extent you did is considered harassment and punishable. Probably the bit of flaming you did at the Vi too. \n\nRemember it only takes 1 report to flag a game, report lobbying is redundant.\n\nTry to stay positive regardless of how everyone else is behaving in the future, and if you want someone reported, do it yourself.\n\nBe careful, the next step is a permaban if you misstep.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T01:27:45.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This guy.\n\nBegging for others to report people can be viewed as being just as toxic as bullying them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darkorion","date":"2017-10-24T09:46:35.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I just got a reply on my ticket... Apparently \"there was a glitch in the matrix\" and \"we sent the wrong chat log you got reported for\".\nI wasn't suspended for the chat log above.. I was suspended in a game I was extremely toxic to my team..... One thing is... I was in a premade team and I was in a skype call with them; I have no microphone so I speak to them through skype/in game chat. And yes, we are absolutely toxic when we speak to eachother but I didn't think you can get suspended if you're not getting reported, that's why I was so light about.\n\nAnd no, other than being salty in all chat, I wasn't being offensive towards the other team, since we kinda lost the game from starters we all as a group decided to have fun with them. I didn't think you can get suspended by playing with 5 premades. ._.","replies":[]}]}
