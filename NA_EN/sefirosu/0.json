THANK YOU.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":53,"down_votes":7,"body":"Hello Riot Games and fellow summoners!\r\n\r\nMy name is David and I am 23 years old. I have been playing League of Legends for about 2 years and a half. Of course I've had my ups and downs with the games but I always come back to it. What I am writing now is something that I've been wanting to send you guys but never had the courage to. So I finally decided to come here and type it out to you guys.\r\n\r\nI have been suffering from depression since I was 16. I never really had friends during my high school years so I was pretty much a loner. Video games were pretty much my saving grace. It felt good to just play games and have fun with it.However there was one time my depression worsened and I was on the verge of suicide. I felt like I had no salvation and just wanted to disappear. Thankfully my mom stopped me in time and helped me through it. From that day on it was like a wake up call for me. I immersed my self even further in the world of video games and found my own little world. Fast forward a couple of years later and I am now playing League of Legends. This was recently of course. Just a couple of weeks ago, my depression worsened again. I've been laying in bed for hours without moving. I was to the point of no return. I was about to commit suicide again not too long ago. I felt miserable and worthless. But something stopped me. My friends helped me through it. And that night I remember just booting up League of Legends and playing games. Believe it or not, League of Legends helped me get away from all of my suicidal tendencies. It was my own safe haven.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long message, Riot Games and fellow summoners. But I just want to say thank you so much. League has helped me build my own little world and forget about all of my negative feelings. Sometimes I find myself with a smile on my face while playing LoL. My favorite champion is Lux and I love playing with her. I hope you keep up the good work and I can't wait to see what you will do with the game next. League of Legends is one of the few things that keeps me grounded when I need it.\r\n\r\nAgain, Thank you Riot Games staff for everything. You have helped me so much.\r\n\r\nSincerely, David. aka \"Pyromancy Flame\".\r\n\r\n{{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"GhostCadillac","date":"2014-10-30T04:58:22.158+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"**R**eaching out\n**I**n the world\n**T**o\n**O**thers in need","replies":[{"poster":"CooLTanG","date":"2014-10-30T05:16:56.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"> **R**eaching out\n> **I**n the world\n> **T**o\n> **O**thers in need\n\nAre you trying to spell RIOT? ... not RITO...","replies":[{"poster":"SonyUSA","date":"2014-10-30T06:53:45.181+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah, all the cool kids spell it RITO.","replies":[{"poster":"Copelando","date":"2014-10-31T01:27:23.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all the cool kids... they seem to fit in{{item:3073}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bouffon dAnglais","date":"2014-10-30T15:15:23.924+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"MUNDO GRAMMARS AS HE PLEASES","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Barkhoof","date":"2014-10-30T15:02:00.969+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you, in the most literal sense - during college, my father died and there were days that I could not get out of bed. I went in and out of depression and the one thing that struck me about this story is that that you don't mention a professional counselor, social worker, or someone outside of your home you can talk to. I don't want to discredit your mother or the fact that video games are an AMAZING release for someone in depression (for me it was WoW) but I would really encourage you to also talk to someone professionally. You'd be amazed at how well you might feel. \n\nIt seems as though you're in a good place right now, which is wonderful, but I would really, REALLY encourage you to seek out someone just to listen to you, even if you aren't feeling depressed right now. If nothing else, keeping appointments causes you to get out into the world, which truly is a beautiful place. I hope you continue to be in a good, emotionally well state.

It isn't so much that League \"cures\" depression-- it just kind of defers it. Depression tends to disappear when you're focused on a match.

Stay safe brother.  There may come a time when you see negativity in League of Legends, but that's when you mute all-chat, block your teammates, and just skype with friends.  That, or you can watch pron's. That's always a good alternative. Rub that sorrow right outta your system with a healthy dose of Jergens, and you're all set.  Then you can play league again, and you may see improvement.  If not, rinse and repeat. Good luck m8.","replies":[]}]}
