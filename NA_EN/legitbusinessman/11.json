My adc games are from people trolling me in champ select thinking im gonna give a fuck in their game while smurfing. \n\nNow lets look you up and make some assumptions.  Silver 3 43% win rate.. you have no experience in plat, let alone gold, unless your friend let you use their account, whichnin that case, every One seemed bad to you on your team because you got dumpstered, but lack the game knowledge to realize it was your fault.\n\nYou shit post me, I'll shit post you.. except if i am in YOUR elo I'm looking like an unstoppable beast,  when you are in MY elo you look like you are boosted.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-04T02:02:48.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Erm......

If you did, you would have posted on that, not an even lower account, which represents the same info as the other. My point is still proven.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-04T05:53:32.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I have over 16,000 games.","replies":[{"poster":"The Nocturne God","date":"2018-08-04T06:00:40.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Illabethe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l59vkTkR,comment-id=000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-08-04T05:53:32.134+0000)\n>\n> I have over 16,000 games.\n\nThat is a nice **claim.** But again, my argument in this thread, is that you are making a claim regarding ranks without any provable experience to back it up. I pointed out that your account was not an account that a smurf would be using based on the rank and win rate. It was silver 3 with very little games played. It was 25-33. It is very easy for someone, even at the bronze 1 level, to place an account and get that rank and win rate. After many many games they will drop back down to bronze 1, or at least bottom out at silver 5 with very low mmr.  \n\nYou then went on an account that was a lower rank, silver 5, with 48% win rate and 847 games, 0 lp. It has 1077 MMR ( Bronze 2 ). The account only has premade games with 1 other player, a silver 2 player with a 50% win rate., your win rate with him is 29%; his win rate is higher when he plays without you, a supposive diamond 3 smurf.\n\nMeanwhile, here is an account of a real smurf, around your MMR:\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=honor+ribbon\n\nSee how in even the VERY FEW LOSSES, the player completely dominated everyone in the game? That is the difference between a smurf losing and someone losing in games where they are at their rank, which is what is shown in your match history.\n\nHere is a smurf account at a much higher rank than you, with P1/D5 MMR and a 76% win rate.\n\nhttp://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=the+nocturne+god\n\n\n\nSo my point is, you are saying your rank, silver, is better than gold and plat, without even having provable experience in those ranks. If you do have any games played, it would mean you played on someone else's account to try a high ranked game, or you bought an account. If you want to prove me wrong, simply post from your main account and** try to prove me wrong**.","replies":[{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2018-08-04T06:52:12.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Smurfs casual.
