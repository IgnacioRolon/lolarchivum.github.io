Same thing.\nFleetfootwork still stacks with other mobility effects, both from items and kit abilities.\n\nPffhahahaha\n{{champion:245}} A dash and blink combined into one skill, both halves can cross walls; and his ultimate is a get out jail free card in every sense, removing him from danger, healing him, and making him untargetable.\n{{champion:81}} Has flash as a skill on a 20 second cooldown that goes down to 8 seconds with rank and cooldown reduction; going hand in hand with some of the longest range in the game for basic skill attacks.\n{{champion:114}} Her dash gets half it's cooldown refunded if it strikes an enemy, and she has an outright negation to any offencive or debilitating effect used against her; sure it takes timing, but can block anything used on her and potentially stun the attacker. Did I mention completing her ult turns into a janna ultimate heal?\n{{champion:105}} Has a combo built into a single button; a repeatable leap that can jump walls and cross significant distance, area damage for each impact that apply a significant slow, and makes him intangible during the entire cast. Not to forget it's cooldown goes as low as 6 seconds with cooldown reduction at max rank.\n{{champion:145}} She gains ~+50% movement speed (higher than rammus though half the duration) with a second of invisibility on initial cast, and her ultimate is basically nocturne's. Besides the fact lifesteal is easier to come by in the last couple years than ever before, granting unexpected health for a fight unless you can stun her. \n{{champion:38}} Along with leesin, the premier hypermobile champions, with shields on command.\n{{champion:133}} Have you seen her outrun rammus? Have you fought against a compitent one? The targeted gap-splitter and blind are debilitating to anyone reliant on close range or skillshots respectively, and as previously mentioned lifesteal makes her troublesome to take down. \n{{champion:91}} Let's see he can dash to enemy champs, hop walls, and go invisible for an extended length of time. \n{{champion:67}} Unavoidable self peel, and a spammable dash that gains invisibility during her 12 (up to 24) second long ultimate steroid buff; again benefiting from lifesteal which is easily accessible and applicable. \n\n{{champion:8}} His massive movement buff from his Q is 10% for 2 seconds, or 35% for 1 second with his pool. As for his pool; untargetable for 2 seconds but can't cross walls, can't slow anyone beyond melee range, even with max cdr can only be cast once every 10 seconds, and still burns 1/5th of his health on cast. Mass healing? Still bet about any marksmen will heal more than he can just by landing a critical hit; he can only sustain by landing his spells, which have cooldowns, which marksmen have limitations to their auto-attacks again?","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-07-26T01:47:21.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"marksmen don't have lifesteal to heal more than vlad even if they tried","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-07-26T02:08:31.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AirKingNeo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yLIvNUqt,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-07-26T01:47:21.821+0000)\n>\n> marksmen don&#x27;t have lifesteal to heal more than vlad even if they tried\n\nGot any math to prove it? Lifesteal is amplified by three things, physical attack damage, attack speed, and critical hits; all four things are picked up in any full build with any 2 being core depending on champion and meta. Spell-vamp hasn't existed for years, and vlad is limited by cooldowns; though there's multiple lifesteal options in the runes that stack.","replies":[{"poster":"AirKingNeo","date":"2018-07-26T04:24:15.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"most people aren't building lifesteal until 4th item except bork, but bork means no crit, which means you don't have massive 2.0 AD ratio autos to heal off of\n\nalso, no one is taking the lifesteal rune options.

If it was TOTAL ad, it would be. It's also reduced against minions if you're ranged. Like said, Fleet isn't used as much anymore. **Doesn't scale with Crit anymore either.**\n\nTriumph's missing HP healing isn't as utilized by ADCs because they don't build HP nor are in the fray of a fight to get too low. It's takedown reliant aswell.\n\nNo one uses Bloodline because it is outclassed.\n\nTaste of Blood, while I admit is good healing, has a 20 seconds cooldown (can't be reduced, therefore never consistent), but most marksmen don't go Domination besides HoB Jhin. Same for Ravenous Hunter, though other runes in Domination also kinda suck.\n\nMarksmen don't use Grasp. Unsure about Font of Life.\n\n**Let's not forget, Lifesteal is reduced as ADC's autos no longer have a 2.5 AD ratio.**\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGoing back to the topic, there's is no way ADCs could even reach Vlad's level of healing, especially in the current state of the game where ADCs rarely hit the 4th item (of healing).","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-08-08T06:23:15.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering most marksmen get around 300 bonus AD from a full build, yes it is; and only fleet footwork doesn't scale from criticals, regular lifesteal still does. \n\nBut triumph ensures snowballing if you get lucky against multiple opponents, besides it's in the offensive tree so tanks will be taking it even less. \n\nOutclassed by what? Tenacity on the squishiest class is rather pointless since most people try to combo against crowd controlled opponents; and attack speed isn't hard to max out anymore by items. \n\nTaste of blood I'll say is pretty balanced, periodic but not excessive sustain. Ravenous hunter on the other hand is used by caster marksmen, since it acts like physical only omni-vamp, such champions tend to hit harder since they can't criticaly hit. \n\nIndeed but figured I'd mention all the options anyway for posterity, and Font of life is tedious to measure at the best of times. \n\nBut marksmen still critically hit for double damage (only a 1/5 damage per hit loss), and can surpass attacking 2.5 times per second from two different runes (Lethal Tempo & Hail of Blades). Not to mention most marksmen have their own AD or attack speed steroids in their kits. \n\nNext to nobody hits a forth item anymore because of snowballing, a problem that's pervaded the game for the last few years, so that excuse is flimsy at best; again I ask for what counter-proof you have.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Colton147","date":"2018-07-25T22:46:02.705+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And {{champion:42}} is still an auto-loss. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2018-07-25T23:10:39.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Colton147,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yLIvNUqt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-25T22:46:02.705+0000)\n>\n> And {{champion:42}} is still an auto-loss. {{item:3070}}\n\nI forgot he was a champ.","replies":[{"poster":"LeftyRaydy","date":"2018-07-25T23:34:31.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"who is that? is that a warcraft character?\nalso who are {{champion:268}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:429}}","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-07-26T01:34:20.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I never noticed he looks like a Dwarf gunner guy in WC3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daddy Ants","date":"2018-07-26T11:02:54.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Colton147,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yLIvNUqt,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-07-25T22:46:02.705+0000)\n>\n> And {{champion:42}} is still an auto-loss. {{item:3070}}\n\nBrace yourselves guys!\n\nColtron's here to shitpost.","replies":[]}]}]}
