Lucian's passive is a steroid, and his mobility is his form of self peel.  Jinx's minigun passive is a fast-charging steroid, she has a slow and self peel, and her passive gives her mobility.  Xayah's W is a steroid, her root is self peel, and her ult gives her untargetable mobility.  \n\nTristana isn't as big a problem as you think she is.  She snowballs super hard when fed, just like most champions.  It just gets exacerbated by her gradually increasing AA range as she gets more levels while also getting more fed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-18T20:10:08.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, and because of that she has no early game power to rival her opponents in lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2018-08-18T20:01:15.075+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that is what adcs all do and tend to have in some way or another?","replies":[{"poster":"LegitBusinessman","date":"2018-08-18T20:03:04.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jamaree,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=povvXY7d,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-18T20:01:15.075+0000)\n>\n> I mean that is what adcs all do and tend to have in some way or another?\n\nNot even remotely close no.
