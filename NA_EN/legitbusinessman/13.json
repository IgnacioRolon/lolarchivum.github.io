Having a bad game is I gave up 2 or 3 kills, and am slowly losing cs to the enemy cause im stuck under turret.  Going 0/11/1 which my top laner did last game, or my 2/14 kindred who couldnt get sated in a 43 minute game then talked about how he &#039;carried people to diamond&#039;, this is not a &#039;bad game&#039; this is people with a fundamental lack of understanding on how to play the game.\r\n\r\nSolution? \r\n\r\nIs it fair to consider a game # requirement of normals after hitting before someone can solo que ranked?  Would this tighten up the skill disparity that exists in bronze / silver?","replies":[{"poster":"TheThundersRoar","date":"2016-01-17T06:45:40.862+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing to do with skill disparity.

It would merely add another layer of requirement to enter ranked play.  The reason is that if the players you are talking about really view their losses as simply \"bad games\" then it suggests that they don't particularly see how they would have played differently.  And this suggests that even if they played the same game over again that they would have made similar decisions through out the game.  Therefore, playing more games wouldn't really change that they have \"bad games\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troiann","date":"2016-01-17T06:56:38.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've fucked up bad too.
