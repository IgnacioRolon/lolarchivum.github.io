Lack of warding (from your teamates) can easily be supplemented from 2 ways. The first way is simply warding yourself, even in diamond games people don't ward so I grab a blue trinket and by 20 minutes my half of the jungle is fully warded, the only time this isn't effective is when the enemy team has map pressure and is constantly invading, but even then by them destroying the ward, you are getting information of their whereabouts not to mention, control wards are also a thing. The 2nd way is probably the most commonly used and the easiest to use with practice, game sense. Any good player knows where the jungler starts and knows where the jungler will be for the next few minutes, and that also applies to any time the jungler appears on the map at all, not to mention you can use your own wards for more information on his whereabouts if you were to for example get lane priority and get deep wards down, that way you would never have to worry about dying to a gank. Another common way to take advantage of your wards is to ward somewhere that gives you plenty of time to react to the jungler, and then play on the opposite side of that ward, the only exception for this would be the mid lane, and in the case of the mid lane its easier because you want to play towards the side of the ward. Then if the jungler comes from either direction you are covered and have plenty of time to react. Don't try to make concrete claims about the game in silver. You still have much to learn about  the game. If any good player were in your elo they could easily climb out of it, the reason you are in silver is because you are the consistency that is causing you to lose your games, not your teamates.","replies":[{"poster":"Raiyza","date":"2018-07-03T16:41:37.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, you're saying that your trinket and getting only one control ward lights up your side of the map?

If my top laner is 0/5 by the 15 minute mark and they are a full item or two behind, then it really doesn't change anything even if I come and get a successful gank. \n> \n> once again, did you even read my post? It&#x27;s one ward 7 letters, ROAMING.\nAgain, there is a proper time for that. ADCs cannot freely leave their lane without confirming a kill. I'm not going to walk all the way to mid lane, and walk away with nothing. I lose cs and xp, and I risk losing my own tower. \n> \n> Think about it this way buddy, any good player can consistently dominate games in your elo despite their feeding teammates, why do you think that is? Do you think it&#x27;s because they are lucky and always get the good teammates?\n\nNo, but this is a team game. I can understand if players make mistakes. You can always recover. What I don't understand is why players don't have common  game sense. With all the current problems the game has like damage being as high as it is, and champions with overloaded kits compared to others, it's becoming tougher and tougher the last few seasons to actually make a recovery. \n\nThat's why I've quit the game. I play maybe once every here and there, but overall I couldn't care anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"RxO Carmada","date":"2018-07-03T22:05:31.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ok so let me get this one straight. I place my ward over at the river brush where the scuttle spawns. What does that tell me, with your logic? That the enemy jungler is 100% not in this spot. Ok? So that means he must be.....anywhere else. Nice. That is not enough info. Now, if the other teammates also ward in useful spots, that would be super duper. But, nah. It's silver.\n\nOnce again because you can't utilize strategy you resort to blaming your teammates. The idea is that you place wards at chokes that the jungler must walk through in order to be on that side of the jungle, that way you know if he has not been seen by that ward then he is either not on that side of the jungle, or he is not in a position to have a successful gank. With this, you know that he is more than likely on the other side of the map, and depending on when you placed it you can generalize how long he will spend on that side of the map.\n\n> Yes, smart players will ward for their teammates, and ping whenever someone is coming to gank their teammate, it's not rocket science.\n> \n> You just confirmed my whole point right here.\n \nYou're already making a mistake by assuming you are going to have perfect teammates every single game, you realize that you will statistically receive the same skill of good and bad teammates as your opponents right? Also, this is towards you, not your teammates, if you're a good player you place wards for them and ping when their jungler is ganking.\n\n> Did you read mine? I can ward where the jungler is, and ping it. No problems. The issue is can my laners ward their own jungle entrances to anticipate the gank? No, they do not. The issue is that players don't seem to listen. I have no control over that.\n\nOnce again making assumptions without doing it, why don't you actually try to ping to get their attention, spam ping and ping on top of them. Most people will listen, and sure not all of them will but as long as it's a majority you can easily climb if they listen to your calls (assumiong you know how to make good calls), and the games that they don't aren't just simply \"unwinnable\".\n\n\"Blue trinkets die in one shot. They also have a rather long cooldown. They are not reliable enough to be the only reliance.\"\n\nThey are good for relying on, because once again it's a ward if they are on the ward it tells you they are there, if they aren't on the ward it tells you they are not there. Also, you don't strictly have to use blue wards, this is just what I do, you can easily control your side of the map with your yellow trinkets and a cw.\n\n> Roaming is all fine, but there is a proper time to do it. I'm not going to just walk away from my lane whenever just because my mid laner is losing. I lose cs that way, and I risk losing my tower. If I shove the lane, and force my opponent to recall, sure. But That is not always the case, and if I have a decent opponent they won't allow it.\n\nObviously, roaming has a time and place, you're preaching to the choir. Also, your argument here is that you can't win lane against a silver player (or find opportunities to roam) so the rest of your team is punished for that reason, do I need to even say anything about this?\n\n> Did you read mine? I can ward where the jungler is, and ping it. No problems. The issue is can my laners ward their own jungle entrances to anticipate the gank? No, they do not. The issue is that players don't seem to listen. I have no control over that.\n> \nOnce again why are you expecting them to anticipate the gank instead of just telling them when it comes yourself, if you're warding correctly, you know where the jungler is, so tell your teammates. Also when you get opportunities ward for them, there are places that have extremely great value in terms of wards that let you get a lot of information with just a single ward.\n\n> That's all fine and dandy, but even if I take the fight to top lane after winning my own lane, my top laner is STILL well behind the enemy laner. If my top laner is 0/5 by the 15 minute mark and they are a full item or two behind, then it really doesn't change anything even if I come and get a successful gank.\n\nOkay let me get this straight, you won your lane in one of the most gold efficient lanes in the game, and you're saying if the top laner is 0/5 you can't 3v1. Give me a break. I'm a Riven main and I can't 2v1 when the bot lane is 2 levels under me or higher in most cases, let alone 3v1. Also if you can't win one of these scenarios once again that's on your skill being unsatisfactory, not your teammates.\n\n> No, but this is a team game. I can understand if players make mistakes.

Apdo has 80%+ win rates aganst other challenger players, you're actually joking or trolling if you think he can't consistently win in silver. Also there have been other challenger players that have gotten 95%+ win rates to challenger.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-07-02T16:58:03.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because most people's goal is to get to Gold 5, which is why there are a lot of boosters in that elo creating huge imbalances.","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-07-03T02:45:18.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Snowman Arc,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=thHX1dj8,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2018-07-02T16:58:03.874+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s because most people&#x27;s goal is to get to Gold 5, which is why there are a lot of boosters in that elo creating huge imbalances.\n\nGold 5 is pretty rough still though because its still matching you with the problem Silver Area(S2 and S1).","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-07-03T13:21:27.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfs will get there easily.

That said, with 15 ranks between the lowest rank and the rank where you see drastic improvements, you will have players all over the place in skill.

My experience in bronze is that while I was sometimes matched or exceeded in lane, I could almost always win by focusing objectives and punishing deaths/positioning mistakes.
