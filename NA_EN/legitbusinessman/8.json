Plenty of times whenever i play support and go alistar, as long as my team isn't feeding, i end up denying enemy junglers, blocking 'hooks' and then just countering with my own CC and disrupt the enemy ADC (sometimes throwing him right at my own ADC buddy, under our turret if i'm lucky enough on them being 'silly' enough to hug turret.\n\nThe main issue is how the 'power' between what the champion can do, the kind of damage it can dish out and the itemization it can 'exploit the hell out of' and get away with things is even PROPERLY DISTRIBUTED.\n\nWhich unhealthy mooks like {{champion:64}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:80}} are able to get super tankie with with rather easy 'tank itemization pick ups'(For the donger its all that EZ health/AP pick ups with barely a single issue on mana efficency and can still be strong as heck without any mandatory CDR for him with when he does he becomes such a damage bully on anything that isn't a tank). With pantheon and jayce they both get relatively easy harass gimmicks, all ins and just wipe an opponent out, especially in the early game but little to no 'penalty measures' to lock them up either.\n\n...and i'm sure anyone agrees with on Lee and Hecarim they just go high tank with 1 damage item like a {{item:3078}}  or {{item:3071}} and can easily charge into any enemy, even 'full tanks' and just rip thru them like they don't even care since they are so pudgie and so high on damage that they can just melt things (doesn't help that i even feel like an item like {{item:3078}} needs a 'penalty' to the spell blade ability to not allow repeated spams of insane damage just because of particular scum champions exploiting it more then champions who use it more as a option then a one trick pony item.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-05-17T15:45:16.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, abuse cases with low risk high reward need to be dealt with.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nGood analysis, I have nothing further to add here.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kal Vas Flam","date":"2017-05-17T15:46:24.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What? eliminating bans would force them to change kits.

RIOT might just decide that its ok for some champs to be perma-banned in low elo. The introduction of 10 bans is likely to introduce a new meta that changes based on the tier you play at. Some champs are banned in bronze but not in plat etc. I see them accepting this as it ads a bit of diversity to the champ roster depending on the level of play.
