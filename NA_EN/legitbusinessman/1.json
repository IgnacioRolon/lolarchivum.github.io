Only difference between old swain and new swain in terms of play style is that his root isn't ground targeted anymore and requires a bit more skill to aim, and his tether q and e dmg amp have been changed into more of a shotgun burst. W is also its own thing, sorta like old w but without the root, and you actually gotta combo it to hit it most of the time.\n\n The only reason why support is his best role is because his passive is really strong, but not op strong, but in early game being pulled to the enemy is gonna blow a sum spell or get a kill, and games just don't scale anymore because of riot's r%%%%%ed mentality about fast games with tons of dmg, and they removed a lot of his power on his combo early, so he can never reach a level in which hes 'powerful' until late mid to end game, not to mention he doesn't normally build full ap items, unless you are crazy and play him like a glass cannon (spoilers, hes not, and the healing on ult isnt as good as you think with lots of ap).\n\nAside from ALL of that, the most important thing was his gameplay style. He was a battlemage drain tank who dealt sustained dmg, he is STILL that, but traded some of the sustain dmg for burst, and they actually made him look and sound interesting, especially with how he has a demon for a hand now. \n\nI know you're being sarcastic, but it actually is a solid rework, id say in the Warwick category of solid, you may not think so because 'But he don't do dmg so bad rework\", but it isn't always about the damage. He still does it, it just takes longer. This is coming from a guy with almost 20k mastery on him, both pre and post rework. If it was about the dmg, you'd get the type of champs that we dislike now, specifically certainlyt's because they don't know when to limit themselves.\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention with the support role thing its because a bunch of shitters started abusing it, just like they did with brand, malz, xerath, velkoz ect. If he gets nerfed because of that, im going to flip shit because its taking a core skill of his and cheesing it in a lane hes not supposed to be in, but that \"magically\" makes it op in ALL lanes, at least in brands case.

Her entire kit is REVOLVED around old nidalees q.

And you'll love this: Javelin Toss can reach 200% damage at 1300 range, which is less than its maximum range. Paddle Star can only reach 150% damage at 2550 range, over THREE TIMES its base range. And Nidalee can do this from level 1, while Zoe can't even compete until she gets her ultimate at level 6. (I'll remind you, Zoe's ultimate is used to bring her closer to her opponents, which puts her in danger.) Also, Nidalee isn't restricted to moving toward her target to have the range she does. She throws a Javelin and goes on about her business, while Zoe needs to commit her time and positioning to the cast.\n\nZoe doesn't have it nearly as easy as Nidalee does.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2020-01-24T08:13:44.702+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Everyday Legends,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=0AuRtGb5,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2020-01-24T08:05:01.655+0000)\n>\n> I wish people would stop comparing Zoe to Nidalee.\n> \n> Let me tell you about Nidalee.

I play MAYBE once a week. I have been playing since s3 and don't have that much essence or all the champs unlocked. Different strokes for different folks. I will say that this cash grab isn't unique to league. Call of Duty have had a few games with loot boxes that are basically pay to win.

If you could get your opponent to take a trade pre 6, then you would overwhelm them with your Q AA Q AA combo and they'd be dead. They could never catch up to you again and you could easily dive them with your ult. That lane was over and they'd be forced to build armor to survive. After that few could stop you.\n\nThis was fine in lower ELOs because they're constantly fighting. Back then there weren't as many ranged champions top either, so it was common to want to trade.\n\nBy Gold people knew not to get cheesed by Fiora early. They knew if they stuck it out through laning phase, she wouldn't spiral into a big problem. If they were truly smart, they'd pick old Malphite and just win against her by default. From behind Fiora could do nothing because she was actually just a ball of stats with a pretty ult.\n\nThat kind of design is frustrating for both the people who play her and the people who play against her. Then her rework came along and they crammed so much into her kit. She's much more dynamic now, but there's no reliable counter play when she's allowed to thrive in the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JayceAccount43","date":"2020-01-25T21:19:19.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah im diamond but i still feel like the whole matchmaking system is RNG garbage.

The things is that reworked versions of them have more depth and are less about stat stick. For example Irelia, she was before just about wqe, wqe, wqe,wqeR without depth attached like how you use given spells, it was just about just use them, however you want. The same goes for Fiora  and Akali. Akali just outtraded  you on combo, you couldnt outplay her, you could just beat her via decision making which was also hard with certain champions since she had upper hand and also high numbers as statsticker. She just used W and then jumped at you dealing full dmg, not just Q poke, and went back.\n\nI really think that there can be done something about game balance, but the game itself is way better right now then how it used to be ( I still remeber that 140% lifesteal sion with 800 AD 3,5 K HP and some crit chance with no bad attack speed ). The thing is that smaller things have greater impact now. When everyone was clunky then nobody was and nobody was statsticker in comparison. Whole level of gameplay moved forward, so everything seems less balanced than it was before. The whole game right now is more about details than it was before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I say Facts","date":"2020-01-25T05:54:57.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see you point there and I truly understand because lately they have been \"Trolling us\".\n\nTechnically, I wish they made 2 versions of League, the old one and new one. Old one for the true game to invest in, and the new one for only \"those who really love marksmen\"\n\nOld League was much more fun, and it had plenty of comfortable roles, from Top to support. None of them was lacking, each role had its best and perfect position to play as.\n\nLook at the game now, look at Pyke, Senna. Are they really supports? Shall we call an assassin with invisibility and extreme self sustain, who can both hook and stun with the other ability and execute, and also ignores all the shields + defense ? gurantees kills and shares gold to allies? seriously? do we call that a support? no I call that a 10x Top and Jungle mixed together instead. He is been picked almost most of the games.\n\nOh and for Senna, a support who can make allies camouflage, global ult, heal and damage with an extreme passive that overpowers every other champion in late game? Seriously a passive that gives bonus Range + Crits + AD at the same time from farming? What the hell is this concept of a support? Shouldn't Senna be the wife of Lucian and supportive in gameplay? shouldn't she focus on helping the allies? why would she have the best passive in game? She can have 100% crits, lifesteal, 500 Ad and 800 range in late game for free man. I saw someone like that who took full lethality and defense. Never dies, what the hell is this concept of a support?\n\nI don't want to mention Fiora's VGU because it's rediclously frusturating to deal with and as much as I dislike AFKs, when I see my teammate rage quits fighting Fiora or Vayne, I will never put a single blame on them because fighting a champion with % true damage that gurantees to kill you no matter how much defense you invest in is borderline cancer and very toxic kit.\n\nEven Zoe, true damage. and Sett? Ofcourse, give him Tahm's E + Garen's ult in 1 single ability! It's so fair. Oh and give him that 40% HP ultimate because why not? If he has Tahm's Kench's E mixed with Garen's ult in his W, then he may as well have even more overpowered ultimate too! Let's not forget the onhit from his passive. I saw on hit Sett who just deletes tank from punching. Why?\n\nIn past I always wanted League to be fixed from all of these frusturating kits\nNow, I am just hoping a new company makes an interesting game similar as Dota or League if things remain same because the Riot's balance team is borderline extremely toxic and most frusturating team I have ever encountered in gaming. Straight up unfair and making things too irritating to play against.\n\nDon't forget that Kaisa have a shield that blocks everyone's most powerful execution, and oh god forbids if she takes Phantom, another 400 Hp Shield allowing makrmen to survive as they please.\n\nShall I explain what is the most frusturating thing in bot lane now?\n\nYummi + Any adc who builds Phantom. It's undying, extremely irritating and makes the adc 10x tanker than the actual tanks because god forbids if you dare to fight them, their Hp will always go back to full in no time, and if you manage to bring it down, they got a shield from Phantom. If you manage to chase them, they got Yummi's superior movement speed.\n\nIs this fair? shouldn't Melees Overspeed the Marksmen to capture them? If the Marksmen can be 10x faster than Melees then how the hell is this game going to work out? Everytime I think of it, I just can't understand how they believe things like that are fine and fair for the playerbase. People clearly dislike the irritating and frustrating situations to deal with.\n\nI've seen Jhin who has no boots, went up to 1k AD and 700 movement speed everytime he autos someone, he runs miles away. God forbids if someone dares to chase him ,1 shotted then runs away safely. Fair? Ofcourse.\n\nShall I talk about assassins? \nYeap, look at Yi's kit. It's very fair indeed. 5 Qs pentakills late game. You can never gurantee to kill him even if he has no flash because his Q is always up, and if you dare to slow him, he is immune for slows. If you dare to tank him, god forbid because he will melt the most tanky tank in a moment. Thanks to the RIot's balance team for making such fair decisions.\n\nAside from Yi, I see Nocturne, Wukong or other assassins with Sanguine Blade and they go from losing lane, to a guaranteed 1 v 1 lane against anyone. What the hell is wrong with this item? Maybe I should abuse it too until they manage to make changes to it!\n\n\nThis is not League of Legends anymore\nThis should be named League of Marksmen, New Supports and Assassins.","replies":[]}]}
