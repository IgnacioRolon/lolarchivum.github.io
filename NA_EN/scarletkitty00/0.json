If such a thing were to be implemented, profits would likely go down. If we were patient, we could recycle the RP for newer and preferred products.

I for one have always hated the idea of having three acquirable points for one life time. \n\nP.S - I've looked at the opposition towards my fabulous idea, and I understand their point. People should be more careful about what they buy, and if you make a mistake, 3 strikes is about all you should get. I myself do a fair amount of research before purchasing something, but I still stand where I stand. 1 refund credit per year isn't asking for much, we can't abuse it, and nothing should be forever. \n\nUpdate 2-15: My post isn't getting anymore love, can all vote more yes's? :-)","replies":[{"poster":"YambrinZ","date":"2015-01-10T19:17:26.391+0000","up_votes":102,"down_votes":3,"body":"Or, every X amount of money spent = refund credit. that way the people that actually make this game free to play get something while the freeloaders dont.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaCarrot","date":"2015-01-10T22:12:26.228+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yea I spent over $200 on League but I think it is unfair that I get the same amount of refund credits as people who spent no money.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkFaun Fortes","date":"2015-04-11T02:56:40.505+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"same","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SirFeedselot","date":"2015-01-10T21:29:34.707+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YambrinZ,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=J20bERJc,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-10T19:17:26.391+0000)\n>\n> Or, every X amount of money spent = refund credit. that way the people that actually make this game free to play get something while the freeloaders dont.\n\nI get where you're coming from but in order to get a refund on anything you would have needed to pay for it at some point.\n\nAnyone who's spent money has supported the game, and so they deserve the extra refund credit too, even if it just ends up being a chance for them to try something they haven't paid for at the expense of something they have.\n\nJust FYI, I've spent an embarrassing amount of money on this game in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Rock Rockburgh","date":"2015-01-11T20:48:48.324+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, you CAN refund IP purchases, can't you?

This means You have to choose to either **A**) just stick with your old skin even though the new one is 10 times better or **B**) Get the new skin, but now the old one is completely useless and basically almost a waste of RP.\n\nExamples:\n\n* I have Muse Sona and Arcade Sona and for some reason Riot is taking it upon themselves to make a *legendary* Sona skin...\n* I have Deep Sea (or whatever it's called) Thresh and now they come out with Bloodmoon\n* I have both Justicar and Atlantean Syndra because the Atlantean one is so beautiful it's hard not to get it\n\nObviously this is not Riot's fault. They don't force you to buy anything. But I do think it would be incredibly notable and grand of Riot to give us **at least** one refund per year, simply for the purposes of cleaning out old skins. Since it's over years, that means you're rewarding **loyal** players who have purchased skins (or champs) in the past. AKA you're giving back to the loyal players that made you filthy rich.

I bought Syndra enjoyed her for a while but could never grasp what made her tick, and thus my play is ineffective, purchased Yasuo realized my mechanical skill on spamy champions is god awful, that and if my team is expecting me to carry that's pressure and with pressure I play worse as a player.\n\nWhen playing a tank top or a support, the only pressure I hold is the need to get my carries ahead and that alone allows me to excel at those roles, but I of course didn't realize this upon the acquisition of Syndra and Yasuo.  Playing league allows for better insight into what the right purchases for you as a player are.  Refunds are great because they allow a player to more quickly find the role and champion they may excel at.
