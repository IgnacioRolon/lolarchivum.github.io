There&#039;s one, maybe two champs who have one current line of speech that breaks the 4th wall, but I&#039;m looking for a champ that Breaks the 4th wall very consistently, not only in Speech, but in moves (possibly).\n\nAnyone up to the idea?\n\nUPDATE [4/17/2015 11:31pm-US-Central]: Yes, one of the characters does infact break the fourth wall. I understand that. But I'm asking for a character that says more than just one line of damage to the wall. We need a character that _consistently_ breaks the fourth wall with **Speech and Abilities**.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-04-14T22:04:08.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:82}}   _\"You only need to click once, fool.\"_","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Woo","date":"2015-04-18T04:28:48.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heard that one already, still looking for a character that breaks **more** of the fourth wall.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Woo","date":"2015-05-09T21:19:06.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Final Bump, unless we get rollin'...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Woo","date":"2015-04-15T00:59:27.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post Bump\n\n(do people do this 'round here?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Keagn","date":"2015-04-14T22:08:09.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion has an ability where they become untargetable for 2.5 seconds, jump up on the HUD and start talking to the player.\n\nAll kidding aside, I think its best some things aren't messed with, but its a neat idea :P","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Woo","date":"2015-04-14T22:13:14.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Keagn,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=w70JRI8o,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-04-14T22:08:09.964+0000)\n>\n> Champion has an ability where they become untargetable for 2.5 seconds, jump up on the HUD and start talking to the player.\n> \n> All kidding aside, I think its best some things aren't messed with, but its a neat idea :P\n\nIt's a neat idea that doesn't necessarily even have to do what you said. I think the character should be ridiculous, but not in such a way that he could become annoying when you use one of his abilities. I mean, one of his abilities could even be just taking the ability box and smashing it into the opponent.
