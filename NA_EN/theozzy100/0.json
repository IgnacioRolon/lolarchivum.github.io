The RP either didn&#039;t update after my purchase of the 2 champs or, i was overcharged but either way this is a bug that needs to be resolved, i was planning on getting lumberjack Sion now, sadly i cannot. I would like Darius to possibly be refunded for me since because of this bug, i was not aware of the small amount of rp left in my account, and i used all my initial refunds on previous champs i ended up disliking. Thank you. {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"theozzy100","date":"2015-09-20T17:20:57.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it was updated than you for the help. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-28T17:10:47.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey theozzy100,\n\nHave you tried logging off and logging back in to see if your RP amount has been corrected?\n\nIf that hasn't worked, you can submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) regarding your purchases.","replies":[]}]}
