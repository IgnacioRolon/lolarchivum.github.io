After all your MMR changes while you play. I guess the best approach would be deciding at random whether to mute or flame, as this removes any bias created through the order of experiments over time.\nThis would also fix the issue of winrate itself not being interesting in the long run, as either approach should eventually yield 50% winrate. By randomizing the approach per game you should get a 50% winrate, which is the result of your average performance using both strategies, meaning you would have a way of directly comparing your performance with each method.\n\nOnly one problem left, easily highlighted in that last sentence: **your** performance.\nThe biggest problem with the sample size of your \"study\" isn't the number of games, it's the number of players: One.

I recently had leavers in two promo series in a row, but that doesn't mean that promos are any more likely to have leavers in them, and to call it evidence that might be the case would be actively misleading, because the data set is simply not sufficient to even start drawing that sort of conclusion.\n\nAll you have really established here is that, in the course of a hundred games, you came within the approximately expected win rate both times. Anything else is probably a statistically unfair assertion to make or even suggest, and is a misapplication of statistical analysis at best, especially as we don't have any indication of what champions or roles you played, how often you played, or at what times you played. These and more are all factors that can severely influence your win rate, which is why this is effectively a misleading statement to make even as a suggestion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2019-11-07T06:12:33.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=MkysETIX,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-11-05T23:54:01.609+0000)\n>\n> This is actually a very small sample size, and one that it's not really reasonable to draw conclusions from.

You can do it and stay within the rules. If you want to use chat to do it, you just gotta be a little creative. Well timed taunts and dances can be quite effective too and are built into the game, so Riot will never ban you for that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tahngarthor","date":"2019-11-07T06:11:08.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it really is no secret that yas mains are some of the most toxic players in league lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2019-11-06T09:06:36.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean yea, I wouldnt be surprised.
