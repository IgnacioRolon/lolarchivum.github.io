That's when I realize my Q had AD scaling and I somehow have 500 stacks and guess what I'm one shotting people. So I go in get myself a quadrakill, theirs a low yorick who i have slowed by my W, no flash or snowball up to make a possible escape. My ally Nunu see's me with my Q which at this point one shots their squishes and half-heaths their tanks/bruiser. Yorick is at a nice 500 health. 1 of mine Q is more than enough to finish him off. Their is a clear Quadra kill the announcer even says so and I'm asbout 2-3 seconds from killing Yorick. This Nunu steals my kill and says he's reporting me. I was so close to getting my first penta and this annoying kid denies me the penta. I'm not here to complain that Rito is broken or whatever, I'm just saying what motivates players to do this, where is the humanity and the empathy?","replies":[{"poster":"Teh Song","date":"2019-08-10T02:44:44.035+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"In short, it's because there's no such thing as kill stealing.\nIt doesn't exist.\n\nEnemy had 1 hp left and was cc'd?\nIrrelevant.\nYour penta wasn't stolen, you just didn't get one.\n\nFrankly though, sometimes I think kill credit should go to whoever dealt the most damage, not who got the last hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Magnesium14","date":"2019-08-10T03:26:40.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teh Song,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sG2EurEs,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2019-08-10T02:44:44.035+0000)\n>\n> In short, it's because there's no such thing as kill stealing.\n> It doesn't exist.\n> \n> Enemy had 1 hp left and was cc'd?\n> Irrelevant.\n> You're penta wasn't stolen, you just didn't get one.\n> \n> Frankly though, sometimes I think kill credit should go to whoever dealt the most damage, not who got the last hit.\n\nMy point isn't on Rito policies on kill stealing, although i do agree with you on that.

Think about it: CS, kills, etc. are earned and not given, but that doesn't justify following your allied jungler around and taking his camps while announcing ganks in /all so the enemy can hide under tower.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magnesium14","date":"2019-08-10T02:06:23.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KVbqbFsC8e,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sG2EurEs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-10T01:51:34.592+0000)\n>\n> I remember Jatt saying it many years ago during an LCS game when someone took a penta.

I don't want to complain but it's kinda unfair how you can do 99% of the work to kill an enemy and a team mate can just stroll by and take it. I would understand if for example it's a 1 v 1 top lane you lose but your enemy is at 1% health and your jungler strolls by to secure the kill, but sometimes your doing all the work and then the feeding jungler come's in with his flashy execute mechanics and steals the kill. And then says in chat \"Ez kill.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2019-08-12T13:20:47.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving someone a penta isn't expected or mandatory. \n\nGoing out of your way to steal it is rude, and flashing to deny it is honestly stupid, but you get it yourself or not.\n\nSide note why is he going to report you?

As for stealing my penta at first he was cc'ing the swain, if you looked at him it would seem he was just keeping the swain till i cam he didnt even auto attack just kept him their the second i get their and attack the swain with a few auto attacks to make sure my Q executes him, this nunu Q's him and kills him, he was obviously just trying to steal it just before i killed him. and yes it was a swain not a yorick. my bad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKUMBAG FERG","date":"2019-08-12T12:52:41.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will always try my hardest to secure kills, unless I'm sup or JG and I'm trying to get someone fed.
