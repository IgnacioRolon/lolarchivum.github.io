It would be better if riot just removed chat from the game that way nobody&#039;s feelings could get hurt. because in 2018 pt2 you get reported for: asking someone to play passive and stop feeding, asking why someone who got auto filled to a slot they cant play didn&#039;t ask to switch, pointing out  mistake a player made that lost a teamfight. hell even split pushing is reportable if your 0/11 lucain says to &quot;all mid&quot;. the toxic side of the community will slowly but surely drive players away and once that happens they will slowy flame eachother till they stop playing","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-01-14T05:19:04.289+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">asking someone to play passive and stop feeding, asking why someone who got auto filled to a slot they cant play didn't ask to switch, pointing out mistake a player made that lost a teamfight\n\n  I think you had a good point up until you said this.\n\n  You don't get chat restricted or punished for saying things like these, it's only when you do it in a _negative_ way and are being nonconstructive. Please, show me a chat log where someone was banned for saying something like \"We need to focus Yi from now on\" or \"Don't try to fight Vlad, he's already fed\" because _that doesn't happen._ \n\n Toxicity in communities is generally something that companies have no control over. Runescape has a really bitter community even though the company that runs it is fairly good to us. I doubt toxicity will be the thing to drive players away, if we've lasted this long, we'll be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"The Chad Support","date":"2019-01-14T05:41:46.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"you misunderstand what i meant, i meant that ppl that are toxic cant handle any of these comments being made towards them. so they lash out by flaming you or just straight telling you that they are going to report you all while telling you to suck their dick. its a prime example of the pot calling the kettle black","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-01-14T05:44:19.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, in that case they're still breaking the rules and you can easily report them and they'll be punished for their toxicity.
