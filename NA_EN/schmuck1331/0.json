I haven't played LoL since sometime in 2012/2013 (played between 2009-2012/13) but opened  the old laptop that I played LoL on and decided to try to get back into it.  Anyways, after my first game i noticed that I was missing pretty much all my champs/skins/runes/rune pages.  I only had 8 champs, 1 page of runes and like 5000 IP right now (I've since purchased Ezreal so I have 9 heroes now and 1200 IP).  Anyone know someone that's had a similar issue or know what I can do about it? I've sent a ticket into riot and am awaiting a reply.  Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-19T02:08:26.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since we're dealing with sensitive personal information when doing account repairs, I won't be able to be of much help on the boards.
