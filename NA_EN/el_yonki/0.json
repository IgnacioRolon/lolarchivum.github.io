I don't see anything that would cause you to get banned through game play offense so I'm guessing you are banned based on toxic chat.  Your story doesn't matched with the replay I saw.  No one baited you into any fight and left you.  You overextend and die.  No one went afk in that game unless you count the first 2-3 minutes that you afk'd at base after the first wave of minions already clashed with other wave on bot lane.  Oh yeah, I don't see any afk for any significant length of time that game (unless you want to count yourself) so there's that story.  I don't know how you plan to dispute your ban if your story is not even truthful.\n\nIf you got banned based on toxic chat, then post your chat log so we can discuss further.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2020-01-06T04:30:55.812+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you feel a ban is **truly** in error, you can submit a support ticket.\n\nHowever, there's something you have to keep in mind:\n\nUnless their action **literally** forced you into doing something (e.g. Dying a lot because Tahm was throwing you into the enemy team, or AFKing because someone is DDoSing you), what they did is irrelevant. Whether or not they flamed you, AFKed, or inted **does not excuse any action you did**. You are punished based on what **you** did.\n\nThe reason for this is because, if **their** actions were considered when it did not directly force you to do something, **they could not be punished either**, since you also broke rules by flaming them and threatening to int.\n\nI'm also not seeing anyone who looks like they went AFK in your last game. Unless it was at the very end, after it could have realistically mattered. You also did suspiciously terribly on MF for being mastery 7 with that high of a winrate on her. Bad games do happen, but that seems *incredibly* suspicious.","replies":[]},{"poster":"omgitsgb","date":"2020-01-11T09:35:56.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|after taking like 10 kills.

So maybe once, she left you on your own when you died! And this was after lane phase was long done and you were pushing T2. Your story really doesn't match up. No one went AFK from what I saw. Malphite was the only one at over 10 kills and every kill he got was primarily his own damage. Just look at the damage done, he was the only one doing well on your team. Also, that's how Malphite works. He does his damage and then he has to back away. \n\nYou were running up on your own, OP. You don't have to be out there pushing lanes and stuff when your team isn't there. They also have to B and buy items/get health back. The issue here is that you were dead so often (at the beginning of a fight, usually) that by the time you'd respawn, team fights would be over. You get to lane or are on your way back while your team is leaving the Rift after the fight. Meanwhile, the enemy team returns and meets you because you pushed up more than half of the way forward. None of your teammates are close-by. No questions asked, you're dead _again_. {{sticker:sg-janna}}\n\nSo, I think that what you typed there got you punished. Because even if you had no intention to feed, you threatened your team. Making them uncomfortable while dying at the same time. 1/12 - Riot can't guess your intent unless you type it. Anyway, even if you didn't intend to feed, threatening teammates like that is not considered okay! {{sticker:leblanc-funny}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-06T23:04:21.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You kept saying it over and over?
