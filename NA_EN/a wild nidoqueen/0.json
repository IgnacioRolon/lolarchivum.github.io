So as it was installing, my antivirus alerted me that a file called Pua.Safe.Install was inside the update. My antivirus removed it and I tried re-downloading the update. Unfortunately, it kept popping up with an error. I restarted my computer and I uninstalled league of legends from my computer. I waited a bit and reinstalled it, only for it to say there was another error.\r\nPlease let me know if this is something with the alpha client or if its my computer itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T17:59:13.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What anti virus are you using?  You may need to configure your antivirus and other settings to allow league as an exception, which our[ patching issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) guide to help with.  \n\nThe part that sucks if you've already had the file removed, in which case a repair would be necessary.

It was just this one update.

Allowing league as an exception should fix that up!  I haven't seen too many reports since then so I'm guessing that the software has since updated to no longer detect a false positive.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeadRag3","date":"2017-03-08T18:50:49.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same exact thing is happening with me.
