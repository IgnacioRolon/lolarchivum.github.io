You want to contact support; you more than likely, will get nothing from posting here.  The only thing this board is really used for, really, is as a place that other players can read your chat logs and be toxic and condescendingly insult you to feel superior.\n\nThat's 90% of this board; it's unproductive for you so just contact support. So you should....\n\n>I hope this wasn't misinterpreted by the system as coming from me -because I repeated those same words to him in chat that he...\n\nOh.\n\nAs they say, \"You dun goofed.\"\n\nYou see, Riot uses an automated system to look through reports.  To be fair, they kind of have to, because of the size of the player base.\nThe thing about automated systems: They don't understand context.  It can, it has, and it will ban players wrongly, for anything that appears in chat and will find new things to ban for.\n\nSo what you _really_ need to do is contact support and hope you don't get stuck behind the wall of \"You were toxic so your ban stays\" replies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2016-04-08T01:50:10.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You asked for it by repeating them.

You can't call out your teammates for being bad, you can't ask the enemy team to report them, and you can't mock, threaten, insult, or coerce anyone. That's not even totally inclusive.\n\nIt sounds silly to say that, because I'm sure you see people do those things quite often.\n\n The problem is the way Riot chooses to punish people who break that rule. Only people that get reported in a **large  percentage** of their games ever get punished- so nothing happens to the people that do it once every 10 games or so, less than 10% of them.\nBecause there are 10 people in every game, it's likely you're going to run into someone having their \"l'm usually not like this\" game. \n\nWhich creates an environment where people think it's normal or acceptable to call for reports, insult their teammates, etc every game, even though it isn't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-04-08T09:51:25.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unstable teenagers are not a reason.
