Once the kills have happened the lanes will need to get their minions suiciding for the sustain before the bots return.\n\nOnce the game hits that 15 minute mark however I've heard the bots will group and begin a single lane hell push. With most bot selections and curses being magic based a high MR team is likely to do better versus the doom poke. The enemies can also be delayed greatly with as much player created terrain as possible to allow you to poke back without getting hard dived.\n\nAnyone want to start poking holes so we can improve?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-10-07T08:24:37.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the way to beat it from what I've seen is to get lucky about who they put you against.
