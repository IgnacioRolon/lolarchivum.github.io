If you never played ranked, you'll start rated at 1200 and then they'll adjust from there, even if you win or lose all your matches you won't be placed insanely far from where you currently stand. Also, people going 5-5 will usually see a small drop in their ranking. I was Gold IV, won 5-5 and I dropped to Silver II. If you are really worth more that where they placed you, it shouldn't be very lon for you to climb the ladders.\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Frikgeek","date":"2015-02-21T15:36:44.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're full of shit.

I don't know why you get upset so fast, you could've just told me I was wrong and correct what I said, no need to tell me I'm full of shit when I was just trying to be useful and help the guy understand why he was put Bronze II.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla7","date":"2015-02-21T07:00:34.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raptamei","date":"2015-02-21T15:40:09.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know about the print screen key, right?\n\n> Provisinouals","replies":[]},{"poster":"pE4CbxDPQO","date":"2015-02-21T08:46:07.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best be is to make a new account and just play better.
