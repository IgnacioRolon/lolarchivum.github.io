Doubly so if it's Kassadin's daughter. The design seems really safe and uninspired, like I've seen this Champion already in the game before. \n\nI don't even mind that she looks humanoid, what bothers me more is that they could have made her super creepy and uncanny, really emphasizing the fact that the Void is a scary place that breaks people. I'm talking something inspired by the girl from the Ring or something, human-looking, was probably once human, but is twisted into something horrifying and has become just a host for something unthinkable. Riot could have flexed their horror muscles even a little, but instead we are getting chick wearing Void suit that harnesses the Void? Is there going to be some kind of struggle against corruption? I just don't see an interesting angle with this design, she seems more like a poor interpretation of Kassadin sprinkled with a smidge of Kayn edge and turned into a woman. \n\nMaybe her lore/voice will change my mind, I don't know though.
