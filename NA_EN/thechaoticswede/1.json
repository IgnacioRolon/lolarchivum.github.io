This means there will be better-or-worse win/pick rates because of this. Realistically a 5 minute game could see all 22 heroes played.  Not always gonna happen but it's possible. One-hero limit per team also leads to some situations, whereas balance was far worse when there were stupid comps like 5 tracers/1 lucio.\n\n* Overwatch is new and balance is building up. Same reason why League's balance has had periods of better-and-worse balancing but in generally is building up better DESPITE THE GAMEPLAY BOARDS COMPLAINING. It's also why DOTA, which is older than WoW, has some fantastic balance. (DOTA's first iterations were early 2002/2003 and the game is still being tweaked and balanced almost 15 years later. League came out realistically in 2008/2009.)\n\n* Statistically, Overwatch/League have similar levels of balance. LCS/LCK/etc. will see around 80-90 champions picked. Which equals about 60-70% of the cast being picked. Overwatch (as seen here) features about 14/22 heroes picked to a massive rate, so 63%. Now, you can read this either way: Overwatch has less heroes so their number is better than Leagues. Alternative, because of hero swapping and overall less/more specialized heroes, Overwatch should always have better pick rates than League and DOTA. It all depends on how you want to read it....aka \"Do I wanna disparage Blizzard or Riot?\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-08-11T16:01:57.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would certainly hope a game that's been out for 6-7 years has better balance than a game that was just freshly released. \n\nBalance in Overwatch isn't quite there yet and definitely still has some kinks, but the direction and goal of it is certainly much more defined than League's balance. And this is noticeable as the percentage different in win rates across most of the champions in Overwatch are pretty consistently close with only maybe 1 or 2 outliers...unlike League where it can wildly vary from 40% to 55%, \n\nAlso, much like League of Legends is, pro play is incredibly different then solo queue/regular play. There are champions who do better in pro play because they thrive in coordinated environments and other champions who thrive in chaotic environments, something you will rarely see at professional level. \n\nDisclaimer: I play League way more then I play Overwatch.\n\nAnd slightly off topic, I find it hilarious that Sona players hate how Riot has a death wish against their main champion who has an aura style game play, but yet Overwatch proves just how unbalanced and overbearing it is to play against a strong aura based champion with Lucio.
