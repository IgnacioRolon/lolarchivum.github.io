When I try to click on something on the Lol main menu (the one you get to when you log in) I am unable to because ( I'm on Mac pro laptop so I have multiple 'desktops' so one desktop will have my safari running and the other lol main menu so I can just swipe on my touchpad to access either )\r\n it moves to another 'desktop/screen' aka the safari running desktop. So  I have to position my cursor on where the \r\n'play' button would be if I were on the Lol screen and swipe back to that desktop and fast click , may have to repeat 2-3 times for the click to finally get through. I HATE IT - WHAT IS THIS PROBLEM CALLED AND HOW CAN I FIX IT??? \r\n\r\nHope I explained it so you understand the problem. Seems like a BUG but not in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-15T18:16:49.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I'm personally not too familiar with the specifics of touchscreen and desktop functions for Mac.
