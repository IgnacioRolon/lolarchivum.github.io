From everything in your original message, this strongly seems like the root cause is a hardware issue.  If your screen freezes, and your audio glitches 16 to 20 minutes into the game, it strongly seems like your system is locking up from lack of available RAM, possible faulty drivers, an overheating Graphics Card, or other hardware related causes.  Since it is incredibly difficult to pinpoint the exact issue at this moment, I strongly recommend that you complete all of the steps from our Knowledge Base Article regarding hardware issues, found here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22167780\n\nIf you are still experiencing issues, regardless of completing all of these steps, then please let us know here in Player Support by creating a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new), and include the following latest information so that we can investigate the root cause:\n\n1) Dxdiag information: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20100477-obtaining-a-direct-x-diagnostic-or-dxdiag\n\n2) Please send your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22128450-League-of-Legends-Logs\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list","replies":[]}]}
