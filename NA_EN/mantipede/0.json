It flat-out ruins games and makes it hard to want to queue again. \r\n\r\nI report this every single time, but most players don&#039;t just randomly rage-quit. It&#039;s a habit for these players. You would like to think after a few offenses, that player would just be banned from the game. \r\n\r\nBut do we really think/know it&#039;s happening though?","replies":[]}
