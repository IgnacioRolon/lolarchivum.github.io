Also, it is not available to use boardless mode anymore since it wont be full screen with movable option anymore. It bugs me hard actually cause I enjoy playing rank and it is making me not able to play very fluently and always atomically dodge before go into the game. I have tried to re download the game but it is not working. Anyone have this problem too? Also hope have a solution. It is annoying problem","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T22:35:52.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds pretty frustrating, and I'd like to help get you in game.  This might not be a result of an update, unless you recently changed network hardware.  Your issue seems to be more connection related, specifically failing to reach our game servers.  My suggestion here would be to run through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot.  Be sure to test it out in a custom game though, to prevent any penalties.  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
