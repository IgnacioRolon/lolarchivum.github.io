We've transitioned over to the updated version so it's not going to function anymore.  I suggest grabbing our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and using it to perform a clean reinstall.  This will get you to the current version as well as the resolution.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"skendrlja","date":"2017-04-27T01:03:43.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"downloaded hextech repair tool, reinstalled game upgraded client.. still same problem :/. \nCould be nvidia geforce experience? because it was auto optimized but I guess thats only ingame..","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-27T15:44:35.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's okay, at least now that you're on the updated client I consider that progress made!  Hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can check this out and see if there's anything we can do to help.
