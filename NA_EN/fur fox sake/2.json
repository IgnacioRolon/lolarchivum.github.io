Keep in mind that I had someone like this that was toxic, I reported them and still got stuck with them in the next game. Are you serious this has happened me 3 to 4 times the past week and I lost my promos to plat and now I&#039;m just tanking so hard. Its like Riot is trying to tilt me. HOLY. Can I just get a whole new team lol stop this. Like one time I won against a pantheon who went 0/11 then the next game I got him on my team.. thank goodness that was a remake. I&#039;m already not doing too hot this ranked season but this is not helping at all. Riot, are you trying to tilt me? \r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\nAlso something I&#039;m seeing a lot in my games...people that don&#039;t know how to ward.

The reality is, people think its worse now, but back in the day of season 2 and 3. That was a full out war zone. Didn't get your role? Most people would then troll you. Plus you cannot magically just change shit and expect it to be good. It will never be good, why? Human beings are unpredictable. Sometimes you get a game, people suck. Other times you get the great team. Take it in strides people, some shit you just have to cut your loses and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"your mother88888","date":"2018-02-25T16:36:59.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually liked the old matchmaking system, i don't think it was that bad. i would say the trolls were slightly higher back than, but people troll in the auto fill supp position all the time now as well.

Your MMR gets to the next tier or above in my case and then you get paired with people that are unranked or have 30% WR's literally...despite your own MMR and WR being way higher and eventually lose enough to tank your MMR and you continually get shit on and drop rank getting paired with people who intentionally throw, rage quit, or are completely unskilled while not even being ranked.  Match Making is Bull$hit!! Play 200 matches maintaining a 60% WR to get thrown in with 3 unranked players in your damn promos... or 30-40% WR's!!!  Literally, use op.gg for live matches and you will see exactly what is being discussed here.  It's really frustrating and a turn off...even from a game that I like and have spent money on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"abca98","date":"2018-02-24T21:29:42.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would also help not pairing people who know basic concepts of counterbuilding with people who don't even know what statistics mean.

There's a big pool of players of the same ELO to be matched with at most times so the matchmaker doesn't \"recycle\" players. But if you queue up back to back after you got tilted by a teammate, there's a good chance they did that too and you find yourselves pressing the same \"play again\" button at the same time, resulting in increased chances to be in the same game (not necessarily the same team).\n\nI get that way too after someone tilts me and the urge to just play again instantly and not end my day in a loss is strong. But taking a 5 minute break in between losses helps me unwind a bit and not carry the same shitty mentality in my other games and blame my new teammates for the mistakes of my past teammates. Yea, they could be the same mistakes but me being the reason why i'm tiling again isn't helping me or my team play the game any better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nea104","date":"2018-02-25T17:49:36.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you've mixed a couple of different issues here.\nMatchmaking is awful, and not intended to get balanced (and then enjoyable) games; it's just about the 50% win ratio.\n\nSo, it doesn't matter who you reported before, nor if your teammates know how to ward (besides that means they are probably not really good, so if you've been matched with them it's probably because your time to lose has come :P).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rico Nasty","date":"2018-02-25T16:27:56.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've completely stopped playing ranked till this shit gets fixed.
