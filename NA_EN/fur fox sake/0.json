Really disappointed","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I upgraded my monitor to 4k and realized that league looks awful. The champ/minion health bar is tiny, so are the icons on the minimap, and my cursor is so small like it's almost impossible to play. It really is unplayable. I was wondering when 4k will be fully supported because its been so long and I've seen other people talk about this years ago. So many other games have 4k support and I think it's about time for league to support it too since this is pretty much just a scaling issue and should be easily fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"DW4RD3N","date":"2017-12-13T03:35:33.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As of patch 7.24, the scaling for health bars was fixed for 4K.
