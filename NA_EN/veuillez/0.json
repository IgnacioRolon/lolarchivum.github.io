Did you see anything listed on the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/) page or in-client about it? \n\nTypically if there are service issues, loss forgiven is turned on once our network techs have investigated the issue and confirmed it. Sometimes this leads to a small number of players who missed out on the *loss prevented*, while most players affected by it would still receive it. In any case, we can not retroactively apply loss prevented to an account. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
