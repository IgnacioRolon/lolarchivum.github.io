This is not a be-all and/or end-all description of Sona but rather to provide food for thought and a place of discussion for those who love Sona  as a character.\n\nWith that said, let’s get this show on the road.\n\nPart 1: Who is Sona  Buvelle?\n\nLet’s start by laying down what we know.\n•\tSona  is of Ionian origin and was left at the doorstep of an Ionian adoption center.\n•\tBy whatever means and for whatever reasons, Etwahl, a special kind of musical instrument, is seemingly bound to Sona  and refuses to leave her side.\n•\tDespite being well-behaved and mute, Sona remained in the adoption center until her teenage years.\n•\tSona  was eventually adopted by Lestara Buvelle, a noble of Demacia who learned about Sona's exotic instrument.\n•\tIn her League Judgment, it is hinted that Etwahl can act on its own and may have killed Lestara Buvelle but now that the Institute of War is no longer canon, I question if everything associated to it is valid.\n•\tA member of the band Pentakill, both old and new. (Again, canon?)\n•\tIs officially friends with {{champion:5}}  and {{champion:44}}.\n•\tIs able to use her music to physically affect people and things around her.\n•\tLoves to float.\n•\tSome telepathic capabilities?\n\nIf I have missed anything, let me know. Like I said, this analysis is a WIP.\n\nPart 2: {{champion:37}}'s abilities.\n\nThis is the meat of my analysis and where I poured the most of my effort. I’ll just say the bottom result outright.\n\nDespite being mute, {{champion:37}} is a full-fledged spell caster. She may not be a dedicated caster like {{champion:7}} (the ‘c’ in the end is silent btw) or {{champion:50}} but {{champion:37}} does use magic.\n\nNow, let’s analyze what is a ‘spell’ (and I’m using this word a bit loosely here). In standard fantasy setting, you say a few words, maybe a body gesture, and something happens like Avada Kedavra or Fus Ro Dah. \n\nI chose those two because they are easily recognized. The word part of the spell is called the verbal component of the spell. There are mages that can use spells without needing to speak the words but generally speaking, no words = no spell. But Sona is mute so she must be a non-verbal caster, right? I’m not going to say that she is or isn’t but I have a theory that gives the maven another workaround, one that technically includes using the verbal component of spells.\n\n**Etwahl’s music.**\n\nNow. In order to explain what I mean, I need to point out something first. What is speaking (as we know it)? Well… it’s really, at its core, us making a bunch of specific sounds and in a specific order with our mouths so that we can understand each other. Here is the key word; **Sounds**!\n\nDespite being mute, {{champion:37}} has with her at all times, something she can use as an alternative to ‘activate’ the verbal component. That is not to say she can’t use or even master silent casting but my theory gives {{champion:37}} more tools to work with to use magic.\n\nIn order for my theory to work, {{champion:37}}will have to be smart and/or cunning enough to translate words to music or just use music and things happen. But hey, that’s what she been doing since day 1 of her release; using music to cast spells. Hell. Even Scott Pilgrim vs the world did this. An electric gorilla vs two ice/ghost serpentine dragons being a big example.\n\nAs for {{champion:37}} being an aura mage with QWE, it makes sense. Sound is omnidirectional and given the kinetic nature of sound energy, if one has the skill, it can be built up and unleash a combined effect (aka her passive). I’m no physics expert though, so I could totally be wrong about this.\n\nOf course there is the iconic ultimate, Crescendo. For now, I’ll ignore that it’s a linear skillshot but I will instead explain how I view it works. Augmented by magic, the music forcibly activates the part(s) of the brain that regulates dancing of those who hear it. If no such thing exists or isn’t developed enough in the listener’s brain, the brain shuts down its functions to protect it from the foreign stimuli. The potency needed to cause such a reaction is nothing to sneer at. Only those with special mental or spell defenses can protect themselves.\n\nOn the subject of In-game abilities, I find that the main reason why {{champion:37}} only has four abilities and a passive is purely for gameplay and balance reasons. If Sona, or LoL for that matter, were a living, breathing person (or world) then the sky would be the limit on what she (or it) can do and learn. Sona even floats, which suggests some telekinetic capabilites and we don't even need to press a button. It's already there.\n\nPart 3: Etwalh.\n\nNow. We can't discuss Sona without mentioning her instrument. They will always be a package deal. And that is what I'd to discuss. Why are they linked and what is the nature of said link? All that we know that where Sona is, so is Etwahl. Despite it seemingly is capable of acting on its own, it always goes back to Sona's side.\n\nFor a lack of a better term, I found that Etwalh is **soulbound **to Sona... or it could be the other way around or it goes both ways. Like I said, what is the nature of the link and how strong is it? At this point, I don't really know. Riot left it open either for potential story development, a little ambiguity (nothing wrong with a little suspense), or both.\n\nSome of you suggested that Etwahl may be its own entity, and that is fine, but I have another theory. What if Etwahl is SO in tune with Sona's thoughts, wishes and desires that it may pick even the hidden ones. Ones that Sona may not consciously aware of. More on this in the next part.\n\nPart 4: Personality.\n\nThis is, by leaps and bounds, the most subjective part of this analysis. Not simply on my end but for everyone. On Riot's end, Sona's personality is defined by her splash arts, her quotes, and how she behaves in the game (body language and all that). We, the players and the reds not on the narrative/art department take what we have and, knowingly or not, add our own creative license. This is what I meant about Sona's full personality is subjective. Eye of the beholder kind of thing.\n\nOh. For those saying that Sona is bloodthristy... the same can be said about the entire roster. If one wants to take part in glorified gladiatorial combat, one must possess an amount of bloodlust to even set foot in there. Sona is no exception. It is with that I transition back to my theory in part 3. What if Etwahl can even pick up on Sona's hidden emotions and whatnot. If my theory holds true, Sona may be thristy for blood but that's not the be-all and end-all.\n\nLet's take a look at her gameplay. What does she do? A little bit of everything. Q can be seen as part of her aggressive tendencies. W would represent her defensive tendencies (heal and protect). E can symbolize her supportive tendencies. And when I see her ultimate, I can't help but get a 'mess is mama bear and you get the claws' vibe.\n\nSo if Sona wants to prevent Etwahl from going rampant, she must master herself. If she does, Etwahl will behave like Sona wants it to.\n\nEDIT: added parts 3 & 4. This is still WIP. I still have other parts to adds.\n\nEDIT2: Continued in a quote...","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-28T18:49:06.329+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now a little out of date, but I have to throw in my favorite rant, borrowed from a friend, about why Sona is the most bloodthirsty Champion in the League of Legends.\n\n\"Sona is a bloodthirsty psychopath.

Hope you don't mind if I try to contribute to what you've written, despite not really knowing any more than any other player of League!  (My red-name-ness doesn't give me any secret knowledge on Sona, alas - but I am a Sona main!)  \n\nFirst - maybe someone else can confirm this, but I remember in the previous lore that Sona DID actually get adopted out a few times when she was in the orphanage, but was returned by the adopters soon after, with mysterious (but very polite) reasons for giving her back.  Similarly, the etwahl was sold multiple times, but always found its way back to Sona - again, always with a whiff of suspicious mystery about it.\n\nWhen I read those bits, I always got a bit of a sinister feeling.  Maybe that's not from Sona, and she lives a charmed life - but certainly from her instrument.\n\nSecondly - I'm showing my [D&D nerdiness](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Components_%28Spell_Descriptor%29) here, but 'somatic' component is perhaps the wrong word?  A somatic component is a hand movement - the verbal component is probably what you're thinking of.  I'm disappointed it doesn't have a fancier word than that.  If we were thinking of Sona as a classic fantasy mage, then her ability to create somatic (hand) movements is probably beyond most other mages!  She's a musician, after all, and the discipline (and strength) that musicians have in their hands can be near paranormal, even in our world.\n\nI was about to completely agree that her instrument is her voice - but then I remembered those sinister feelings from earlier.  Head canon, but I suspect that the etwahl itself has some agency in the sounds that it makes.  So her music becomes a merging of both their wills.  I'm not sure I could imagine Sona working much magic without the etwahl, nor can I imagine that instrument being particularly effective without her.  Maybe it's some kind of symbiotic relationship.\n\n\nLastly, and I'm just throwing this out there as a complete tin-hat conspiracy theory (which you should all feel free to shout down as complete nonsense) but is anyone else getting a tragic vibe from the new DJ Sona skin?  I know that her VO is intended to be unintelligible, but in the same way that crazy people claim that they can hear messages from the devil in records played backwards - I can almost make out phrases in her VO.\n\nHere's the link to the Skin Spotlights VO video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgaxVzYurPI\n\n0:58: \"What's happening?\"\n1:09: \"Let me out.\"\n1:14: \"They're all so amusing.\"\n1:18: \"Just being a friend.\"\n\nI know the the VO is remixed bits of her original VO - but in my imagination now, DJ Sona is a bound AI construct.  Maybe forced to perform against her will and only able to communicate in soundboard form.  When she's killed in game, she disappears in a bright pulse of light - as if she were never physical at all.  Maybe there's something wrong with me that I would read that into a skin that is so obviously designed to be full of joy :)\n\n(Standard disclaimer - I don't work directly on League, and I am not on the Narrative team.)","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2015-02-28T17:35:00.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And there's the judgement in which (spoiler) the Etwahl kills the person Sona loved most.","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-02-28T18:39:20.822+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really wonder if, in that event, Ethwahl actually kills that person, or if it retaliated against the summoner's image.

A somatic component is a hand movement - the verbal component is probably what you're thinking of.  I'm disappointed it doesn't have a fancier word than that.  If we were thinking of Sona as a classic fantasy mage, then her ability to create somatic (hand) movements is probably beyond most other mages!

This is my least favorite part of the analysis and the emptiest as well. This part is meant to explore Sona's social life.\n\nThis is not a guide for lane or team match-ups. There are already guides out there just for that.\n\nOfficially, {{champion:37}} is friends with {{champion:5}} and {{champion:44}}. Only one question comes into mind when I look at this. Why? Well. The only ones who can truly answer that are the Rioters in charge of it. The only thing I can guess that makes sense is that Xin taught Sona about Ionia. Their heritage, culture and so on.\n\nAs for Taric, I can only guess that they share a deep passion for their respective art. Sona being music and Taric being gems.\n\nWhile technically not canon, we can't leave out Pentakill. They are a part of what makes Sona well... Sona. Even more so than Xin and Taric. What goes on backstage? Well. The AMAs for Pentakill album and DJ Sona gaves us a few bits but keep in mind that those bits are just us having fun with each other and not an serious discussion.\n\nLike I said, this part is quite empty. I'm hoping that some of you guys have insights/ideas that I lack.\n\nPart 6: What lies in the future?\n\nAt this point, the sky is the limit. The core reason why I made this analysis is the following:\n\nGive and take with the community and Riot, especially the Narrative team. It is Riot's job to create characters and all that entails but that does not mean that we can't help somewhat. I'm aware that Riot cannot takes ideas directly but they can be inspired and use a few workarounds over an idea they like.\n\nThat and it's kinda like voting. If we give Riot these ideas (the act of voting) and they somehow botch it, we have every right to complain.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'd like to thank everyone who read this monster of a post and give a big shout out to everyone who posted.\n\nTo the narrative team (if you're reading this).  This is a love letter to you guys and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nThis is Shrouded Snake slithering away.\n\nP.s. If any forum mods could remove the WIP in the title, that'd be nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerana","date":"2015-03-02T16:42:55.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her Etwahl is cursed and soul bound to her to prevent the Etwahl from killing anyone. Since the instrument is a killing machine the only way to prevent it from killing anyone is to bind it to her will. As the original poster pointed out though, Sona's subconscious may on occasion desire death for someone. She joined the League because it was the only to prevent anyone from dying and to satisfy the Etwahl's blood-lust, as well as her own. If it was not soul bound to her, it would kill wherever it went.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1DGJtniGlk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrouded Snake","date":"2015-03-02T16:15:19.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated the main post.
