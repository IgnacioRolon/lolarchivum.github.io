If you want the most possible damage then get some experience and pick up Draven. He's really fun and his spinning axes act like critical strikes that are guaranteed. Get some crit on him and you just about double his damage in the mid game. \n\nHe is mechanically demanding, though, and your positioning has to be decent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyer Beast","date":"2015-11-07T23:11:42.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:67}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:18}} .

Vayne is strong against tanks, jinx does alot of area dmg, caitlyn is the long range poke adc, corki is a bursty adc, and tristana is great all around","replies":[]},{"poster":"StoryDuck","date":"2015-11-07T21:58:29.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plain damage?  {{champion:67}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:96}} and {{champion:29}} if you can get a good ult off.  Vayne eats tanks for breakfast.  jinx does so much AoE with her rockets it's scary.  Kog'Maw is the definition of hyper carry for late game.  Twitch is harder but if you ever see a twitch pull off a good ult you would know what I mean when I say he brings the damage.  I've seen a full build Twitch in late game kill an entire team that got caught in the jungle in under 3 seconds....it was scary.","replies":[]}]}
