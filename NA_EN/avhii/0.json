(I can't get all the details as I am currently at work posting this)\r\n\r\nI've tried repairing the files, uninstalling and reinstalling the game and the problem is still ongoing. Please help me fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-21T02:26:31.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When your champion seems to teleport around outside of your commands or \"rubberbanding\", the most likely culprit is typically an unstable connection.
