As I have asked in the question above, I noticed that my friends were able to change their language from English to Korean by going to league folder -> RADS -> Locale.cpg and change the en_GB or en_NA to ko_KR and the patch would start once you start league. For me, this was not the case. When I started league after doing this, it said that there was an error and that I should check my logs to check what my problem was. Anyone know why it's doing this? {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\n안녕하세요. {{champion:103}}  저가 롤을 영어에서 한국어로 바꾸려 하는데 어떻게 하는지 아시는분 계시면 답장부탁함니다 {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T21:58:33.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't supported languages beyond what's already available on each server, per the [supported language](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language) guide.
