When you smite raptors, you *might* get something.  If you spot a ward, you know it's there(maybe), but it's duration is so low that if there is anything else going on when you spot the ward you have to use your sweeper to get it anyway.  Combine this with the fairly common tactics of placing a trinket inside the raptor pit just to waste the buff, or placing any ward in the bush next to raptors so the buff procs instantly and if the jungler doesn't stop killing raptors right away and go to the bush to kill it, it did nothing.  The cool mind game is neat and all, but when you have to play this game just to get any benefit at all from the camp, it doesn't seem right.  Also, considering that in most normal conditions you should always assume the enemy is warding, simply knowing a ward is there is an extremely small benefit.\n\nI think because of this, allowing vision wards to pass by the proc would make more sense to me.  If you take it as the primary function is to reveal stealthed things moreso than specifically spot wards(if not , why does it work on a shaco box but not a heimer turret?), than it wouldn't proc because it's not revealing anything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-01-24T20:47:26.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That...that makes sense.

For detecting stealth **champions** on the other hand.. Smite is *basically* compulsory on each team and so it shouldn't have an extremely specialized power like **champion** stealth detection. It's already enough that it detects {{champion:17}} shrooms and {{champion:35}} boxes. \n\nIn my opinion it's much more healthy to have it apply the \"{{item:2047}}  visual\" when a ward is nearby whenever you pass by one for the duration up to say, 3 wards or time expiration without the sweeping effect.
