It's an irritating and unnecessary \"feature\" held-over from the olden days of DotA. Riot made League and cleverly removed a lot of the more obtuse parts of DotA, like minion denying, to make it the game more accessible to people unfamiliar with the genre. Yet for some reason minion block has managed to stay in the game for... what like 8 years now or something? And I honestly cannot fathom why.\n\nIt is a pretty fundamental rule of design that everything should serve a purpose. You should have a good reason for every decision when making a game. But what purpose does minion block serve? There's absolutely minimal skill to it; either you randomly get caught or you don't. It's frustrating because it is extremely unclear where or how you're getting caught until you're already 2 seconds into your minion CC. \n\nLets compare minion block to a mechanic that was removed for a similar feel bad reason; dodge. When Riot removed dodge from the game entirely, the reasoning was that trades shouldn't be decided by RNG and because outplaying your opponent only to watch them get away with 10 hp because they dodged your flash-auto. Dodge served an actual purpose (defense stat strong against heavy auto attackers) and yet Riot removed it basically without a second thought because of the randomness and the feelbadman moments it created. Minion block serves no purpose (punish melee characters harder than they already are? wut?) and is equally as random. Why on earth is it still in the game? Just remove it entirely and the game will be better for it.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkKatalyst","date":"2018-01-16T20:02:27.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you talking about ignoring unit collision? The reason why that won't be removed is because of balance. Ignoring collision with minions would make it much easier to avoid skill shots that minions can block. So for example, if you are in front of a minion, you can pass right over it instead of going around to avoid attacks. The few fractions of a second saved is enough to make a difference. Overall, I think more problems would be created than fixed.

As a side note, this is also why I'm not a fan of the recent Zoe nerf to her Q updating, because it works exactly on that principle. In this particular respect, if removing creep block were to make specific champions shoot up to excessive win rates, then I think balancing them directly as a result of that would create a much healthier situation overall. If champions were to lose counterplay entirely due to creep block, then the real problem is likely that those champions are just unhealthy to start with, and so updating their gameplay would be necessary anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"God vs Rito","date":"2018-01-16T04:57:37.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I don't really understand why people complain about creep block as if it was the main problem in LOL.
