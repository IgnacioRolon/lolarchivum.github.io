My placement matches this year put me in bronze 2{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} . I won virtually every match up to promos for silver 5 too. This player had about 50 games. This player was in a normal game, but I could get him on my team in ranked, slashing my odds of winning when he should be in bronze. It&#039;s bad enough you get unranked players in silver games, they often cost matches for their team or solo carry if they are a smurf. I hear they are also in Gold matches.\r\n\r\n Anyway I dont understand this, anyone got any ideas how? High rank last season so a high rank after placements but account bought? Just plain broken placements?","replies":[{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2017-04-09T14:55:02.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had an ADC . . with 0 ranked wins when I was playing braum support autofill\n\nThis is silver 2 btw lol","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T15:11:09.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you first start ranked you get a provisional MMR of 1200, which is around silver 3. As you win or lose your 10 placement matches your MMR goes up or down accordingly. What this means is that silver games will always be filled with people who are actually bronze AND smurfs who are actually plat/diamond but haven't been placed properly yet, since silver ELO is the ELO where placements matches take place. \n\nIt sucks, but there's no way around, it's just something silver players have to deal with as long as they stay in that ELO.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-04-09T15:06:02.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because riot made it impossible to drop to bronze 5 unless you're actively trying to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2017-04-09T14:33:50.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New accounts get placed really high for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-04-09T15:05:53.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a bonus MMR gain for the first 50 ranked games you play in an account.

It's hard to say anything without looking at the account in question, but it's perfect possible to do really well on your placements and then land on gold 5, then start tilting for some reason or other (or move away to a place with higher ping, etc), then slowly go down. If someone is silver 5 with that winrate, it's possible they still havent been demoted to their new proper ELO, or that they've already in it but the winrate haven't caught up yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-04-09T14:37:11.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see he played last year and was also silver 5?
