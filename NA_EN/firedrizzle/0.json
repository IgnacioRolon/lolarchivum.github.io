I wont confuse my teammates through tapping w automatically now. Pinging for assistance at my team near an inhib for example, when I want them to back instead of overstay does give the wrong message. I dont know what i've done but it worked so far. I tried setting my controls to default before and that didnt fix this???????? \n\nAnyway thank you, have a good day{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"FireDrizzle","date":"2017-03-09T20:54:26.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhhh... v not w sorry.
