Then they end. How do I carry this? I was winning too many matches, now matchmaking has decided I dont get to win anymore. Every match today a total shitshow. My teams consistently faff around when I ping for infernal drake we can take with no opposition, but no, they get kills afterwards or we dont get to start and they end up taking. I have a retarded Zed report call me for taking a kill when he was about 5% hp! I did more damage as support than him.","replies":[{"poster":"Tonkuhz","date":"2017-04-01T17:15:23.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHATS THE WORD OF THE DAY? ---------------URFF------------------","replies":[]}]}
