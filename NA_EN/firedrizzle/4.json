I can’t come on shear to read the posts without finding some stupid joke about rams, fuzzy farm animals, and things that headbutt/charge. Not to mention they’re always so forced, most authors are probably sheepish afterwards. I’m not usually one to make terrible jokes either, but these jokes just break themselves as soon as they get posted. All the jokes do Is make people realize that all pressing R on that bearded goat does is summon Hornnibal Vector, the scariest iron horned beast to manifest on Runeterra. I think we should stop the bad ornn jokes while he’s still brittle. I shall take my molten chocolate cake and leave now.","replies":[]}]}
