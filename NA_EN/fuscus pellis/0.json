(My opinions included)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment, I've been binging on HotS the past couple of days, I've reached level 9 (almost 10) and have a couple heroes at level 4 to unlock all of their skills.\r\n\r\nSo far I think it's an *okay* game. But I have a few **HUGE** gripes with it.\r\n\r\nThe game is incredibly snowball driven. Once you get behind it becomes the worst experience ever.\r\n\r\nTo break down my understanding of the game to give you an idea, in case you don't have a clue about HotS, this is how I think you should be playing the game.\r\n\r\nFirst, you split up into lanes so that you don't lose XP and begin farming for XP.\r\nSecond, when the map objective (there's a bunch) is active. Drop what you're doing and work on the objective.\r\nThird, after farming up start grouping for jungle camps to push a lane extremely hard.\r\nDestroy the base GG.\r\n\r\nObviously during all of that you should be getting kills and counter pushing their siege monsters and clearing minion waves.\r\n\r\nIn theory this sounds all fun and dandy but here's how most of my matches go. (Note, this has gone either way but I'll be using the example of my team being behind, whilst the enemy is ahead)\r\n\r\nEnemy team grabs first blood, usually because of some scrub not knowing what they're doing.\r\nEnemy team is now ahead in XP and starts leveling up quicker.\r\nEnemy team brute forces objective, since my team is overall 1 level behind they try to fight over the objective but lose because being 1 level behind fucks you over.\r\nEnemy team groups up and does the 3 things I've listed above keeping a consistent 3 level lead.\r\nAlly team, and myself, can now never do any map objectives, camps, or siege objectives because the enemy team snowballed.\r\nEnemy team wins GG.\r\n\r\nThis game is extremely overbearing when behind, since it's way more objective focused then League of Legends being behind means no chance at objectives meaning a slow death.\r\n\r\nThankfully matches only last 20-25 minutes. But when you're trying to level up your favorite hero it becomes a slow boring process because winnings nags you 2 hero levels, while losing gives you a small chunk.\r\n\r\nTo sum everything up, team levels are probably the worst idea I've ever experienced. Games are not fun, even when winning, because there's no threat of losing unless you literally throw the game. (which is a challenge, play an assassin and 2v1 people because you're level 12 and they're 10)\r\n\r\nI believe they should either split up the levels, or make it so that being behind 1-3 levels isn't the end of the game.\r\n\r\nINB4 \"Post on the HotS forums scrublord\"!\r\n\r\nI've come to this forum because I wanted to know you're opinions, summoners, not people who play the game non-stop and flip shit on saying such heathenish things about their game.\r\n\r\n{{champion:29}}","replies":[]}
