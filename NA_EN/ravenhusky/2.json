Because when a good portion of the feedback in the main PBE thread says \"Make it legendary,\" [even the top post of the thread wants the skin to be legendary](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/XOpyBTOy-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-star-guardian-lux?show=nested&comment=0005), you know that you&#039;ve done something right, but at the same time, fallen short of player expectations as well, because my excitement for the skin is getting drowned out by my disappointment for what could have been.\n\nThe biggest thing that people have wanted being a new voiceover. Being one of the older champs in the game, she doesn&#039;t have as many lines as most of the newer champions, and even older, visually updated champions are seeing expanded voiceovers as well. Without a visual update in the near future, that likely wouldn&#039;t happen for Lux any time soon,  and SG Lux is the best opportunity to get an expanded VO, and an opportunity that is seriously being missed. Just being able to interact with her fellow Demacians, as well as her close friends like Ezreal, would be cool, and in the magical girl spirit of the skin, it would be awesome if Lux would directly address her enemies, as well as have a couple lines for Leona and Diana about the sun, moon, and stars. [Carrie Keranen recently revealed herself as Lux&#039;s voice actress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHpEDaco-WA&t=36m51s), and it would be really awesome if she were to come back in and do the voicework for us.\n\nAlso Katey, [your response to my ask.fm question was also disappointing.](http://ask.fm/KateyKhaos/answer/126842851870) Back in 2013 during the fallout of the Steel Legion fiasco, [Morello defined \"The Skin\" as a skin that takes all the cool parts of a champion, and drives them home](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3040000&page=7), which I believe applies to Star Guardian. I know you&#039;re personally a fan of the Void Lux concept, but to me, as well as a lot of other Lux mains, Lux is cute, has a positive personality, is bright, colorful, magical,  and makes it very clear that she&#039;s going to melt your face off with a giant laser, and Star Guardian delivers on all of it. \n\nI know that there are other themes floating around out there that would also make for good 975/1350 tier skins, such as Void Lux for Halloween, Candy Cane Lux for Christmas, and Neon Lux as a random fun skin, but I don&#039;t really see any of them having the strong enough thematics needed to hit legendary status that Star Guardian has the potential to be, as I don&#039;t believe that there&#039;s anything that fits her better.\n\nAlso, the issue of timeframe comes in again, as since we had to wait over two years for Star Guardian, how long would we have to wait for a potentially legendary skin now that Lux has six skins, considering that other champions are in dire need of skins as well? And that&#039;s assuming a stronger theme can even be found.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-05-07T16:58:59.951+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"At this point, the skin is already done.

As I've mentioned, that doesn't mean that she's out of the running for a legendary skin or even an ultimate skin in the future. \n\nTaken from Morello's post - \n\n> *Let's look at Ezreal. In my mind, Pulsefire is \"the\" skin for Ezreal - it really enhances most of the cool things about Ezreal (including anime-inspired tech) and meets a lot of Ezreal player's expectations creatively - not just in quality. ... The Lux argument, I think, it really associated to \"all these skins are counter to the reasons we like Lux, and none of them support the fantasy.\" Not all skins do, but at least one skin needs to just nail it and fulfill that primary need.*\n\nPulsefire Ezreal is an ultimate skin, as opposed to a legendary, however, I do think regardless of the skin tier, a skin should enhance at least some of the cool things about a champion. I agree that a lot of the military Lux skins didn't bring out some of the cooler aspects of her.\n\n>I know you're personally a fan of the Void Lux concept, but to me, as well as a lot of other Lux mains, Lux is cute, has a positive personality, is bright, colorful, magical, and makes it very clear that she's going to melt your face off with a giant laser, and Star Guardian delivers on all of it.\n\nI am! I think it's a cool twist on her personality, and I think Star Guardian Lux really hits the nail on the head when it comes to portraying Lux's bubbly nature.

Some champions have waiting even longer for a skin, and there's various reasons for it. Taric is a good example of this, but he's in the middle of a rework, so we'd like to wait until he gets his new look before giving him a skin. We've been pushing out more skins than ever, and have been hitting a lot of the champions who haven't seen a skin in a while - such as Akali and Galio.","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2015-05-11T23:04:05.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gg3ToPEe,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-11T18:11:55.295+0000)\n>\n> Hey RavenHusky, \n> \n> Sorry for the delayed reply. \n> \n> First off, I'm sorry to hear about your disappointment in Star Guardian Lux not being a legendary skin.

It's just that when you get so invested in seeing a good skin actually come out for her, I kind of need to make sure that it is done right, and while not making it legendary was still a missed opportunity, it's still an awesome skin.\n\n> Taken from Morello's post - \n> \n> Pulsefire Ezreal is an ultimate skin, as opposed to a legendary, however, I do think regardless of the skin tier, a skin should enhance at least some of the cool things about a champion.

Keep in mind, that my opinion in no way determines the next thematic for any skin - it's a team effort. ^-^ \n\nBack then, Morello used Pulsefire Ezreal for sake of example because that was the best skin that he had at the time in order to compare it to Lux's skin situation at the time, which was less about skin tiers, and more about \"does this skin fit the champion,\" which Lux didn't have at the time. Now that Star Guardian is a thing, it will most likely be The Skin for Lux for a lot of people because it's the only one that really embodies what she really is.\n\nAs for the theme of whatever legendary skin Lux happens to get, people have wanted a Sailor Moon themed skin for a very long time, even before Steel Legion was a thing, and while I know that there is plenty of opportunity for skins down the line (I saw the Ravenborn Lux concept art on Elohell.net and DeviantArt, Riot Pls), I still believe that using her best obvious skin theme on a 1350 skin was a mistake. Maybe there's a theme that fits her better, but right now, I'm not seeing it. I would have loved something on Super Galaxy Rumble levels of awesome being an anime skin, because at that point, the only thing missing would be the voiceover and some extra animations.\n\n> \n> Two years is a fairly substantial amount of time to wait for a skin, and if you're waiting for a new skin for your favorite champion, it can certainly seem like forever.

One of the big things about Steel Legion besides being military was that as her fifth skin, we knew that it would be forever before Lux got another shot at a skin that really fit her, which at that point, Morello came out and said that he had wanted to get another skin expedited for her, which clearly didn't happen as he had moved on from the skin team some time after that, and that is kind of where our frustrations in not seeing a skin in over two years come from.\n\nEither way, you guys did an awesome job on Star Guardian Lux, even if it is not legendary, and I'm looking forward to climbing the solo queue ladder with it.\n\nIn other news, PAX Prime tickets are now a thing, and I'm thinking about cosplaying as Spellthief Lux (as a guy, it's a lot easier to do Spellthief than any of her other skins), Don't know if it's going to happen, but I'm thinking about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CosmicWaters","date":"2015-05-11T18:41:32.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I was really disappointed as well in the fact that this was 1950, Star Guardian Lux as like final boss viegar would be like a million times better","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2015-05-11T21:47:33.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean 1350?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magicsparkle","date":"2015-05-07T17:08:09.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OMG wait if they add this.... i will wait XDXDXD\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pjyVjg1.gif","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2015-05-07T17:09:36.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"SG Lux's recall animation is already an abbreviated version of Sailor Moon's season one transformation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magicsparkle","date":"2015-05-07T15:54:15.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No, just giveme the skin now!!!!!......idc about the voice whatever... i want the skin naaaaw... no more waiiitt!!!","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2015-05-07T16:25:17.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"We've already waited this long, What's a little while longer if it means that the skin would be that much better?","replies":[{"poster":"Magicsparkle","date":"2015-05-07T16:50:03.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RavenHusky,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gg3ToPEe,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-05-07T16:25:17.436+0000)\n>\n> We've already waited this long, What's a little while longer if it means that the skin would be that much better?\n\nthat much better? is just a voice....that idc for....so no, not worth the wait......\n\nThrowing Money At The Screen\nThrowing Money At The Screen\nThrowing Money At The Screen\nThrowing Money At The Screen\n\nGive it to meee nawwwwwwwwwwww","replies":[{"poster":"RavenHusky","date":"2015-05-07T16:52:23.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't just be the voice, they'd have to add a lot more unique animations to it as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Magicsparkle","date":"2015-05-07T16:56:51.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RavenHusky,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=gg3ToPEe,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-07T16:52:23.416+0000)\n>\n> It wouldn't just be the voice, they'd have to add a lot more unique animations to it as well.\n\nWell if they add more stuffs... maybe is worth the wait......just maybee.......... if the new stuffs are really nice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vuux","date":"2015-05-15T03:27:00.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I'm simply happy that Lux is finally getting a themed skin that suits her personality.

Just try not to let your expectation for \"What it could of been.\" throw a sour note in something we should all be celebrating. There are so many other champions out there that are in desperate need for a good skin as well, some even more so than Lux. We were lucky that the team did acknowledge our disappointment in Steel Legion, and while it did take a while for this skin to come out, I'm sure that had they not thought it was an issue, we'd still be tapping our feet impatiently along with some of the other players waiting on skins for their champs (Like Zac.)\n\nThe Lux fan community has already taken on a bad wrap for being \"ungrateful\" in the eyes of other players, which to some extent I could understand.
