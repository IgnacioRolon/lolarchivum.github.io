Just queued up for my plat promo game and immediately got a bugsplat upon launch. Then relaunching states I have corrupeted files than need to be fixed (wouldn't launch without it). Long story short I got a loss for the game, due to a remake decision. While this isn't the hugest deal in the world it is not super fair seeing as I just patched the client before that game. Anyway I was hoping there would be potential for some dialogue or some sort of rectifying salve to rub all over my burns.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\nCheers and have a great one.\r\n\r\n-Skuttles","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T20:42:26.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks that happened during your promo game, and I hope that everything has worked out for you since then.  Leaves and remakes will treat every player equally even if it was not intentionally because they cause other players a negative experience.  I'd personally recommend playing a few normal games, even just to warm up, just in case the game files were not updated properly.  Let me know if you still have any issues with the crash, and I'd be happy to help.","replies":[]}]}
