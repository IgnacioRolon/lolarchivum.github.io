But props to you mate.\n\nAs a jungle main I would say a lot of this is fluid and subjective. The jungler really does need his camps, especially gromps for the tanks after cinderhulk/5.5 patch. As for red buff, unless the jungler is literally carrying the game the buff usually goes to the adc right as the laning phase is starting to end. Enemy red buff is ALWAYS up for grabs unless it's a lvl 1 invade.\n\nTaxing the lane is weird to me. I still don't believe in it much as a jungler. It's one thing to last hit while a solo laner is backing, but you'll find that taxing really comes down to the individual views of the jungler each time.\n\nAs for pushing the lane, I always think in solo queue it's a good idea to push the lane if you 2-0 the enemy bot lane. More global gold and more control over dragon. \n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2015-03-22T11:08:06.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On I usually take cs from the lane if the laner would miss it, or when we want to push it onto the tower, and sometimes I spam some skills on Zac to regain some health.

They get kill gold. i get a minion or 3 for setting up your kill. if the creep wave is somewhere in the middle and you die as adc, i leave the wave to the support an be on my way.\n\nbecause the support has no major lane shoving potential and without the adc, they dont need to worry about feeding the adc while they respawn nor about pushing the lane too far. it helps them much more to be left the lane than for you to take it in tax even though you opened up a trade instead of a gank.\n\nso for #3.

Some junglers really need/love having red buff for themselves, so they can actually use it better than the ADC in most cases, so they can chase better. Usually the jungler will take red buff for himself consistently until the teamfights start becoming really heavy, and people group more. In a teamfight situation the ADC usually uses the red buff better. So once people start grouping, you can generally start asking for red buff. If you can get to the enemy's red buff safely? The ADC should take it, because the jungler can take their own red buff.\n\nAs for pushing lanes/towers with junglers, certain junglers do it better than others. People like Xin, Jarvan, Vi, and Master Yi are extremely good at taking towers, so if you're jungler is one of them, and you get a double kill bot lane, ask them to help push tower, especially if dragon is down. If dragon is up you should do that instead of course, but if it's down, take the tower. Some junglers, especially tanky junglers aren't as good at taking towers, Zax, Nautilus, Sejuani, they aren't strong tower pushers, so unless the tower is already at less than 50% or so HP, then it might be better to just invade their jungle some, or even 3-man roam mid, try to get a kill there, and maybe take mid turret with 4 people.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-03-21T18:04:11.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes.

I except people to be able to hold their lanes and do it well. I also expect them not to overextend into the enemy turrets so that the enemy jg can gank them.

Coming from somebody who constantly plays jungle (and riding a certain scarecrow that gives free wins) these would be my thoughts on what you said:\n\nAbout taxing, I only do that if I didn't get the kill and even then I take like maybe 1 or two CS (I forget a lot).  It is extremely beneficial to have your jungler help push the wave though so if they get CS while doing that they probably aren't there for the XP or gold (more so to deny the enemy XP and gold).  Turrets are also very good to get if you can kill it early as it massively increases your dragon control and global gold.\n\nWith red buff I'll give any red buff after the 2nd red to my ADC (so long as they aren't doing horribly).  I like the first two usually because it enhances clear speeds, HP regen, and the slow on-hit is great for ganks.  Afterward if the ADC needs it (or I think they do) then I'll ping them if they are within a reasonable distance.  Its easier to do this on the blue side than red side.\n\nWith jungle camps... I'd prefer it if people don't take them.  Unless I'm ahead, then my farm from the jungle means a lot to me (I don't care much if you take Gromp or Krugs if I start at the top side at the very beginning since they will be up again by the time I get to farming around there) and it will be a large chunk of my gold and XP income.  I can understand if you need like one camp to finish an item but taking more than one camp when there is a minion wave nearby is just kind of selfish in my opinion.\n\nLastly (as a comment to my own personal experience) I find that the best way to help make bot laners understand this (and any laners in general), I just need to be polite and straight-forward toward them.  Jungle's a role about getting your team to trust you more than anything, you carry your teammates so that later they can carry you.  If you end up pissing everyone on your team off cause somebody stole one or two jungle camps then you will likely lose due to break down of communication.  Likewise, if your laners get mad because you take a few CS while pushing the wave for them (or even rushing the turret) then a similar thing will happen and nothing will get accomplished.\n\nTL;DR When everyone cooperates instead of getting mad due to misunderstanding, you're going to get more accomplished with less sacrifices.","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-03-22T04:10:52.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Full agreement on that communication thing!\n\nAlso helps to keep a level head and not get too angry at your team. \n\nand this may just be a girl thing but.. state your feelings sincerely and sometimes people listen and surprise you. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-03-21T17:46:45.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i jungle i dont mind if they take some of the minor camps, just dont take my blue/red without asking...that hurts me as a jungler.

Its fine for anyone to take a small camp here and there, no biggy..but from a pure math perspective it equates to less gold for the team. Jungle items give them an extra like 30gold for large monster kill and that includes the scuttle crab. so while you may need it, and its ok if you do, in the end the jungler will gain so much more for it.\n\nAs another aside i have been working on a new jungle style, i started with shyvanna and i think it may be possible to do it with reksai or any other energy/manaless jungler.\n\nJungle Support:\n\nwith shyvanna i am able to tank the blue, give away my first blue, run straight to red and give away my first red...and then proceed to hit level 3 back safely and continue gifting every buff i can get people to take..for some reason when i do this they dont want them..go figure. With shyvanna insane point and click power farming its easy for me to do this and then counter jungle for buffs of my own.\n\nIn the end the only problem i see is that...its shyvanna :( her ganks arent very good and doesnt add too much to the team imo","replies":[{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-03-21T18:11:21.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg\n \nI wanted to try that kind of support jungle before.

Because each camp gives a buff when smited, each jungler wants something different. I'll roll over each then talk about who likes them for reference.\n\nKrugs: every 6 AAs against monsters will stun for 1.5 seconds. Super useful for champs like {{champion:11}}, {{champion:19}}, and {{champion:77}}  who hardfarm the jungle early, though they don't get much use from this later one. This is probably the best camp to take once laning is over, as the buff isn't useful in fights.\n\nRaptors: Single use oracles for spotting out a ward. DO NOT TAKE THIS WITHOUT ASKING!!! This gives us assistance while ganking, so they can spot wards, helps later on for cleaning out wards, and is always a useful buff. PLEASE LET US KEEP THIS, IT HELPS THE TEAM SO MUCH!!\n\nWolves: Releases a little spirit into the jungle that gives vision and chases enemies. This one is fairly ok to take, though the free ward is super nice to help spot out when enemies are invading. I'd say don't take if the enemy might invade, more forgivable a take if you're controlling the enemy and map well.\n\nGromp: Deals a DoT effect to all enemies that attack the champion. Late game this can get above 200 damage. If you have a tank jungler, NEVER TAKE THIS FROM THEM. People like {{champion:33}} get so much damage off of this that they try to have that up as much as possible. If your jungler is something like {{champion:11}}, then it's much more ok to take his because he doesn't play to take much damage, and doesn't really benefit from the DoT.\n\nAll in all, making sure you know the buffs can really help you make informed decisions on what to take if you have to take something (say 100 gold off of IE). Since I'm a {{champion:33}} main, I rarely clear my jungle, instead getting most of my gold off of ganks. I'm typically giving away blues from 2 onward, and I keep my reds for ganks until we start teamfighting where adc uses it best (though I never give buffs away to someone who I think will just die and give it away without getting good usage). I love my gromps and raptors, and the other two are useful but expendable.

If you want your jungler to stay for tower, target ping the tower.  A lot of laners get upset when you push their lane, even if it's to take tower, so many junglers have learned not to push without the laner's permission (even if they think it would be helpful, it's not helpful if it starts your team fighting each other and not cooperating).","replies":[{"poster":"DorkunedAuras","date":"2015-03-22T17:43:36.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(again, this perspective is coming from a {{champion:33}} main)\n\nAfter a solid top gank, where the enemy dies, I almost always push out the lane and try to take the tower.

I also need all the gold I can get, as my jungle clear is hardly fast or good.\n\nIn Mid with a comparable gank, I usually just clear out and let the laner take the farm, as they're gonna carry us later, only going after the tower if it's low or they ping it.\n\nIn bot, I do the same thing, clearing out unless there's a good reason to go after the turret. \n\nIn any lane, if my laner is backing after the gank, I do take the wave to the tower to deny the enemy farm, unless I know my laner will TP right back. \n\nAgain, there is no universal rule for this kind of thing, just play it on a case by case basis.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-03-22T15:18:56.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh.
