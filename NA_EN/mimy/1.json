Ezreal being \"forgiving\" doesn't make him \"easy\", at least in the highest levels of play.\n\nYou say the only consequence is his DPS lacking?\n\nOh... so the only consequence is being incapable of properly doing his job as an ADC. \n\nHave you ever wondered why Ezreal, even when he is considered one of the best ADCs, almost always hovers around a fairly low, 49-50% win rate?\n\nThere is a world of difference in effectiveness between a noob Ezreal and one who has mastered the champion.\n\nTeemo's skill floor is also pretty low, since it is not hard to take Teemo to lane and beat people up effectively, but to effectively use his kit to pressure the map and make use of his weirdly versatile build options effectively require more competence than just taking him to lane and beating the shit out of Tryndamere.\n\nKindred is ranked as difficult because she is:\n\nA. a squishy ADC jungler who has trouble clearing safely for new players, as opposed to someone like Xin Zhao or Warwick who remain at near full health for their entire clear.\n\nB.

Has to scout out her targets much more thoughtfully than most other junglers, since as said before she has to win early to scale into late.\n\nDo I have any problems playing Kindred? Not really no, but then I can pick up almost any champion in the game and do reasonably well (I am awful at Lee Sin though, truly dog shit).\n\nBut see, these rankings are for less experienced players.\n\nIt's why Rumble has such a high difficulty rating on the current client, despite being shit baby easy to play.

I mean, he's dog shit, but statistically he is one of the least risky champs in the game. And has been for a long time.\n\nLet me make this easy for you, since I see you are having some trouble.\n\nIs there any potential for Jayce to miss his Q if the enemy is in range. Yes, or no?\n\nIs there any potential for Garen to miss his Q if the enemy is in range. Yes, or no?\n\nThis doesn't count instances like the target being eaten by Tahm or using Zhonya's, it has to be purely a matter of the player of Jayce or Garen's mechanical skill.\n\nLook, I get that you're a little butthurt that people (correctly) think Jayce is harder than Garen, but fact of the matter is... well, he is. He's not particularly hard, but he is harder than Garen. \n\nAlmost every champion is.\n\n\"Versatility makes him easier to play\" lol shut the fuck up.\n\nVolibear can do one thing (run at you and flip you), and is balanced around being able to do that one thing. He's usually at least a decent jungle pick in solo queue. Does his complete lack of versatility make him hard to play?\n\nNo.\n\nHe might actually be the easiest champion in the game.\n\nGaren is similar.\n\nWhat you are saying is tantamount to claiming that the versatility of a sword makes wielding it easier than wielding the much more limited spear or axe.\n\nHistorically we know this to be false.\n\nAlso, why do you continue to ignore that the difficulty ratings are for inexperienced players?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-11-07T21:22:45.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope this has data backing it up because Ezreal seems weird as a 1 bar to me when compared to Tristana and Ashe and Caitlyn.
