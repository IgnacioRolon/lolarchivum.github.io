I want to download it without all of the other sound effects on top of it, no matter how much I love the meeps. Any idea if/when this will be available as a stand-alone piece of music? If not, does anyone know how to remove the sound effects so it's just pure music. It's...yeah. Spine tingling.\r\n\r\n(Also, the horn itself: it sounds like a tuba or bass trombone but it has too much of a woodwind feel early on. Then again, even the most amazing contrabassoon isn't going to get that sort of sound.  I'm guessing it's a conglomerate?)","replies":[{"poster":"Scherzo","date":"2015-03-27T18:13:48.547+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your compliments! We'll try to get a score-only version uploaded to our Soundcloud page soon. (Edit) - [here's](https://soundcloud.com/leagueoflegends/bard-mountain-score) the link: \n\nYou guessed right, the instrument sound at the end is indeed a mix of different elements. We combined some pitched-down recordings of a trombone in a parking garage with a bass clarinet, run through various saturation and distortion plugins. The clarinetist is actually using an unusual technique where he's playing long tones in such a way that the upper harmonics actually come through as loud, if not louder, than the fundamental tone he's playing. This gives the impression that he's producing more than one note at the same time, but with a much different sound than you'd get if you had two players using normal technique. Definitely not something we could have achieved just by pulling up a bass clarinet patch in our sequencing program!","replies":[{"poster":"Oh Crab","date":"2015-06-24T16:10:54.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know its been a while, but i do have a request. I'm currently brought together a little team of musicians. We do have a singer too. We decided to play \"The curse of the sad mummy\" at our next school concert. The thing is that although there are fanwritten sheets for this piece, there are currently no sheets for violin cello and drums. So i'm kinda begging you if you were so kind to send me the full score for all the instruments in this piece. Because we do want to play it as good as possible. So please release a \"official score\" and me and a hell of alot off people will be thankful.

This will be on repeat when I am studying. \n\nI love the trombonist in the parking garage. That will go up there with my favorite sound effect, the Reaper effect from ME that was made by putting a mic in a bear-proof trash can. I've also never heard a bass clarinet do anything like that and I've played with a fair number; really fascinating sound. Any reason for bass clarinet vs. contrabass vs. bassoon/contrabassoon? I'm an oboe player so I have a love of double reeds.  How long did it take to decide on how that should sound? I remember the 30+ takes to get Amumu's cello right. Was this just as crazy?\n\nI'd like to close with another piece of praise. I love the little evil laugh in Shako's violin solo. What a fun composition overall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipi99","date":"2015-03-28T03:51:14.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance that you could used upload the meep whisphers for download?
