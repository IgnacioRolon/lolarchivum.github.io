There are some cases where champions fit better for a certain thematic, so they'll be chosen over another (this is usually for Snowdown or the Harrowing). \n\nSince it's been less than a year since his last skin, it'll be a little while until he receives another. Most champions wait a year plus (sometimes longer D:). \n\nThat said, Soul Reaver Aatrox could be pretty cool, and I can keep that idea stored for when it's time to talk about the next skin for him! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-05-01T13:36:47.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then there's Zac....","replies":[{"poster":"Nightmist Dark","date":"2015-05-01T13:44:47.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1421028002814/caz.jpg\nStorm Zac","replies":[{"poster":"Nucleophilic atk","date":"2015-05-01T13:55:48.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many cool skin ideas for him lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-08-19T05:44:16.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"soo we getting those skins any time soon or does some one have to use him in worlds finals and win","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightmist Dark","date":"2015-05-01T13:34:30.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can we talk about his next skin now :3?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightmist Dark","date":"2015-04-22T19:09:39.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i want to buy a new skin for aatrox that isn't mecha, maybe  a darker themed one. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"G01fanThomas","date":"2015-08-15T01:59:28.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you so so thank you very much :)","replies":[{"poster":"Blade of Justic","date":"2015-08-15T02:00:55.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=lilozang454,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=94PiEZAE,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-15T01:59:28.126+0000)\n>\n> I agree with you so so thank you very much :)\n\nYou're a necromancer.","replies":[]}]}]}
