So the global bit is overstated. It has some bounds. But Flash alone is not likely to get a champion out of the range.  Also if you do go beyond that tether range, the mark will disappear so your main statement remains really good advice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mistress Shyvana","date":"2016-08-17T00:50:33.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also how many Teemo's is 700 units?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-08-17T01:26:00.367+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"700...
