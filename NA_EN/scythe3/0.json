Why should a whole team suffer because someone got a lane it can not play, and think if they lose lane so the whole team loses the match. It&#039;s not fair I&#039;ve been autofill many times so my team lost and it has many others. I would rather wait 10 minutes longer and getting the lane I want, because riot&#039;s argument to have autofill is because it will be faster to get a match so you do not have to wait a long time. I see no problem waiting 10 min for a game that I can enjoy and have fun on the lane I like.","replies":[{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2018-03-12T20:21:23.567+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing autofill would be nice, but that would cause 10-20 minute Queue times and prevent some people from learning roles they currently can't play. There's so many people who hate autofill simply because THEY CANNOT play the filled role and if they're playing ranked then that's a huge problem on their part.\n\nriot would rather die before allowing those Queue times so good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Scythe3","date":"2018-03-13T15:25:47.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you are right but I mostly think about ranked ques beacuse in ranked you should not train new roles and lanes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-03-12T20:25:01.493+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you considered i don't know.\nLEARNING THE BASICS OF EVERY LANE AND HAVE 2-3 CHAMPIONS FOR THE OFF LANES YOU CAN'T PLAY?\nor just main support, like me and never get auto filled","replies":[{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-03-13T09:47:18.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in the days of pickorder everyone needed to learn a bit about every role, in fact: there was more ppl \"autofilled\" with the old system than with the current one, I remember that being last pick in ranked was majority of the time being relegated to play supp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kythers","date":"2018-03-13T15:32:10.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"put it as an option for faster queue pops\n\noh wait we already have this, it's called putting fill secondary\n\nwow we could actually just remove Autofill and the problem would sort itself out\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Scythe3","date":"2018-03-13T20:21:18.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you are right #TheMoreYouKnow","replies":[]}]}]}
