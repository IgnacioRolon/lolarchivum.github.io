If it was just an item temporarily usable during the event, I would have loved to have been told that before buying it. If this problem is the result of a bug, I would love to have the ward skin re-enabled on my account.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-12T03:28:49.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been seeing a lot of players who aren't able to find that ward anymore, but no worries! Even though you can't find it on your account right now I am able to see it on our end, and it seems like this bug is affecting everyone. The devs should have it worked out, and that ward should pop back up when the next patch drops most likely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndreiZop","date":"2017-12-11T20:37:45.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same situation here","replies":[]}]}
