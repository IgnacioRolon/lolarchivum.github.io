You should see an exclamation mark icon on the top right of the boards to review your notification regarding that.  \n\nIt looks like you had a post that was in the wrong section of the boards.  Reviewing it, you may want to repost it on the [gameplay ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)boards.  It was previously posted in an area specifically for feedback on the boards itself.    I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2017-09-02T03:21:55.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou!\n\nIt looks like the notification you mention _was_ in fact sent to me, but it seems to have been marked as read, without my actually having read, or even seen the alert first.\n\nI can manually check these, now, where as i didn't know where to look before.\nThanks for the help.","replies":[]}]}]}
