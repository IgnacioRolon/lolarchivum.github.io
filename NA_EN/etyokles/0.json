I uninstalled LoL and downloaded it again, this time it worked and i went to the shop to buy blitzcrank and upon entering a match my game crashed and it says something about a zlibb.dll file so i uninstalled it again but this time theres no progress on the download except the download stopped at 76% and to my surprise the download was downloading backwards it became 69% then it became 73% then the client crashed.
