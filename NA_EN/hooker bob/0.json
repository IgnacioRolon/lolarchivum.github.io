I didn't make too much of it but when i enter it i gave me a fresh account with nothing on it. Now my account is gone and i cant get back into it for some reason. I put in my username and password for my main account and it brings me to this empty one. I've spent so... much money on this game and have every champion on this account so i really want it back. If anyone can tell me what to do, it would be a great help. Ive tried account recover and password reset but it never worked and i really think i need help from someone at riot games PLEASE HELP ME!","replies":[{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-01-12T04:24:12.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you just logged in to an old account you have.

We don't reset accounts for any reason, so this shouldn't be something that happened. I recommend using our [**Username Recovery Page**](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/na/en/forgot-username) to ensure you're logging into the correct account~ ^.^\n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[]}]}
