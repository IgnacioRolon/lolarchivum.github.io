I have been round league for 5 years, i am a HUGE board game fan, collector, and miniature painter.\r\n\r\nSeeing such a board game with League&#039;s artwork team pouring all of its love into every god damn piece in the game makes me super jealous that someone in house could have an idea such and this and your Family (Riot Games) backed you up 100% to make sure it happened just hurts man.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has been creating my own RPG system for 8 years its just cool to hear about someone having lots of love for board games and their company backing them up until it came true.\r\n\r\nGratz on not taking a short route and getting consulting, internal playtesting, but more importantly putting a lot of resources and love into the game so it isn&#039;t just some themed league game. Making it a completely new experience is such a big thing for me because i ensure every board game i purchase is something fresh, fun, and different.\r\n\r\nThanks Riot &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Catzpaw","date":"2016-09-21T03:57:26.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, no... \n\nThank YOU. \n\nYour passion is what enables us to do what we do day in day out.
