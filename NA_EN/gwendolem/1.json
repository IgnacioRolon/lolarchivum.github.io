I recently just purchased some other board games thinking there wan&#039;t going to be another one coming out any time soon.... i was sorely mistaken.\r\n\r\nI just wish to know if this is going to be a first come first serve sorta deal? Will there be a good amount in stock for months to come? Will it be reprinted if sold out? \r\n\r\nI want to make sure i can pick this up if not right away &lt;3 The game looks great, you guys rock!","replies":[{"poster":"Kades","date":"2016-09-19T20:25:01.630+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Gwendolem,\n\nIt _will_ be a first come/first serve distribution when we begin selling units in Mid-October.  We ordered 30k for our initial print run (which is pretty high in the world of board games) and the first half of that will be available in October.  The rest of wave 1 will arrive in December.\n\nIf the game does sell out and we still see a demand, we hope to make additional waves until everyone who wants a copy can get one.  We're also studying other regions closely to see if it makes sense making runs in different languages.","replies":[{"poster":"IS12e7212012c384","date":"2016-09-20T09:35:33.339+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please ensure each account can only buy 1 copy so that hoarders/touts won't be buying dozens/hundreds on release date in order to resell?
