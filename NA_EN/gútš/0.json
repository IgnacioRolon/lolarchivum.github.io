I had the Ribbon for years, and at the time the new honor system rolled out so I have no idea why I wouldn't have gotten it. Judging by the posts here it seems a few people got their icons late, but judging by those responses everything was supposed to have gone out by the 30th - so I'm bit concerned since it's a day later and I haven't gotten anything.\r\n\r\nAny help would be awesome - thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-31T15:03:52.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of icons and eligible players, so it's going to be a bit to distribute everything out.
