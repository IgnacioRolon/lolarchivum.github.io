It's entirely dependent on the opposing team's bot lane not being very bright to create multiple level and income advantages for his team.\n\nIt's not going to be fun for the adc, but if they keep a level head and play towards the strength of the strategy it can, and clearly does, work.\n\nThe strategy itself has been around for years, it's just never been effective or efficient. It is this season because many systemic changes to the meta have resulted in junglers being overly powerful and ganking to snowball lanes the only truly effective and efficient meta strategy. Simultaneously the bot lane roles have become much less efficient since games end sooner because of the snowbally meta and adcs rarely have an opportunity to hit late game effectiveness.\n\nThis makes pouring more resources into denying and disrupting the opposing jg at all costs more effective than it's ever been in the past, and a viable strategy for the first time.\n\nThere is a difference between what he does and what a player like Trick2g does though, as Trick plays in an exclusively selfish and non team oriented style. Take the Draw actually plays a style that is dependent on him being a team player and assisting every player on the team and every part of the map.

Here is why:\n\n1) Teemo's E prices the gold passive for {{item:3092}}. He also gets more vision from this. This helps prevents ganks.\n\n2) The best defense against an ADC is a blind. ADC goes bot lane. Kind of not hard to figure out why this is good. His Q does blind. You want to max this first.\n\n3) He can gank IN LANE. I find myself in unorthodox spots in lane, not even in bushes, when I camo. Blind out of camo and they will run.\n\n4) Building  {{item:2045}} adds even more vision. Now you have 5 things of vision.\n\n6) Teemo shrooms add even more vision and prevent jungle and other lanes from going to your lane easily because of the slow. Also, 45% CDR on Teemo is nothing to laugh at. This isn't aram where your shrooms are predictable. You will force a competent enemy team to grab {{item:3364}} \n\n7) {{item:3050}} helps ADC and Teemo. It gives teemo CDR. It also gives Teemo crit for his basics (minor for obvious reasons) and AP in bonus and charging. Since Teemo basics a lot, although AP, he still benefits from the critical boost.\n\n8) In a meta where jungle ganks a lot, Teemo isn't as bad as people think he is as support. He is defensive and aggressive.\n\n9) Since he can work as a support, IDGAF about what my team says. (Still go Soraka though if they knew I was going Teemo.)

Speaking as a support main, who is willing to experiment, it seems that there is the off-meta pick and off-off-meta pick.  \n\nFor example, Galio support is an example of the first type (not a popular champ for support but can do the support role pretty darned well - shield, ccs and movement speed boosts for the adc).  Even Heim, Veigar, Elise and Ahri can fit in this grouping.  (All of these have been used as support in diamond+ play in the last year effectively.)\n\nThen there is Teemo support as an example of the second type.  Not only is he not meta, but he has risks of ks and/or minion steal with little to no trade off in exchange for the weak protection for the adc (i.e., little to no: shields, enemy slows, enemy ccs).   Granted, the  effects of the Q and E are nice but they tend to be a bit more skill shot related and not directly benefiting the adc.  And let's not forget that the shrooms tend to pinch minions away from the carry.\n\nPlus, I hate to say it but usually when I get another position on the Rift, and I see a Teemo support on my team, I worry.  I rarely see support items used, little to no warding (often due to a lack of sightstone itemization) and little to no utility items.\n\nDespite this, I have no problem with a Teemo player in the support role - but if you do play him, then please play him as an actual support.  And please not in my ranked games. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Team Fat Amy","date":"2017-03-05T03:58:15.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if I'd agree with you, I'm afraid.  To me, a \"meta\" is defined by popularity, or champions that would be considered over-tuned (whether directly as a result of their kit or an item they would use as a core item arguably being too strong). Just because you play a champion that doesn't benefit from either of the above scenarios, does NOT mean they cannot be competitive at any given role.\n\nEvery champion has risks of ks or minion kill; but I'm not entirely sure why you base kill-power as an argument against a champion being played as support.  I would argue that Teemo is great bot-lane due to his blind, esp. vs. ADC's who have power built into AA empowerment (such as Draven & Vayne, etc). Also, where do you think shrooms are being placed? Any Teemo who puts shrooms in a middle of a lane are doing it wrong, in my opinion. When used properly, teemo shrooms can be used for some pretty amazing map & objective control. The meta currently favors more ranged ADCs (Varus, etc) so I could understand an argument such as this vs champion like Teemo, but not any of the reasons you noted.\n\nI don't have advice for your own perception of certain champions.  It sucks that there is a certain stigma in League that erects when player's choose champions in a given role, and that shouldn't be a dictator as to how the game will go.  Especially if the support is trying to communicate to the team and is comfortable with their pick. \n\nTo me, supporting is a state-of-mind, a build of items, a tool of utility, and is a style of play that allows for decision making, anticipation, prediction and ward-control to shine. Are certain champions better vs. certain picks? Yes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to, or flamed, for playing a champion that you (or anyone else) deems as \"off-off-meta\".\n\nNote: this post does not justify the behavior of any individual who purposely trolls, plays irresponsibly or cripples their teammates because of their unfavorable playstyle.  If you have a support who buys a sighstone, contributes to the teams utility and continues to play their best while playing an \"off-meta\" champion, don't complain and tilt the team with your stigmatized self-doubt.

He would sit in the lane and roam, just as most supports do, but instead of just roaming to gank, he would roam and counterjungle the enemy Jungler.\n\nHe won more games than he lost with it (in high elo no less), he showed Riot the full data including wards placed, gold earned/denied and outcomes of his matches, but they continued to ban him for \"Refusing to communicate\" and apparently \"Stealing other peoples roles\".\n\nIt is just incredibly suspicious that a manual audit was conducted on his account after he and his team demolishes Riot Phreak.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Legacy Hydralpha","date":"2017-03-04T17:41:25.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Puns of damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-03-04T16:31:21.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I played Rammus support recently, team praised me.\n\nFriend of mine named Ariel the Cruel plays Yorick support, he is praised too.\n\nMaybe you are just shit.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2017-03-06T07:24:20.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dominick Destine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bEVof8qy,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-03-04T16:31:21.580+0000)\n>\n> I played Rammus support recently, team praised me.\n> \n> Friend of mine named Ariel the Cruel plays Yorick support, he is praised too.\n> \n> Maybe you are just shit.\n\nI can see the Rammus support as working but that Yorick support sounds quite interesting.
