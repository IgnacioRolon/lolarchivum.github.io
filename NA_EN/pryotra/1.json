I'll give you my personal views on the pro's and con's of each.\nThresh.\nPro's: Thresh can be a brilliant play-maker providing you, a) have your team on your side and following up. b) have an aggressive adc who can go hard early. and c) can land those clutch hooks onto the enemy team's carry. His mid-game damage is very high for a support, due to his soul mechanics and the ap/auto attack damage it gives him (the latter from his Flay's passive(e)). The Box (r) is arguably one of the best support ultimates for an engage/all in comp and can also function as excellent peel for any carry getting attacked. Lastly, the Dark Passage (w) is one of the most clutch gank tools/save my trapped teammate tools in the game. Throw that lantern behind you and BOOM, suddenly the jungler is on top of the enemy adc from the tri bush.\nCon's: No sustain at all, for both you and your adc. So against a poke team that is nimble and can avoid your hooks, you're going to have some trouble. Also, his cool downs are fairly long in comparison to some of the other supports, so if you wiff that hook or misuse the lantern (w) then you're going to have to play passive for at least 10 seconds if not more, which can be a problem if the other team suddenly goes in. Also, especially in lower levels of play, if your team doesn't follow up you're done for. He's not like blitz where you take their carry and insert him into the middle of your team. Thresh is like Leona where you go all in, and if your team isnt with you you're done for. He has no major escape other then a flash, or a hook to a neutral monster (if you haven't just hooked to engage). Also, he is frequently banned in draft/ranked at mid/low elo play. I hear he isnt quite as perma-banned at the upper divisions.\n\nNami:\nPro's: Fairly well rounded and aggressive, but with the ability to play passive too. Her stun is surprisingly long and her heal is very useful if you use the bouncing mechanic well. Her attack steroid (e) can be a brilliant boost in any phase of the game, for both harass or for an all in. It also slows, so if you're trying to peel for your adc use it on yourself and then auto the enemy to slow them. Her ultimate is godly, having a MASSIVE range with a knockup, a slow, decent enough damage, and is comparable to the power of sona's creshendo, especially in the jungle. Her passive is secretly super useful also, even if it doesn't always feel like it. Spam spells on yourself or an ally to get them back into lane faster, or to run away/chase faster. \n\nCon's: The bubble/stun (q) animation is iffy where no matter how far you are casting it, it always has the same time in the air. This can be difficult for players unfamiliar to nami to get down, but once you get used to it, it doesn't seem as problematic. Nevertheless, the bubble animation is also rather slow and a good vayne,caitlyn,ez,ect. can dodge it (so can someone with tier two boots if they're smart). Her early heal on a single target is slightly lackluster for its mana cost and cooldown (rank one and two is where  this is a real problem), so you have to watch your early mana consumption. Lastly, she is squishy. Very squishy. Especially if you are running utility masteries/runes to deal with her mana problems early. \n\n\n\nI hope some of this helps in any way. Good luck with whoever you choose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sternbery","date":"2013-09-19T19:31:47.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami is my favorite support of all time.

Both champions bring a TON of utility making them insanely strong.  Nami has sustain through her heal which is something important to consider.  Thresh on the other hand allows ridiculous dives with his lantern that a heal wouldn't necessarily be able to accommodate.  Nami's bubble is an AoE stun, thresh has a single target stun and an aoe displacement.  Their ults both offer a slow but remember that skills are tuned around worst cases.  Thresh's  walls have pretty big single damage but the maximum damage output is hard to get with each wall only hitting one person.  It does have a bigger slow however.  Nami's ult is easier to hit on multiple people, does similar damage, slows for slightly less, but also knocks people up.  \n\nIn my mind this all boils down to:\nThresh is a lane bully.  His e empowered autos and beefiness allows him to abuse his lane opponents while his kit allows him to finish the kills with pulls and cc.\n\nNami is a zoning champ.  Her bubbles give her control over where opponents will go.  She can also poke with her e autos which also slow and can be used for allies and not just herself.  She provides more sustain for her lane allowing them to bounce back from trades quicker.  \n  \n\n\nFinally: if you're considering ranked, consider the ban rate of thresh is much higher than that of Nami.  She is a similar strong support but will be much more likely to be available for you to play in game.\n\nGood luck with the decision, deciding on new champions is a tough call every time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrus Blackmoon","date":"2013-09-20T00:12:47.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I enjoy Thresh, he is kind of on permaban status, so Nami would probably be your best bet to have an actual playable support. Both are great though, though your team needs to have some alternative initate aside from you, since you can't just wade in as Nami, and will most likely have to peel for your Carry at the same time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bakaultima","date":"2013-09-19T05:04:35.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a main support player i personally use nami over thresh you can actually build some ap into her and make her a decent mage her heal is pretty good the stun is a great escape device and her empower make you adc very strong her ult can break the other team off if you need to run or give your adc a great opening but she is very skill shot heavy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atapari","date":"2013-09-19T02:03:49.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that Thresh takes a lot more coordination, not just mechanically but within a larger team as well. In the heat of the moment, it's difficult to communicate whether you're going to pull, ult, or who should grab a lantern. If you are on voice chat, it's much easier to figure out that kind of thing, but for those of us without friends it gets frustrating when the wrong guy takes your carry's only escape.\n\nNami on the other hand I find is a much more reactionary support, which works better in a solo que environment. All her abilities can be used defensively, she can passively aid her partner, and trap enemies on the way in or out of a fight. With voice chat, you can play her aggressively, but if your carry is not communicating, you can also simply heal him, buff his autos, and wait for him to make a move. \n\nI enjoy both, but I feel like they're meant for different people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fishbeard","date":"2013-09-18T18:44:55.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh and Nami are my two favorite supports. They both offer tons of control, both in lane and in teamfights. \n\nLooking for a new ranked support, though, I'd go with Nami. Thresh is often banned and you won't have to fight for Nami like you would with Thresh. Nami also feels more reliable if your team is falling behind, where Thresh starts to feel less useful if your team starts losing or you fall way behind early on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freezman","date":"2013-09-18T18:43:55.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are both amazing at what they do.
