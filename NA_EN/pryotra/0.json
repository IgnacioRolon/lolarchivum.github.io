Don't know why, and it isn't 100% of the time, but 4/5 games of 5v5 Matchmade PVP games I get delayed into the game buy a pretty large margin.\r\n\r\nSo, firstly, let me explained \"delayed connection\". By that, I mean that after champ select, instead of the game beginning to load, it crashes once or twice before it connects. I have figured out that I simply can't load into the game while I have opponents loading into the game. Pretty weird. After it starts actually loading, however, the game runs more or less fine.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have tried a multitude of solutions, from connectivity solutions to graphics solutions. While generally I now have better FPS, I still have this problem. I have also noticed that when I restart my computer after one of these crashes, a system dump file bearing a league of legends title is getting cleared by CCleaner. This is odd, as previous to this I was playing without this issue. It started shortly after I got to silver, so I don't know what caused it.\r\n\r\nAny help would generally be appreciated. However, the general help in the wrenchmans toolbox doesn't seem to cover this.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-30T18:31:56.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pryotra,\n\nThe helper will receive some help!  Unfortunately, when there are issues with long load times during the Loading Screen, this can be one of two different reasons:  Either you have an unstable connection that is repeatedly disconnecting/re-connecting to the Game Server, causing it to take a while, or your computer is having a difficult time loading the game assets (due to low RAM, weak Graphics Card, etc, etc).\n\nThe best way to determine why this occurs is by reviewing logs, specifically the R3d Log.  This records exactly what is occurring when you attempt to load into the game.  Unfortunately, since you cannot have attachments in the reply comments, you will need to open a new ticket to Player Support, and make sure to attach the following logs:\n\n1) Please send your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22128450-League-of-Legends-Logs\n\n2) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list\n\n3) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n4) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n5) Dxdiag information: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20100477-obtaining-a-direct-x-diagnostic-or-dxdiag","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-09-30T20:23:48.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, though I managed to narrow it down to a connection issue. \n\nAbout a day ago, I tried WTFast, due to hearing it would help with connection issues. Considering it wouldn't even let me connect until the other team has connected, I thought it would at least rule it out, but when I tried it the problem vanished. I have been able to access games with no problems while using it. \n\nHowever, I am but a poor college kid, and don't like the idea of having to pay for a service that will allow me to play a single free to play game. With this in mind, this is a temporary solution. I need to figure out what is causing my issue and actually fix it, not use a service get bypass the problem.\n\nSo, considering that I have narrowed it down to a network problem, I have a few questions:\n\n* What info out of the above is relevent and should be included?\n* Should I disable CCleaner from auto cleaning so that I can nab the dump file if I manage to recreate the issue?\n* Do you have any further steps to try before sending a ticket now that I have narrowed it down to a connection issue?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-10-01T23:13:05.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...at this point, I would still just send in the following information (as there cannot be much else done ahead of time until we know for sure by reviewing logs):\n\n1) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list\n\n4) Please send your most recent r3d log where you experienced the problem (You'll notice that the file name starts with the date/time and ends with r3dlog.txt): https://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22128450-League-of-Legends-Logs","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-10-09T20:51:14.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I think I figured out the problem thanks to that network anlysis\n\nEssentially, I had a DNS server that I was using for security reasons, but I found out it was causing issues. Lots of issues. When I switched to google's DNS servers, I found a dramatic change in connectivity, load times, and general ping fluctuation.\n\nOnly reason I found it was due to the network analysis. Thanks so much for that link, my whole Internet experience is better!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
