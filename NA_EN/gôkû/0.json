But it's one at a time, which may not be a problem for some people who maybe didn't get that many but I still have like 113 cores left and I'd rather not go through the process of disenchanting each and every one of them especially since my client is as slow as molasses. I was wondering if some from 'upstairs' could just take them off my account and just give me 226 essence. If not then I guess I'll just lose the cores and essence which I'd rather not, but as you can tell from me making this it's not the end of the world if I lose them because I'm not worried enough to go through and disenchant all of them! Any responses from the higher-ups would be coolio! &lt;3 Thanks in advance.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-01T01:27:44.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what?
