Sometimes I&#039;d get Youmuu&#039;s into a second Brutalizer to max out my CDR and make use of all the flat armor pen, and upgrade into Cleaver late game. However, since the changes to the Black Cleaver build path, I find myself not picking up Brutalizer as often. I am a fan of Youmuu&#039;s, but it&#039;s not always my go-to item choice. Usually I&#039;d rather have Black Cleaver. Right now if I&#039;m laning, my options if I decide to buy Brutalizer are either having to get Youmuu&#039;s or selling it off. My question is, will there be a new item in the forseeable future that can build out of Brutalizer?","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-08-21T15:37:39.207+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{item:1038}}+{{item:3134}}=Unicorn Lance\n**UNIQUE passive:** You gain bonus flat armor penetration equal to (percentage) of your bonus AD.
