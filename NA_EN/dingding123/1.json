Tanks won't be able to last-hit minions.**\nMinons can have 10% less health and 10% more damage resistance to eachother to compensate.  _Boom._\n\n**2.) Champions will still continue to one-shot eachother.**\n10% damage resistance will not be enough to save someone that doesn't buy defense from someone else 2+ levels higher that is building pure damage; however in any other situation champions will lose their power to nuke people on their own, especially if any healing is involved. \n\n**3.) Games will be longer.**\nNot if objectives are no harder to take down, if for example towers/monsters had 10% less health and 10% more minion resistance - again, all that needs to be reduced for there to be more varied gameplay is champion-to-champion damage, nothing else.\n\n**4.) Everyone will still run the same dumb rune pages.**\nObjectively untrue - many, many runes will be infinitely more valuable than they once were if champions can avoid getting nuked by 1-2 champions and stats can reliably matter past, say, the 20-minute mark.\n\n**5.) Assassins as a role will die.**\nNot die, but they will require more teamwork (**gasp**) to do well.  Imagine 2 coordinated assassins/fighters/mages ganking being the norm - doesn't that sound cool?  Cooler than one guy desperately trying to nuke people on their own at least?\n\n**6.) LC$ hypercarries and Big Play$ will cease to exist.**\nFaker didn't first become famous in Season 8.  League of Legends as a whole didn't first become famous in Season 8.  Damage isn't what people get excited about.  _Search your feelings, you know it to be true..._\n\n**7.) Riven skins won't sell.**\nI'm sure they will.  In fact I'm sure Riot will buff her to compensate no matter the circumstance, no qualms here.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-08T02:13:15.757+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reducing damage by 10% will just utterly break the game in every way.","replies":[{"poster":"Dingding123","date":"2019-10-08T02:31:43.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"The game **IS** utterly broken in every way.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-10-08T03:22:29.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hardly.
