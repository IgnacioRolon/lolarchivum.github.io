Please try again. If this issue persists, contact support at...\". I don't know what caused this, I got on after a few weeks about three days ago, I downloaded the new patch, then I played then and also the day after, but I started getting this error yesterday and it has persisted. I go to log in, it seems to process for a few minutes, then gives this error.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-01T01:40:55.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could either be happening from some missing or corrupted game files, which you should be able to fix with a quick repair through the client options. If that doesn't help then this is most likely a connection related problem. Most of the time a good adjustment to your Port Forwarding and DNS settings by using those steps in this [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), but it's worth it to do the other steps as well if those 2 don't help immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"GaberahamLincoln","date":"2017-11-02T01:14:41.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Broporo, I did what you suggested and ran a full client repair, unfortunately i'm still having the issue of not being able to log in. I don't believe my connection is the issue, as I'm not playing on internet through a router. I'm actually using the hotspot in my data plan, as I don't have the money for WiFi yet. Four days without League and i'm starting to feel common withdrawal symptoms.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-02T02:03:37.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but a phone's hotspot wifi isn't likely going to work very well for League. League needs a stable connection and hotspots aren't designed to play multiplayer games on, but rather just to get some quick and easy work done when stable internet isn't available.","replies":[{"poster":"GaberahamLincoln","date":"2017-11-03T17:41:08.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Hotspot has seemed to work fine until now, it's perfectly steady unless I get texted, and you need friends for that. I get 3MB/s download speeds and 55 ping.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
