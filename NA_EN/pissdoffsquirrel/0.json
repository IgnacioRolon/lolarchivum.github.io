I also can move around with no lag but i cant see other champions and minions at all. My frames also don't drop at all, I have tried different ways with packet loss and wireless to wired connection. I don't know how or why this is happening but, this issue is making it unplayable. I have been playing for a couple years now with no issues from anything but a bad router one time. If anyone has had a fix or this issue resolved for them I would be more than happy to know the fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-16T21:56:42.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There could be an issue with how your ISP might be routing to the game server.

I don't think there is much to be said about the infinite lost pings after the second riot router, could be intentional or not. I'll probably submit a ticket with a bunch of relevant info and logs later if this keeps happening.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Davaroodaves","date":"2017-05-16T21:48:16.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo.
