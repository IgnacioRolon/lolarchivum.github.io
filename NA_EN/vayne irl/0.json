Blitz is tanky, but if the team can't delete who ever he pulls then Blitz is pretty useless if the fight doesn't last long enough for his cds.  \n\nSome people will find {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} frustrating to lane against. The trick is for Sona wait for her to Q then you can trade with her or poke the adc. She will run out of mana or hp and that point she is useless. For Raka you have to all in her before the adc, make sure to dodge her Q so she will have low hp and an easy kill.\n\nOdd ball supports that I like: {{champion:57}} {{champion:79}} \n\nOnce you have found the ones you enjoy playing, play them a ton and master them.\n\nOne little tip, once you buy sightstone switch to the sweeper trinket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Level 0 Magikarp","date":"2015-09-02T19:41:35.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WELCOME TO THE LOVE YOUR TEAMMATES CLUB :D! I main support mid-gold. I'd recommend playing something with easy mechanics first like Janna... which you have been doing (yay!). Try out one of each \"type\" of support. Like melee/tank, poke, and sustain, and see which fits your playstyle the best. Someone said {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} are passive supports. That is so NOT true. They're poke utility supports and if you're not using their kit to harass (don't forget to AA!) then you're probably playing them way too passively.\n\nTips: \n1. Always ward and watch the map for where the jungler shows up/mia's. You don't have to back and get a sightstone as your first buy. Typically I have to buy 2-3 wards before I have enough gold to buy a sightstone.\n2. When you get into fights, ALWAYS auto attack no matter what. If you can slip in an auto attack when just trading in laning phase, do that too (especially good with Nami)\n3. Exhaust CAN be used as an initiating tool if your enemy AD has low/no escapes and your jungler is close enough\n4. If you're playing against a raka, poke the raka down first\n\nSummoners:\n{{summoner:3}} for peel and damage reduction (safe pick)\n{{summoner:14}} for anti-heal and kill secure (aggro)\n\nSupport items:\n{{item:3303}} for AP poke supports {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:161}} \n{{item:3301}} for mobility supports (or team){{champion:432}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} \n{{item:3302}} for tank/melee supports{{champion:111}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:98}} \n\nSome supports can fall into multiple roles/use different build paths (like Thresh and Janna) but typically if I'm playing a support that uses {{item:3303}}, I don't bother to upgrade it. If anything I'd switch it to a coin midgame (which is better late game) or just sell it to invest in some other item. It's not really worth building Frost Queen's in my opinion.\n\nIf you want to play, add me in game! I want to practice ADC anyway haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miror B","date":"2015-08-31T17:31:35.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you kinda answered your own question. As a support, your main \"goal\" in the game is to not only make your adc look good but make everyone else look good. Picking something that compliments your team's playstyle is pretty key, as it then makes it easier to influence multiple lanes and roam without being much of a burden. Make sure you ward CONSTANTLY, and pick up items that can influence team fights. \n\nOh, and for an easier time getting used to the role, try out the {{champion:48}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:98}} combo. All three are easy to master, and should show off most of what the role has to offer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-08-31T17:04:00.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the tricks with supports is knowing what kind of support you're playing. Some supports are ridiculously aggressive, some are just kinda passive and help their lane partner farm, and some are there purely to protect their ADC from anything that flies at them (looking at you {{champion:201}}, you magnificent being).\n\nKnow your lane partner's usual laning style, and choose a support to compliment that. If they'll be mainly farming, you can take a more passive support ({{champion:117}}, {{champion:267}}). If they're more aggressive laners, be prepared to do the same ({{champion:89}} {{champion:111}}). You can also take into account their potential for snowballing, and choose a support to assist that (usually aggressive supports).\n\nOther than that, never forget your sightstone. A support's primary goal in the game when nothing's going on is to give/deny vision.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]}
