It was usable while dead, had a low cooldown, and granted kills if the shielded turret killed a champion. \n\nIt was rarely taken as it was considered to be revive-tier.\n\nAnivia used to be able to egg teleport. If you started casting teleport before you egged, the channel would continue into egg form, allowing you to teleport to safety. And it actually worked because everyone and their goddamn mother didn't have a hard CC back then.\n\nThere was a time when Janna was an ADC.\n\nYour turn.\n\n(And be creative, don't post pleb tier shit like \"TF and Xin Zhao used to be OP gyuh gyuh how weird huh guys\")","replies":[]}
