No wonder you see the ice planet on every fucking poster, it's the only one they spent any amount of screentime on.\r\n\r\nPeople say that it was supposed to be all \"human\" and \"touching\". Makes sense that I'm a dragon then, cause I'd be going \"see ya %%%%%%s!\" at the first opportunity. I literally cannot think of anything less important in all the universe than *sentimentality*. I never at any point gave a single shit about plan A.\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on McConaughey's \"I'm a poor yokel and I do poor yokel things\" slackjawed schtick. All in all the only thing that made me gag more than this movie was all the praise it got.\r\n\r\nFuck you people.","replies":[]}
