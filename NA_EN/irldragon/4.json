I knew something seemed eerily familiar but I couldn't put my finger on it until a moment ago. Jesus christ Riot you sneaky fucking cows.\r\n\r\nWe're coming up on april fools day. A turbulent and critical time for everyone here. Everyone is asking for URF. Where is URF? But Riot's not bringing URF back this year, guys.\r\n\r\nOh no, that would be far too predictable. You don't be predictable on *april fools day*.\r\n\r\nBard. This new champion Riot has coming out. Conveniently announced such that their release could very well coincide with that sacred day. He's fun, interesting, and probably horribly imbalanced, but that's not the point.\r\n\r\nA question on everyone's minds, almost as much as URF: \"What *is* Bard underneath that thick ass coat?\"\r\n\r\n...A big guy, isn't he, Bard? Physically, I mean. Sure the coat is huge but there's still something massive under that. One could even say he's big as a... *house*.\r\n\r\nBard's kit, chimes. Or rather bells. Bard runs around, collecting bells. *Riot is literally rubbing it in your face that this guy should be ringing some bells.*\r\n\r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough for you, his name. They left the most obvious of clues right in the middle of his fucking name. *They only changed one letter.*\r\n\r\nI have to admit, they were thorough. They produced all this hype for Bard, even released a dummy character onto the PBE. God **damn** did they try to cover up their secret. But I saw through it all.\r\n\r\nWe're not getting URF or Bard for april fools day. I know what lies beneath the coat. And for us all, it is time... *to burn*.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2425713","replies":[]}
