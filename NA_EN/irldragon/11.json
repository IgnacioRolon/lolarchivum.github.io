Do you hate Riot for deleting Karma and replacing her with an entirely different champion? Do you wish new Karma had any level of intricacy? **WELL NOW YOU CAN!**\n\nBear with me for a moment. Take a careful look at Karma's passive. Useless, right? Contributes nothing to her kit? Would get thrown over a bed and anally obliterated by Inner Fire any day of the week? Think again. There's a little detail that people completely overlook.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/S9q9xkx\n\nWait, what's this...\n\nhttp://imgur.com/DY0M1zo\n\nHow have I never noticed this before...\n\nhttp://imgur.com/N3shfiU\n\nARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING??\n\n\n{{item:3091}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3115}}  {{item:3085}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}} \nAS KARMA, HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\n\nNow, let's do some math. By default, the cooldown of your rank 4 Mantra is 36 seconds. -20% from Nashors will put it at 28.8.\n\nBy channeling the power of your fabulous fists of fury (at roughly 1.8 AS), You can reduce that cooldown by 5.4 *per second*. That will bring the cooldown of your ultimate below 5 seconds *without even considering landing your spells*. realistically, it's gonna fall to around 3-4 seconds.\n\n\"But Dragon!\", you ask. \"How can you expect to stay in short range long enough to autoattack? You're gonna get exploded!\"\n\nWell let me answer that for you, Jeff. Mantra W.\n\nMantra\n\nFucking\n\nW.\n\nYou will be able to heal 23% of your missing health every single time you press W, and then 23% again 2 seconds later. And because your ult cooldown is so fucking low, you can do it again, and again, and again.\n\nOr if you're fine for health, you can mantra Q! Or E! Hell, your ult cooldown is so abysmally low, you will be *forced to use it on different abilties*. OLD KARMA IS BACK, BABY!\n\nARE YOU A REAL MAN? THEN GET OUT THERE AND PICK UP AS KARMA TODAY!","replies":[]}
