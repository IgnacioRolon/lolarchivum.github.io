So, I wait it out and get into a match finally. THEN, whenever I get to the loading screen for the match, IT CRASHES AGAIN. I get back in right after 3 mins and then the game has been set as a \"remake\" the second i get in. SOMEHOW this led to me getting a demotion in my rank, and on top of that I got 5 different times where i had to wait 10 mins to get into queue (really annoying).\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\nI finally get out of the 5 wait times and are queueing up for another match. At this point I am back in promos to get back to where I was. I get into champ select for about 1 min, and BOOM. THE CLIENT CRASHES AGAIN LEADING TO A DODGE AND A LOSS IN MY PROMO GAME.\r\nOn top of that, I now have a 30 min wait before i can play another match (which I am spending some of that time typing this).\r\n\r\nCan someone do anything about this? I've spent about 1 1/2 hours waiting, got a demotion, and have lost a promo game due to this issue.\r\nI don't think it's my PC, because it's never had crash issues before. This is really ruining the game for me.\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T15:24:30.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your issue persists after the provided troubleshoot steps, please reach out to our tech team by [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
