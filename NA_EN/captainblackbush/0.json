These two started the argument with me and when I retaliated they told everyone to report me for hate speech. After the two goons reported me it didn&#039;t take long for Riot to chat restrict me, I&#039;m sure they did no research into what actually happened because if they did then I wouldn&#039;t have been punished and/or they would have went through restrictions. On top of that I think it&#039;s stupid for being punished for talking junk in a video game. League of Legends has the worst community in gaming, that&#039;s because they cater to the individuals who make this game a terrible experience. Look at what they did to videogamedunkey just go watch his video on why he quit League of Legends and I agree he shouldn&#039;t have said some of the things he did but look at everything he put up with prior to that point. ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE CATERING TO THE TOXIC COMMUNITY. They won&#039;t change unless we take action so I encourage you guys to stop supporting/playing League as I will. Don&#039;t buy any of their merchandise, Don&#039;t play, Don&#039;t promote the game until they actually care about their community. Let&#039;s see how long it takes before this post is removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-10-22T19:35:37.005+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, you were chat restricted for breaking the Summoner's Code by contributing/creating a toxic environment in game.

Why am I banned???\n I'll keep this one simple: those other players in your game that you thought were worse are probably also banned. Nearly 100% of the time, those players were banned even before you were. If someone is being toxic, just report them and move on.\n\n We strongly believe that it is not OK to retaliate. If a player refuses to cooperate and says something negative, then players should ignore the player and report them after the game. Players can ignore or mute players by pressing the “Mute” button on the Scoreboard [when you hit TAB] in the game. \n\n If a player retaliates and says something bad back, then the two of you have made a negative experience for potentially the other 8 players in the game. Rarely do teams start working together better when players begin fighting back—great games only happen when players cooperate and don’t make the issues even worse by fighting back and forth.\n\n-Lyte","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadòw","date":"2016-10-22T19:49:02.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  League of Legends has the worst community in gaming\n\nActually it's exactly because of people like you.\n\nYou don't have to defend yourself, you flamed and that's it.\n\nenjoy your ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Photos of Ghosts","date":"2016-10-22T19:46:53.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*It's only fun if they run.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wonderlands","date":"2016-10-22T19:46:20.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs or stfu","replies":[]}]}
