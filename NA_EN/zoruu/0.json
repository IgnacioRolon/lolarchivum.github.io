I can use window capture to show the client easily but neither game capture nor window capture will let me see the actual game. I've switched in and out of windowed borderless, I am running the software as admin, and I've done the alt tab method to get the game to show up. I've looked at plenty of videos but none seem to fix the problem. If I can't get it to work does anyone at least have good feedback for any other free streaming programs?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-23T20:26:25.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...We don't offer OBS support but I'll take a jab at it.  You'll be capturing **two **different assets in this case.  You'll want to do a capture for the client first.  When your actual match starts, make another separate capture to discover an option for the game itself.  Having those two up should transition smoothly between the client and the game.  Let me know if that helps or makes any sense.  :x","replies":[{"poster":"Zoruu","date":"2017-06-25T05:36:36.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So by capture would you mean a game capture or window capture? What I tried is starting up the client and doing a window capture for it in a a scene then I would spectate a game and create a new scene then try to game capture the actual league game client shows up fine but game doesn't. There has to be something I'm missing...","replies":[]}]}]}
