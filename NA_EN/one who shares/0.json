But a couple issues. Where have the custom item sets gone? Why can&#039;t you make them anymore, I hate using the recommended items and love having the freedom to build custom item sets for specific champions. Also, I LOVED that you could click play now it automatically took you to your last played queue. That was awesome, but now you have top change your queue back every time, and it&#039;s really pretty tedious. I would also really like it personally if you could hide the sidebar/friends list. It feels pretty obstructive and I think it would feel nice to hide it or be able to minimize it.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-10-21T20:15:05.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super happy to hear that you are enjoying it so far!\n\nCustom items sets are missing and it is not being worked on at the moment, discussion is ongoing tho.\n\nThe behavior of the play button and minimizing chat has been discussed in other threads, here in the boards and internally at Riot. I don't posses any other information about that. Open beta is coming really soon and we are focusing on ironing out the wrinkles in the already existing features.\n\nThanks for your support!","replies":[]}]}
