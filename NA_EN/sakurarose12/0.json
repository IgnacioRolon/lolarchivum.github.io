So I reset my pc to completely new again and reinstalled league. Although other apps that I installed worked perfectly fine, League was the exception. It is smooth when I'm just in the app, but once I entered the game, it started to lagg to the point I can barely move my champ at all. I tried to Run as Admin but that didn't work, reset my computer to new but it looks like it didn't work. What's weird is that it only happens once I entered game :/ My ping wasn't that bad either (12 ms), please help if you have any idea what's going on. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-16T17:20:50.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue might not be with your install, but connection to the game server.  Even if your ping is okay, you can still have packet loss or some other issue.  Start out with the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide in this case to help rule out some possibilities.
