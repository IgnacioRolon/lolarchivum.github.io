This could be timed so that  you could only do this once every 5 minutes or after a game to minimize server performance impact. This would help players know the ping beforehand and not have to upset the fellow teammates by having slower reaction times due to connection issues. This could be a button on the main screen (make it small so people won&#039;t press on it too much but also noticeable to where people know where it is; maybe next to the settings?) or something in the settings menu. Personally, I have had one too many games where I have had worse performance due to high, stable ping (not spikes but constant 200ms+) and I dislike both playing at that ping and having the other players suffer due to situations out of my control (ISP issues). Please consider this an important feature as I am sure the community as a whole would appreciate knowing the ping before playing a 35-45 minute game.\r\n\r\nPS: I know there are external websites that somewhat provide this service and that the main workaround is to create a custom game and play it for a few minutes but this is cumbersome enough to make people not want to do this check, since most want to log on and just play.","replies":[{"poster":"Jawadrian","date":"2016-10-14T06:07:46.363+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is, indeed a genius ideal.

It would help a lot of people decide if its better to go into a custom since they have high ping to play or go into their ranked. (Talking from someone that plays from 115 ping average from Alaska.) Be amazingly helpful, but maybe over 30 minutes we could do 15-20 since its more frequent and more updates. Since you could AFK for 15-20 minutes and come back to check for if your ping is ready for a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2017-03-09T04:57:41.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pinging doesnt impact the server lol.  not unless millions of people all did it at exactly the same time.\n\nalso, go into command prompt and type this: ping 104.160.131.1  -t\n\nwhat this does is ping riots game server until you tell it to stop.  if you leave out the -t it will send 4 pings, which can be ok but wont show if you are spiking at all.  you can also do -n (number of pings you want) so like -n 10 that way it stops after a designated number of pings, but imo -t is simpler and if you want to end it you just press ctrl+c and it stops.  i usually ping riots server for about 5 minutes before playing for the day as my internet is pretty random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shggfhdh","date":"2016-11-26T19:02:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my problem is not in the game but in the client.
