Make a custom game or play a blind pick and use the chroma you'd like to have selected. After the game starts or completes the chroma you had selected will be the default option next time you choose that champion (even in team builder) and the chroma will work. Since discovering this i haven't tried switching skins then back to the chroma without repeating the process so be wary of that. Hope this helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-05T18:21:34.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Murkinesis,\n\nWe're aware of issues with chroma packs not always 'sticking' in champion select. We don't have a root cause for this, so we don't have a fix for it at the moment.\n\nThat said, I use the Nami chroma pack a lot, and I've found that sliding to a different skin card and then clicking back to the chroma I want to use has successfully selected my chroma pack every time. It's obviously not the best case scenario, but it's a workaround I've found until we're able to nail down what's causing this. :c","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-01-05T20:12:15.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it's a bug with the client.
