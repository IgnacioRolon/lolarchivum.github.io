However, when I ask my friends if I'm in the group or not, they have said I'm in the group. The worst part is, I'm the person who made the club so I can't get myself kicked. Has anybody else having this problem or am I the only one?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T03:59:14.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've resolved most of the Clubs issues for club owners, but some are still lingering.
