All Riot is doing is making consistent announcements on how Sion is a \"top priority\".

Not sure what you're referring to from two years ago as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-06-27T01:31:32.137+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could I voice my (limited) opinion on Sion?\n\n\nI feel **he's far too magical**. By that, I mean I never liked he has a point and click stun nuke that's supposedly him *\"staring at an enemy so hard that it damages and stuns him\"*. That's DnD Wizard territory right there. The same goes for his magic shield, that too is something I feel does not belong. It's a great concept imo, but I don't think it belongs on Sion.\n\n\nSion should be a sluggish brute that ignores attacks and cc designed to hold him back. He shouldn't be fast, but he should be unstoppable. If he sees a target, he will shamble towards that target and he will use whatever he gets his hands on to pummel that target. Axe, or a chopped off arm, or bare hands doesn't matter.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this is from a person doesn't play Sion much. But why else do you think I disliked playing him?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-06-27T03:48:34.665+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're thinking roughly along the same lines - undead juggernaught, raw physical power, heavy and brutal.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-06-27T10:59:26.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it possible to keep the exploding shield?
