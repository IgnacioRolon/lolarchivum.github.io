I don't know if this is a network error or what. But I uninstalled the game, and tried to download it again to no avail. It just keeps popping up with the little download bar at the bottom of the icon then nothing happens. I'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem despite my being at a college.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-28T23:18:29.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen when you're on any other network outside of your college? It's extremely likely there are specific network restrictions that you'll either need to be whitelisted to bypass or to speak directly with your network administration about.","replies":[]}]}
