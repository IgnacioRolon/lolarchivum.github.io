This happens when the game server fails to send a message to the matchmaking platform that your match has concluded and results have been recorded. This leaves you in an awkward spot until the platform is finally updated on what happened.\n\nIf you're still experiencing this issue, please let me know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaark","date":"2016-07-21T03:37:04.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just something that is happening commonly today. i don't mind much, but I really need the win I just got..
