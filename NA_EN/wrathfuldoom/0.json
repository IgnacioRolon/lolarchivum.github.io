Is this a feature that&#039;s going to be a permanent thing?\r\n\r\nI just want a way to block people easier than relying on typing out their names, espescially when they have goofyass system charachters and such which make it nearly impossible to remove/avoid in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-03T20:23:23.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That exists.\n\n/ignore @ChampionName","replies":[]}]}
