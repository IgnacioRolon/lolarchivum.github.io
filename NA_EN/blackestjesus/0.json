I'm not a veteran to board posts, especially when it comes to putting down ideas. Now, the idea for this champion is one I've purely conceived out of my head just from looking at fanart for many of our other female champions. Many of them have a little bit of \"Eye Candy\" to them, and there is nothing wrong with that. I mean look at {{champion:421}}, she has it going on. Anyway, my thought for this character relates to my own mother, hence the nickname now, \"Momma\". \r\n\r\nMy own mother is not a toned, athletic woman. She is pretty chunky and she does have meat on her bones. Now, I want you to imagine this character. She does have a motherly likeness to her, but she is stern and stubborn in lane. I imagine this character to be tanky. Why? I imagine this character to be raised not to be a ninny. This woman worked on a farm, she did chores, when she was older, she worked harder to help provide for her family. She doesn't take nonsense from people. If I have to go by lore standards, this is a woman {{champion:201}}  would be proud to bring home to his Momma. She would be from the Freljord. At first, I do imagine her as a cook, kinda how Gragas is a man fond of his drink. Her weapon would be a giant ladle. Those nights in the Freljord would get to be pretty cold, nothing like a nice steaming broth/soup/stew couldn't fix. She would be a woman of amazing culinary skill, passed down among her family. And she would know she's a good cook, for she has eaten some of her own creations. \r\n\r\nSee where I'm going with this?\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not the best of descriptions or the best at creating characters, but this woman is who I would love to call mother. She's caring for her teammates. Thus, support/tank is what her role would be. Her passive could be something along the line of a boost to allies, be it health regen, bonus AD, or what I would think, bonus resistances to slows. If I were slow about something, my mother would get me to go faster, hurry, but no running and such. Done in a timely manner if you will. Something to help stop slows, quit being lazy. Her Q could be a main poke or something. I have no idea.  What I would love to see is her ult being something like, Momma's Secret Recipe, which is a single buff to one ally, like Lulu's Hugeify, and it can be a savior to that one ally. I would love to see it be a massive heal with bonus armor and magic resist, something to literally save a teammate. Or better yet, something to remove all ill effects along healing them. \r\n\r\nBut, that is just my idea. And since this is a forum, I would love to hear some of your guy's input on this. Maybe you could help lend a description to Momma or give ideas for abilities and such.","replies":[]}
