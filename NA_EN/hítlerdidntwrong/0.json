I also reinstalled the game several times and then after I gave up i reinstalled it one more time later in the day and it finally worked. They seriously need to put item sets into the new client as that is what caused me to try to launch the legacy client in the first place because I do not play the game every day so I NEED item sets to remind me what kind of builds I have made. I wish I could help them design the layout because the masteries/runes screens and the lack of item sets has really put off a lot of players from what they have told me. Another mistake I have seen is that the riot points seem to be missing the red glow around the icon which isn't very smart if it is intentional as that design catches the eye and something that basic draws more attention to the potential to sell characters and skins instead of making it easy to gloss over as you look across the screen. As a company you guys should definitely want to draw more colour/attention to areas like that. Its got the same goldish colour scheme of every other text based element. If you guys really need some pointing in the right direction on how to make these things Pop out and catch the eyes of the people playing thus increasing profits you should hire me or at least someone that understands what I'm talking about. It's such simple tweaks as this that would build revenue working off the subconscious and how the human eyes work(anatomy and psychology, I mean your program is interfacing directly with human beings so it should be easy to see how the layout should be designed with people's natural perceptions. Which brings me back to the item lists thing, it doesn't matter how well you design a change, if you are taking something away from the player that used to be there, especially something as simple as items sets then you are giving the impression that your new change is inferior, and First impressions are important to the average person. I am ranting or rioting to you so that maybe it will get passed along somehow.\n\nAnyways! Thanks for trying to assist me, I appreciate it!\nThankfully the game works for now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HítlerDidNtWrong","date":"2017-01-24T02:08:43.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried deleting all sorts of folders from the projects folder as that has worked for others in the past, I have checked and made sure it is allowed through the firewall as well.","replies":[]}]}
