It's extremely difficult due to the randomness of his transformations, but also hiding in a bush right before you transform then scaring the turd outta whoever followed you in is too fun. \n\nGnar is stupidly squishy, and I don't mean that lightly. Let's look at stats:\n\n{{champion:150}} \nDEFENSE:\nHealth - 540 (+65 x level) = 1645 at level 18.\nHealth Regen - 2.50 (+0.50 x level) = 11 at level 18.\nArmor - 23 (+2.50 x level) = 65 at level 18.\nMagic Resist - 30 (+0 x level) = 30 at level 18.\n\nHere's a rather common ADC,\n{{champion:18}} \nDEFENSE:\nHealth - 552 (+82 x level) = 1946 at level 18. (Trist also has a random 0.76 added to her health, weird.)\nHealth Regen - 6.19 (+0.65 x level) = 17.24 at level 18.\nArmor - 24.04 (+3 x level) = 75 at level 18.\nMagic Resist - 30 (+0 x level) = 30 at level 18. \n\nSo, {{champion:18}} can be tankier then {{champion:150}} by stats alone, assuming Gnar is in mini form. \n\nMega Gnar gains:\n43 x level Health.\n2 x level Armor.\n2 x level Magic Resist.\n2.5 x level Attack Damage.\n2.5 x level Health Regen.\n\nMega Gnar loses:\n9 (+0.50 x level) movement speed, on top of an already crap 325 base.\n245 (+5 x level) range.\n5.5% (x level) attack speed. (Not sure on this, seems iffy. I'll test in a custom game later.)\n\nWhen changing back to Mini Gnar, he does not keep his current health, but health percentage, AKA he heals a lot less than it looks.","replies":[{"poster":"Serenity Now","date":"2015-01-26T02:46:01.049+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ok, but Gnar builds tank, whereas an ADC does not.  So that low HP is deceptive.","replies":[{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2015-01-26T03:28:53.918+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had to go eat dinner so I didn't finish my post, here's the rest.\n\nGnar builds tank **because** of his low health. Having that little health forces him to build extra to survive, and as a giant CC machine in Mega Form that is what he's best at. Gnar is excepted to build with a somewhat tanky build, I usually go half and half similar to Jayce. This reduces Gnar's over-all damage. To compensate this, his AD and AP Ratios are really high.\n\nMini Gnar:\nQ builds with 115% AD.\nW (Passive) builds with 100% AP\nE builds with 6% of Gnar's health, which encourages the more tanky builds.\nR builds with 20% AD and 50% AP.\n\nA normal Gnar build focuses in using his Boomerang and Hyper passive for damage, and then when transforming to Mega just CC people to death. \n\nFocusing on Q first, it has a 20 second cooldown at level 1 and a 10 second cooldown at level 5. However, catching the Boomerang reduces the cooldown by 45%/50%/55%/60% depending on the level of his ult. So a good Gnar will make sure to catch Q to increase the damage he can do. If you're against Gnar, try to play someone with a skillshot snare or other form of CC. When he throws his Q, it comes back based on the direction Gnar is going. Throw your skillshot towards where he has to be to catch the boomerang, this forces him to either catch it to reduce the cooldown and get trapped in the CC or ignore it and wait on his boomerang to come back, which allows you to get damage on him or get farm. Another thing is staying behind minions reduces the damage by 50%.\n\nHis W allows for large amounts of damage and easy escape, it's great fun in Hide and Seek. Every time Gnar hits a champion with a basic attack or his Boomerang it applies a stack which is easily seen by the orange ring at the targets feet. At 3 stacks the target takes 50 (+100% AP) (+6/8/10/12/14% of the target's max health) as magic damage. This allows Gnar to shred those high-health target like Singed and Garen. However, this only works in mini form. The best defense is watch the stacks, especially at low health and build magic resist. If you're a tank, wait for Gnar to go into his Mega form and fight him as far away from walls as possible. This reduces Gnar to one stun, at a 15-7 second cooldown instead of two.\n\nTo sum up the best thing I think to do would be this:\nIf you're an AD melee champion like {{champion:114}} wait for his Mega form before going in so you can do damage without worrying about him using his ranged attacks and W passive to kit you. Watch for the stun, as it's easily to see it and dodge. Stay AWAY from walls to prevent him using his ult.\n\nIf you're an AD ranged champ like {{champion:51}}, watch his Rage bar very **carefully** and stay back when he goes Mega. Gnar usually using his bounce on a minion when he transforms as a gap closer, so back off from your minions. When he does go Mega, kit him and call for a gank from your jungler. As soon as he goes back have your jungler come in before he can build more rage and try to CC him to prevent him using E to escape. While in lane, abuse your range over him and poke him away from farm. Dodge his Q and send skillshots when he tries to catch it. \n\nI'm a level 30 unranked play anywhere kinda guy, but I'm really good at picking people up and learning their ups and downs.

Additionally, fighting her when you have minions nearby is tricky as she can use her ult to sap health from them. As the game goes on, Irelia gets tankier and still holds the ability to 1v1 Gnar thanks to her passive and unresistable Hiten Style.\n\nXin Zhao can bully Gnar hard whether he builds AD or AP. As Gnar usually hops away from you as soon as you gap close, you can grab an early sheen as AP Xin and by maxing E first you front-load a ton of damage onto the little bugger while also being able to trade blows with his mega form thanks to your hefty W passive sustain. (Seriously, with Doran's Ring and about 25 AP you get a health pot every nine attacks in lane.) If Gnar stays in to trade with Xin, he loses out on damage and Xin mitigates a fair amount with his heal. Xin wins. If Gnar panic bounces away and throws a boomerang then he (probably) pushes lane against you, letting you freely sustain for several attacks. Xin wins more. Additionally, Xin's passive reduces the armor that Gnar will eventually buy to resist your powerful auto attacks and Three Talon Strike. \n\nOutside of his transformation Gnar also has no innate sustain at all, so champs that can trade and then heal up quickly will become a problem as whenever he goes in to CS he risks being further poked down.\n\nEDIT: Also, many manaless and some mana-using bruisers like Vi and Renekton have brutal burst that can put the hurt on mini-gnar and even bring CC into the combo so he can't easily escape.

He can't control his ultimate.  He's quite good at poking safely, but there's little chance for him to all in you successfully.  Squishes very reliably, even more so than Teemo, when caught out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-01-26T16:37:46.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin, Lissandra, Vladimir, and Irelia are hard matchups vs him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuumidiocre","date":"2015-01-26T16:00:16.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from my experience as gnar. if theres one thing that screws me over the most it is slows and stuns. now im not a pro gnar and i only play him when available but evertime i get stunned im pretty much screwed. and another thing ive noticed is that people tend to get thornmail. screws me over every time. hopes this somewhat helps lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-26T15:23:44.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his gap closer is high cooldown and his base damage is low in mini form.  if you can bait out his hop then re-engage on him while it's down you will win every all in, assuming he does not go mega. the best time to do this is right after he transforms *back* to mini gnar from mega.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluxBound","date":"2015-01-26T15:21:37.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think gnar is a late game champion, so shorter games is kinda a weakness. A good player would time his ganks and engages right after he goes into mini gnar. As shown by the match between TSM and C9, Gnar has a bit of trouble ulting in a lane as it's too big to find a wall. I've been playing gnar all week and I got steamrolled by a top jinx, maybe that will help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-01-26T13:54:00.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do not counterpick him,you have to go in the moment he returns to mini form.

Otherwise, he just hops away every time you engage.\n\nI've taken half a Gnar's HP bar as Jax with a simple Q and a WR empowered auto.
