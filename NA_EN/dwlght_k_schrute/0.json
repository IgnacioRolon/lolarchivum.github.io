Find the line 'gameflow-patcher-lock: xxxxxxxx' and delete it. Close launcher and reopen. \n\n*It takes over a minute to Authenticate during login, in the normally busy hours. The authentication may fail and may loop fail (not even try) requiring restart of launcher. The next LONG attempt may get you in, but could fail again too. \"Unexpected Error\"\n\n*Once in game, it may sometimes be extremely laggy yet ping may or may not be fine which seems like a packetloss issue. I myself have a steady 54ms for years, but since this patch the minions freeze, other champions are porting around, I cannot move my character, jungle minions won't spawn,the usual stuff you see with high latency, except the latency is very low!.. This may go on the entire game or randomly let up. Meanwhile my internet is perfectly fine and I can play any other game with 0% packetloss.  Restarting the client and relogging in fixes this sometimes... I might play another game after and 100% perfect. \n\nWhat's weird is not all of us are affected. If I had to guess some of us are being routed to the Riot Servers through a poor route? Some ports are bad somewhere? I can restart the client and fix the issues (sometimes).\n\n== If you're like me you've restarted the client a number of times to try and get pass a block. Sometimes part of the launcher stays open even though you close it. There are 3 processes for the launcher. LeagueClient.exe, LeagueClientUx.exe, LeagueClientUxRender.exe. Press CTRL ALT DEL if you're on windows and go to task manager, hit Details tab and close all 3, then try and reopen client.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightshade36","date":"2017-06-17T04:53:03.078+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue since patching, and it's tilted me off the face of the planet.

That's a 104. network with a steady 6-7%.\n\nRight now in game is 100% fine so I'm gonna keep it running... Testing launcher and it took about 15 seconds to login just now after I exited launcher which is much better.. but this morning at 6:30am it was good as well like that then went to being very bad again.\n\nSo maybe it's all fixed?

Not even an hour ago before I did the test, I was on a roll with tryndamere.... I was one hit from killing a darius and he got away because the lag thing happened. It kept happening for a minute or 2 then it went back to good! I've been playing league for years and this is the first time I feel like any game now I might get a leave for this lag problem and inability to log right back into a game if I get dc. In all these years I think I have 1 leave on my record, maybe 2 at the most and it was from power outage or internet outage, extremely rare considering I've played thousands of games.\n\nCome to think of it.. since the patch this is the best it's been.. and I've done absolutely nothing on my end.","replies":[{"poster":"FieryAuraa","date":"2017-06-17T22:16:09.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it seems strange. The first match I had earlier, I was at 115MS which being a player on NA from another region, is normal. But within that first match it upped to 216, and started insanely lagging. I don't know what went on but I even turned off things like the private teamspeak I host from my Laptop, and since that's where alot of my connection would be directed too, did nothing to fix the fact I couldn't attack anything. I got ruined in a game where I was jungler with three of my league team-mates because there was no way I could even attack. And then the support, Thresh, who is one of the friends I play with, she was pinging 14k MS to us, then timed out of league entirely yet when I checked her ping for my TeamSpeak she was perfectly fine, nothing else locked her out, just league.

But fails every time it happens. and we run fine on other games - I can play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 perfect, no lag whatsoever unless of-course a bad host - but 3-4 bars which is my complete normal. There's something wrong with the league server itself. As what was just said by DWlGHT, if it was a network issue, only a handful of people would have the issue and it'd be fixed by now, but this is NA wide, was in a match with three friends of mine, the servers lag was that bad one of them exceeded their normal max ping then lost complete connection to league servers for over half the match, capping out at over 14k MS. Yes her internets bad but if it was her connection she would have had that MS on a private teamspeak, which I can assure you, was not the case. I do hope this gets looked into thoroughly because there's going to be a-lot more reports than this.\n\nEdit: Considering this also - I just checked my latest network log, and I'm going to compare it with any other game I can view the ping.
