There are some ways the engine processes certain kinds of audio differently now, so we're adjusting things accordingly (but then finding out it affects other things along the way and having to adjust those as well). \n\nNexus blowing up for sure was turned down - there were a couple layers of things happening that made that so super loud, but the fix should be on PBE now.","replies":[{"poster":"Boy 1 champ Zyra","date":"2018-03-12T12:26:08.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@semipriceysoap the sound of my game (announcement and champs' voice) is 2x faster than before.
