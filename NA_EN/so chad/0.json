Oh my god, the end of the tail is even different from the rest of it.\r\nI can only be talking about Cassiopeia&#039;s Desperada skin, right?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2e07w5.jpg\r\n\r\nThis is absurd. First Riot lets a kindergartner hand-paint the Desperada skin update:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/um0xJb1.jpg\r\n\r\nNow they have identified a hole in Cassiopeia&#039;s wardrobe for something light-brown with a cool scale pattern on the tail and decided to fill it with this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YAQt3al.jpg\r\n\r\nThe craziest part is that of Cass&#039;s base skin and the other two colors in the SAME CHROMA PACK as this pseudo-Desperada skin NONE of them feature a darker tail tip to give the illusion of being a rattlesnake, only this one. It is clearly intentional.","replies":[{"poster":"CatSith","date":"2015-07-29T04:36:40.478+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"The updated desperada looks better.","replies":[{"poster":"Nagma","date":"2015-07-29T04:51:23.059+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"for me the old desparade was 10000000000x better than this ; but u know riot doesnt care about cassio players feedback","replies":[]},{"poster":"so chad","date":"2015-07-29T04:45:27.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"all opinions are respected here","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-29T20:17:08.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hiya! \n\nFirst off, thanks for the feedback!
