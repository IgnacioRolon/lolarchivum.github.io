Primarily, they’ve made her completely useless until super late game. What does that tell us about Riot’s intentions?\r\n\r\nIt crushes her ability to compete on all non-Summoner’s Rift maps. Late game hypercarries are universally bad on Twisted Treeline, Crystal Scar, and Howling abyss due to the short games times and general lack of ability to farm. By nuking her early/mid game from orbit they’ve managed to avoid spending any real mindshare trying to balance her for these game modes. This is a clear goal of Riot’s with the rework as they had made multiple map-specific nerfs to her recently and even stated that she is difficult to balance on non-SR maps. \r\n\r\nRiot has developed a history of eliminating “out of the ordinary” champions every time they rise up and it looks like now they are gunning for the outcasts even outside of Summoner’s Rift. For many others, and myself the most fun part of URF mode was seeing underused champs like Skarner, Hecarim, Urgot, and Taric rise up from the ashes and stomp their unsuspecting opponents. Once Riot finishes off Cassiopeia they can breathe a sigh of relief because finally Twisted Treeline will be dominated by the usual suspects such as Ziggs, Syndra, Oriana, Morgana, and Lulu.","replies":[{"poster":"KSHarrison","date":"2014-09-05T14:46:56.117+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot has never balanced for SR around other map modes.  To expect them to do that is an impossible task; balancing for one map is already hard enough!  Any champions that function on both maps well are coincidences or have been subject to post-tuning by their Dominion/TT teams.\n\nCassiopeia is a well-known lane bully when she was competitively viable.  It may be that in her current state, if Riot were to have buffed her to viability, her lane bully may have resurfaced.  In fact, if I am not mistaken, she was recently nerfed on TT because of her power!\n\nThey do reworks to put champions in more tunable positions exactly so they can expand champion versatility.  In Cassiopeia's case, they are accomplishing this by making her kit even more thematically consistent than she previously was, so I don't get this outlandish conspiracy claim that Riot is trying to eliminate out-of-the-ordinary champions.  Some more examples that Riot supports out-of-the-ordinary:\n\nTheir Xerath rework was pretty unique, introducing a new long-range mechanic not seen before.\nAzir is probably the most unique champion I've seen yet.\nGnar\nBraum\nVel'Koz\nYasuo\n\nAll of these champs have been some of the most unique and out-of-the-ordinary champs to date.  I don't get your claim at all.\n\nEven the reworks are pushing champions to become more unique.\n\nNidalee\nSona\nGragas\n\nThey are also advancing the meta in a direction catering to out-of-the-ordinary champions.  They removed the stranglehold of early lane bullies and have tried to buff tanky junglers.  They are actively affecting the meta with a goal to expand champion viability.  Even Lulu in solo lanes they did not shut down.  *They specifically adjusted her to preserve her various roles, rather than pigeonhole her as support.*\n\nSo not following OP's position at all, sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"Morello","date":"2014-09-05T23:56:51.600+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":15,"body":"Very true - Casseopia - WHEN powerful - is a lane bully only.

Compared to the full reworks like Nidalee, this is definitely smaller in scale.  I doubt the word choice here was meant to imply they will be taking the changes casually.\n\nAs for her identity as a DoT caster, I can't deny frustration losing that.

But I have never seen that as her main purpose in league. That's Ryze's gig, being the machine gun of league and all. Cass is the DoT queen.\n\nBesides, if riot really wanted to tone down her lane bullying, all they had to do was tone down the base dmg on her Q for her early lvls while leaving the late game dmg on her q untouched.\n\nAlso, I thought riot was against giving champs pure stat buffs in their kit.

The massive amounts of AP you may be able to stack in the course of this game are a mere illusion since her ratios drag them down to live Cass-levels of damage at best.\n\nAll you did was lock away whatever power the current Cass had for over half an hour and not giving anything remarkable in return. What makes you think people will suddenly pick her up after those harsh nerfs? Not only are you alienating her already small playerbase, you're also making her unplayable for everyone else. [I strongly suggest checking out the poll in this thread.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/miAxAAz0-riot-please-rethink-your-approach-on-cassiopeia)\n\nYou only have one tool to deal damage now and that is her E, too bad the actual range on the thing is too short for comfort. She already had terrible issues against assassins and mages who outranged her in the past, now she's even worse off since they instantly get to bully HER once she goes in for the E-lasthit. \n\nAlso how do you even justify a 14 (!) second cooldown on miasma, an ability which hardly deals damage anymore and has such a weak slow before you get around to max it (which is at around level 18)? And how come you didn't fix the terrible issues of her ultimate aka the clunky hitbox, the awful delay and the short range? It's among the most unreliable ultimates in the entire game and you decide to NERF it for a mere 10 second cooldown reduction?\n\nHer kit is inherently flawed and needs more safety to make up for her terrible squishyness and lack of power during the earlier stages of the game. You definitely need to lower the poison-stack-cap or at least allow her to collect more by poisoning multiple champions at once so that she may reach that desired carry status a lot faster before it's too late.\n\nEvery other hypercarry in this game has some kind of backup to secure their survival (some form of instant mobility, huge range, a reliable stun or inherent tankyness), that's NOT the case for Cassiopeia. I don't see how she's ever going to recover once she falls behind in lane since the nerfs to her ratios are pretty much the final nail in the coffin. Once that happens, she's nothing more but a liability to her team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-09-06T00:40:30.466+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Umm...Cassiopeia's changes isn't just low-scope, but it's horrendous in how it completely does away with her MAIN APPEAL. It's not mashing E to shoot a barrage of fangs the size of her torso. She is supposed to be THE POISON MAGE OF LoL. Yet you guys chose to remove the significance of her poison in favour of the most boring aspect of her entire kit, the ability that has NOTHING to do with Poison at all. When I heard of a rework, I was hoping you'd emphasize her POISON, not downplay it so disappointingly hard.\n\n\nAlso, your direction for her rework is the complete antithesis of what POISON should be.\n\n> 1. Poison as a status should NEVER be a means of buffing or making the user stronger outside of extremely specific circumstances (think Resident Evil, where a scientist injects himself with the G-Virus to mutate and grow)\n> \n> 2. The signature theme of Poison should be to DEBILITATE. To eat away at your opponent over a long period of time somehow\n\nBe it, significant amounts of poison damage over a long period of time, or an initially small, but ramping style of debuff. What I liked most about playing Cassiopeia in Normal games is how in Sieges, you could slowly rot away the enemy team with your poison. A well-placed miasma to punish the enemies trying to take your turret. Throw in some Q-pokes, and without them realizing it, that significant poison damage slowly erodes away at their health before my team dives in for the kill. Be it defending or attacking, her poison was satisfying in a siege, NOT her Fangs. And no, the slow in her W really doesn't cut it. Asides from being a marginal increase at the final level at best, Slow is far too common a debuff to really make her Poison feel particularly debilitating, especially when you're building Rylai's anyways.\n\n\n\nFor more detail, please visit [THIS](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4842156&highlight=poison+debilitate) thread about why her Rework is disappointing. This is the complete opposite direction she should have gone as it does away with her identity as THE poison mage.\n\n\n\nI don't want a Cassiopeia whose Poison serves only to make her stronger and aid her E. The correct path is to make her Poison be central to her playstyle, and her E is faciliating her Poison strategy somehow, not the other way around. Her Passive takes what is so satisfying about Poison, and completely turns it around. **Aspect of Poison shouldn't be making Cassiopeia stronger, her Poison should be making her enemies WEAKER.**\n\n\n\n\nAnd while we're here. I'd like to make one more point over all this. The designer(I assume it's Stashu) of the Rework only ever lurks the PBE forums from what I can see. This means it is impossible to get your opinion on a champion you love heard unless you happen to be a PBE-member right at the point that champion relevant to YOU is being reworked. **The direction of this rework completely removes what makes Poison so satisfying**, and the designer(s) seems to be oblivious of that problem. But it's impossible to let them know this bit unless you're a PBE-er yourself.\n\n\n**PS **- sorry for the wall-of-text. But Rioters are being really hush hush about Cassiopeia's changes outside of PBE(refer to the final paragraph), so I really felt the need to unload everything at once. I want to play a POISON MAGE. Not one where poison does the opposite of what it should do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2014-12-03T02:40:19.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Very true - Casseopia - WHEN powerful - is a lane bully only.

Everything is focused in rapid fire E with Cass which is what Ryze does but better, he has reliable CC, ends up way tankier with better spellvamp and aoe damage while being a AP super carry machine gun.\n\nCass actually had a good identity that needed further polish yet instead the team went in the opposite direction with it. Her DoTs are the strongest in the game with Swain coming a close 2nd. You get hit by her Q when it was maxed and it really hurt or you sit in her W too much you pay for it by a chunk of health missing but her biggest issues still are her range and her immobility which doesn't change with the current rework and will ultimately be what causes this rework to flop hard, you go Cass mid i go a assassin mid or a longer range mage and dominate since there is nothing Cass can do(assassin's mobility or long range mage's poke). Go Cass top and she gets ran over by the tanky brusiers that can gapclose or pull her. She will have no niche that is worth taking her.\n\nIf Riot wants to keep Cass relevant then either tone back the mobility creep majorly or make Cass more mobile or tanky since she is a low range mage otherwise why take her when you can take something that fits the meta better or Ryze more so Ryze if this rework goes through","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Queen Viper","date":"2014-09-07T16:35:28.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh Morello, these changes are for the worse.

It's kinda sad really, since not only you are making her early game even harder than it already is, quite similar to what Poppy has now... you are also making my gameplay of choice, playing her as a DoT poison Mage, obsolete.
