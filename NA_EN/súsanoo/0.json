Just because they spam out certain champs doesn’t mean you need to nerf the hell out of them and let all the regular players feel the unfairness from it. It’s not fair at all. \r\n\r\nYou nerf Akali again and again and again, yet you aren’t coming to the fact that you failed on the rework. Now you are burying her more and more into the ground. Yet, other Reddit pages have a Rioter that talks with the mains about the changes they were going to do to a champ. Diana for instance, they cancelled all of those changes because they felt what it was going to do to the champ, from the community.\r\n\r\nWhere is the Rioter to talk to the Akali mains? No where to be found.\r\n\r\nWhy don’t you delete her from the game at this point? I know you can’t do a rework, because it’ll cost more money. Gosh damn it, stop NERFING HER!!","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-05-31T04:21:04.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has specifically stated this will never happen, for several reasons:\n\n*  Vastly more effort for development and balance\n\n* Disconnection between normal players and pros: people want to try stuff pros are playing, and understand what is going on\n\n* A very harsh divide for players transitioning to pro games; basically switching to a different game with different meta.\n\n* Pro Metagame would be unstable, normal metagame would likely cease to exist, everything would turn into a long-term balance distaster over multiple patch cycles.\n\nHaving Master Yi be broken as fuck in low ELO while Ryze is crap is the lesser evil.","replies":[]}]}
