I&#039;m so tired of players who can&#039;t take responsibility for their own deaths in their own lane. They die at level 2 and then go &quot;WTF NOOB JUNGLERS REPORT THIS RETARD&quot;. This isn&#039;t even an exaggeration. This kind of crap happens all the time and it sets how the rest of the game will go even if you just mute them and don&#039;t say anything. Even if you take the blame and say something like okay sorry ill gank for you. So you come back a minute or two later and attempt the gank. The laner misses every skillshot completely miss plays but you still get a flash. You know what you get? &quot;LOL LOOK AT THIS RETARD JUNGLER PLZ REPORT NOOB GANKS FUCKING WORST GUY EVER CANT EVEN GET KILL STAY THE FUCK OUT OF MY LANE YOU SALTY SCRUB&quot;. \r\n\r\nThis game has literally gotten to the point where I honestly believe the community is retarded. Had a game earlier today with an urgot who flames me the whole time at champ select. I said highly prefer jungle. Jungle is my best role. His response &quot;fucking noob can only play one role rofl&quot; &quot;someone else pick jungle so this fucking scrub cant have it&quot;. lolwhat? So the team doesnt say anything i get jungle and all is good right? NOPE urgot starts flaming again because no one took jungle from me simply because he felt like trolling or whatever his agenda was. So he takes smite and goes &quot;duo jungle new meta&quot;. No one says anything..... At the last second he switches back to ignite and goes &quot; Just kidding you fucking noobs&quot;. He then goes into the game and feeds. Flames me and the team jumps on the bandwagon and i get reported for being bad. \r\n\r\nThis game has become so bad because of this community. Everyone acts like a raging hormonal 13 year old(maybe they are). This behavior eventually rubs off on me and then I eventually start to flame to. Why does every single week that goes by seem like the game gets worse and worse? Riot continues to do nothing(big surprise). My theory is all the good/smart players leave the game because they get tired of listening to what i presume is endless flaming from 13 year olds. As more and more smart players leave the game the ratio of bad to good players increases. I don&#039;t claim to be the best, but some of these players can&#039;t even make sense out of what they say. Like these players who die at level 2 and go &quot;WTF REPORT NOOB JUNGLER NO GANKS&quot;. It makes you just want to punch your monitor and scream ITS ONLY MINUTE 3 IN THE WHOLE FUCKING GAME I JUST TOOK MY FIRST BLUE BUFF WTF DO YOU MEAN NO GANKS.\r\n\r\nI will be leaving the game now because the community sucks the life out of you and they make the game not enjoyable. I feel like Riot is a huge part of the problem. They claim they want a nice friendly non toxic game but then design things that breed toxicity. For instance they do NOTHING about trolls/afks/int feeders. Does Riot Lyte with all his fancy degrees not understand simple concepts? The trolls,afks/int feeders (whose sole purpose is to piss other players off and ruin the experiance) get free reign over the game and ruin it for people who actually are trying to win and have fun. The trolls,afks, int feeders eventually break nice players and the nice players turn into toxic ones. Riot also drew a lot of attention to this whole report system and tribunal that are next to useless. Now people focus so much on reporting others rather than focusing on the game and trying to win. you died once &quot;reported&quot; make one mistake &quot;reported&quot; ask the suppport to toss a ward down &quot;you&#039;re salty reported&quot;. Its out on control and lets be real here reporting does nothing.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who quit months ago because of how bad the community is was telling me he was watching nightblue3 and nightblue was walking about how Riot Lyte is an idiot. Nightblue3 was talking about how putting in an in game voice chat would help things and lower the amount of flaming. I strongly agree that an in game voice chat would lower the amount of toxic people. It puts a voice to a name and humanizes the players. Its a lot easier to type and flame someone than to talk actual shit to them. According to nightblue3 Riot Lyte said an in game voice system would increase toxicity by 186% or some random number he pulled out of his ass. How would this increase toxicity Lyte please do explain this very interesting numbers that you pulled from your ass. Lets be real here the real numbers your worried about how much money it would cost riot to implement something like an in game voice chat. Riot would have to pump out a little dough to make it happen. We all know though that Riot would never invest money into something that improves the quality of life in their community. Riot is full of shit and they lie like every company does.","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-04-06T23:59:31.731+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been a jungle main since season 3.

Yes you can mute them, but at this point they just want to see you fail. On ganks they may just choose not to do anything or start feeding simply because \"you don't deserve to win\".","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-04-07T00:14:04.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it shouldn't get to any other point.

Jungler's job is objective control and preventing enemy jungler ganks.

I have no problem trying to help a lane that is behind but I will not gank if your health is low and your opponent is near full...
