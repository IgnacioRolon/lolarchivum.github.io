The best way to explain this is, whenever I press keys on my keyboard, sometimes my desktop will respond instead of my league client, causing me to not be able to push ability hotkeys, access my keyboard for league at all, etc. In order to access my keyboard again for league, I'll either have to push escape a bunch of times, or tab out and back in.\n\nIt's really really been annoying me during gameplay, and I was hoping some of you mac users may be able to help if you have experienced this issue before. \n\nPlease no answers such as: \"Your problem is that your playing on a mac pleb.\"\n\nThanks fellas.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T19:23:01.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you recently installed any new software for your keyboard or mouse then that could be getting in the way or overwriting commands.
