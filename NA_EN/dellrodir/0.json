This wouldnt be so weird if my ping is bad, but it isnt, its on 39-50 every single second. FPS is also great (170-190) \r\n\r\nSo, does anyone know how to fix this?\r\n\r\n          Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-09T22:43:41.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you clarify what you mean by \"lag spikes\"? *Lag* is often used as a catch-all term that can mean different things to different people, so providing a few more details can help me help you. ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Dellrodir","date":"2017-01-12T00:26:30.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It usually happens when I confront  champion or minions.

I don't drop in frames nor does my ping spike upward but my champ sometimes just won't respond to my commands.  My character will just stop responding and I watch as other champions mow me down while I just stand still.  It'll fix itself after a few seconds but it still makes the game go in favor for the other team quite often.  Whenever I click it shows the animation from my cursor but my champion just won't move.
