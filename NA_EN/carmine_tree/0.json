Sorry if that&#039;s not your thing.\n\nI have two close friends irl that are extremely toxic in game, and one who is not usually toxic but when he does flame it can be really bad. I am close friends with two, and one is the little brother of one of the two.\n\nAll three are much better at the game then I. To be fair, I started last season and they have been playing for three years. They are all around a plat level while my main is in low silver. (posting this on smurf for obvious reasons)\n\nA = first friend, not usually toxic but can become extremely bad if he tilts\nB = always toxic, generally dick person who has made friends cry\nC= lil bro of A, likes to be hella toxic and claim he&#039;s &#039;trolling.&#039;\n\nWe all voice call when we play, A does invite me often to norms. Those 3 are best friends and I am often forced to play with the less likeable B and C because of it. We all use voice comms and sometimes we will invite other friends to join us (most are around bronze-silver)\n\nI usually play support with them. I&#039;ll generally have to support for B. He loves to flame me for every little mistake I make, even if it&#039;s not always my fault. He&#039;ll call me a &#039;retard&#039; and a &#039;pussy&#039; and loves to tell me that &#039;even though you&#039;re a girl you can&#039;t even play support lul&#039;. Always tells me (and our other friends) that we&#039;re &#039;shit&#039; and he can make super hurtful comments, both on call and in game. He has made friends cry.\n\nC will jungle, and loves to make passive aggressive comments and laugh whenever I don&#039;t ult to save him or make perfect plays. He _loves_ to repeatedly remind me that I am useless, that I only play with them because I want free elo and that I am simply a rock that they have to carry. I always express my frustration, but he will apologise usually after over pm and tell me that he&#039;s &#039;simply trolling.&#039; Idm making jokes with him, at least he&#039;s better than B, he will apologise and can be constructive.\n\nA is probably the closest out of all of them to me. He is also the best player out of our group, he&#039;s high plat/low diamond. He&#039;s generally chill, usually constructive but when he tilts all hell breaks loose. Since he is the closest to me, he hurts a lot more. He&#039;ll call me a retard, %%%%, useless, shit, worse that bronze etc. He did this to my best friend, who had to quit for two weeks because of it. He won&#039;t admit it&#039;s flame, either.\n\nI am not good at this game, but I feel as if they expect me to be amazing. I am silver, not diamond. I&#039;m going to make mistakes.\n\nHow do I deal with these toxic friends? I don&#039;t want to avoid playing with them, but is there a better way to deal? I usually have thick skin but with irl friends it hurts a lot more.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2018-08-15T08:08:51.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Locking this necro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CodyBear ","date":"2017-01-27T00:20:20.051+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First Unfriend them in LOL.

If they want to continue doing it; you do not have to play the game with them. \n\nMake it clear that they are abusive in game and that you are fine hanging out in IRL cause they are upsetting you. \n\nif you feel like you need evidence of them saying this stuff (cause they do not hear them selves doing it) you can usually record with most voip programs and play back the parts to them. (have that conversation in IRL though so they see you are serious) \n\nMost people lack empathy over audio only and playing a game at the same time can make it worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-01-26T10:51:59.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"be strong and stand up against it.\n\nTell them clearly to stop and you don't appreciate things they say.\n\n tell them that you will mute them on chat and in voice (if you can ignore what they say, then you can do that instead of muting them) and actually do it, so they know you are serious.\n\nYou can be passive aggressive and say that you'll ignore them irl unless they apologize (it will test whether that friendship is real).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-01-26T04:59:11.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really sure \"friends\" is the right term for them. If they are your actual friends, talk to them and tell them it's not okay to say shit like that. If they don't listen or act even worse, then it would probably be in your best interest for your own mental health to not hang around them. No one should have to be berated, especially not by people they consider friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Carmine Tree","date":"2017-01-26T05:10:52.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I have talked to A and C about it and they have promised to be nicer.

At this point I have been refusing to support him, telling him to go another lane and that it would be better for both of us, he will be less frustrated and I won't have to deal with him as much. A understands that B is really toxic, and to avoid confrontation will generally take my side and tell B to Mid. It's just sucky because he's so stubborn.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LORDCRUSHINGT0N","date":"2018-08-15T06:35:19.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"W01fedin","date":"2018-08-15T07:18:45.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LORDCRUSHINGT0N,realm=OCE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=dxa6qFmo,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-08-15T06:35:19.139+0000)\n>\n> please tell me you didnt ditch your irl friends over a game\n\nthis is 2 years old, just a friendly reminder to check the date before posting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Seigvale","date":"2017-01-28T17:09:43.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats more important?

At my university there's a class where I'm with some of the freshmen and I see a lot of them playing LoL. \n\nIn person they are totally reasonable and pretty friendly, but I've never played LoL with most of them because I've watched them play and they are extremely toxic in game.. ping spamming people for mistakes the whole game, criticizing people's builds as if there's only 1 right way to build each champ, telling people to kys for asking them to stop flaming, it's really bizarre. It's almost like it's becoming a fad to be as much of an asshole as possible in this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"luhegha7","date":"2017-01-26T17:49:34.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aight","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Cat Tosha","date":"2017-01-26T07:56:45.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talk to them about it.
