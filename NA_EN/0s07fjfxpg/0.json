The thread was asking for more communication from Riot regarding the Harrowing and specifically the Harrowing skins.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a thread asking for info on the Harrowing skins, in the Story, Art & Sound board.  Now, to be clear - _I did not delete the thread_ - it didn't even occur to me that it was in the wrong Board.  Were I the one in charge, I'd have probably let it go, seeing as there was so many of you guys feeling so strongly on the topic.  However, that's probably why I'm not the one in charge :)\n\nTo follow up - no, the thread didn't get deleted because I went completely off the rails, started foaming at the mouth, and screamed anti-Riot propaganda.  Because I didn't :)  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/3oOeMrt.gif\n\nFrom what I can see, the thread was deleted because it was in the wrong Board - and it seems the mods are slowly doing a cleanup of misplaced threads.  So, not because it was popular, or wasn't a cheer-leading thread, or anything sinister like that.  Not from what I can see.\n\nFor visibility and accountability, my comments are below:\n\n> I'm here. I'm reading the threads. But as you and Mcprowlington suspect, I'm not one who can make any significant changes here. In the background, I'm poking people and asking questions, but on the weekend it's slow to get responses. If I find out anything I can share, I'll definitely make sure to get back here and clear up whatever I can.\n\n> (On a completely personal note, I wish it hadn't gone down like this.)\n\nand comment 2:\n\n> No problem! And I'm pretty sure it's not a hanging offence to have an opinion - even if it might be a little indelicate of me to say it here ;)\n\n> I'd bet there's some good reasons for what's going on, that I don't know about - but if I have around-about the same information that you guys do, and I'm not a fan of it, then how can we expect you guys not to feel the same way? Hopefully I can get some real info soon - hold off on any thanks until then :)\n\nI am still pushing to get some information from someone - and with it being a bright new Monday morning, I'm hoping we can get responses far more quickly.

And if to many people are focused on worlds that you don't have enough. get more.
