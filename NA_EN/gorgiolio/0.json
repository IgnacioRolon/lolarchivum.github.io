Idk, how do you guys feel about Kha Zix&#039;s current state in the game? Does it feel overbearing.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Sotere","date":"2016-08-16T20:56:00.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like most assassin-y types, he has his good games and his bad games, but then he has his really really good games and really bad games. Those really really good games tend to be frustrating playing against, but he tends to allow more responses to him than Rengar.  The upside/downside is that if you don't respond immediately, his capacity to leap through an entire team is higher.  \n\nHe's performing slightly better than I'd expect given how popular he is becoming, but don't think it warrants immediate action.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxDogmanxxx","date":"2016-08-17T15:35:29.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels like he unloads his damage way too quickly now. I had no problem with him until Riot decided to let him buffer his skills in mid-air. Even after that buff though, I think it's actually the buff to both his Q and his W cooldowns that started to make him broken. \n\nI get that an Assassin like KhaZix is supposed to be able to frontload his damage, truly I do. I appreciate that his Q deals a shitload of damage. But now KhaZix's initial Q is unavoidable (on the context that he hits his jump, his initial Q is now unavoidable because it was buffered before the jump even hits), and since it only has a 3-second cooldown, he gets to use it a second time much earlier, because not only does the cooldown start while he's still in mid-air, the cooldown itself is .5 seconds shorter than before.\n\nYou can see why people feel he's become a bit of a problem.\n\nEdit: Also, unlike other Assassins who go in, do a full rotation of their skills, then get out, KhaZix just goes in and stays in the fight dealing massive amounts of sustained damage because his Q is on a 3-second cooldown. It's really quite unfair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gorgiolio","date":"2016-08-16T22:48:50.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really have a problem with his ability to hop around, which is actually pretty skill intensive. So I give those players a thumbs up! It just felt like once he gets a lead, it doesn't matter if you're isolated or not. However, I haven't particularly played against him enough to really have to super good idea of his games where he isn't really super far, but not super behind.
