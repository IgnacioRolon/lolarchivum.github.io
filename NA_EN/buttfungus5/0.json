Riot has set the standards here and you have repeatedly broken and violated those standards.\n \n> apparently i&amp;#039;m in the 0.006% of people who get banned, but i find that hard to believe seeing as the boundaries for getting banned are so easily crossed,\n\nThe problem isn't the boundaries.  The problem is that you keep crossing the boundaries.\n\n >riot needs to find a better solution, i don&amp;#039;t understand why they just perma ban your account when the problem is toxicity, why don&amp;#039;t they just chat restrict your account indefinitely. doesn&amp;#039;t make any sense. \n\n\nThey've practically already tried that.  Before this system we had a system where people would stack restrictions and the result was that some people stacked them indefinetely.\n\nThe problem is that these people resorted to passive aggression/inting and ruining the game experiences without chat","replies":[{"poster":"ButtFungus5","date":"2017-12-01T02:42:24.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"they only did it on the pbe tho. where people could give less of a fuck about their account. not really accurate.","replies":[{"poster":"MadMad Sickness","date":"2017-12-01T02:47:00.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ButtFungus5,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XKApJIxh,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-12-01T02:42:24.685+0000)\n>\n> they only did it on the pbe tho. where people could give less of a fuck about their account. not really accurate.\n\nI pretty sure it wasn't just the pbe and was a widespread system.\n\nIn fact, alot of the code for the IFS came from this previous system and it got its ability to give restrictions from the old system.\n\nSo in summary, we had this as an ongoing situation until Riot fixed it with our current IFS \"escalation\" system.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MadMad Sickness","date":"2017-12-01T01:15:24.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that {{summoner:11}} .\n\nI can't understand why someone would lie about they're chat-logs if Riot is the one with the evidence xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"ButtFungus5","date":"2017-11-29T21:35:00.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I have also never had a problem saying these things for 2 years, its only been the past 2 months for some reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-11-29T21:38:34.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ButtFungus5,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=XKApJIxh,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-11-29T21:35:00.257+0000)\n>\n> I have also never had a problem saying these things for 2 years, its only been the past 2 months for some reason.\n\nTime to evaluate your situation of the past 2 months.\nIf you stopped being a decent summoner, chances are something changed on your end\nBest of luck on your appeal or third account","replies":[{"poster":"ButtFungus5","date":"2017-11-29T21:51:05.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I didn't mean ive become more toxic. i meant that i wasnt getting suspensions and chat restrictions. up until august i think i only had one chat restriction, and if anything i was more toxic back than, than i was in the past 2 months.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Colgate Gator","date":"2017-11-29T21:19:52.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ButtFungus5 you just got your second account banned for toxicity, wtf ButtFungus5.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giojun","date":"2017-11-29T21:17:10.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You deserved it.","replies":[]}]}
