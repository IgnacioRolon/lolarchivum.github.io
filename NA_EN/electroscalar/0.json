I get that this Dawnbringer Riven 2 will be perceived as being sold more - I don't know if it truly will sell more than a knight in full armour who doesn't emphasize her feminine features.\r\n\r\nBut what I do know that this truly was one of the most important characteristics of original Kayle. She was a stoic angel of justice, with big wings, hiding her features behind a mask at all times, slashing judgment with righteous fury. Her distinctive lack of sexual tones (in classic skin) was a deliberate contrast to her fallen sister.\r\n\r\nNow? Her identity in the champion rooster is gone. More wings on ult? New Swain and new Aatrox say hi. But at least now you can see her belly button through her spandex.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I know the art team at Riot can do better than this. This is a sellout. It really hurts.\r\nRiot, can you pour in more resources, to change new Kayle's model and add much more armour? Please. This is simply unfair.\r\n\r\n[https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ca6f91e741baedc72ede498de445b23/tumblr_pn51ph6B081tbpqalo1_1280.png](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ca6f91e741baedc72ede498de445b23/tumblr_pn51ph6B081tbpqalo1_1280.png)\r\n\r\n[https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0a7d24f2b376e8372dbbad21766dc9a/tumblr_inline_pn51ogrstL1rt04q5_540.jpg](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0a7d24f2b376e8372dbbad21766dc9a/tumblr_inline_pn51ogrstL1rt04q5_540.jpg)\r\n\r\n[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504434887168753694/547124568112889857/unknown.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/504434887168753694/547124568112889857/unknown.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Gapybo","date":"2019-02-18T21:30:32.898+0000","up_votes":68,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah this is blatant fan service.

Shes not a tank so her chacter model should not read like one. Did they need to remove as MUCH armor or her helmet for her base skin? probably not. But they still needed to remove some armor to bring her up to current Visual standards, champions who are mostly damage dealers shouldn't look like they can also take a hit if thats not intended. Kayle mostly builds damage right, and theres less focus on her taking damage right? SO aside from when she casts her ultimate she shouldn't look tanky.\n\nNow Im not being biased towards liking her appearance. I strongly dislike it when they make sexy champions that shouldn't be sexy Kai'sa in point, and IK that eventually she will get reworked in someway cause her story really isn't adding up at all with her looks. They need to change her story and her looks. But back to Kayle im just offering an idea for why she has less armor.\n\nIm not sure if its true that she removes armor as she gets stronger I do agree with the people who dont like that...cause it doesnt make any sense.
