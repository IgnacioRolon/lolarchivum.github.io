Click that.\n* A new window opens. In the main paragraph of text is a link that says \"set a custom scaling level\" in blue. Click that.\n* This opens another, smaller window that has a dropdown menu with percentages. Set that to 100%\n\nOnce this was done, the text, and maybe another element or two, in League matches was the correct size again. I think what differentiates this from the slider on the first display settings page is that the advanced one overrides the automatic Windows font scaling.

In resolutions OVER 1080p, Windows has to scale icons and text(the lowest setting being 100% size, and the highest setting being 300 or 400% i believe. Now, I've not gone through any files yet to determine the issue, but if you set your windows scaling settings back to 100% the in game text font will have been restored. However you are left with the issue of having very tiny font, and very small title bars and icons and such. If you understand how to change scaling settings, and properties, then a temporary solution would be to change the scaling settings down to 100% during your duration of game play, then back up after you are done. RIOT's text fonts currently seem to be somehow connected to windows fonts, or at the very least somehow connected to the scaling settings. I came across this issue when i got my new GPU, a gtx 980 Hybrid. I was playing with the DSR settings and found this to have happened. I corrected it by doing the above fix of resetting my in Windows scaling settings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HanNotHon","date":"2015-08-29T04:29:57.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePostMaster","date":"2015-08-27T04:39:42.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay guys and girls, I think I figured this out. So it looks like the problem is that the NVIDIA 860m graphics card (which is the dedicated graphics card used by the Lenovo Y50, and if I'm not mistaken, other computers of similar make) does not support the native 4k resolution of the screen. Now this is a problem because even if you change your in-game League video settings to 1920x1080, your screen's resolution will still be 3840x2160, which means that the game will not be being supported by the NVIDIA graphics card, and will instead be being supported by the Intel graphics card, which is still trying to display in 4k. The solution I found is the following:\n\n1. Go to device manager, and make sure BOTH graphics cards are enabled (for some reason, it seems like both graphics cards have to be enabled for the computer to use the NVIDIA one, which I won't pretend to understand, and I should be corrected if I'm wrong.)\n2. Change the screen resolution of your Laptop to 1920x1080.\n3. Restart your computer.\n4. Open League and load into a custom game. The problem should be solved.\n \nIf this solution doesn't work for you, try making sure your NVIDIA graphics card's driver HAS been updated with the most recent release from NVIDIA, FOR that graphics card (this is apparently very important for notebook graphics cards.)\n\nIf it still doesn't work definitely leave a reply to my comment and if I have time I would be more than willing to sit down and work the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"lmThePoroKing","date":"2015-08-27T14:24:59.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried your method and it didnt work for me.
