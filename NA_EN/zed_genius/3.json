I'm a support main, Soraka specifically. And when I play Soraka, I'm super nice and optimistic. But the minute I lock in Master Yi jungle, I instantly start getting super salty at everything. I even flame my teammates if the game is particularly bad. I don't think its even that certain playstyles attract certain types of people. I think that certain playstyles actually encourage/induce different mental states. It's kinda creepy actually.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-11-03T23:12:09.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I worry I might agree with you on this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2017-11-03T22:47:15.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stereotypes usually start from truth, but are just over publicized and then kept true by people hyper-noticing the instances that they are true for. It's not that \"people keep them alive\", but that there is probably a small increased chance for things like rage quitting or feeding to happen with people who play those champions and you notice them because you are familiar with the stereotype.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xion The XIV","date":"2017-11-03T22:51:59.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Yasuo one is hilarious. Because majority of them are their stereotype. Vayne Mains are the exact same. They will try to 1v5 and lose and blame it on no peel. I have made so many Rivens rage quit I think it's a Meme now. The problem is people are not keeping the Stereotypes around it's that the players are keeping it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fools Hesltate","date":"2017-11-03T22:35:21.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion kits themselves inherently attract that type of player.","replies":[]}]}
