This in no way impacts his ganking and only his jungle clear and a little of his dueling capabilities will actually benefit from this change.\n\nOkay I'll tell you what Ahri got nerfed in just 2 seasons:\n\nPassive heal was halved.\nHer Q is fine, got some mana cost increase\nHer w range and base damage and ap ratio was gutted\nHer e no longer stops dashes when it is a taunt.\nHer r range and base damage and ap ratio was gutted\n\nLee Sin got ulti nerfs? Was every part of his kit nerfed? Did he get a range nerf? Hitbox nerf? Ahri has 52~54% winrate because Ahri was made into an easy soloq champ, that winrate is fine and balanced. An easy champ with that winrate means the balance is in good state. However, after her many nerfs after her winrate dropped to less than 50% winrate at diamond and above. \n\nDespite Lee Sin having a low winrate, he is still consistently picked in diamond and above and sometimes used in competitive as well. Ahri was fine and she was probably the most balanced champ in game. Her nerf in patch 7.11 was extremely unnecessary especially when there was tank meta + lethality item buffs or w.e that basically ruined Ahri all together. \n\nAlso I am speaking from season 5, not before. Ahri before was considered weak.

Then he is getting a buff but Ahri is not? Psst.\n\nFirstly, you talk about ahri being balanced around having a high winrate and being an easy to play champion. With that in mind, you also understand that an easy to play champion will have a consistent winrate through all all leagues. This also means a more complex, harder to master champion, such as Lee, will have a far larger discrepancy between ELOs. With this discrepancy comes A higher potential, meaning someone who masters said champion will beat out an easy to play champion most of the time with the trade off of more skill and effort involved. This means a good Lee will have a higher winrate than a good Ahri, or at least should. Were he to have a lower winrate in every ELO, I can guarantee the buff would be far more significant\n\nOnce again, Lee's buff is minor. Very minor. Compare this to the last time his shield was buffed, where rank 5 afforded +80, far more significant as it was something he maxed 2nd after that point.\n\nAnd to close this out, ahri is currently just below 51%. This is fine. If an easy to play champion has between 50-52%, then they are currently well balanced.\nCompare this to garen and Annie, both at 51-52% and probably the pinnacle of simple champs.\nIf you want to talk about gutted easy champs, fiddlesticks is a good starting point, or braum, shen or karma. None of these champions are particularly complex yet have far lower winrates. This is gutted.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2017-09-11T12:30:27.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TwinkiePro,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=qWUx2Gl5,comment-id=00060000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-11T06:49:52.151+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t have much time to really present a full argument, but this part irked me the most:\n> \n> Firstly, you talk about ahri being balanced around having a high winrate and being an easy to play champion.

None of these champions are particularly complex yet have far lower winrates. This is gutted.\n\nHowever Ahri was made into a skill dependent champ by making her rely on her charm for damage. I dont consider Lee Sin skill dependent. \n\nAhri's winrate is below 50%. That is sad for a champ that requires great mechanics to play. A masted Annie has also around 58% winrate compared to Ahri's 55.30% winrate. And in average Ahri's winrate is below 50%. So what is the point of choosing a hard champ that relies on skill shot when you can choose Annie and win more no matter how much you played her or have experience with her. It is totally not fair Ahri was forced out of meta because of all the nerf to her kit that completely destroyed her playstyle and her damage was gutted because of stupid items like Gunblade which Ahri is forced to build it now. Do you know how bad the build path for gunblade is? It is horrible but it is the only item that can give Ahri burst. \n\nI did say Riot balances around making Ahri easy, sure, Ahri was way harder before but Riot destroyed her skill cap by gutting her range and every single part of her kit in the name of \"rework.\" At least Lee Sin was never hit by a fake thing called rework that actually destroyed the entire champ's kit. Rework is just one way to ruin a champ conpletely. It is to remove the high skill cap of champ and balance around the idea that everyone can play the champ. That id also the reason for Vayne rework. Yes riot does not like how Vayne does so much damage, and damage means carry. So riot wants to completely gut her damage so that she can't carry as hard anymore. Make her only good against tanks and make her not appealing to anything else. Riot has constantly nerfed damages of champ because damage is what makes carry champs carry. Range is also very important that basically removed Lucian from bot lane. Ahri's range was gutted(like Lucian) and her damage was gutted(like vayne coming up). Ahri's kit was entirely destroyed after the rework and you think Lee Sin had it worse? Hahahahahhahahahaha. \n\nIt feels soo bad for my main to be ruined like this. She didn't even need the last nerf and people think she is fine? She is absolutely destroyed and Riot's going to keep her in dumpster only because riot hates ahri for some reason. But riot makes skin for her? Well ya cuz it makes money. Treat us like trash and take our money is what Riot's doing. \n\nPeople usually only refer to Irelia as Olaf'd(before) but I consider Ahri to be in a MUCH more of a nerfed state than any other champ. Sure winrate shows she is fine, that is average. 55% as Ahri even if you mastered her skill shot and all and 58% winrate on Annie with her point click stuns and all. So much for high risk high reward huh. Riot gutted Ahri's reward playstyle and made her a support midlaner who brings charm and only that. Riot will keep Ahri trash because she is not fun to see in esports or w.e. While all other apc is getting a buff Ahri is kept out from all of it. Seems really nice. Lol. At least Lee Sin's core playstyle did not change nor was his Assassin's or w.e. Ahri's early game is weak, her mid is average, and her late is garbage. Whereas Lee's early and mid is great, and his late is trash. So yeah Ahri was just gutted so hard up to the point she is below 50% winrate and a mastered Ahri only brings like what 55.30% winrate? So much for reward for landing skill shots. \n\nRiot's balancing has been garbage tier. They kept on nerfing Ahri because of the failed rework and now they say she is fine? After destroying her entire kit they say it is fine? Lol. They don't know anything about balance and don't care about Ahri player's feeling. But the community argue she is fine. People are so blind sometimes. If you main midlane Ahri is the easiest matchup for nearly any midlaner. Ahri counters no one pre 6 because her early game is really weak and it cannot be abused. But other champs counter Ahri. Assassins do. Melee ad's do. Ranged mages do as well. But what is her reward? Avergae mid and garbage late. Her outplay on her ultimate is useless since she does no damage even if she lands her stuff. Riot really made Ahri baad.

Keep in mind though, those 0-10 ahri is just as useful for data as other champs. People claim Ahri is easy but they feed lol. People usually assume it in their mind before actually trying her out. \n\nI'll think about taking teleport. That may be a good spell to consider. Compared to other roamers, I don't consider Ahri all that great. I guess tp can help a lot with that. Thanks. \n\nHowever, I don't think I will use Ahri in ranked much anymore after I heard what many other Ahri mains said about using her to climb right now.
