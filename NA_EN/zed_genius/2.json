If that is not enough then add a small AD ratio on it as well. The ability itself is pretty good but really only useful for allied unless you waste your escape to dash in front of it. This way his AD potential will be increased while not effecting his AP style either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2017-09-19T16:07:23.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a map?","replies":[]}]}
