This isn't because they're afraid of confrontation, but because they already have enough shit to deal with and don't need this retard making things worse.\n\nJust because you don't get into a homoerotic wrestling match over every little thing that crosses you doesn't mean you're a spineless doormat.

If you can't or won't interact with others in a neutral or positive manner then multiplayer online games are not for you. From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=1#post43465401): \n\n>**People who report are simply being oversensitive. The mute button exists for a reason.**\n\n>Lets start with the Riot quote on this (link (http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=30696571#post30696571)):\n\n>_**Why is verbal abuse punishable if there is a mute button/language filter?**\nPlayers shouldnt need to rely on features like the mute button or language filter to engage with other players in positive ways. When a player verbally abuses another player and forces him to use the mute button, they have already created a negative experience for that player._\n\n>Simply put, Riot says no. You can scream and cry all you want, but it is their house and their rules.\n\n>With that out of the way, I think the topic deserves some further discussion. The theory is that, if people resolved to care less, then they would be happier. I often refer to this as Argument from Stoicism and I think it is a fairly weak philosophy because it places the burden on the person being expected to endure the behavior rather than the person exhibiting the behavior. You should be able to handle it is just a flimsy excuse for being a bully or a jerk. I have to be the bigger man so that you can do whatever you want? That hardly seems fair.\n\n>There is also the issue of how I spend my limited free time. Like most people, I am constantly required to make value judgments between the different forms of entertainment that are available to me and, let's be honest, we live in an age of nearly limitless entertainment options. If I'm having a bad day in League, I can just fire up Steam and play a whole bunch of games that don't require me to put up with someone's BS.\n\n>This is not an issue of weakness or thin-skin; it's a question of choosing activities that don't leave me feeling frustrated and angry. Too many of those experiences and I'll just find something else to do. Riot knows this.\n\n>**EDITED 18 JULY 2014**\n\nAs for why people insta-mute at the start of the game, usually it's so that they can avoid being tempted to rage at and flame their teammates. I don't agree with it, but if that's what they have to do not to be a verbally abusive jerk in the chat then so be it.","replies":[{"poster":"LeilabHxT","date":"2016-09-11T01:28:20.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You say online multiplayer games are not for me yet I have played many competitive multiplayer games and never once been banned even slightly punished for slight cussing, telling someone theyre bad and a cuck.

Yes it's just one example, but it proves that they do get punished.\n\nNot only that, but the people punished for this stuff usually know why they were punished and as such rarely come here to complain about their bans, hence why we see more people complaining about verbal abuse bans more than anything else.\n\n>Sorry but I&#x27;m pretty sure the people who are toxic and or just trash talking are actually playing to WIN like a competitive environment is supposed to be and atleast not losing intentionally.\n\nYou can play to win without being a jerk to people when things don't go your way.
