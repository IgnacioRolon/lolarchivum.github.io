Nidalee is currently strong in the jungle, so buffing weaker junglers might fix the problem and that's what they're waiting to see. If you buff weak junglers and nerf Nidalee, she might not be able to compete anymore and they would just end up reversing the nerf. Nerfing a champion is basically the same exact thing as buffing every other champion, and buffing one champion is the same as nerfing every other champion. If she ends up needing a nerf still then she'll get it, relax.","replies":[{"poster":"The Whamboozler","date":"2015-03-25T17:30:34.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsugaga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ssPiVPxw,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-25T15:15:53.074+0000)\n>\n> Balanced is focused around how the game is currently played.

Her kit is obnoxious and the enemy rarely has any interaction with her unless it's because she got lucky with a spear and is jumping in to blow them up in .5 seconds.  Why does she get to have the long-range damage of a poke mage, the sustain of a bruiser and the mobility/burst of an assassin?   Her kit needs a rework.  Just because she's not going to be in-meta right not doesn't make her well-designed.  It just means her counters will be popular so she won't be.  Once tank-meta passes, she'll be right back to where she was last patch and people will start complaining about her again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarshallBananna","date":"2015-03-25T15:19:16.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tsugaga,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ssPiVPxw,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-25T15:15:53.074+0000)\n>\n> ... **If she ends up needing a nerf still then she'll get it, relax.**\n\nlaughed","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Acidic Puddle","date":"2015-03-25T15:12:27.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Did you even watch the fucking patch rundown.
