You should compare it to one of the only two other stacking mechanics in the game that involves armor: Seeker's Armguard. That has a definite hard cap on it.\n\nThe other is Thresh's Damnation, but that ability is terribly designed, so don't encourage Rioters to build off it.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-08-20T01:31:41.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"seekers armguard is also weirdly designed, when you upgrade it it doesn't matter how much you stacked it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MarshallBananna","date":"2015-08-19T19:29:40.080+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":1,"body":"The fact that this thread, which is calling out a factual mistake on the 5.16 patch notes, actually got downvotes pretty much confirms this forum is full of idiots","replies":[{"poster":"MasqureMan","date":"2015-08-20T08:00:10.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MarshallBananna,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YOxGri70,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-19T19:29:40.080+0000)\n>\n> The fact that this thread, which is calling out a factual mistake on the 5.16 patch notes, actually got downvotes pretty much confirms this forum is full of idiots\n\nIdiots = people who don't use the pbe?
