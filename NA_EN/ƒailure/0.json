A lot of people get banned after first use of cheating/3rd party programs. Riot uses some kind of detection system which can detect less sophisticated cheats easily. Those are usually free easily accessible cheats. Only those that people sell, that are a bit more sophisticated are hard to detect, but they get caught eventually too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-08-28T17:50:41.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A, albeit poor, explanation for a negative win rate in silver is that someone bought a silver account that had be botted to 30.

If you have anything like Voice Attack or some kind of streaming software... Anything that interfaces in some way with other applications, it might've read that as potential cheating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2017-08-28T18:32:32.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why the down votes.
