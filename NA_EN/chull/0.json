Simply put the changes to his kit will make his numbers look better on paper but make his game play feel slow and clunky, like we aren't even playing the same champion. We aren't asking for much, just that you reconsider these changes and hold off on them until further testing is done to be able to make some good changes while keeping his game play the same fluid fun one that a lot of players fell in love with. Sylas is one of the few champs in the game that makes it fun for us. Please don't take that away.  \r\n\r\nComment #ChampFeelMatters and your thoughts and suggestions in the chat if you agree and maybe they will listen to the community and tread more carefully in the future when making similar decisions with not just Sylas but other champions that need balancing.

I agree with the consent to strictly make him a midlaner instead of a jungler. I just fail to see how the removal of his autoresets benefit his gameplay experience, as well as the questionable extra stack on his passive. Please, if a rioter is reading this, consider the approach of changing sylas. Please don't make him a statcheck. Currently he is a multidimensional champion and most of us Sylasplayers don't like where these changes are heading. \n\nThe changes he has recieved on the PBE push him into an assassin playstyle, where he may oneshot someone by hitting E2 and W (+Lichbane AA) on his target before using zonyas and repeating the whole process. I agree that the removal of the shild would make that playstyle less tilting for the enemy player.\n\nIn my opinion though you could just not remove his skillexpression and add some damage onto his onhit passive (not the AOE portion) and remove the damagebuff from his E2 and the shild from his E1. Perhaps make his AD ults scale a tiny bit better as it used to; his anti-mage identity I can't support (most demacian champions do physical damage anyways) and there is the question to why not just pick kassadin at that point?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CandyReign","date":"2019-12-14T13:56:45.245+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":3,"body":"these changes are going to ruin the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CaptainAntiHeroz","date":"2019-12-14T13:44:27.859+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean some of it seems nice like the W healing even if it doesn't connect but literally almost everything else isn't good unless they are trying to balance him by turning him into a champ thats not played","replies":[]},{"poster":"FSRER","date":"2019-12-14T14:14:35.416+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"Do you think they actually have played Sylas themselves?

They all lost quite a lot of things in their kit to make them less oppressive over all other champions.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, he is such a generalist, that in his current form he has to have weak numbers or is just broken otherwise.

And she's one of the best-balanced champions in the game who almost never needs balance changes (there was her release and a brief time where she was too good in the jungle but that was only very brief and didn't need much to nerf her out of it).\nThe problem is that they don't seem to know where they want Sylas to be. They need to decide on whether he needs to be a bruiser or an assassin and balance him for it: right now he's a bit of both and it's hurting his balance and champ identity.\nIs he a bruiser? If so, why does he build full AP and not AP-tank like Swain? Where is his health scaling and % health damage?\nIs he an assassin? If so why does he have a burst heal? Why doesn't he have an escape? How is his ult supposed to benefit an assassin playstyle?\n\nWhat needs to be done is Riot needs to put their foot down and say \"This champion is a bruiser like Camille or Vi and we're going to tune his numbers like one\" and give him low-damage, short-cooldown abilities with a mixture of AP and health scaling so ROA becomes an attractive first option like Swain or Diana.

His dependence on 40% CDR pushes you towards building Luden's Echo since it gives you so much CDR, and his heal and shield both scale with AP and nothing else. \n\nThat's probably the single biggest reason Sylas has been impossible to balance: because the rewards for him building full AP are too good and the rewards for him building AP-tank are too bad. \n\nIf Sylas was balanced like a bruiser and had a reason in his kit to build health (e.g. his heal or shield scaling with bonus health) we probably wouldn't be in this mess, but the obstinate refusal of Riot to entertain abandoning an assassin playstyle in favour of a bruiser-y one means that isn't happening.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LowKeyMLG","date":"2019-12-14T22:16:47.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's definitely not the champ with the most mechanics in one kit.

Camille is a great example or ekko (before the spam buffs this season). Putting his shield on hitting his e was a really nice change and I'm not sure why they removed it.

Sylas did not need to be the way he is. He should have been worked on more. Maybe he could have been seen as balanced if some one else was in charge of the game. I don't put any real blame on his players or even the pros. Riot should know by now what a champion will do in pro play, I mean this has been their only game for so long it's only natural that the one with all the data and access to player opinions on the boards worldwide would know.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2019-12-15T04:57:21.959+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, they jumped the gun and did tons of fucking changes to him because he was problematic (not because of the kit, it was Aftershock and it took them forever to notice it was Aftershock), so they sunk resources into pointless work, which already started ruining him, so they did more, and then more, and then more. Man, its almost like this is the same shit that has KILLED the Aatrox rework currently, and since Riot's too busy being mage biased, means Sylas will likely end up like Aatrox regardless if we ask them to stop or not.\n\nKeep the passive change, but:\nA- Make the primary auto still deal phys on top of the aoe damage\nB- re-rig the auto animation to alternate between left swing and right swing\nC- give him either better attack speed base , or give him what taric has for his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acemaster81","date":"2019-12-15T02:17:43.931+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made a post about the now normal cycle of new champion relaxes, this post actually inspired me to make it, and I hope your voices are heard. Sadly there are cases where they were not and this is upsetting even if I've never touched Sylas. The list of champions made problems by reworks, orcompletely and utterly changed by reworked, as well as new champions that are flawed in practice is growing with each new champion or individual rework.\n\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:350}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:246}} {{champion:235}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:142}} {{champion:84}}.\nWhen creating anything for pro play, if Riot creates a champion specifically and specially tailored to pro play in any role and gives then overloaded or kits only good for being flashy it hurts the playerbase. I wish you guys would stop taking hits like this because it sucks to see your favorite champion be taken away from you. Was {{champion:136}} old W strong and a toxic permaslow with {{item:3116}}? Maybe, but he has clear weaknesses that were so exploitable by his counters it felt so unfair at times. I've gotten used to the new W, but I played him long enough to appreciate what the champion has lost. I can't say that for someone like Aatrox who I did not even know much about until he got reworked. I was surprised he came out so different but I never picked up the champion, old or new.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WAZZZUP500","date":"2019-12-15T00:20:46.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, when making a new champ, design should be about how they feel to play and play against.

High base damages, high scalings, and alot of built in defense (the hp changes alone put him at the highest base hp in the game at level 18, a whopping 2480, which was previously held by Galio at 2466). Of course, I don't play sylas and part of the hp increase is probably to counteract the loss of the shield, but those numbers are kinda nuts.","replies":[{"poster":"Neverm0re","date":"2019-12-14T20:24:36.980+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He just totally lacks role identity. He's got the kit of a bruiser (the heal and shield) but the numbers of an assassin (lots of AP scaling, reliance on CDR-heavy burst mage items like Luden's and no % health damage or defensive health scaling). What he needs is to be firmly ensconced in the bruiser role with a kit of low-cooldown, low-individual impact abilities like Riven that synergise with his passive to make him less reliant on 40% CDR so that ROA will be an attractive first item like Diana or Swain, with a mixture of AP, level and health scalings to make sure he gets rewarded for building AP-tank and not for building full AP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dotty LB","date":"2019-12-14T17:53:03.582+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot seems to be on this binge of ruining champion Gameplay for the sake of balance and well i think its terrible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"homage the boss","date":"2019-12-14T17:37:41.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honestly didn’t know what to expect when I heard sylas was getting buffed but these changes are a bit less than optimal. Sylas is more enjoyable being his fun and interactive self that he is currently. The pbe changes just makes his abilities feel either slow or unnatural. The feeling of busting out a full combo is basically now gone and he just doesn’t feel the same. Giving him better numbers this way isn’t exactly the best way of improving the champ as you're taking away a lot of what made him fun to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Casualscrub69","date":"2019-12-14T17:24:14.362+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Changes makes him Seem like a new less fluid champ Pls fix rito\n\n\n**Champfeelmatters**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deymize ","date":"2019-12-14T16:21:07.398+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"These changes to the destruction of our master, please do not remove his shield and the possibility of use E2+Q.

Taking his Shield away, lowering his base stats (armour, mr and health) and the W heal alongside with the execute no only takes away how satisfying the to hit the ability, it also lowers his defensive capabilities as a champion \n\nSince Sylas is pretty much ass against any kind of ad champs and the fact that his armour has been Reduced to 27 will make it even more difficult to face champions like a {{champion:157}} or a {{champion:238}} then riot should honestly add his shield back (not his magic one) especially when his health is literally reduced to 525 \n\nAnother problem sylas will now face is his mana problems thanks to his W mana cost being 80 now after being lowered to 40 which doesn’t make any sense ( considering that his W doesn’t do anything). His passive is another thing, I’m fine u can stack 3 passive charges but reducing the radius of it is a bit to much especially if ur in a hard poke lane like a {{champion:45}} or {{champion:518}}, u won’t be able to efficiently get cs now if ur constantly getting harassed in lane. \n\nRiot plz Think about what ur doing sylas and other champions aswell\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harden Stepback","date":"2019-12-15T05:13:50.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wont listen, they f'd up too many champions to care","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2019-12-14T23:40:02.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"First they decided to change the shield so that it would activate after landing an e (which is fine in my opinion gives high risk/reward) then made it into only a magic shield during first e which really does not help him at all and makes him worse and increase his e cd and also the ult cd too. It's like they want him to not be played in pros. Honestly he needs the tools to survive and removing his shield completely takes away an identity in his kit as a skirmisher and they allow him to heal off non-champions which is really counter-intuitive to his learning curve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stylas","date":"2019-12-14T20:53:49.495+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"being a sylas OTP.
