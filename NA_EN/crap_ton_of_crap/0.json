When I try to turn it on it doesn't respond, and the thing is that this only happens in Lol. My computer cannot go lower than 200 ms and reaches 500 ms in most of the game. In the recent 10-15 games, I spent most of the time disconnected and eventually I got reported. I received a five game queue for afk but I couldn't do anything toi stop it. I feel like this is Lol's server's problem, instead of my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-28T22:35:34.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sounds like your router or ISP might be having some issues reaching out servers specifically if you never have these issues outside of League.

If you're playing on wifi, that's already a bad sign, as wifi generally is less stable to begin with.","replies":[]}]}
