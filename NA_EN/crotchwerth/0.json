Naturally that's at the end of the game (not an ideal solution, but reporting and muting is your best option right now) but I imagine that category in particular brings the chat sweeping bots running. \nIn my experience the trouble with trying to block specific words is that if people can be bothered to use them, they can be bothered to make up some nonsense alternate spelling or use symbols and numbers in place of letters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-01-29T23:14:36.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is easy to filter out.\n\nHow about turning your profanity filter on?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2016-01-29T22:59:06.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heres a list of all the racism slurs some people say them everyday without knowing it?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huang Shaotian","date":"2016-01-29T22:35:04.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Words aren't racist. Peoples intentions for the words are racist. A huge percentage of the words everyone uses today in standard speech used to be slurs towards minorities. The meaning of words grow and change despite how they started. But aside from how stupid it is to ban a word there are also perfectly legitimate non racist ways to use that word. E.g.\n\n1) I heard a guy call someone a %%%%%% yesterday so I told him that was not an acceptable way to talk about another person.\n2)  How do you feel about people who want to ban sexist or racist words, like %%%%%% or bitch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2016-01-29T22:18:03.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naga?\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/shWdRX0wJQs/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ward Baron","date":"2016-01-29T02:10:18.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"DUDE!, you can't just come here and type \"N-WORD\" on the forums. \nYou are on Clearnet here, maybe that deep web you can just say \"N-WORD\" anywhere, but not here buddy.\nThat's our word.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grashnim","date":"2016-01-29T01:58:46.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Freedom of speech, #ATL.","replies":[{"poster":"ReadyxPlayerxOne","date":"2016-01-29T05:04:46.614+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Using this word in most settings will most certainly lead to EXTREME repercussions.

Also context. Not every usage of a slur has a racist intent behind it. I'm perfectly capable of saying bitch in this game, especially joking among friends, but despite what the word police will try to tell you, it isn't sexist by default.
