Cause my brother sent one out back in December or January I can't remember which and he never got approved. While I applied for one not log before him and got one about a month later.\n\nThe main reason I'm asking is that I have no one to help do any play testing with since I have like two people added and I never see them on. If he had it things would be so much easier for me.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-29T00:17:26.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the best of my knowledge, we do still accept waves of players in periodically. \n\nAs far as not having anyone to play test with, I'd suggest joining the \"Public Beta\" chat room on PBE. There are always players in there - many who are also looking to test something, or who are willing to help lend a hand.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheLastShadow45","date":"2015-07-28T08:12:25.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Click the drop down on you profile in the top right of page then click PBE.
