I have recently being playing some Kled and wanted to do a Pirate Skin for him and Skaarl. So here its is, High Seas Kled and Octo Skaarl.

But I don´t think that an octopus fits Skaarl´s personality well (it would also look strange when Kled rides Skaarl). Because an octopus is way braver than Skaarl is. I think a seahorse would fit better to Skaarl (and is better for the riding animations) but wouldn´t fit to the skin theme.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2017-03-01T15:08:21.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Parrot Skaarl?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2017-03-01T01:04:59.254+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awwwwesome!","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2017-03-01T06:35:41.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know it!

The only issues I have with him is the belt I feel would have been better if it were on top of his shirt, that way you could show more pouches/mushroom juice hooked onto it.  It would sell it a bit better if his pants/boots looked wet he's riding a big slimy octo after all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"paisy","date":"2017-03-01T19:48:08.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All your work is great.
