Need Help.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I've recently updated my windows 10 operating system a couple of days ago, and ever since then I've been getting lag spikes and delay within said lag spikes but only within the League of Legends game. Not the client, not the loading screen, but whilst playing the game itself. I've followed many steps (including all of the ones in this link -https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting-) and read countless information about how to remedy the problem but nothing so far has helped. I know there is probably somebody out there who can help me or maybe not since this is a problem caused by Microsoft's end, but hopefully someone can help me. The reason I know its not my internet service and its Microsoft is because everything else runs fine, all of my other devices, programs, and games on my computer run the same if not better after doing all that I can to fix the lag spikes within LoL. Any help at all will be appreciated, I will do anything to fix this lag. LoL is my favorite game above all.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T02:58:27.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you recently updated, it could actually be a number of different things.
