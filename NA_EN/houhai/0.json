Just two nights ago, I was playing League of Legends with everything working exactly as normal; however, yesterday morning I haven't been able to login. I only receive the message \"An unexpected error occurred while logging in. Please try again. If this issue persists contact support at support.riotgames.com.\" I have run the Hextech Repair tool many times and even done a clean reinstall, deleting everything from the Riot Games folder. I'm at a loss for what else to do. I've submitted a support ticket with all the Hextech Repair tool information but I have yet to get a response. Anyone else have this problem or a solution? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-30T23:03:13.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This specific issue sounds like a network problem failing to reach the authentication service.  A reinstall might not fix this, but the HRT does have a config firewall settings that could help.  It's great that you've put in a ticket with logs, thanks for that!  In the meantime, go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for some additional troubleshooting.

The only temporary fix was a VPN I downloaded called \"HotSpotShield\" and that seemed to fix it, albeit temporarily. However, I haven't had any luck at all after I ran out of the trial.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niwatoko","date":"2017-06-30T22:58:38.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been having the same issue for a few days now.
