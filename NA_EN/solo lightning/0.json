So I believe that the VO for emotes might be glitched and I hope you can fix this if it is.\n\nThanks\n\nP.S. Unrelated to Sion, I really think you should add a passive indicator to Xin Zhao's W so you know when you can heal (Sorry if this is a bit much and thanks for replying).\n","replies":[]}]}]}
