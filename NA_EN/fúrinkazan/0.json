So much that my posts feel out of place, just wanted to acknowledge that. Anyway...\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHello you people, I'm FúrinKazan and, although a level 10 account, I'm actually close to 400 in the BR server. I recently tried to reach out to Riot about my projects for League of Legends, but unfortunately they only deal with graduated people.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the projects I made for the game have no use anymore so I decided to publish them all. They are champion kits, counting up to 120 with unique abilities, defined classes, gameplay and numbers for those who like. The idea is to publish one champion per day until April. I also have some champion updades and they might show up sometimes.\r\n\r\nI see a lot of good and creative kit concepts and reworks everywhere on the internet. However, if its gameplay is not coherent, it's not a champion. If numbers are not right, it won't work. Riot abandons a lot of cool fantasies because they end up failing at executon, so I bring you the abilities instead, for people to imagine a theme as they want. Here we go (leave a comment and take a look at my older posts!):\r\n\r\n\r\n* Yoshitsugu Ōtani (names are merely for inspiration and representation)\r\n* **Enchanter core traits:** high healing and shielding power, ally boosting, unreliable damage, moderate crowd control\r\n\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n**Passive: Friendship oath:** Yoshitsugu can choose one of the allied champions to sacrifice himself for. When the selected allied champion dies, a calculation is made based on a percentage of all the damage his ally took since he entered combat with enemy champions. If the value is enough to kill Yoshitsugu, taking into consideration his **currenth Health** and that it will be dealt as **True Damage**, the selected allied champion has his **Health** restored and Yoshitsugu enters a dying process, taking said value as damage over **6** seconds. If the value is not enough to kill Yoshitsugu from the start, the effect isn't triggered.\r\n\r\nDuring the death process, all heals and shields used on Yoshitsugu have their effectiveness reduced by half and not even **stasis** can stop the damage. If he is able to survive, Yoshitsugu has his **Health** altered to a certain percentage of his **Maximum Health** and the **Passive** enters a long **Cooldown**. If he ends up dying, his death timer is reduced by a percentage.\r\n\r\nYoshitsugu can unmark an allied champion moments before he dies. The **Health** restored to the allied champion is equal to all the damage he took in the last **6** seconds.\r\n\r\n**-Percentage of damage transferred: 200%\r\n-Health altered to: 30/40/50% of Yoshitsugu's Maximum Health\r\n-Cooldown: 180/150/120 seconds\r\n-Death timer reduced by: 60/70/80%**\r\n\r\nValues at levels **1/7/13**.\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n**1st Skill:** Yoshitsugu throws his saihai towards the selected direction. It stops at the first enemy champion it hits in a median-sized line, dealing damage and energizing itself. It then returns above Yoshitsugu's head before returning to his hands, distributing the energy to all nearby allied champions in the form of healing. \r\n\r\nThe heal is based on a percentage of the damage dealt to the enemy champion hit and is equally divided between all affected allied champions. It also grants **30%** additional **Movement Speed** for **2** seconds.\r\n\r\n**-Damage: 70/115/160/205/250 (+ 70% AP) as Magic Damage\r\n-Percentage of damage dealt as healing: 50/55/60/65/70 (+ 12% AP)%\r\n-CD: 10/9.5/9/8.5/8 seconds**\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n**2nd Skill:** Yoshitsugu grows the seed of hope on himself or on the targeted allied champion. For the next **2** seconds, all the damage the allied champion takes is reduced by a percentage.\r\n\r\nAfter **2** seconds, the seed flourishes, exploding in the form of damage to nearby enemies. Additionally, the allied champion receives a shield based on a percentage of all the damage he took in the last **2** seconds (counted before resistances). The shield lasts for up to **2** seconds.\r\n\r\n**-Damage reduction: 7/9/11/13/15 (+ 4% AP)%\r\n-Explosion damage: 70/110/150/190/230 (+ 60% AP) as Magic Damage\r\n-Shield value: 60/65/70/75/80 (+ 12% AP)% of the damage taken in the last 2 seconds\r\n-CD: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds (begins after 2 seconds)**\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n**3rd Skill:** Yoshitsugu rises his saihai and then brandishes it forward, creating a power mist that slowly flies towards the selected direction. The mist causes a series of effects to both allied and enemy champions that enter contact with it, all of them lasting for **3** seconds.\r\n\r\nYoshitsugu and allied champions receive additional **Movement Speed** and are healed. Enemy champions are **slowed** while taking damage. Keeping \r\ncontact with the mist resets the duration of the effects. The mist lasts for **5** seconds.\r\n\r\n**-Bonus Movement Speed: 10/12.5/15/17.5/20%\r\n-Slow: 10/15/20/25/30%\r\n-Damage/healing: 30/35/40/45/50 (+ 15% AP) (as Magic Damage) every second for 3 seconds\r\n-CD: 16 seconds (begins on use)**\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\n**Ultimate:** After activating the ability, **3** combinations of elite guards begin to rotate above Yoshitsugu's head. Targeting himself or an allied champion selects one of these options:\r\n\r\n-A squire and an archer;\r\n-Two squires;\r\n-Two archers.\r\n\r\nYoshitsugu targets himself or an allied champion to whom he will trust the chosen combination of elite guards. They walk side by side with the allied champion, have **Maximum Health** and can be hit by basic attacks and abilities.\r\n\r\nEach squire deals damage to enemies within melee range (prioritizes enemy champions), dealing damage and **slowing**. The **slow** stacks up in quantity and duration if more than one squire attacks the same target.\r\n\r\nEach archer attacks enemies within **525** range but follow the attack of the allied champion they are protecting, independently of the distance, dealing damage.\r\n\r\nWhen the **Maximum Health** of the ally that the guards protect gets below **20%**, they sacrifice themselves to create a shield whose value is equal to **30%** of the sum of their remaining **Healths** that lasts for up to **3** seconds. If it doesn't happen, their services end after **12** seconds or when they are killed.\r\n\r\n**-Squire:**\r\n\r\n**   -Health: 250/625/1000 (+ 80% AP)\r\n   -Damage: 20/30/40 (+ 15% AP) as Magic Damage\r\n   -Slow: 25/35/45% for 0.75 second**\r\n\r\n**-Archer:**\r\n\r\n**   -Health: 200/400/600 (+ 60% AP)\r\n   -Damage: 45/60/75 (+ 30% AP) as Magic Damage**\r\n\r\nBoth have no resistances and **0.8 Attack Speed**.\r\n\r\n**-CD: 150/135/120 seconds (begins when the effect ends)**\r\n___________________________________________________________________________\r\nRanged, uses **Mana**","replies":[{"poster":"Zerdun","date":"2020-02-19T03:15:39.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This passive as a whole is pretty interesting. The idea of having a method of trading life is kinda neat and it should be the focal point of his kit in my opinion.  considering that the passive screams i potentially prevent my carry from popping like a balloon when  he gets caught i think the whole theme should revolve around health.\n\nThematically i think this would be awesome to make an amazing HP based supportive champ instead of mana and should be tied to the shadowlands\n\nPassive should read more like \n\nOath: when the linked companion dies this champion. Revives the recently deceased after 4 seconds (scales to 1 @ 1/6/11/16) while healing them by X% of his Max HP (scales 20 - 50% @ 1/6/11/16). This champion then receives 200% (arbitrary number here) of the damage dealt over the past x seconds to the linked companion as true damage. If this damage were to kill the champion he instead enters a dying state for 5 seconds. During the dying state Yoshi is unable to move or cast any spells (can activate items). Shields and healing are half as effective.\nThis has arbitrarily large CD (think 5 minutes reducing to 2 each time he can put a point in R) This link has some arbitrarily reasonable range. This will keep in in a duo lane if you want to max out his kit potential while preventing him from being a split push bot.\n\nSince its true damage that is being dealt and pretty large amount of it this should encourage building a mix of AP and health while remaining light on armor/MR\n\n\nI like your Q but i think with how broken the passive is overall reducing the effectiveness of the self healing would be warranted \n\nQ : Moderate HP cost : in line skill shot with medium speed and medium range. Stops at the first champion hit. Deals low/moderate damage with low end AP+bonus HP scaling leaves a token on the ground where the skill shot lands that if collected will heal all friendlies in the area for a low-moderate amount of the damage dealt (scales with level)\n\nYour 2nd ability is way too overloaded a shield+ % DR + Damage ability something needs to give its way too overloaded considering it has three effects. I would personally vote for either the damage to be removed or the damage reduction.\n\nthis would probably be a more balanced ability\nW : grants a 2 second shield to a target that explodes when expired for x + the amount of damage done to it. Shield health scales off of AP and there is an additional damage boost that scales off of Bonus HP\n\nYour third ability is neat and effectively serves as a mix of zoning/peeling > Making it a fire zone that slows enemies and heals allies is good. \n\nR: theres a whole bunch of stuff going on with your R and i think that because of how the champ is designed and with the way the balancing team works you will find that there would only be 1 or maybe 2 viable combos. Instead i would suggest the following changes  \n\nSummons three elite guards that follow a targeted ally or self and provide specific benefits for the target for moderate duration (something along the lines of 10-15 seconds). These guards will assist the target and attack (champions preferred) If a guard dies then the benefits it provides will be lost\n\nGuards have small base hp with an additional 1/3 of the champions bonus HP as actual hit points \nGraurds deal 2/3rd of Champions current AP.\n\nSquire : Spells and attacks will slow enemy champions hit by scaling % (based on rank something that starts worse then equeal then slightly better than slow hammer/rylais) \n\nKnight : grants % damage reduction (15/30/60)\n\nArcher : grants % damage increase (10/15/20)\n\nHaving it always be a consistent and specific effect makes the ability easier to balance (theres a reason TF cards are unique)\n\nOtherwise i think the idea of having a psuedo general styled champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"lunarcana","date":"2020-02-19T02:30:07.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we stan","replies":[]}]}
