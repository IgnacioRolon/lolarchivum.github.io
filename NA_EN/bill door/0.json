Restarted my computer, did some updates, full system scan, even ran the hextech repair tool a couple times to fix it. At one point I was able to connect for maybe 5 minutes, but then it kicked me back out and I'm forever authenticating again. Is this just some weird bug that's plaguing the client, or is it something greater?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-05T20:50:10.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Failing to reach the authentication server can result from a connection issue.  A repair wouldn't really resolve this, but we can look for factors like blocks caused by firewalls and antivirus.  I recommend running through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to really know for sure.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
