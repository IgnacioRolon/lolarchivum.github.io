Granted, this is after the end of year recap dropped and I have been finding my client unable to connect to the authentication server. Run the repair tool several times to no avail, restarted my computer, done various scans and nothing is coming up out of the norm. Could it be an issue with the current patch, or maybe i just need to fresh install the game?\nPlease help!\n\nUpdate: uninstalled the game, only to reinstall and still have the same issue plaguing my client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-19T22:24:38.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, this can happen if a network is block from talking to the authentication service.  I'm not seeing anything on our side, but let's get a traceroute to really know for sure.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a route to the game server: q.na1.lol.riotgames.com.  Run it for about 5 minutes, replace the IP address with dashes on the first two rows only, and let me know what you find.","replies":[]}]}
