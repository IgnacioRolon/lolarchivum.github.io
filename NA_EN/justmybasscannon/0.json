Give him more utility and self-synergy, and make his AS steroid attached to something less retarded, like his Q.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-04-30T02:14:24.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it needs to be quite that complex, nor do I think Varus needs to not have an active steroid.
