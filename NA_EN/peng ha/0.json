I was tilted.  I wasn't able to make it then, but the following season with practice I did successfully make it to Gold.  I know you've been through quite a ride, but there's always next season and you have a lot of time to prepare and practice.  We can't adjust rankings, but I wish you the best of luck!","replies":[]}]}
