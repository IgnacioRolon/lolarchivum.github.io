I played for over a month with no bans, entered a new season ( season 7), and I left one round which in turn banned me 5 rounds for twenty minuets. I know that there has to be a punishment but 20 minuets is too much. Now I love the game and all but there has to be a point where the ban time goes back down to the 5 minuet mark like the first ban you ever got. Thanks for your time. Ill leave a poll to see how you guys feel about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-18T23:38:37.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your account's status with [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) can only be improved by playing consistently without leaving games.  Twenty minute timers result from frequent leaves or disconnections, so it's really important to resolve whatever is causing that to happen.  Leaverbuster is not something we can remove, but let me know if I can help with any technical issues.","replies":[]}]}
