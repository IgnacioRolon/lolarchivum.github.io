You group with a random set of strangers for maybe 45 minutes at a time, and often times there's not a lot of actual conversation that happens outside of champ select and the first minute and a half of the game because everyone is focused on trying to do their job.

Sometimes i play 3 days in row and there are times when i dont play for a week.\n3. if i wanted to always play with someone i would need huge friend list.

Their collective mmr gets increased to compensate, perfect.\nNow, guy played a good game with randoms and decides to invite 2 players from last game. They're still unknown and there are no voice comms. DQ inflates their mmr the same way because they're premade. And this is where this system gets broken. Its impossible to match premades with solos in single queue because of this.\nOld Soloq had duos, but there's much less potential synergy between 2 than 3 players.\n\nSo i believe you it's fun to have friends to play with, but it's stupid to penalize people who can't or even compare them to 3/4/5 man premades","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2016-06-03T17:10:44.267+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm more worried about premades having the same ladder as soloQ.

I say every subset of the community, and your bias can only pick out the boards from that. Take a look at youtube. Not only does Riot's own video on dynamic queue get a crapton of dislikes in comparison to likes (a rather uncommon trend for youtube), youtubers themselves have come out mostly in support of solo queue over dynamic queue. Then there are the pro players themselves who are considered the peak of the league community who also have a majority preference for solo queue. It's not just the league boards that show a dislike for the lack of solo queue. Reddit's boards also mirror the same opinion. Then there all the streamers who also seem to generally share the opinion that solo queue is the superior option. \n\nAnd if you won't accept that reality, you probly won't accept this one as well, but Riot themselves knows the result of an unbiased poll that asks for the preference between solo queue and dynamic queue. Just think about it intelligently. One of the largest and most sensible outcries from the community has been the demand for an unbiased poll that asks for the preference between the two. And there is absolutely no way Riot has not seen the countless threads demanding it. Now if you really think about it, there is really one and only one reason why Riot wouldn't introduce such a poll. It's because they know the result won't favor their objectives and they don't care about the community opinion on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2016-06-03T17:32:22.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dehitay,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=559c77tG,comment-id=00030000000000010000,timestamp=2016-06-03T15:29:27.644+0000)\n>\n> Says the guy speaking with what is half bias and opinion.

Not only does Riot&#x27;s own video on dynamic queue get a crapton of dislikes in comparison to likes (a rather uncommon trend for youtube), youtubers themselves have come out mostly in support of solo queue over dynamic queue. Then there are the pro players themselves who are considered the peak of the league community who also have a majority preference for solo queue. It&#x27;s not just the league boards that show a dislike for the lack of solo queue. Reddit&#x27;s boards also mirror the same opinion. Then there all the streamers who also seem to generally share the opinion that solo queue is the superior option. \n> \n> And if you won&#x27;t accept that reality, you probly won&#x27;t accept this one as well, but Riot themselves knows the result of an unbiased poll that asks for the preference between solo queue and dynamic queue. Just think about it intelligently. One of the largest and most sensible outcries from the community has been the demand for an unbiased poll that asks for the preference between the two. And there is absolutely no way Riot has not seen the countless threads demanding it. Now if you really think about it, there is really one and only one reason why Riot wouldn&#x27;t introduce such a poll. It&#x27;s because they know the result won&#x27;t favor their objectives and they don&#x27;t care about the community opinion on it.\n\nOk then let me pick it more a part for you. Who goes on boards? Dedicated players. Who goes on youtube to watch league content? Dedicated players. Who stream league? Dedicated players. Who goes to Reddit? Dedicated players. The fact of the matter is that you did not list every subset. You only listed sub sets that a minority of players who have the tendency to be very involved in the game. To sum it up; you only listed subsets that were convenient for you and use them as \"proof\". \n\nNow on to your idea for a poll. I only really linger on boards so I will only speak to that. Boards has not had a large outcry for a unbiased poll. Maybe reddit has. Maybe the streamers have but boards has not. Do you remember over the last year the random polls you got asked to filled out when you signed in on the client? Well some of the questions on their were things like \"do you enjoy playing with friends?\" That was a unbiased random poll. Not all of the questions were great but that was a poll. Now the only difference between Riot and us is that they can see the results of those polls and I am willing to bet that the results say most people preferred to \"play with friends\". Now if you want to ask for those poll results to be made public I am all for that. If you want to change dynamic queue so it works better I am all for that. If you want to revert to solo queue I am for that too. However if you want to claim false statistics and accuse riot of lieing and other such unproductive things I am going to call you out on your bullshit. Not that I think it will change your opinion but hopefully it will change the opinion of a person reading it.","replies":[{"poster":"earlsimmonz","date":"2016-06-03T18:59:36.476+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Ok then let me pick it more a part for you.
