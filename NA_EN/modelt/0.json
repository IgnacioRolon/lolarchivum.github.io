Poppy and Taric Skins!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy and Taric don&#039;t have much in the way of skins at all, so I was thinking maybe Riot could toss out some Hammer-Themed skins for the two of them.  A few basic ideas:\r\n\r\nEnforcer Bros, Poppy and Taric!\r\nDesigned to make them look like hockey players, replacing their hammers w/ hockey stick and masks/helmets that look like the Hammer Bros from Mario.\r\n\r\nSTOP!  Poppy Time and MC Taric\r\nOld school 80&#039;s rap inspired skins, and Taric has a big crystal studded clock around his neck.\r\n\r\nIron Poppy and Iron Taric\r\nIron man inspired skins that give them a retro / steam punk look.\r\n\r\nPoric and Tappy\r\nIt&#039;s an armor  swap.  Poppy has a miniature version of Taric&#039;s armor and Taric has a bigger, gaudier version of Poppy&#039;s armor.\r\n\r\nRail Worker Skins\r\nA set of skins based on American history, making the duo look like olde fashioned rail road workers.  Ziggs can come too with old fashioned dynamite.\r\n\r\nReally... the potential is out there.  I think Poppy and Taric could use some love.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellhammer","date":"2015-03-28T02:32:47.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to see Poppy's Lolly Poppy get reworked to be a creepy skin or something? wit better visuals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeductiveGrandpa","date":"2015-03-28T00:49:00.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah! Woah Woah! Slow down... Poppy's getting a whole RELAUNCH (Hallelujah!) to compensate for her lack of graphics which will probably temporarily move the possibility of new skins but Taric seems like a good candidate for them. And yes, maybe if we love hard enough they (Poppy) will become beautiful.","replies":[]}]}
