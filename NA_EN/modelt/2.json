{"poster":"ModelT","date":"2015-03-20T22:36:12.361+0000","title":"[Campion Concept]  Zuki, The Zaunite Delivery Boy  (Melee, Mage, pseudo support)  Art wanted!","subforum":"Concepts & Creations","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot wishes to use any of the information listed here, please feel free to, but consult me as the creative force behind the champion.\n\nChampion Name: Zuki\nThe Delivery Boy\nRace: Yordle\nConcept:  High Tech, Parkour Yordle\n\nBasic Stats\nAttack: Medium\nDefense: Low\nSpells:  High\nDifficulty: Extreme\n\nRange: Melee (Kicks with his rocket boots)\nRole: Melee, Mage, off Support\n\n--------------------------------------------\nAbilities\nInnate Ability\n-Cool Resolve-\nZuki gains tenacity as he levels up. Bonus = level + 7. Stacks with other sources of tenacity.\n8 tenacity at level 1, 25 tenacity at level 18.\n\nNotes:  Though this might seem like a lot, other champions have abilities that can produce more tenacity, such as Irelia (who has this much tenacity when near two champions, and more when more champions are near).  The difference for Zuki is that this is always active at a specific amount and only requires leveling up.  The main reason for this ability is based on Zuki's proposed Speed, with the idea that Speed is not just going fast, but also not slowing down.  Mechanically, Zuki doesn't pack much in the way of ranged abilities, needing to be IN combat to be effective, and this ability gives him a primary resource to that effect without blatantly copying another champions abilities.\n\n\nQ\n-Power Slide-\nDescription: Zuki drops into a rocket enhanced power slide dash, dealing damage and tripping (Stunning) any enemy he passes through, dealing a large amount of damage.   Hitting Q again during the slide or running into terrain (Such as a wall, turret, or a temp wall such as Anivia's Ice Wall) ends the slide early.\n\nTechnical: This is treated as a typical dash, but with special collision physics.  Summoner Spells and Item Activation effects are treated the same as they would be during a typical dash, and Zuki's other abilities cannot be activated during the slide.\n\nPurpose: This is some decent damage and a good initiator/escape. Gives Zuki a means to run into a fight. Used defensively, it can be used to escape fights, juke, and stop a channel if needed.  It's Zuki's core ability and one of Zuki's main damage sources, and mastering it is the cornerstone to mastering Zuki.\n\nFlavor:  All important fast characters are known for sliding through trouble, into trouble, and out of it.  It's presence in action scenes always adds to the action.  Most importantly however, is Megaman and his infamous slide ability.\n\nType: Skill shot Dash\n\"Missile\" Speed: 1000\nMana Cost: 40/50/60/70/80\nDamage: 75/110/145/185/220 + (0.9 * AP) \nStun Duration:  .5 second at all ranks\nCool Down: 20 seconds at all ranks\nRange: 750\n\n\nW\n-Special Delivery-\nDescription:  Zuki tosses a package, designed by his uncle for the Fields Of Justice, from his satchel onto the battle field.  If an enemy runs into the package, he takes damage and is slowed and given a debuff that provides vision.  If Zuki or an ally picks up the package, they gain a shield and a movement speed buff.\n\nPurpose:  This ability or more flavor driven than otherwise, but gives Zuki something in the way of both support and additional damage.  The utility of the ability is great, if not a bit underwhelming.  The damage and shield are the most notable parts of the attack, as the movement buff and the slow are fairly weak.  The vision, as a utility, allows Zuki not to waste his Q on face checking bushes early game, and useful late game for chasing down enemies or keeping an eye on the jungle.  Also, late game, Zuki can use the movement speed buff to combo with his ult.  NOTE:  This only effects a single enemy.\n\nFlavor:  As a package boy, it'd be TERRIBLE for flavor if Zuki didn't have SOME kind of package delivery based ability.  The flavor of the bomb effect is present in his character description, and what's the point of having a package NOT do anything good for the people it's meant for?  So his uncle made him a bunch of compact packages for him to deliver to his allies in combat so that he can charge them for their reception of his services later... AND to help out, cause why not?\n\nType:  AOE item drop\nMana Cost:  30/35/40/45/50 mana\nRange:  800\nCooldown:  15 seconds at all ranks\nPackage Duration:  5 Seconds at all ranks\nEnemy Effects\nDamage:  80/130/180/230/280 + (.6 AP)\nSlow:  10/15/20/25/30%\nVision and slow duration:  1 second at all levels\nAlly Effects\nShield:  50/75/100/125/150 + (.4 AP)\nShield Duration:  3/4/5/6/7 seconds\nMovement Speed:  +20%/22.5%/25%/27.5%/30%\nSpeed Buff Duration:  1.5 seconds at all ranks.\n\nE\n-Quick Leap- and -Rocket Kick-\nDescription:  This is a two part ability.  Quick Leap sends Zuki straight into the air, becoming untargetable while in the air.  Activating Rocket Kick while in the air, Zuki rockets to a nearby location dealing damage in a small area and becoming targetable upon landing.\n\nPurpose:  This ability serves Zuki in several ways.  First, it grants him a temporary reprieve from melee combat (an ability that has proven useful for Fizz).  Second, it gives Zuki some much needed AoE damage.  Thirdly, it's actually a dash move that can put him over a wall, unlike his -Power Slide- ability.  Finally, it adds just a bit more damage to his kit.  It's not perfect, as while out of combat, enemies can move away to avoid the damage, or you can activate Rocket Kick quickly by sacrificing the effect of Quick Leap.\n\nFlavor:  Parkour is about jumping around and being crafty, but if you add ROCKET BOOTS to the equation, poop gets real. That statement is WAY more fun if you say poop... just sayin.  Also, Quick leap/Rocket Kick is a bit of a shout out to Sonic's homing ball move, without being exactly that.\n\nType:  Instant Effect / AoE spell\nMana Cost:  50/60/70/80/90 mana\nCool Down:  20/17/14 seconds\nQuick Leap Duration:  1 second\nRocket Kick Range:  600\nRocket Kick Damage:  80/130/180/230/280 + (.8 AP)\nRocket Kick AoE Size:  300\n\n\nUltimate\n-Hex-Tech Rocket Boots-\nPassive:  Zuki's base speed increases by 10 per rank (Max +30).\nActive:  Zuki over charges his Rocket Boots and gains bonus attack speed and his attacks do additional damage based on his AP.\n\nPurpose:  Since Zuki is a melee mage, he needs something to help him IN combat that allows him to use his AP and alleviates some need to build Attack Speed in favor of both the survivability and AP he needs to stay useful in fights as a melee champ with somewhat longer cool downs.\n\nFlavor:  This is all about Zuki's boots, which are his weapon as well as some stylish foot gear.  As his boots power up, they allow him to move faster, and by over charging them, he becomes a combat monster.  This is the embodiment of what Zuki wants to be in a game:  Fast and Painful.\n\nType:  Passive with additional Active effects\nMana Cost:  100/125/150\nBonus Attack Speed:   +20%/40%/60% + (Extra bonus based on bonus movement speed)\nBonus Damage:  +40/60/80 + (.5 * AP)\nDuration:  7/10/13 seconds\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nBack Story\n\n//Under Construction until Riot rehashes basic world lore.\nCore Concepts:  Delivers packages in Zaun.  Works for uncle who makes hex-tech gadgets.  Is really really fast.  Like... wow.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nAppearance\nHe is no more or less than an average Yordle (Sharing the fuzzier nature of Kennen and Rumble) in size or appearance, with the exception of his constantly wind blown fur. However, from head to toe, he is covered in hex-tech gadgets. Special night, fog, magic vision goggles (Similar in design to Ski Goggles), special Hex-Gloves that enhance grip and negate friction burn. Special Hex-shield vest that reduces drag and damage, a special satchel over his shoulder which links packages with bombs so that if he \"accidentally\" drops them, their secrets will be protected with pain of destruction. To top it all off, his signature boots. Hex Tech Enhanced High friction soul for road grip, hex-steel toes for kicking, and special hex-tech rockets that help Zuki run, jump, and kick faster, higher, and harder.  I'm going for a pseudo Steam/Cyber-punk feel for overall effect.\n\nHis fur is white, with a faint sky blue hue, and has black patches along his ears, and the back of his elbows. He has sharp features, and his ears point low and backwards. He appears totally resolved, undaunted by trivial concerns of day to day life. His smile is slight at most. His stature is unyielding but humble.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nPlay Style\n\nGenereal\nZuki wants to be a mage that hits hard and fast and has the ability to wander the map to help nearby lanes or in the jungle.  Because of his longer cool downs and fragile nature, he relies a bit on poke and mobility in the early game to get kills and for survivability, but with his speed and powerful abilities and the CC on his -Power Slide-, he can roam and gank nearby lanes or the jungle with ease.  In the mid to late game, Zuki should have one or two AP based defense items like Rod of Ages{{item:3027}}  or Rylai's{{item:3116}}, otherwise focusing on items that grant AP and movement speed, such as the new Luden's Echo{{item:3285}}.  His role in a team relies on his mobility to scout jungle and initiate on lonely champions to set up.  In full blown team fights, he can initiate behind the tank providing secondary CC control and a higher damage output and with -Quick Leap-/-Rocket Kick- he can manuver through a fight with some ease to put more hurt on enemies further away.\n\nRoles\nMid Lane Mage\nIn a mid lane scenario, Zuki's speed and higher damage output allow him to lend support to near by lanes with great ease.  He would have a rough time against high damage output assassin characters that are difficult to escape, relying heavily on his -Quick Leap- to escape their initiates.  Against a more typical mage, the mobility of his -Quick Leap- or the shield of his -Special Delivery- would be useful to help alleviate their damage output while countering during their cool downs with -Power Slide- and -Hex-Tech Rocket Boots- to finish the job.\n\nTop Lane Mage\nZuki in a top lane would rely on a tankier AP build with good CDR.  Using a hit and run strategy with his -Power Slide- and strategic placement of his -Special Delivery- to wear away tankier fighters.  He is in a solid position to aid his team's jungle or to help middle lane in a pinch, but also allowing him to focus on creep killing without having to roam too much, making him a heavy AP powerhouse for the late game.\n\nSupport\nNot filling the roll of support as well as pure supports like Sona{{champion:37}} or Soraka{{champion:16}} with consistent heals to keep team mates in lane as long as possible, but smart use of his -Power Slide- for initiating and more skill point focus on his -Special Delivery- for the shield or slow would allow Zuki to fulfill the support role, and his higher mobility and relatively superior damage output would allow him some roaming ability, giving support to more of the team.  With his enhanced speed, he would be excellent at maintaining wards as well.\n\nPros\nZuki has good damage output and mobility, making him a solid mage threat.  His abilities allow him to make his way around a team fight with ease and he is hard to pin down.  Zuki is also apt at scouting the Jungle, chasing weakened foes, or initiating on solo champions.  The multiple uses for each of his abilities makes Zuki something of a Swiss Army Knife in the right hands.\n\nCons\nZuki is a frail, AP based, melee champion, and relies heavily on his mobility.  Though his abilities are powerful and useful, his melee nature can put him in difficult situations if not used properly, making him a high skill level champion.  Being engaged when even two of his basic abilities are on CD puts Zuki at a severe disadvantage, especially at earlier levels when his Tenacity is lower, as he is not innately tanky as even the weaker melee champions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nFinal Thoughts\nSo as far as EXACT numbers go for... just about everything, please don't be too harsh.  They are all basically based on other champions' skills.  Pay attention to primary effects, Cool Down, and AP scaling more.  As far as the flat numbers go, I'm not married to really any of them, as they ARE my best guesses as to what MIGHT work based on other champs with similar abilities.  His kit is designed to be a mage who cut through combat with something of a hit and run strategy, only really dedicating to AA combat with use of his Ult.  I'd like to add art if anybody wants to waste some time on this.  Hell, if you're really awesome, maybe I'll even throw down a couple of bucks.\n\nNote, that this is a rework of an old champion idea I had years back.  I've maintained all the back story and stuff, but reworked the whole kit, save for the passive.  I'm not going to bother with a link to the archived post, since everything relevant is still here and most of the kit was conceptually garbage.  Sorry if the post isn't as refined as some, I'm a novice at board coding.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nSkin Concepts\n-The Blue Blur\nThis skin has a spiked, wind blown mo-hawk, with Megaman flavored Hex-Tech gear, blue fur, and is based off of two of the key influences behind Zuki.   (HINT:  Megaman and Sonic)\n\n-Bat out of Hell\nThis skin has red and black/brown colored fur and he has bat like wings (small) on his back. Hex tech gear has a distinct \"Biker\" look to it, with a leather jacket with a devil image on the back, fingerless leather gloves with spikes, and huge \"Chopper\" like exhaust pipes coming off of his boots. Influenced by Meat Loaf (the musician) and the album art from the similarly named album.\n\n-Zuki, News Boy\nNo fancy hex-tech gear. Just some old-fasioned Steam Punk style goggles, spring loaded boots, and 50's \"news boy\" flavored attire (complete with messenger boy cap and Sepia tone coloring).\n\n-Kringle Clause Zuki\nZuki dons Santa Clause flavored attire, including a red stocking cap, magic jingle bell boots, and Santa's magic bag of presents, and a red glowing light in the middle of his goggles. And a fake beard, a very very fake beard. His Special Delivery becomes magical Christmas gifts that have a whimsical magical explosion sound. His Rocket boots sound like Jingle Bells while flying through the air, and while Zuki yells, \"Ho ho ho!\" when activating his Ult.  All of zuki's quotes gain a Christmas/Santa Clause theme to them as well.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nQuotes and other misc. stuff\n\nDance: Jump Dancing\n\nJoke: Requires multiple uses of /joke\n\"Knock knock, anybody home?\"\n\"Maybe I'll come back later...\"\n\"Na, I'll just put this note on their door.\"\n\nTaunt: \"You're too slow.\" (In a serious, curt tone)\n\nMovement: \"On it.\" (common)\n\"Already there.\" (common)\n\"You better tip well.\" (rare, when directed to move far away)\n\"At least I'm getting paid.\" (rare)\n\nUpon Selection: \"Zuki's Package Delivery Service! 100% guaranteed results, or your money back.\"\n\nCharacter Interactions\nYi: \"Race ya.\" (When moving Near any Master Yi)\nAny champ with base movement speed of 325: \"OOOOHHHHH, I was wondering where you were.\" (When moving near these champions)\nTwisted Fate: \"Cheater!\" (When TF activates his Ultimate to teleport into or out of Zuki's personal vision)\nKennen: \"Sup, cuz?\" (When allowed to stand still next to Kennen for a few seconds)","replies":[{"poster":"Scorpoison","date":"2015-04-04T20:41:20.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like your idea of a hit and run champion, but I think his special delivery is a bit weird in the fact that his other abilities are centralized around a quick in / quick out attack.
