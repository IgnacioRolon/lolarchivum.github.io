Sej's skin get's a bear that looks suspiciously like Volibear, and Volibear's skin makes him look like a Boar with human qualities similar to his normal skin.\r\n\r\nI know there's already a bear riding Sej skin, but it's not specifically Volibear... which looking at their background would be VERY insulting to Volibear, I think...","replies":[]}
