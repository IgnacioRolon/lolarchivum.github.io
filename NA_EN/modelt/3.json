It happened for me because my Documents location was on a secondary hard drive which I then removed.\n\nEven though it seems LoL doesn't store anything in Documents, the client black-screens if it can't find/use that location. You can fix this in Windows Explorer (without dangerous registry changes) by right-clicking on your Documents location (should be in your Quick Access bar in the left pane) and, in Properties --> Location, setting up folders which exist.","replies":[{"poster":"RamminRigsby","date":"2016-08-08T12:50:15.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've raised a separate bug for this root cause: see http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/0QHdsFow-client-client-requires-existing-documents-location-even-though-it-doesnt-store-anything-there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Fitz","date":"2016-05-25T05:40:53.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg, it is worked, thank you so much :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GXY Indeciso","date":"2015-07-29T01:28:43.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg thank you so much it worked thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyGosu","date":"2016-03-29T08:06:55.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANKS YOU GUY IT WORKS FOR MEEEE OMGGGGGGGGG {{champion:266}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3001}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sentarinee","date":"2016-03-25T18:22:56.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're the best.
