Do I want to engage near that many minions?  Will their Jungler or lane partner help in this engagement?\r\n\r\nA team deathmatch would need something in place to help maintain balance in those respects, while still being fun for all players involved.\r\n\r\nThings that Team Deathmatch would need\r\n- Minion farm\r\n- Team Zones\r\n- Rotating, random objectives that provide temporary buffs to teams, possibly favoring losing teams' zones\r\n- More than two teams\r\n\r\nWays map design could facilitate these needs\r\nThree distinct zones:  Top, bottom left, bottom right, each with distinct lanes going to the team base to the center.\r\nLanes that connect each team base to each other team's base.\r\nThe team bases would consist of one or two towers that cannot be destroyed but can take enough damage to shut down, allowing minions to continue down lanes towards opponents' bases, and a spawn point that is isn't accessible by other teams.  This would give reason to kill maintain base safety from minions for reasons other than just farm.\r\nEach base would have a health/mana items similar to the spawns on Aram rather than being able to heal on base.\r\nThere would be health drops randomly in each jungle.\r\nA minion spawn point in the center would provide a literal central location for fighting, as maintaining your teams' creep score would greatly benefit a team.\r\n\r\nThere would need to be a lot of tweeking and map design to make this game type work properly and in a balanced manner.\r\n\r\nAny additional ideas would be greatly appreciated, as this new and different game type would add to the community.\r\n\r\nLet's make this happen people!","replies":[{"poster":"Or√¨on","date":"2015-03-26T16:43:57.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think this would be a very fun gamemode to just place in the game like aram dominion or twisted treeline it would be so much fun","replies":[]}]}
