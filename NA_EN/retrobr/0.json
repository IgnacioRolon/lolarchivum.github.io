So I was in lobby, picks and bans were made. We go into game to play and I couldn't reconnect because I had the pop-up of \"Could not connect to league of legends servers. Want to reconnect?\" Then two boxes with Retry or cancel. So I kept trying to reconnect and my buddy that was already in game was connected to the game. But over curse I was able to still talk and hear him perfectly fine. I had a browser in the back ground playing music just fine. I knew it wasn't my internet not working and such so that couldn't be the reason. So long story short, game was remade and now I am placed in Low priority queue for reasons that are not my own. Can I get some help out of this or because I was technically out of client trying to reset the client to fix it, or never got the bug splat info card that I cant get my low priority queue taking away? Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-05T17:41:21.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having a problem establishing a connection to your group's specific game server.  This could be more of a connection related issue, so a bugsplat wouldn't necessarily occur unless there was an issue with game files or game rendering.
