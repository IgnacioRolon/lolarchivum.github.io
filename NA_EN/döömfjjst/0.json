RIOT can say literally anything here in their contract if they want to. Imagine if a car sales company has a contract that states that if your payment is more than a day late you need to pay them $10,000.\n\nmy argument has literally nothing to do with whatever RIOT has in the contract and everything to do with how to negotiate from a position of strength.

And guess what that was exactly what the op hinted at and what I want people to actually think about.\n\nWhen you take someone's money, the rules always change. You're always bound to some type of condition and after working in finance I have seen there is always some recourse to get your damn money back if the service doesn't match what you were sold on.\n\nMore importantly it should be a lesson to everyone that more than the children playing the game, that RIOT Games has standards to uphold as a business and they are doing a terrible job at it as evidenced by the number of complaints (read \"toxic\" rofl).  The suit I am describing is definitely coming their way, if the smart ones haven't already done it to recoup at least some of what was taken from them. \n\nTLDR: No a company cannot take your money with impunity....Not sure why people need a book in order to believe that any of us could sue RIOT games for OUR money back.","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-03-23T18:20:50.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mnstryvii,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=R5hIuJR4,comment-id=001300010000,timestamp=2018-03-23T18:01:11.976+0000)\n>\n> TLDR: No a company cannot take your money with impunity....Not sure why people need a book in order to believe that any of us could sue RIOT games for OUR money back.\n\nThe problem is, they didn't take away his money; they took away his access to it. The money is still there. The skins are still there. The Champions, icons, etc are all still there. He just doesn't have access to it because he broke the rules. \n\nThat said, and once again, you are not entitled to a full refund when you yourself broke the rules. I don't understand why you think criminals are entitled to non-criminal treatment. It's a simple situation:\n\nYou were told not to do something or you will be punished. Did you do it? \nIf yes, you will be punished. \nIf no, you won't be punished.\n\nYou only have the right to complain if no but you were still punished.

You do not own this content and that access is temporary.  \n\n3)  \"But what if a minor (a person under the age of 18/17---depending upon jurisdiction) agrees to this contract?  Minors can't enter legally binding agreements\".  This is a much more interesting situation, however starting a \"class action suit\" will net you absolutely nothing because in a class action suit, the lawyers get most of the money and the hordes of plaintiffs get zero.  \n\nON THE OTHER HAND, if you file a small claims case---which is what your case would fall under because the damages are less than $5,000-$7,500 (which is hte statutory maximum for small claims in most states), then you may have a chance.  Remember, in small claims court, there are no lawyers, it's just the litigants involved... plaintiff and defendant in front of a judge.  All you would have to do is prove you were a minor at the time of the transaction and boom, you win.  \n\nThe adults that want to claim they could get legal help are out of luck, however, because you do have the ability to enter a legally binding contract and you have no case.  \n\n--\nAll Riot would have to do to avoid this is simply put in a checkbox upon any purchase that says \"I certify that I am over the age of 18 and can legally purchase this content\".  Doing so essentially covers them, because it means that if you click that link you are stating that you're of the age of majority and you can legally enter a contract.  If you aren't over the age of 18 and click that link, then you are committing fraud and Riot could simply have the defense, \"they said they were 18, we made a reasonable effort to engage in a good faith contract\".","replies":[{"poster":"The Highest Noon","date":"2018-03-23T16:42:13.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except, isn't there something somewhere that says \"Don't accept unless you have an adult present or are 18 years of age?\"\n\nI don't remember, it's been years LOL but the game has a T rating anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-03-23T05:14:27.645+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man.. it's been a while since I saw a lawsuit threat.\n\nThanks for making my day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mnstryvii","date":"2018-03-23T15:58:05.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"I'm sure RIOT believed that their gamers were smart enough to dig through their contracts after haphazardly coming up with a new system to battle toxicity rofl.
