I just dont understand how this is still a recurring problem considering all the updates and bug fixes riot does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-24T17:19:41.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower priority queue from [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) would occur after multiple leaves, and not a single game.  It's not something that can be disputed because leaving still causes other players a negative experience.  My suggestion would be to resolve whatever is causing you to crash and restore your standing with leaverbuster.  If you are still having an issue, let me know what's going on in detail and I'd be happy to help.  Let me know!","replies":[]}]}
