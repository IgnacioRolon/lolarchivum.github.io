I checked the trinket key but it was not interfering with the emote one . I already saved my emotes before that game and I don't know what could have gone wrong \r\nAre emotes still in an experimental stage or I be done something wrong ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-12T00:37:04.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK they should be working on all regions currently. I've heard word that there were some issues with them not working correctly in custom games, which might explain what was going wrong. We could go ahead and try resetting your config settings, which should reset the Emote Keybind back to 'T'. \n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings\n\n\nLet me know if this works or not, and if you got those emotes working!","replies":[]}]}
