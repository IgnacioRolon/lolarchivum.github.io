And they are unnecessary.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"Smurfs make learning the game more difficult. Not easier. Things I hear when I say this typically are;\r\n\r\n**Be glad and learn from it. Maybe you will learn something.**\r\n-The problem with this is the skills needed to be good at this game is practice at watching details and keeping track of things. Not mechanical skill. Mechanical skill is 20% maybe of what you need to know. The rest is things that take practice. I also cannot learn from someone who does not tell me how they did something. Most Smurfs just destroy a lane then steamroll victory then leave with no advice given.\r\n\r\n**But I am only Smurfing to improve my bad lane.**\r\n-Do it in teambuilder. It has a system FOR that specific thing. It adusts skill to new roles or champs so you can practice in Team Builder and not ruin someone's day by playing Bronzies as a Plat. On top of that you will ALWAYS play the lane you want to improve where in Ranked that is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\n**I want to play with my friends without bringing up the challenge rating**\r\n- Then DONT play ranked. Play other modes. Playing Ranked with a friend is Boosting and IT IS NOT authorized by Riot. \r\n\r\nThere are other issues brought up for Smurfing but none of them matter because all it will do is make people stop playing. Its already a pain to deal with people not building right, performing poorly, bad attitudes, AFK's/DC's, Trolls and Feeders. Adding Smurfs to that causes more issues. And to those that Smurf to Brag and Show Off. Your a special kind of Douchebag. It is like a minor League player coming to play with Highschool kids and Owning them without giving any kind of incentive to keep going. Just being all HA I AM BETTER THAN YOU SUCK IT! Guess what? THat makes you a Grade A Douchebag.\r\n\r\nIF anyone wants to try and convince me that this opinion is flawed because you have a legitimate reason to smurf please state it. I am not against being shown a different side to this but so far I do not see any need for Smurfs other than making yourself feel better about your skill level. As if your Rank was not enough.","replies":[]}
