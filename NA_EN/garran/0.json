While a lot of players that never played galio are happy about it, I would like to send a request regarding the conditions of this revamp, as it doesn&#039;t appear to sufficiently stay faithful to the original concept....at all. \r\n\r\nThis is, quite literally, a new champ.  The reason why the negative feedback in necessarily high about this is that, regardless of whatever&#039;s going on to those that did play Galio, people are seeing a new champ and are simply pleased by that. I&#039;m speaking on account of those of us that had mained the original Galio for several years though. As quoted by the riot staff in his Q&amp;A on redit, they stated they did this revamp like so because, &quot;Very very few people&quot; in League were pleased by his winrate. Please note that from my observations, Galio was never given a chance to become stronger, and with item changes (Most notably things like changing {{item:3174}} ), he only got passively weaker. This goes to show that their data is most likely inaccurate and doesn&#039;t work correctly to display the true feelings of those that played Galio. Likewise, &quot;Very Very Few&quot;, is still a lot of people when taking account the number of those that play League. There&#039;s hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of league players, so even .01% of the population being unhappy about the revamp would still be at least ten thousand individuals. \r\n\r\nWhile I do understand that as a company, Riot must take steps to ensure optimal profit, the original Galio was in no way hindering the game. His design and such, has been altered enough by this rework that the original Galio doesn&#039;t in fact, currently exist now. I would like to request that either the rework be rolled back, or the two Galios be separated. The two champions are far too different for this rework to do justice for him. \r\n\r\nI would also like to present proof of the discontent of those that mained Galio, simply by providing the link yo the Galio subreddit, and to a few screenshots I made of players in the reddit responding to this revamp. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading this ticket fully, and I beg that your company take into consideration the feelings of those that played this champ for so many years before that of those that never played him, and perhaps try to take steps to make a considerable compromise. Many of us that saw the revamp are leaving League, I myself included. If this isn&#039;t resolved, there isn&#039;t a way to fix it. Many of us are feeling bitter about the removal of our main champion and would like to have the benefit of Riot understanding and attempting to fix this. \r\n\r\nSo, what do you guys think of this? Maybe if this gets popular enough, Riot staff will actually give us a couple cents of attention...","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-23T15:23:12.194+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your complaints are valid, riot deleted your champion from the game.

Fiora, etc?\n\nGalio was in my champion pool also. I always new he was due for a tune up, but I was annoyed when they announced he was getting a \"Sion/Poppy\" level rework, which is essentially a new champion, that's a spiritual succeser of the old. You have champion updates, and reworks, and I was hoping his would be more inline with Fiora, Warwick and Taric, where you feel like it's clearly the same champion, but updated for the current time. \n\nSion, Poppy and Taric had clear design flaws that made it so if they were ever too viable, they were just broken. (point and click stun, immunity,etc.) So big changes were warranted.\n\nGalio was actually in a decent spot with a high win rate, good at what he did. Galio was a disengage/peel tank, similar to the likes of Cho'gath or Braum, awful at engaging w/o flash but his Q made him a great peeler, along with shielding carries and his ultimate to round up divers. \n\nNow he's just an all around tank, that happens to be good against AP. What always bothered me about Galio was that even though he was good against magic he never really screwed magic damage users over in the same fashion that Malphite or Rammus did to AD users. \n\nIf you picked Malphite or Rammus into a full AD team it was pretty much GG, not just because there damage scaled with Armor, but they're kits inheritly screw over AD users. Malphite with his attack speed slow, helping his **entire team** and Rammus reflecting damage back. \n\nI was hoping the Galio rework would make him the AP Malphite, but all he got as a Magic shield. Imo if they just gave old Galio the current passive he has now and just take the absurd cast time away on his E, he would have been fine. \n\nRegardless I'm liking the new Galio and I think he'll be a fine addition to my champion pool. His Q is still there even if it doesn't slow, and I don't have to worry about getting CC'd for my taunt. I mean the amount of CC he has is kind of crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"Garran","date":"2017-03-23T17:00:59.402+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, he's pretty nice as a standalone champ.

His melee AAs felt of cause he wasn't really rewarded for going melee asides from the ult(that also had ~550 range if you just wanted a specific target)\nHe didn't even have good base stats on his AAs unlike other tanks like malph, mao or gragas. It was more in line with mages like morgana.\nSo imo there were two good ways to solve that issue: give him a reward in meleerange, and simply changeing his passive the way they did would have been enough(with some number balanceing for his overall damage), giving him a reason to use go in meleerange duering his W tankiness window for the extra burst.\nOr Giving him ranged AAs, imo 450 range like morgana would have gone a long way for him, still keeping him somewhat close combat as tanky mage, but not full melee without payoff either.\nBut that rework, besides deleteing his form character in terms of story, art and vo, eliminated nearly all mage aspects and turned him into a clear tank. And Galio never was a pure tank, he always was a mage/tank hybrid.\nAlso, his melee attacks are actually a point for him beeing a mage: Every tank has a kit that works better if they can stay close to their opponents, either aoe dots like Amumu's W, spamable close combat spells or echanted AAs, spells that automatically get you to melee range and so on. \nThx to his pointless AAs and no other melee skills, Galio never profited from going melee later on(in lane, especially vs mages, the AAs still had impact). In teamfights, Galio would have the same effective impact with his base kit from ~800 range as he would have in melee range, which fits for a mage but is very unusal for a tank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2017-03-23T15:07:27.263+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"First off, no need to flip out like that. \n\nSecond, he was a melee mage.
