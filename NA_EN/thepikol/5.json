I ignore it. Never cheated and no need to. It destroys the game.  But what I don't understand is how they found me.  They say they played a recent game with me but when I look up recent match history I don't see there names.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-22T17:10:34.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't click the link, there's nothing to worry about.
