I haven't known about it in my 2+ years of playing the game.\n> You also forgot that most mages are mid because its the shortest lane thus the safer considering their immobile (generally speaking) nature.\n\nSO in regards to this, I was talking with some friends about this topic and it came out that it might end up happening that your mage who used to go midlane would go to a lane depending on what side you start. If you're blue side you would want to send them top so they would still be near a blue buff. Other side you would want to send them bot. Plus bot is considered the \"safest lane\" as of now because of the limited gank paths, including there are a handful of mages that are played top anyways (Vladamir, Swain, Galio, Karma, Malzahar, Cassiopiea) that are all either tanky enough to survive on their own against other top laners, or have enough mobility to reliably get away if they're good enough. This could be a really fun and interesting change to the meta and match ups, as you wouldn't have mages fighting mages in the early game, it would be mages fighting tanks and hoping to push in  and roam to mid with the jungler looking for early kills. \n> I also dont think it'll encourage junglers to only gank mid either; mid is a short lane.\n\nI would counter this argument with bringing up a handful of junglers that don't terribly care about lane length.

Right before the Ardent meta catchup assist exp meant supports could just roam all day and stay at a similar level to their team since they didn't have to farm or soak minion exp.
