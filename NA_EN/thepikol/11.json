So far champions had only 1 emote (or in very rare cases 2) if any. Most champions don&#039;t have n emote that shows them at all. \r\n\r\nThere were really amazing ideas in memotion contest for less popular champs. Plus there was a guy that made 45 really creative emotes that a lot of people would love to see. https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/KJI2f1eh-made-45-emotes-in-celebration-of-the-launch-of-patch-720\r\nSo I doubt Riot lacks ideas. \r\n\r\nDo they make emotes based on champion popularity? If so thay have to stop. These are not skins, if certain emote is good enough people will buy and use it. Do you know what emotes I see a lot? Rammus, Amumu, Naut. They are not polular champions but people just like them. These 3 new Jinx ones lacks something, they are very generic in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m ok with expressions showed on these 3 new emotes, but couldn&#039;t there be other champions that represent them?","replies":[{"poster":"BoringLittleF","date":"2018-08-01T11:08:57.297+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"She is the Harley Quinn of the League.

In fact she was probably the champion that hyped me the most in this game and I have been playing since just after Lucian was released. She represents the era that a lot of players started to get invested into the game. It's simply marketing. They are feeding off the connection she built when she was released. Those of us who were there for it hold a special place for Jinx in our hearts no matter how unbalanced she can be because she represents the good times in league and quite often she also fits the player base in emotion range.\n\nLet's put it this way: I am more hyped nowadays for champion reworks to old binary champions than to see new ones.

Most of the emotes are geared at emotions of yourself and the enemy team. Naut could possibly have an emote thats literally just an anchor symbolizing your team being heavy.","replies":[]}]}]}
