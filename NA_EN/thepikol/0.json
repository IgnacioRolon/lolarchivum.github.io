Neither of those boards have Discussion View enabled, so you won't be able to switch off Chronological there. The rest of the boards have it, so let me know if you can't do it elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2017-09-21T05:16:56.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yeah, you are right.
