Any region is able to post on the NA boards, but I don't think EUNE would be able to post on EUW for example. It looks like it might not be an issue anymore since this post in on the NA boards.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2017-06-06T05:18:09.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I log out and in again to post it.
