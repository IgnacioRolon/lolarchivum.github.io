Keestones for Mages were already useless, for most there was no difference if you took Aery or Comet and they both become worthless in late game when you teamfight.

However, Nimbus cloak seems to be cool because it gives you something more \"readable\" than Ultimate hat. There are many mages (and let's not forget supports who use Sorcery as either their main or their secondary rune tree) who can make use of the new rune, just to mention a few: \n{{champion:103}} {{champion:131}}  {{champion:105}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:142}} \n\nI would also like to highlight the fact that Nimbus cloak is not a keystone but a simple rune, which means that many other champions, who would usually pick something else as their secondary tree, can now pick Sorcery and Nimbus cloak as a niche rune pick. I'd like to mention a few champs who sometimes can make use of it: \n{{champion:84}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:145}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:23}} \n\nYou are, however, totally right in the fact that there are many mages (and also other kind of champions too) who don't profit from Nimbus cloak at all. These champions are the ones whose ultimate either roots them to one place or makes point-and-click moving impossible (or useless). Just a few of these champions:\n{{champion:254}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:164}} \n\nBut hey, this is why there are other runes because runes are supposed to fit certain champions and playstyles. The old Ultimate hat didn't fit a few champs either, especially the ones with special or low-CD ults, such as: \n{{champion:126}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:142}}\n\nI often don't agree with the things and buffs-nerfs  they make at Riot, but this new rune seems pretty fun and sometimes game (or at least 1v1 fight) changing.

Therefore any keystone in the path should benefit mages if it were to empower their abilities. Nimbus cloak fails to do so. Hardly any mage would benefit from this than what it could have benefited from ultimate hat. Btw riot has if anything, made runes simpler and easier so newer players have an easy time.
