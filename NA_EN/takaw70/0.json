When I enter the pvp.client page (after the log in page) it is basically frozen. I cant do anything on this page anymore and I cant play. It does load, but it is so slow (basically lagging hard) I cant do anything.  My ping and internet is fine and my laptop is new. All of the pages before this (launch page, log in) are perfectly fine. Please help me on what to do about this problem. Thanks!!
