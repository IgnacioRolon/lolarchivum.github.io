After one hour, it still hadn't responded.\r\nPressing Alt + Tab to open task manager does work, but the entire screen except for the taskbar is black and I can't see anything, so I can't terminate the task from task manager.\r\nRight clicking on League of Legends and pressing close doesn't help either. All I can do is restart the computer.\r\nAnyone else having this problem? I'm using the new launcher, by the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Summonah12369","date":"2018-01-06T23:37:28.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It just happened ti me out of nowhere where the defeat thingy doesn't even appear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T18:10:03.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It sounds like something could be causing you to disconnect from pvp.net when when the match ends, so it can't transition over to the post-game screen adnd going haywire.
