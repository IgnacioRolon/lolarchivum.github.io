Everything is in Turkish and I can't understand anything.\r\nI tried going to RADS/system/locale.cfg and changing it to en_gb from tr_tr, but it only worked on the patcher. I'm using the beta client and nothing seemed to help change the language there. I even tried going to regions.txt and adding a \"|en_US\" after the \"tr_TR\", but nothing happened.\r\nIf anyone has a solution to this, I'd appreciate their sharing it with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Lets Light it Up","date":"2017-06-28T12:51:51.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuKAWo40jik this guy explains it easy and good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T22:18:45.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each region has their own specific set of languages that it supports.

In Greece, it's hard to get below 70 ping because the EUNE server is in Frankfurt and it requires a standard amount of time for data to reach. So, when the least amount you can get is 77 in my case, having someone watching HD videos on Youtube or downloading large files while you're playing can ruin the experience.\nAs I said, Riot can't do anything about this latency issue, as it's a problem on my end.","replies":[]}]}]}
