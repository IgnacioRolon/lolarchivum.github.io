But this time its not funny i have been issued a leaver buster for something i myself have no control over..... A BUGSPLAT ok ok but lets be honest here you shouldnt get a bugsplat for your game crashing and you having to reconnect its just not very fair. and i know there are several ways to avoid the Leaverbuster system like shutting down your system but i dont want to do that every time i bugsplat i think that it should detect whether the leave was intentional like closing the game or whether it was a game issue and i feel like anyone affected by this deserves some type of apology or reward for having to sit here and deal with a broken system that has needed fixing since release  {{champion:122}} cough cough","replies":[{"poster":"No surrender","date":"2015-11-09T17:16:55.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No damn way, trust me, you don't want to have any mercy point in leaverbuster.\n\nIf LB would let you to not be punished for crash, then there would be released massive exploits that can crash the game and make it in the way LB would think it's not your fault. You don't want to have a lot of kids in game that uses some \"LolCrasher\" program? Because that would happen if LB would have mercy for crashes.\n\nIs it fair? No, but many things that are not fair are in the end good in the global scale.\n\nImagine now some fat kiddo that scores 0/8 on midlane and tells to himself \"fck it I am gonna LolCrash.exe it and eat something\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ceroria","date":"2015-11-09T23:43:40.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should atleast make it detect how the game was going","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-11-09T18:52:10.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ceroria, \n\nSounds like you're having this problem a lot judging by your post.
