If you run into issues loading League, try temporarily disabling third-party software and reply to the thread below to let us know what did or didn’t work.\r\n\r\nHey everyone,\r\n\r\nThis week we’re rolling out anti-cheat changes to the League of Legends game client in North America, with other regions scheduled to follow shortly. These changes were created to help protect players from cheaters, and we’ve worked hard to help provide a safer and more competitive playing experience for everyone. \r\n\r\nWe’ve collaborated with software vendors and content creators to ensure compatibility with as many products as possible, but unfortunately, our update may still impact some legitimate third-party software. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of legitimate applications out there that we know you love, and we can’t test them all. We’ll need your help to identify the software that’s incompatible.** If you encounter a critical error message during the game**, try temporarily uninstalling or disabling the following software, and then comment below with what you disabled and whether it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n    - Security software (anti-virus and anti-malware products)\r\n    - In-game overlay software (Steam, Discord, TeamSpeak, Overwolf, ASUS Sonic Radar, etc)\r\n    - Streaming software (XSplit, OBS, Raptr, etc)\r\n    - Video capture software (Fraps, ShadowPlay, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\nOur mission in creating this software is to keep the game fair for players everywhere. We know how frustrating it is when new features work in unexpected ways, so please comment below so we can look into any issues you’re facing and work toward resolving them as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nSee you on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2018-06-14T05:11:17.475+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will this affect people playing on Linux using wine?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Perma","date":"2018-06-14T06:05:45.976+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":57,"body":"We've not specifically tested for compatibility with Wine or other Windows emulation or virtualization software.

We were told that you all didn't intend to break Wine but wouldn't deal with it if it did. Since then, PBE has been broken completely for both VM and Wine users. I often play casually while breaking from working on prrogramming projects and constantly rebooting into Windows where programming is harder and inefficient just isn't an option. If QEMU wasn't broken too, I could alt-tab to the VM and it wouldn't be too bad but somehow virtual machines aren't allowed either. These are some incredibly broad anti-cheat rules that just don't seem fair to a small but incredibly dedicated fan base. Those of us who play on Linux had to work harder to get our games running. For me, it was completely worth it until now because League actually runs faster \nfor me on Linux, despite running through Wine due to the optimized network and graphics stacks. I just wish there was a way for us to declare that we are using Wine and then have your anti-cheat system confirm that and run different checks.

The custom skins isn't about that though. The custom skin community I am talking about is about creations, bringing back old textures and visuals, making new content. The modding and custom skin community is in my eyes an important part of the spaces where players can express and develop their creativity and love for the game.\n\nEver since the change of the champion's skin format to the \"WAD\" system, we have had to break the rules. The game checks the WAD files when it starts up a game, and if Riot's signature isn't on them, it will simply close and say an error happened, then it will repair your game. Therefore, we came up with a way to patch the game's exe so that it doesn't check for the WAD signature, lettins us use custom WAD and re-enable custom skins. This is fine except it's already against the rules to do anything on the .exe. We don't want to break the rules, but it was the only way for custom skins to continue existing.\n\nWith the encryption changes, we most likely will not be able to patch the .exe in that fashion, and even if we figure out a new way to do, players who do it might get flagged for cheating and receive punishments for essentially no reasons (as customs skins were always \"use at your own risk but we tolerate it\").\n\nOn behalf of the custom skin community, I seriously want a dialogue to be opened between us, creators, and Riot. We just want to be able to exist while staying in compliance in the rules. I think it is about time that actual discussion is started between us and Riot so that players can still have fun and express themselves in the space of modding and custom skins.\n\nWe already have started thinking about some solutions, and some changes are quite easy and costless to implement while not harming any of the security / anti cheat purposes that you are seeking.\n\n\n\nIn hope for an answer,\n\nSincerely yours, Charles \"Hi I am me\", EUW","replies":[{"poster":"Raykay","date":"2018-06-14T18:40:41.713+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey Charles, Thanks for sharing your feedback and thoughts. While I am not the owner of this decision I certainly can help open up a dialogue with the right people at Riot. I'll reach out to you directly with my contact information and we can start talking. Hopefully we can find a solution that works for the custom skin community and Riot. \n\nJust to add some context here it was not our goal to destroy the custom skin community when we moved to WAD files or now with our new anti-cheat protection system. I did not work on the WAD change but it was done for two main reasons: decreasing patch sizes (smaller, more succinct file format) and increasing stability when dealing with asset corruption. With the protection system we wanted to move beyond just detecting and banning. We want to keep as many cheats as possible out of the game. The war of cheating will always be an arms race but it is one we are committed to.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JoeAnarchy","date":"2018-06-15T01:31:33.426+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want to play :( \ncant you possibly just revert the changes for now, until you've figured out a fix? \n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"IanGrove","date":"2018-06-15T01:46:03.374+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES PLEASE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BriboGarlic","date":"2018-06-16T02:21:29.687+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot, this is affecting a lot of linux users including myself.

A VM is still connected to your main pc, if your main PC had a virus in it, the person who made the virus would still be able to access your pw's (ofc not for all sites) through a complicated type of sniffing or man in the middle attack.\n\nI'm sorry, but this claim is pretty stupid. The only times VM's really do increase security, is when you're reverse engineering/testing a virus (or doing a review of one). And when that's the case, the VM is fully encapsulated to itself (meaning no internet connection).  \n\nDepending on what Riot does with the change, this will prevent a wide spread of level up bots. This will prevent a lot of scripting platforms and this will make the integrity of the game better. They will obviously monitor it and tweak based on what people prefer. But as it stands, the only people I've seen use a VM is for bot farms.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkRitual","date":"2018-06-14T08:52:16.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"The only legit VM type thing I can think of for League is emulating Windows on a Mac because the Mac client always has so many problems.\n\nThe thing about VM's is it can prevent Riot from obtaining correct some types of unique Machine ID data to track cheaters/scripters and enforce bans. I used to volunteer on an old game that had that issue when Mac users were using Wine. Their Machine ID number was always just \"1\" which made it more difficult to track cheaters over multiple accounts. There are definately other ways, but it might heavily complicate things if Riot is trying to do so with an automated system.","replies":[{"poster":"Zozucoth","date":"2018-06-14T10:29:06.372+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":4,"body":"There are also a reasonable number of Linux users that are now locked out (Mac is basically a modified closed source Linux). \n\nIndeed, using a VM increases your security. Software within a VM has no real access to your main operating system unless you give the rights. You basically run a VM to avoid getting a virus on your main operating system, test software, run software multiple times & a few more use cases. There are also people out there who are not allowed to run their private software outside a VM on their work laptop (nobody carries 2 laptops during a business trip [that applies to me :3 ] ). More and more technology companies are actually prescribing VM's. Today's computers hardly notice it anymore anyway. \n\nIn the end it's a desperate attempt by Riot Games (sorry, but I look at it kinda realistically as programmer). Their game will have the bots & scripters probably for ever. It's a cat and mouse game. 2 botting platforms and many random dudes have already cracked the AntiCheat because it has been on the PBE for a while. The same will happen with the scripting platforms. Riot cannot infect/hook/control 100% of the windows system, so they have no chance of catching good cheaters. Microsoft cannot even protect its operating system from cracks. Valve has introduced VACnet some time ago - artificial Ai to catch the cheaters - the game is still full of cheaters. Only super obvious stuff gets caught. But at least their trust system sorts the suspicious players into their own games. Maybe Riot should try this path.\n\nThat just reflects my opinion! I could be wrong with some stuff, but from my research this is pretty much all true. Riot's new AntiCheat is btw called \"packman\" and they even suggest in the cracked lines of their code that you should check their careers page - WHAT? O.o \nI will not post links to different forum posts, but they are relatively easy to find and look very legit.\n\nAntiCheats and DRM's have never really helped in big games \n(well... online multiplayer is the best \"DRM\" + first days sales).\nBut they often do things that are especially questionable for European laws (scan files, hook system, transfer files to their servers & probably more stuff I don't know about). Riot really should introduce a trust system like Valve did. I never have cheaters in my games on older accounts.\nOn the other hand, it probably costs a lot of money to run servers for bots & scripters.\n\nPS: banning for HWID is btw super unreliable. Once the cheating platform gets suspicious atleast. Easy to change ... hell even some big windows10 updates did it in the past.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"coolcourd","date":"2018-06-17T16:49:37.459+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am soooooo sad.

And I'm very sad to have to let it go even if I was not more than a casual player for the last months. \n\nAnyway, since 8.11, my role has been almost deleted from the rift. It's sad to get flamed for playing adc. I can't imagine League without midlaner, but I guess now we can imagine FNC playing without a marksman, it's reality. I was sad about that, and still tried to adapt and keep having fun.\n\nAnd today, I connect, happy to enjoy my Vayne against Yasuo/Brand botlane, just for the beauty of the game. But which game? There is no more game as the critical error said. Sadly, I cannot choose League of Legends over Arch and Linux. I wish Tencent would have push its Linux efforts into LoL. Maybe one day. But for now I have to say:\n\nRoses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nLeague you were sweet,\nBut I leave you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sector46","date":"2018-06-26T06:14:25.717+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There are a lot of legitimate applications out there that we know you love, and we can’t test them all. **_We’ll need your help to identify the software that’s incompatible._**\n\nWhile the idea to implement anti-cheat features is noble, this statement just doesn't sit right with me. If the solution isn't scalable and/or dynamic, it's gonna have huge issues when introduced to the myriads of different configurations that are used to run League.\n\nWhat happens when new software is released that isn't compatible with the anti-cheat features? Will you have to write up a patch or two each and every time that new software is released to ensure it's anti-cheat compliant? To me, that doesn't seem feasible nor robust.\n\nBeing one of those minority LInux users since my introduction to League around 5 years ago, I've gone through a lot of the update changes and having to fix them in Wine time and time again. This wasn't a problem to me or others, as we could always find a way to work around the issues on the client side. However, when it gets to the point where we can't fix the issue on our side, then it feels like we're out of options.\n\nMy friends joke about how I should just dual-boot Windows to play all the games with them, but I'm firm about not supporting Windows because I think it's a terrible OS (my opinion).\n\nI've held out for a Linux client for so long, but Riot doesn't want to support a Linux client with a small player base. I can't really blame them for that, it's a business and they don't really have any stake in Linux.\n\nI hope this isn't how it ends guys, but it feels like it very well may be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoLTyrant","date":"2018-06-23T11:53:48.403+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"your anti-cheat isnt working people still cheat on aram and reporting people for doing so","replies":[{"poster":"Scibra","date":"2018-06-24T15:42:03.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Willing to bet that the anti-cheat is causing more issues than the number of cheaters it's preventing.
