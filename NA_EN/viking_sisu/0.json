The league clients keeps lagging when i try to lock into a champ or ban it wont let me or it just pauses. I even have all the settings at the lowest possible. now Im in a 20 minutes low priority queue simply because the damn client keeps lagging out and stopping me form lbannign and selecting a champ. even the chat lags very badly. How do I fix this? I have tired all of riots recommended trouble shooting, but It hasnt fixed it, andim ready to leave the game its gotten so bad","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-06T22:27:16.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by bugging out?  Is this specifically happening in-game or during champion select?  Is this on the updated client?  Are you using any third party programs like play.tv?  Let me know, and I'll be happy to help!","replies":[]}]}
