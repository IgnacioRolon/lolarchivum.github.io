When I login the client either gets stuck on authenticating or the login fails and gives the message \"an unspecified error has occurred...\". The interesting part of this is that the client will ALWAYS reject a false password, but it can't login valid credentials. After working through all of the troubleshooting articles on League, none of them work. Even after running all of the netlogs and tests, Riot support was eventually just stumped, saying the issue must be ISP related since it doesn't appear to be on my side. I returned the laptop, after all if it can't play League it can't do what I need it do (lol). The new laptop I exchanged it for is a different model and still the issues persist, I took the laptop to McDonalds, cashing in on the free wifi, and the problem still continued. The only slight fix I was able to find was using Hotspot shield VPN allowed me to login, however the connection is much too unstable and none of the functions of the client work and the client loses connection if the VPN is turned off. Ultimately we could argue back and forth and blame ISPs or weird settings, but with an issue which seems to be prevalent to many users ever since patch 7.13's release, and no possible user fix, I think it warrants a hotfix or at least an investigation into the underlying causes of this issue. TL;DR If it can't be fixed on our end, and the issue is so specific to League, something in League is causing the issue, and hopefully Rioters can provide a fix soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T02:52:03.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If there truly were issues with our physical servers, using a VPN like Hotspot Shield wouldn't be able to get you connected either. VPN's are able to help people get connected when their ISP is routing their connection in a less than optimal route.\n\nIt seems like this might be the main issue for you as well, since using that VPN was able to finally get you connected again. Essentially, the reason you weren't able to get logged in is most likely due to the route your connection was taking, and it was most likely getting hung up on a specific node. Let's do a quick test for some packet loss to see if that's the main problem using our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot of what it says, and shoot it my way for us to go over together.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-07T13:58:57.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry @broporo but I've had the same exact issue for over a week.

I'll just be blunt and honest, it's only a League of Legends problem, everything else on my computer works fine, how can you be so stubborn and not just admit that there is a problem, I'm not asking for a refund or an apology, I just want to see a fix be made for the issue so that I can play the game, and there's never going to be a fix to the problem if Riot support won't even acknowledge it. The fact that you even suggest me doing that fucking test, again, just proves you didn't even fully read my post in the first place where I said I had already went through support! Quit brushing your customers off to the side and treat with them the respect that they deserve and actually hear out their complaints for once, I guarantee if there is ever a fix for this issue, it'll come in the form of a patch, even if its not on the patch notes.","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T18:02:05.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I'm sure that you'll probably say that my ISP lied in that claim, and maybe they did. But I think it just proves another point, that ISPs won't work with their customers, most of them are notorious for their horrible customer service, just like mine is, but my internet isn't having any problems, League of Legends is. My ISP won't work with me, and I can't justify them to do it. It sounds ridiculous when I contact my ISP for a League of Legends issue, it's like trying to return something from Walmart to Target, they'll just dismiss you and brush you off to the side, and both my ISP and Riot Games are doing it. I've played since season 2 with the same ISP and I've never had an issue that I couldn't fix before with the help of Riot Support, and this time y'all can't fix it, the only thing that changed on my computer in patch 7.13  was League of Legends, and the only thing that doesn't work, is League of Legends. It doesn't take a genius to see the problem, if you TRULY believe that I'm wrong or crazy or something, then please reach out to me in a better form of communication such as telephone or add me in client, and I can use the mobile app to message with you, I'm certainly not getting anywhere by waiting 18 hours for an email from a rioter, we can't make any progress.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-11T20:25:33.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I just got off the phone with Otelco and as of sometime yesterday Riot admitted to it being a direct connection between them and Windstream being the issue.

They both have engineers currently working on a fix for the problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T20:24:05.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I can't say one way or the other about Riot admitting to having issues with our IP address since I've never heard that bit of knowledge until just now. With that being said, if it were true then every single player would be having the exact same login issues you've had recently. I did notice that you mentioned doing netlog tests, but we do need to go through those steps again just like any troubleshooting. It's more beneficial for me to know exactly what's happening each step of the way, rather than assume everything is fine and skip a step that might hold the main issue. \n\nThat [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) will have you ping our servers specifically, which might show whether or not your connection is having problems reaching our servers as opposed to Googles server for instance. You're free to do that test and post a screenshot here for me to see, and I'll be sure to check back frequently for replies. If not, go ahead and check out the steps in our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), or reach our to our tech team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) where they can troubleshoot with you one on one.","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T20:47:16.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've already provided my net tests and logs to a rioter, if you'd read the posts you'd have known that and I wouldn't have to repeat myself again. We've already diagnosed the issue to be between my ISP and the Riot Games server at 192.64.170.252, and both my ISP and Riot do the same thing, blame each other. I really don't know what it is, I'm not trying to figure out the issue at this point, we already know what it is, we've already reached that conclusion with LudusBonus and Prynce on your support side. I'd be more than happy to provide you with a screenshot of these tests, but I can't attach a picture or file to my post, what would you like for me to use to send you a screenshot? But I gurantee you're only going to reach the same conclusion as the other Rioters.\n\nThe number one issue is the fact that when I call my ISP they will not do anything about it, Otelco's support is currenty aware of the issue, and every single one of them says the same thing because it's been such a large issue that it had to be addressed to support. They claim it's a problem with your IP, they've ran multiple tests, and only one server in Missouri can connect to it, or something like that. They act like they have no idea what to do, and offer no help and won't let me speak to a higher level technician with this problem, if you'd like more of an idea of what I'm talking about feel free to call them: \t(866) 761-3462\nI'd love for you or someone to call and talk to them to get more of an idea about the situation, maybe a higher up in your department could collaborate with their higher ups and get it fixed before the weekend :) thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-07T20:55:23.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I missed your tickets, but yea if you posted that screenshot here (which you can actually do using something like Gyazo or Imgur) I'd most likely come to the same conclusions. If you're already working with tech agents then they're going to be your best source of help at this point. \n\nIt really sucks you're going through all of this, trust. I've been through the same issues trying to get connected to certain games. Once I even lived somewhere with subpar internet and couldn't even get connected to Blizzard's servers. Honestly, I would keep working with those techies and possibly try setting up a different VPN connection. Setting it up in a different way might be able to route your connection in a more stable way.","replies":[{"poster":"Zykath","date":"2017-07-07T22:07:04.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got off the phone with the highest supervisor I could speak to, and we ran tests etc, told them what y'all had said and here's the final conclusion he reached: They're able to send their packets out into the internet, and they're able to reach you sometimes using your Riot direct address 104.160.131.1 and they say that they're able to send a connection all the way to Riot's main server at 192.64.170.252, but then they can't get into the server there, sometimes when they do get into the server, the connection dies while within riot servers, and they say the connection issue is out of their hands after they send it. They said were more than happy to work with Riot on a solution, but there isn't a phone number or way to contact Riot officially for them, so they can't. Calling (866) 761-3462 will reach their tech support and they said they'd put a Rioter right up to their highest technicians/supervisors to work on the problem. They may close soon, or may have just closed though, but maybe put it on a sticky note on your boss's door? lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"weeps","date":"2017-07-07T16:07:37.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its about time to stop beating around the bush and fix the problem i've spent alot of money on my account and would really like to play on it.","replies":[]}]}
