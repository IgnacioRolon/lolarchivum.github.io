They dont listen to any chat they just go to any lane they want and move in specific patterns. I even get some games where i am the only real player. So i dicied to have some fun by playing as Tahm , bard and anivia to troll them. I want to do this but haven't done it yet cause i wanted to know whether this is seen as greefing. We always end up winning cause bots are so bad but i was wondering wether this still seen as greenfing. \r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nIronLurd","replies":[]}
