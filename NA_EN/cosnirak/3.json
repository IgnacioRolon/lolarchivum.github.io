Please as the title says, justify this. How is Lux not getting buffs next patch? Everything the commentators say about Lux is everything we&#039;ve all already known for so long and proven repeatedly in the game itself. It&#039;s not just community echo chamber, it&#039;s not just that what&#039;s good in pro play and solo queue are different, it&#039;s that Lux sucks. Her strengths rarely even matter let alone shine. Her weaknesses are glaring and massive.\n\nThis is the sort of thing people are talking about when they get pissed over stuff like Zed buffs and say \"Really?! You&#039;re buffing that champion while others?!\" There are so many ways you could buff her without making her op or obnoxious. Honestly she could probably use a rework of the level Garen and Darius are getting next patch, maybe even more than that.\n\nAnd ya know what? I would love to write all about it, to suggest tons of stuff, to make a reasonable case for it all. But why spend the time and effort on that? The odds it gets anyone to do anything about it are next to none. Hell this entire post is almost certainly going to accomplish nothing except me getting to vent so the 2 people that read it can down vote it and/or tell me I just suck at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-14T02:37:07.061+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't watch the video at the moment, but I am interested in hearing what everyone thinks about Lux.

Her R? SOOOOO fun to cast. Even if it sucks it _looks_ and _feels_ amazing.\n\n\"What specifically is it about Lux that you (or anyone else that reads this) think she needs changes? What is she supposed to be good at that she's failing to do at the moment? Is there something baseline she's just too weak at to even be competitive?\"\n\nI could spend hours writing about potential options to fix her but I'll try to briefly mention what's wrong instead.\n\nHer mana is incredibly bad and none of the good to buy early mana options work for her. Her cds are too long and costs too high for Tear. She's the opposite of the kind of mage that wants Catalyst into RoA because she shouldn't be up close getting hit at all and her costs are so high she can still easily run out of mana. This leave Chalice into Athene's, what people often get on her. Nothing even comes close to beating Athene's in mana regen in fights that actually result in kills and assists. But Chalice itself actually sucks because mana regen based on base mana regen will always be terrible early on. Even with Athene's her mana is so bad that without kills/assists/blue buff she still easily ooms. I take pure mana regen seals, chug mana pots, rush Athene's, and still have trouble wave clearing reasonably let alone poking anyone if I don't get a blue buff.\n\nHer base stats are bad, very very bad. She's squishy, slow, immobile, has only a weak shield to keep herself alive, and is a very easy target for early kills.\n\nHer passive is awful. It's the exact opposite of what the entire rest of her kit is about and to top it off her attack speed is the worst, making it hard to even use her passive effectively for wave clear with her E. The best use of her passive is popping it with her ult to help you kill people.\n\nAll of her \"utility\" is actually pretty weak:\nHer root duration never changes and the cd on her Q starts at 15 and eventually scales into what Morgana's is at every rank. The ability to hit two targets or through a minion is fairly laughable because it does half everything to the second target. Also the particle is pretty narrow.\nHer shield's 'potential' is massive but its actual shielding done is almost always tiny due to its cast time, travel time, short duration per application, narrow width, refreshing rather than stacking on champs hit twice, long cd, and penchant for allies to dodge it on accident. It is good for doing Baron.\nThe slow on her E starts weak, scales slightly with ranks to still being weak, doesn't scale with ap, only lasts for .25 seconds after someone leaves it or its popped, and is very punishing to use for anything but damage due to its high mana cost and cd. Her E does grant vision while sitting there which is nice but hardly unique or strong.\n\nHer damage per spell is bad early unless you always pop her passive, mediocre in the mid game, and basically on par with similar champions later on. But her cooldowns are medium to long outside her R. For an ultimate her R is on a relatively low cd and is her best and most fun spell but even it isn't really all that impressive in terms of damage and it's not that hard to dodge if you aren't cced.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things is that while laning she has a hard time last hitting because all of her damage doesn't line up well with killing minions. If you E the whole wave just one auto won't finish a melee minion despite the passive. If you E the whole wave + auto the casters the melee start to die before you can get to them. You end up with really awkward stuff like E the wave, auto 1 or 2 casters, wait to auto melees as your minions put them just in range, which means you get 2 passive procs on 6-7 minions and only 2 easy minion kills despite using a spell. As you level and get items it changes a ton and the details are intricate and depend on how much gold you have of course but until you can just E + R to kill a whole wave it's always time consuming and annoying. Meanwhile Viktor just goes E and they all die...\n\nThe one fix I will suggest besides the obvious \"fix her mana\" is to change her passive. It's really annoying and bad and often feels like a death trap vs champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2015-08-14T06:01:53.565+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're the OP, I'll leave this here.\n\nThe amount of detailed feedback this has gotten is just mind-boggling.

Her base damage is decent and her ratios are good, but she is so gated by mana that early laning against a lot of the top tier champs mid right now is, for lack of a better word... frustrating.\n\nShe's fine when she has mana and can lane against basically anyone, but two full spell rotations takes her mana pool to nil... Then I look at champions like Azir who can get out three of his soldiers, send them in and dash in behind them for only a little more mana than Lux's rotation... At level 5... At level 9 it is actually more mana spent by Lux to do Q-W-E than it is for Azir to do W-W-Q-W-E. That stay's true when you include their ultimate abilities too. (That also ignores that a champion like Azir has way more damage potential than Lux.)\n\nComparing her to Viktor (another of the higher tier mid lane champions at the moment) isn't much more favorable. While at lower levels Lux can trade with Viktor more easily in terms of mana costs, hers scale way higher way faster than his do on both Q and E. That would be a tolerable trade off if Lux dealt more damage than Viktor, but she doesn't. Before Viktor even upgrades the damage on his E (through the hex core) it has both higher base damages AND scaling than Lux's E. Yes, Viktor's doesn't slow, but its not like he can't buy Rylai's _and then have a better slow than Lux._ (Not to mention that the CC potential of his gravity field far outstrips anything Lux has to offer at the cost of being slightly less reliable than Lux's CC.)\n\nTL;DR Version: I can tolerate higher mana costs on Lux if she was dealing more damage than other mid laners. She isn't. I could tolerate lower damage if she had lower mana costs. She doesn't. Even then, I guess I could tolerate that particular gate on her mana/damage if she was offering more utility than other midlaners... (You can see where I'm going with this.) She doesn't. Either the mana gating should go, or she should get some kind of compensation for her VERY high mana costs.","replies":[{"poster":"Tourian","date":"2015-08-14T14:29:20.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Victor himself is actually a big problem for mid ATM.

Most other mid range burst/control mages are relatively weak (Azir and Viktor actually stick out for being the exceptions to that rule) compared to assassins and poke champions mid lane. I can't remember the last time that I saw a Lux/Brand/Ziggs/Lissandra/Malzahar/Vel'koz/Veigar in a pro match do well. I haven't even seen any of those champions in a Challenger Series match do well.\n\nNow, some of those have to do with pretty glaring weaknesses (Brand's ulti is unreliable with how it fizzles, Veigar's early game is awful, Malzahar's ultimate can be cleansed out of, etc), but they aren't given any kind of compensation for those glaring weaknesses or changes to their kits to allow them to function with those weaknesses intact if they are meant to be parts of those champions' gameplay.\n\nViktor, conversely, has obvious weaknesses (squishy, low range, relatively low mobility) but he also has effective ways to compensate for those weaknesses with good play. That is kind of the sign of a well made and balanced champion, unlike the state that the aforementioned champions are left in.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Herald","date":"2015-08-14T08:12:46.163+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think there isn't one huge glaring problem that Lux suffers from, but a lot of little/medium things that make her a less viable pick.\n\n**- Mana**\nProbably her biggest issue. Most of her spells cost too much when she hits around level 4. She's pretty much forced to get Athene's no matter what, which isn't that big of a deal but again it doesn't really leave her the option of going Morello's/Tear/RoA.\n\n**- Other Champs Can Do What She Does But Better**\nWhile not saying that there is a champion that can 1-up all her skills, most of her skills can be done by better champions whether in terms of utility or power. Besides Lux's Iconic Ult which got name-nerfed, her skills aren't as strong as other mid-lane mages. I don't know if people would agree with the following assessment but I'll give it a whirl.\n**Passive: Illumination** - I think when she was first released her passive made a lot of sense. She had to risk more by attacking to get the most out of her spells and it actually differentiated good vs great Lux players. But as time passed, mobility creep pretty much makes her passive not worth procing. Assassins (Ahri, Zed, Talon, etc) who have strong mobility pretty much force her not to AA them because they have easy ways to all-in even if they get rooted.  I feel like an okay buff would be to let other people proc it for her so it could boost her support/team potential since she works well in a comp that can protect her or hard cc the team.\n\n**Q: Light Binding - 2 Sec Root.** Not bad on paper. But her Q missile speed is 1200 and has a small hitbox. Lets compare to other straight skill shots with cc attached to it.\n{{champion:103}} : E--ProjectileSpeed=1587(1600)  1-2 Charm (Way better than root)\n{{champion:60}} : E--ProjectileSpeed=1437(1400) 1.6-2 Stun (Faster and better than a root)\n{{champion:7}} : E--ProjectileSpeed=1559(1600) 1.5 Root (Kind of holds up to the same standard, less root time for faster speed. Has a smaller hitbox I believe)\n{{champion:89}} : E--ProjectileSpeed=1970(2000)  (Harder to compare since this is a tank support with a root, but still almost twice as fast!)\n{{champion:117}} : Q--ProjectileSpeed=1513(1500)  (Another Utility Mage who's kit is just better than Lux utility-wise. Sure it's a slow but it's 80% and you can safely use it with her E)\n{{champion:25}} : Q--ProjectileSpeed=1173(1200) (Same speed here, but up to 3 sec root and bigger hitbox)\nPoint is most spells with CC are way faster than Lux and are more reliable in the long run.\n\n**W: Prismatic Barrier** - I actually like this skill a lot, lots of potential here for a great Lux to thrive in team-fights. I think the problem I encounter most is the fact that it isn't as instant and reliable as other shields. Most other shields from other supports/mages are generally instant (but only affect 1-2 people at most, except for a Mantra-ed Karma Shield). This makes it less reliable since a lot of fights can be decided in the blink of an eye. \n\n**E: Lucent Singularity - Her Damage Skill with a slow, but kinda crappy slow.** Honestly Ori's W beats this in almost every aspect. The missile speed iirc on this is 1300, which again, if you wanted to compare it makes it relatively easier to dodge than other mages. The recent buffs to let her pre-det were nice, but I think it needs a slight buff in missile speed/utility/mana cost.\n\n**R: Finales Fukeln - What is Final Spark? ** I think her Ult has no major issues. Only thing are it's bugs where it gets mis-aimed randomly. \n\nOverall her kit isn't bad, just lackluster. Lacks strong utility to make her a support, and lacks skills that are reliable to make her a decent mage. I think back in 2011/2012 she was more viable, but now there are just too many champs that do a better job than she does. Kind of how Taric used to be an OP support, but now there are just better supports around.\n\n**- Lack of Mobility**\nI'm going to refer to one of her past nerfs that I wish would get reverted. \n> v3.05 Balance Update\n> On top of her long range and wide array of defensive utility, Lux was also among the fastest ranged champions in the game. These changes force Lux to be more mindful of her timing and positioning as opponents now have more opportunities to capitalize on her mistakes.\n> \n>     Base Movement Speed reduced to 330 from 340 \n\nI know it's only 10 movement speed, but I feel like it was making her lack of mobility even more crappy. She is a Kiting Mage that has been around for 3 years and has been way too easy to catch nowadays. Moreover with items like {{item:3800}} and her lack of strong/reliable CC, she's probably in the same class as Zyra who, hey what do you know sucks in the meta now as well.\n\n**- What does she need then?**\nTo be honest I'm not entirely sure. She does great in ARAM and Dominion, but ask her to be in SR and she'll be an easy mid lane to gank or a support that just can't do as well as everyone else. \nI think her risk/reward in her kit should be tuned, probably on her passive and W or E. Maybe add MS when she procs her passive so she can escape a bit or let her gain some mana to offset her costs? Her pure skill-shot kit I believe should feel more rewarding.\nMoreover I believe she needs to be slightly more defined in either her utility or poke potential. She just doesn't fully excel in either, while other viable mages utility or not, can be more defined as one or the other.\nLastly, when Lux gets behind she is pretty much useless. She ends up doing little to no damage. And the utility in her kit just won't cut it to make plays.\n\n\nI don't know if that was helpful or even 100% on topic, but I hope that was informative!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crossette","date":"2015-08-15T21:28:46.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate Lux's damage.

She also can't effectively use Liandry's Torment, making her unable to handle powerful tanks like Dr. Mundo or Volibear.\n- Lux's E has a nasty mana cost, limiting her early purchase options essentially to Chalice of Harmony or Forbidden Idol. She CANNOT deviate from this without shooting herself in the foot.\n- Being completely skill-shot reliant, Lux is bad against mobile opponents who can dodge her attacks.\n- Lux pales in comparison as a support compared to Morgana and lacks Orianna's utility, while being outperformed in damage by Xerath and Ziggs. She essentially tries to be more versatile, but pays for it in terms of power and overall utility.\n- The usefulness of Lux's passive goes drastically down at the mid-game, when she cannot afford to get into autoattack range of an enemy. If she does, she'll generally get sniped when the enemy jumps on her.\n- Lastly, Lux's reliance on going 40% CDR means her builds are kinda limited; she essentially has to choose between Luden's Echo or Zhonya's Hourglass, and can't really build tanky or build AA Staff.\n\nLux is not bad by ANY stretch, but there are several things that hold her back.
