They're aware of the chroma issue and it will be fixed with the next patch.\n\nYou can play free week champions anywhere BUT ranked and as far as I can tell the majority of people who play mostly ranked don't want free week champions available in ranked. People playing champions they aren't good with is common enough without making it THAT easy. Also they gotta make money for the game to exist.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MVP x Legend","date":"2016-01-19T16:13:20.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but free week champs shouldnt be for use in ranked  yes maybe you are good with some of them but the fact that you dont own does free champs means you are really not good at them and for that you shouldnt be allowed to use them why would i want someone using Gnar just bcus he is op yet they have no clue how to use him thats =  good game.","replies":[{"poster":"Catastrop","date":"2016-01-19T19:54:31.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MVP x Legend,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=J2PsBp0q,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-01-19T16:13:20.377+0000)\n>\n>  but the fact that you dont own does free champs means you are really not good at them\n\nOr you're an impulsive buyer?

Unfortunately with this new rotation of champions I don't think there's any that I don't own that I'd be willing to play in ranked. xD The Vel'koz game was yesterday but that was Monday...
