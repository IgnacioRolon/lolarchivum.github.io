I send them second ticket (I know, it's stupid thing to do but I wanted to try it) and it says the same thing. :(\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-06T04:00:35.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Account recovery tickets require you to be logged out (for security purposes), therefore you aren't able to login to Riot Support to check the status of your ticket.\n\nWe address ticket in the order they're received, so you'll receive a response as soon as we get to your ticket.
