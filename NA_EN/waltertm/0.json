He&#039;s understandably a pretty unpopular champion right now, his playrate has been around 0.5% for a quiet while.\r\n\r\nSome changes were made for him couple of months ago which were scrapped (thank god), and in place of those we were told that some different tweaks are coming around 7.19 IIRC. I&#039;ve read somewhere that those changes would hit PBE around 7.22, but according to Meddler (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) there won&#039;t be any minor champion updates for a while. \r\n\r\nI can understand that any kind of minor update for such a statbag champion could pretty much screw up a whole lot of things right before the preseason, but for god&#039;s sake... **Udyr didn&#039;t even recive any kind of stat compensation for the lack of runes on PBE!**\r\n\r\nSo my questions are: what are the plans, for Udyr, if there are any? Why didn&#039;t he recieve the stat adjustments like the other 120+ champs did? I&#039;d be happy with **ANY KIND** of information. Oh, and god forbid me: will Udyr in the next 10 years recieve a VGU, or the 30$ visual update is not just a joke?\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely: a worried Udyr main {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2017-10-11T07:09:34.517+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into some Udyr buffs this patch (7.21), which I posted some early ideas for in another post a few minutes ago. I'll look into the stat compensation thing to make sure he's not getting the short end of the stick there. I imagine if he didn't get some sort of stat boost like everyone else, it was a mistake, but I'll double check what's going on.","replies":[{"poster":"WalterTM","date":"2017-10-11T13:59:52.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your answer. The stat compensations seem to be live on PBE now and that's kind of a relife. I'm also happy about the fact that you actually have some kind of plans for him. I do not really want to ask any more questions as you are probably not allowed to spoil everything, altough it would be nice to know wether you want to do like a Xin scale rework on him in the near future.

Udyr's problem has always been reaching and sticking to his target.  He is a melee champion with no gap closer (a dash/jump - running faster doesn't cut it), no anti-cc, and cannot maintain high speeds while dps.  Also as a frontliner he melts.\n\nHe needs to be able to do one of these things that he currently cannot do.\n1) Stick to a target (anti-cc, better slow/stun, better gap closing)\n2) Stay alive longer (take your pick, lots of options)\n\nHonestly if he could just stick to a target instead of being cc'd to death with absolutely no way to respond or counter play that would put him in a good place.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XdeathscyX","date":"2017-10-11T02:45:07.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":C","replies":[]}]}
