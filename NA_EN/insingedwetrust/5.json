And her passive is amazing.\n\nHer passive isn't amazing at all. It's a ball of stats she could inherently have in her kit without anyone noticing. If you increase the AP scaling on her abilities by enough then you can completely make up for the removal of the 30% AP boost. In fact, even with that boost, neither of her poisons do as much as they did pre-rework. Petrifying Gaze does slightly more from her AP, but they nerfed the bases to make up for that that. The 30% free AP ONLY buffs her Twin Fang compared to pre-rework (because its AP ratio is identical to its pre-rework value), so I'm not seeing what's amazing there. 3/4 of her kit does less damage despite it.\n\n25% CDR is there to make up for them increasing the CD on her Q by 33% with the rework. Twin Fang's reset is a static cooldown, so doesn't benefit.. Petrifying Gaze and Miasma like the CDR but could easily just have their cooldowns lowered if it was gone. Not seeing how this is amazing either.\n\nTwin Fang's heal is cool. I like that, even if it's random. My problem here is that there's so much stuff in her Twin Fang already that I'm confused as to why this part is locked away in her passive, when everything else about the passive is just random stats she's had taken away from her. It doesn't seem well-thought-out to me, because I can't understand what about this one particular part of the spell makes it the part that goes in her passive.\n\nHer passive looks amazing until you realise what she lost for it. The only thing her passive really does for her is give her spell vamp on her E and higher damage on her E (after 30 minutes). For the most part, it's just an arbitrary \"We've taken away all of these things from you and after 30 minutes you can have some of them back\" gate.

If you asked me, I'd say something like what a snake with poison would do, debuffing the enemy with poison. Many other late game champs don't have shitty shoe-horned stack mechanics in their kits, there's this mystical art called balancing. \n\nAdjust the ratios, costs, or whatever, but don't just give \"levers\" that amount to a ball of stats bigger than the sun locked behind stats and say \"yep that's a late game champ\", it's the laziest shit ever, clearly rushed, stashu even admitted he rushed it for the dumb lore event at the time.

E does like 300-500 dmg 2 times per second. That's like an ADC with 2.0 attackspeed, 200 AD, an IE, with 100% crit chance. And it's magic damage and MR itemization is a lot weaker (and it can't be thornmailed either cause it's a spell). her Q also does a lot of damage lategame. 1 Q on the enemy ADC is about 70-80% of their max hp. She tears apart everyone lategame. it's like Kog'maw, but with an actual self-peel mechanism (the aoe stun ult).\n\nThings I don't enjoy:\nThe passive works in spikes rather than ramping up the ap based on each stack. stacks 1-99 don't feel like anything, and stack 100 feels impactful, but not by much. Pre 250 stacks, she feels slow. Post 250 stacks, you start shredding everything apart.\n\nHer E CD reset seems awkward for laning. It's a flat 5 second CD if you last hit for the mana. perhaps I'm used to Annie Q which does refund some CD (or Karthus/yasuo Q which just has a low CD for last hitting). Poisoning the minions doesn't help because early on, the poison damage (and E damage) isn't enough that I can Q the casters then E each one of them once and be done with it (that comes when I reach that 250 stack midgame powerspike). I guess this is kind of a balance thing to make cassioepia not obnoxious. She scales into waveclear rather than starts out with enough damage to waveclear. Which is balanced as there is only one mage who naturally deals enough damage to clear waves solo ever since the Gragas 70% damage to minions nerf. (That mage is Singed)\n\nEarly game all-ins (and early game teamfights) suck as Cass. You go oom because of the small mana pool and all you can contribute is E spam (for a glorious 2 seconds cause mana pool) and a slow. You can't just regen the mana like in lane cause there usually aren't any minions to last hit during a skirmish. I'm guessing this is supposed to be a weakness that players will eventually find out and exploit to deal with Cassioepia's strong laning phase.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Astral Zephyroro","date":"2015-04-06T12:03:54.834+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you guys are asking for less rampant E spam, and to pretty much scrap the passive, or find a rework for it to fit, and then you want her actual q and w poisons to do the damage, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2015-04-06T13:24:45.944+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Astral Zephyroro,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Aj6ceTTj,comment-id=0011,timestamp=2015-04-06T12:03:54.834+0000)\n>\n> So you guys are asking for less rampant E spam, and to pretty much scrap the passive, or find a rework for it to fit, and then you want her actual q and w poisons to do the damage, right?\n\nYou are mostly correct. We don't mind E spam, we mind that E spam is currently her only effective play style now. Her E has too much of her kit's power concentrated into it and that needs to be redistributed. Her kits is about at about Q:5%, W:5%, E:75%, R:15% in terms of power balance where in a well balanced character, the numbers should be roughly equal, give or take a little. E should be stripped of most of its bells and whistles and brought back to the simplicity it had pre-rework. Q and W, as you said, need to have their power returned so that you can actually be an effective player if you decide to max one if them prior to E. The passive just needs to be scrapped entirely. It's not fun, it has no player interaction, and it doesn't even have a thematic feel like other similarly gating passives such as Syndra's or Bard's.

But yeah they are similar.\n\nExcept that Cassiopeia has the same kit, but with all the power put into 1 spell.\n\nKarma had all of her spells changed to serve different purposes \n(Q doesn't heal, made to nuke and slow, but because of splash radius actually gives LESS waveclear)\n(W isn't AoE and doesn't slow/buff speed, instead it heals and roots)\n(E shields still but with lower scaling and gives teamwide shield and Speed boost, the dmg is a joke tacked on to resemble old karma)\n(R, you can only hold one......)\n\nThey said Karma was a baiting champion that was bad at everything and required too much team coordination. Yet they gave her a heal based on having lower health and buffed her numbers on every single ability until she was mediocre. Then they created {{champion:201}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:432}}  which all have 1 skill that absolute requires a player to know what you do.

They have a frontloaded spell while the others are lackluster and only to enable that one, and both were terribad reworks saved by reverse powercreep and several patches of numerical buffs.
