If a tank can reach an adc before late-game, of course the adc is going to die. They're tissue paper. That's why they have a support to protect them, that's why positioning is so important.\n\nLate-game, adc's make tanks their bitch by outright ignoring 1/3 of their armor, doubling their attack damage with critical chance, several autoattacks every few seconds, and not to mention dealing 8% of their health if they have botrk and so on and so on.\n\n*shrugs*\n\nLate-game, if my calculations are correct, a tank can last upward to 10 seconds against a full-build adc. The exact number might be different, but it's worth some investigation.\n\nBut adc's are squishy. Because of the late-game scaling, they can't take it until their full build gives sustain, and they can't dish it out about mid-game. So of course any amount of damage from at tank is going to kill them. Armor and magic resist start falling off late-game, and between LW and all the other items, adc's will start domination.\n\nAnd before people say I'm biased, I play adc plenty (I find it kinda boring, but that's because I don't like taking risks and focus on cs), I play a few tanks (the really strong ones, sorry... trying to find weaker ones to play so I'm not some meta broker), I play squishies and bruisers and blah blah blah.
