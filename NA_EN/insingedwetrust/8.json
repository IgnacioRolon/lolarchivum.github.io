Understand this, I have seen Evelynn delete people at end game when they are level 18. The most memorable was an {{champion:81}} who died in less than a second to a E + Q + {{item:3146}} active. No R, no auto attacks, no additional Q casts.\n\nYes she can assassinate squishy targets if she builds damage and they do not build defense of note/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DoraTheBrown","date":"2015-02-14T06:12:07.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DOesn't her ult do 15/20/25% hp dmg, give a huge shield, and slow?","replies":[{"poster":"Adrian Umbra","date":"2015-02-14T21:46:00.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ult does 15/20/25% CURRENT HP damage (Note that Mundo's level 1 Cleaver does the same amount of damage as her rank 1 ult and his rank 5 Cleaver does the same damage as her rank 3 ult, only his has minimum damage), applies a good shield which ranges from good sized to good depending on whether she's picking off a fleeing target or engaging a team fight, and provides a slow that ranges from barely better than Chilling smite (30%) to good (70%) for two seconds depending on rank.\n\nAnd all this is gated by a massive 2.5 minute cooldown at rank 1 (this is the same as Amumu's ult) to a decent cooldown of 1.5 minutes at rank 3.  Her ult is one of the weakest in the game, all things considered especially when you consider that its most powerful aspect (the shield) is really quite out of place on an assassin.\n\nThat all being said, she hasn't been an effective AP assassin since her E was changed to physical damage.  Her AP ratios are quite low, she has no good way to protect herself and very little ability to get to a target to burst them down when compared to most burst mages, and her itemization flat out sucks due to having a wide range of mixed damages.  As much as I hate that she's effectively pigeonholed into a fighter type build, there's really no reason to pick Eve as an AP assassin and there hasn't been for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"InSingedWeTrust","date":"2015-02-14T08:03:04.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DoraTheBrown,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3gPGZA41,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-14T06:12:07.833+0000)\n>\n> DOesn't her ult do 15/20/25% hp dmg, give a huge shield, and slow?\n\nAnd still somehow manages to be completely useless until you need a clutch shield to stay alive.","replies":[]}]}]}
