If he's killed you twice by then, you're retarded and need to stop playing mid-lane as that means both of his ults killed you. His ults should never kill you unless you've allowed free harass. His rush of Brutalizer is great and all, and costs slightly more than seekers - however you're looking at 45 armor early on (you can bet that's a fair amount) with only a 10% penetration, which means 41.5 of that bonus armor still remains in effect.\nCare to explain to me how 120/100/80 seconds on a champ that doesn't build a ton of early CDR is in any way shape or form a shorter CD than {{item:3157}}'s 90 seconds?

Zed has the highest damaging, most spammable abilities in the game. Even more than other Energy or even recource-less champs. So he will EASILY whittle you down and push you out. cause all he needs to buy is either get some LS or a few health Pots, where as most other mids, you need both Mana pots and health pots just to not get pushed out.\n\nAnd as a zed, who cares if i don't land half my shots, its basically free, ill wait 7 seconds and throw another one at you, I will eventually make it so i can all in you, ult or no ult, hourglass or no hourglass.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-17T03:22:27.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to disregard you and believe you're absolutely retarded.

I admitted he's one of my hardest matches because: because \"I lack the knee-jerk reactions required to out-knee-jerk a high platinum/low diamond Zed main.\"\n\nYou need to learn how to read.\nIt does matter, as someone who's mained Katarina from Bronze 3 up to low Diamond in Season 4 and is currently sitting in P1 - someone who's done the same on Zed is going to shit on me for a few reasons.\n\nA) his champion REQUIRES great reflexes.\nB) his waveclear is far superior to Katarina's, forcing me to choose between harass and waveclear - either I take damage on tower or I take damage for waveclearing.\nC) his mobility simply outdoes Kat's. Yes, I have a blink. So does he. I can shunpo 1 out of 2 times and be guaranteed to be on him. The second however, he can simply hop shadows and unload a combo.\n\nThat is what makes it a hard lane. Not his meaningless harassment, not his ulti, not his ability to spam Q, but his ability to out-react a Katarina based solely on his kit.\n\nCan I shit on a lesser Zed? Of course. But someone who's mained Zed up to the same point as I have will guaranteed have better reaction time and avoid most of my combos. It ends up being a push/pull lane, and it's all push from Zed's waveclear.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-03-16T21:30:34.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I play normals because I hate Draft and Ranked for the pick order, so I never counter pick.

If he wins the trade by a large margin or you allow free harass, he's going to shit on you. I simply don't do that.\nIf he wants to Q, I'll almost always be able to e/q/w onto him. Dominates early trades by quite a large margin as you're doing three things here:\nputting his W on CD as his harass early is meaningless without that shadow, forcing him to miss both Qs. You're taking reduced damage from his E which is likely to hit you, and if he wants to avoid damage he's going to have to shadow hop his W - putting it on a massive CD.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leti the Yeti","date":"2015-03-16T21:20:04.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"The holocaust wasnt a problem cuz selective jews with a brain learned to live around it\n\nNow I find that assassins being unfun to play against and playing around them are 2 irrelevant things\nbeing able to play around it does not make it any less unfun to play against them\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2015-03-17T00:30:07.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm last season it was poke mages, now its assassins.
