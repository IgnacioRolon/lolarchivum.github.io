He was given them because he was already in a fairly weak state and was more nerfed by the changes than anyone else.\n\nSinged has no scaling MR because\na) He has extra stats on his ultimate\nb) His passive gives him extra health.\n\nWhile these should benefit him they should do so in a way that is fair for his magic damage dealing opponents. As I understand it, given that magic damage is typically lower over time than physical damage and higher in burst. Magic resist is therefore \"better\" than armour in that each point of magic resist does more work. If you can survive the mages first blast you have a few seconds to get to them and stop them having a second. If you survive an adcs they have more and more and more coming at you.\n \nThe other champions that don't get MR per level are:\nKassadin, Maokai, Poppy, and Yasuo.\n\nNotice that all of them have built into their kit some way of mitigating burst and poke either on a short cooldown or constantly. Maokai has damage reduction and regular heals, Kassading ignores a portion of MR and has a magic shield, Poppy has her passive, and Yasuo has his shield.\n\nSinged has MR on his ultimate, regen on his ultimate and health from his passive. All mitigate burst and poke. \nShen has near constant healing from his Q and a fairly spammable self shield. These heavily mitigate poke.\n\nThat is my guess. This does make me wonder why Fizz gets MR/level although I suppose he reacts to it rather than just has it happen and also has it on a marginally longer cooldown.","replies":[{"poster":"Minrog","date":"2015-04-23T16:19:48.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:98}} only gets healing from his Q if he is jungling, and you can't use your self-shield in fights with players because of the Energy costs involved.\n\nI think {{champion:98}}  doesn't have MR/level scaling because his ultimate is frustrating in Solo Q and they want to make sure he isn't being played.
