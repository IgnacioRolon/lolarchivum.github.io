The only notable changes to her in modern times was a bug fix on her ult (the bug still occurs), a ninja nerf on her ult (eventually admitted but never documented), and her itemization being nerfed.

At this moment she's not even relevant early game comparing to other champions. {{champion:64}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:76}} are still stronger early game than {{champion:60}} while having MUCH better late game.

Why is {{champion:76}} able to switch forms much faster than {{champion:60}}  while being better at literally everything?\n  - Reduce the CD of spider form or make it resets every single time {{champion:60}} hits the Cocoon. \n\n\n2. Why don't you give her true personality? Is she a tank? - NO! Does she fits a mage role? -NO!

(Which could be REALLY good in this meta, which may be another reason Riot is playing this carefully). She should be focused towards building full AP like Nid/Diana/Fiddle and still be able to duel those tank junglers after mid game is over. However, one thing I'm wondering: What would happen if Rappel could jump to allied minions/wards? It'd make her chances of survival way better, and also give her a nice little ms boost when coming back from base. But, really, I think it should be one of the following:\n\n1. Make her W slow: Doesn't have to be too big of a slow, but it would be great to have another good liandry's proc + a slightly better chance of escaping from opponents.\n2. Make her E work on allied minions/wards: Better escape potential from a bad fight, make leaving base quicker.\n3. Increase her overall survivability in a teamfight (Scaling MR, Suggestion #2)\nI don't play Elise much, but this is my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Yingzii","date":"2015-05-26T13:41:25.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I agree with this, it just feels like Elise doesn't do enough damage, given her anti-tank potential.

This means she can excel in different roles without worrying about overload. Here are a few example changes:\n\n1)  Rework passive to generate a spiderling on every 1 or 2 ability casts.  Mage W releases spiderlings equal to the number stored.  This fixes her mage wave-clear problem.\n\n2)  Add AP scaling to cocoon duration and spider W attack speed bonus.\n\n3)  Make Q scale from both AD and AP to retain form-swapping feel while downgrading overall utility.\n\n4)  Make mage Q a DOT that attracts spiderlings\n\n5)  Make W spiderlings leave behind venom puddles that slow (% scale with AP only) with a stacking dot\n\n5)  Give spider form speed and defense buffs that slightly scale off AD only\n\nSo basically what you're left with is a spider AD that can go jungle or top and can build tank or fighter/tower-killer.  You could also build AP spider tank for increased utility in cocoon stun duration.\n\nOr you could build AP sustain that gets some burst and zone control late game with a 4-spiderling W and tank-dueling potential.  You can swap to spider for execute Q or the utility of rappel, but you're not really doing any damage and risk losing spiderlings you need to get kills.
