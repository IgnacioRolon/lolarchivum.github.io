What are the essential and most unique elements of Lee Sin?\n\nOkay, I'll take a stab. I think that Lee Sin is defined by his crazy mobility. He's in the top 5 of most mobile champions in lol. He can engage fights in many different ways. He does a respectable amount of damage and has the ability to outplay his opponent at any time with the right timing of skills and mechanical execution. He's a unique mobile fighter who tries to out maneuver his opponent in order to achieve victory. That being said here are things that Lee Sin has, that he should NOT have.\n\n1) Free Lifesteal and Spell vamp\n2) TOO much utility (shield, slow, reveal, knockup) one of these has got to go.\n3) Manaless. Pays 0 cost for missed skillshots. Has many \"get out of jail\" free cards due to his mobility.\n4) Extremely high base damage abilities. This allows for him to build full tank and still be extremely useful due to the utility he brings.\n\nEasiest way to nerf Lee and bring him from \"100% pick/ban in every competitive match\" remove his free spell vamp, no reason for that shiz and lower his bases, but improve his ratios. Force him to build damage in order to do damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2014-12-14T17:58:11.146+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Feels to me like it is near consensus on the fact that Lee's defining element is his mobility, and the unique plays (kicks, dragon steals etc) that he can make with it. \n\nThis is the thing to play up on Lee where things like straight up fighting power for right clicking enemies isn't what makes him cool. \n\nThank you everyone for all of the responses, it helps us a ton directionally when we look to make balance changes or even change his kit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2014-12-14T10:34:03.960+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make a new thread asking this, so all the discussion is focused and the tone can be more set.\n\nTo answer the question, though: Highly situational multi-point power. Great mobility... if he lands a skillshot or is near allies. Great utility... if a knockback or reveal are needed. Great damage... if he can get on a mark with low health/mobility. His kit reflects this strategic thinking, being clearly conditional in most ways.\n\nIn terms of *fantasy* and *feel*, though? High mobility, and Hi-KUUUU!

And his Dragon's Rage Roundhouse kick.\n\nWhat I really liked about the rework that was popping up ages ago was the ult change:\nInstead of frontloading all the damage, independant of how he uses it, it halfed the initial damage, but added 50% of the removed damage for every champion the initial target collided with (same damage as live if colliding with 2 other champions). Making it so that it clearly distinguished between the purpose of damaging a target (kicking it through a team) and the purpose of just moving a target out of position (no further collision).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dfenestrator","date":"2014-12-14T09:43:39.450+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with the other comments.  Most of Lee's identity is wrapped up in his crazy mobility.\n\nHe's unique from other high mobility champs because (1) he is the only high mobility champion that uses energy and (2) he has two mobility spells that have vastly different requirements for using them (Q requires an enemy or neutral unit, W requires an ally or ward). \n\nPersonally, I think if you were to focus on anything to emphasize with him, it would be that mobility. I also think that it would be fine for Lee to have either decent damage or decent utility coupled with his mobility, but not both like he has now. \n\nWhile I think you should emphasize Lee's mobility more, I think you also make some adjustments to it. Currently, Lee doesn't have a lot of meaningful decisions tied up with his mobility. Other high mobility champions are typically gated by a resource (e.g. Kass), by circumstances not entirely under their control (e.g. Yasuo), or require careful planning and zone control (Rek'Sai). \n\nA lot of other high mobility champions also tend to \"pay\" for their mistakes when they use their mobility, either by being squishy (e.g. Ez) or having meaningful cooldowns attached to their mobility. \n\nLee Sin, on the other hand, is pretty tanky, has high base movement speed, has low energy costs, has low cooldowns, and has multiple mobility spells in his kit.  \n\nPersonally, I don't want to see Lee's mobility butchered as much as I want to see it shift to reward good play with teammates and interaction with the enemy. I think Lee Sin should have to rely on his enemies and his allies for his mobility on the battlefield. Lee Sin should also be less forgiving when he misuses his mobility.\n\nI picture Lee Sin to be the more offensive-oriented version of Shen. While Shen uses his mobility to protect his team (and is punished severely when he fails to do so), Lee Sin should use his mobility to fight the enemy (and be punished when he chooses not to do so). I think Lee should have very high mobility and low cooldowns in a fight, but should have drastically less mobility once he disengages from the enemy team.\n\nI think that your ward-hop change for Lee that was (almost) implemented was on the right track. However, I think you can't just change his W and expect to solve the problem: you also need to modify the rest of his kit to be more focused on his mobility and less on either his utility or damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slaaneshine","date":"2014-12-14T07:40:47.913+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RZYdphd8,comment-id=001b00070001,timestamp=2014-12-14T07:32:32.168+0000)\n> Good point, let's ask the constructive question. What are the essential and most unique elements of Lee Sin?\n\nHis mobility. I have never played Lee Sin, but his mobility is the highlighting factor of his playstyle and how I fight him when it comes down to it. He really only has two spells that jump, but they take up so much of his strategical thinking compared to his other abilities that the others are kinda just there to other players (I mean, what can you do against his ult but just be a target?)\n\nFrom a fighting standpoint, Lee does great early due to high numbers and high mobility, and decent tankiness that can keep him in fights when damage isn't high. Late game he becomes more of a support, peeling and keeping people away from his carry. Most people know that. Most people really don't end up transitioning into that late game ideal, and end up falling off like a rock dropped into the pond. So honestly, all he needs is focus in his kit.

That was a lot of wasted effort! If you didn't want her played, you could have left her alone for those of us who liked her! The recent power shuffle on her skills feels great, except that I start every game knowing that if their jungler sonic waves into my red camp I'm removed from play for 15 minutes. By design, you cannot fight Lee Sin, in your jungle or his. No problems here!\n \n -You have nerfed Evelynn over and over and over again, making it impossible for her to have a cohesive build. Your ASSASSIN MAGE builds AD TANK. And this is because \"oh no permasteath too strong\" which might be true, but it's too bad hypermobility costs nothing. How about you remove Eve's stealth and give her multiple gapclosers, escapes, and a knockback along with lifesteal, spellvamp, slows, shields, and reveals? NO THAT WOULD BE FUCKING INSANE, WOULDN'T IT. \n\n -At one point last year you nerfed Lux. LUX. Whose only crime was still being sort of viable once the AD assassins pushed the mages out of mid and into support. You needed to buff immobile mages to compete and instead you just made sure to shut them out harder. What the hell is the reasoning here? (And don't get me started on how you hold back her kit. Illumination not illuminating is the antithesis of sense.) Stop writing articles about how Brand can support and let the mages play the game again.\n\n -All supports. Janna, Sona, Soraka, Lulu, Taric, anyone takes one step out of bot and they get massacred. Immediately. Absolutely no regard is given to destroying supports, but Lee Sin has dominated the jungle since release and YOU DO NOTHING. \"But we don't chain nerf supports!\" Yeah, and Lee Sin falls off lategame. Tell me another! \n\nYou say you want strategic diversity. You are changing the jungle AGAIN, which means you are still not happy with it.

He is consistent because he fits with just about any team comp, similar to Orianna or Thresh.   \n\nYes, Lee does make some pretty insane plays, but it requires someone skilled playing him to do that.  On that note, because he doesn't have instant-success abilities, there is a LOT of room for enemy teams to react to what lee sin is trying to do.  Lee Sin doesn't build full tank, press R, and solo the ADC when he is surrounded by his teammates (and yes, that is what Olaf was doing).  If Lee goes in for a ward jump, you know what he is trying to do and can try to outplay accordingly.  \n\nLee Sin's big plays also aren't stemming from incredibly powerful moves like Elise E following through flashes and dashes.  I guess in general I'm fine with what lee sin is able to do because there are a lot of variables that go into any of the plays he makes, and the team playing against Lee can try to shift those variables to their favor.   \n\nThat being said, if one were to reduce the effectiveness of Lee Sin, I would argue that power should be taken out of his Q, mostly in the % missing health portion.  If it started at 4% and scaled to its 8%, you would go a long way to reducing the early game dominance that Lee Sin has.  \n\nAlso, I remember from my time playing him that it seems like he never runs out of energy; perhaps nerfing his energy costs in some way would help force him to be more precise in his plays or risk failure. \n\nAll in all though, I don't mind his kit or the plays that he is capable of pulling off, just how forgiving his kit is if he messes up.","replies":[{"poster":"Lamfira","date":"2014-12-14T20:15:31.300+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like the energy reduction idea too much.

Does this mean his flashy, hyper-mobile, 'everything-you-could-want-in-a-champ' qualities are going to stay, and all we can hope for are small number tweaks?  Another champion like this is Yasuo, arguably the worst designed champion in the entire game...\n\nYas got quite a few number tweaks, but his kit is  the epitome of anti-fun.  Number changes don't do that much to him in the long run since his kit is so frustrating to go against.  This sounds exactly like Lee's situation.  Do you think it might be  better to start from scratch to make something less obnoxious?  And yes this can apply to both Yas and Lee.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2014-12-14T07:18:57.790+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see why reds tend to tread carefully in these types of threads now.\n\nI wish you luck in trying to map out the horrifyingly difficult task of balancing League of Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"5G8Nri0B54","date":"2014-12-14T01:15:17.723+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":7,"body":">  He is pretty unfocused, and this is more of a symptom of the older champ development style that he was created in (see irelia etc).
