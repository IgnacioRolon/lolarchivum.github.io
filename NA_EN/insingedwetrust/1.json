This is why the fix for tank junglers was to make a new tank jungler item, rather than say pushing the Sunfire line as an early buy.\n\nThis is a really narrow way to look at the game; if you look at S4 Rengar builds, you'd often go madreds -> mobi boots, a lot of pro junglers didn't even finish their jungler item. And this is the build that would allow Rengar to snowball out of control.\n\nAlso putting your completed jungle item on hold to buy a tear is vastly different than trying to build a whole sunfire cape; that's why they also introduced an intermediate sunfire-esque item in bami's cinder instead of just putting sunfire cape's effect onto the jungle item.\n\n> As for the part about playing around her passive better, I recommend you take Lissandra into a custom game and try to clear the jungle for a few minutes. One free spell every 18 seconds is totally not going to cut it.\n\nI'm saying you have to learn to use it better. Or build mana regen. Her passive has built in CDR that allows her to have it up more frequently; if that's *still* not enough, that's why you build mana regen or take regen blues instead of CDR since you can build morello's and have 40% with magus.\n\nAs a jungler you're always scrapping together items since you have innately less gold and exp income than a laner; it's naive to expect to have identical impact as a laner when you innately have fewer resources to work with; you have to *adapt* to the role, it isn't just a plug and play thing. Example: Top lane Olaf builds *a lot* of damage, jungle Olaf builds pure tank. Jungle Lissandra is never going to do as much damage as lane Lissandra unless she's stupidly fed, so you focus on other aspects she can bring to the table, namely her CC (in which case having CDR is vital).\n\n> Some mages are high gold, high exp champions. Quite a few aren't. We run many mages as supports because they are quite good at providing utility without needing a ton of resources to be effective.\n\nAnd many of them function fine currently as junglers too, it's just you have to *adapt* them to the role. If you're playing support Morgana, you think it's *efficient* for her to build sightstone? No, she could deal a ton more damage and have a ton more utility in fights by just saving that gold for a different item; the reason you build it is because it's a necessary component of that role. You bring Morgana into the jungle, you have to find a way to *adapt* her to the jungle instead of just expecting to play her like lane Morgana without any difference. Other elements of her kit will be emphasized, damage is most likely not the prime concern (especially since it will always be less than a lane Morgana's, as I mentioned with Lissandra, since you innately have less gold income).\n\n> Do you think it's desirable for AD to be inherently superior to AP for jungling? It wasn't always this way. It doesn't have to be this way.\n\nI think it's really limited to think of this game in terms of AD and AP; think about your champion and *why* you're actually playing them in a certain role. Honestly look at the champions being played in jungle and why they're there: do you see a lot of glass cannon AD champions going in jungle? No. It's basically Shaco and Master Yi (to which I counter with Fiddlesticks and Karthus). What makes you think glass cannon AP champions should be an exception? Most of the AD champions are bruisers or off-tanks, most of the AP champions are tanks; if anything there's just a lack of AP bruisers in the champion roster (the ones I can think of are Diana, Gragas, and Nidalee; guess what, they're junglers).\n\n> This is a new problem. Didn't exist in season 4, because Spirit Stone was a thing.\n\nAnd Rangers + Blue buff smite + forbidden Idol are things in season 5. *There are ways to adapt to the game*. If it were the case that you've exhausted every single option and still have no way of functioning as a mage jungler, go ahead and complain away, but I suspect that's not the case because *I've seen mages work in jungle* (I'm not even talking about just Fiddlesticks and Karthus). Yes, I know the jungle is mathematically more difficult in s5; I don't think it's so bad that you can't make things work. \n\nMoreover, I don't really see jungle mages as an entire class as something that Riot needs to devote time and effort to blanket-supporting, especially where there are larger issues, especially since the rewards to promoting the entire *class* of champions seem pretty vacuous, and especially when it's still possible to make your off-meta build work given the tools available. Again, if you want a specific champion to be able to jungle more effectively, go ahead and and make an argument for them specifically. I think it's irresponsible and ill advised to have a massive blanket buff if you just want to support a tiny niche aspect of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-23T22:37:25.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> This is a really narrow way to look at the game; if you look at S4 Rengar builds, you'd often go madreds -> mobi boots, a lot of pro junglers didn't even finish their jungler item.

For example, as an AD jungler, blue smite into cutlass is obviously incorrect.  Brutalizer is the only correct choice, because warrior is supremely gold efficient given that you have bought a jungler item.\n\nThe jungle items from S4 didn't have this problem.\n\n> Most of the AD champions are bruisers or off-tanks, most of the AP champions are tanks\n\nThis is an accurate description of what currently is.  It doesn't have to be this way.  Making the jungle the province of only a specific subset of champions is one of the big reasons why DotA meta feels so much more open than LoL meta.  \n\nThe jungle meta heavily influences the lane meta.  If only one kind of jungler can be played, that means that only laners who synergize well with that type of jungler can be played.\n\n> And Rangers + Blue buff smite + forbidden Idol are things in season 5. *There are ways to adapt to the game*.

You build whatever you need in a certain situation. If you're vs. a mage mid lane and you're just getting poked out and bullied, you don't just blindly go morellonomicon because you saw it in LCS, you suck up the extra couple hundred gold to go chalice for the MR. It's the same thing. You buy situationally, that's how the game has always worked. You buy boots when you actually need boots. You buy wards when you need wards (which is pretty much always). You buy defense when you need defense. It's the same thing for regen. I'm not saying you complete morellonomicon, I'm saying you buy a cheap intermediate item that helps you play your role more effectively. You have six item slots for a reason, they're a *resource* that you use to be as effective as possible in your role.\n\n> Where? I'd wager it's not at any interesting level of play.\n\nWatch NB3 do his A-Z series; he plays every \"jungler\" (he's got a loose definition of who can jungle, so he's playing stuff like Brand as a jungler) in challenger or high diamond mmr on smurfs. Is it going to be as straightforward as a typical jungler? No, but is it playable and able to succeed? Absolutely, you just have to know how to play\n\n> From my perspective, Magus doesn't work in the same way that Juggernaut didn't work. For tanks, the problem was that buying Juggernaut didn't help with clears. For mages, it's that buying Magus doesn't offer them enough mana to clear. This is the same core problem, and the same type of solution will work.\n\nFrom my perspective, there isn't enough incentive to take mages into the jungle, aside from a few obvious examples. What is an underfed mage going to offer that a tank or bruiser couldn't do better? There are always going to be certain champions that are better suited for particular roles than others, that's just a fact of the game. I think there are more pressing issues preventing a lot of mages from being god-tier junglers than just mana sustain; I'd say it's actually fairly low on the list of concerns, especially given all the methods of dealing with it.\n\nHere's the difference between magus and juggernaut; tanks *as a class* were struggling in jungle compared to bruisers; that isn't the case with mages. Sure Sejuani was pretty strong, but no where near as strong as Fiddlesticks was in jungle (before Cinderhulk, Sejuani was sitting at like, 51-52% win rate in plat+ IIRC; Fiddlesticks has been at ~55%+ for like a year). Mages in jungle suffer more on an individual level than tank junglers; the solution therefore is, if you want to support a jungle playstyle, buff them individually rather than just making a blanket buff that will throw already balanced champions way out of whack. Simply buffing mana in jungle isn't suddenly going to make Malzahar jungle a pro pick. If you actually want these champions to be junglers, give them a legitimate way to succeed; mana isn't going to do enough, especially without harming the rest of the game environment.","replies":[{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2015-03-24T04:17:33.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are making mistakes in your item builds.

As it stands, scavenging smite is a strategic dead end. Chilling smite has near universal utility, even while primarily being focused towards ganks, blasting smite doesn't so much add strategic options as much as lower logistical limitations (extremely underrated imo), and challenging smite is a essentially a straight buff to your dueling potential, which regardless of whether or not it's balanced, is less limiting than the scavenging smite, which serves solely to increase a champions ability to perform one strategic action, and it's easily the worst strategic choice a jungler can make.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanzash","date":"2015-03-24T03:50:19.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still hope you can do something for Evelynn...

Perhaps changing the damage against champions to magic/physical damage on-hit to make it worthwhile but counterable with defenses.\n\nMy real issue, though, is Poacher's. Of the four new smites, I've always felt that this one felt a bit...**too** specialized. Not only are the item's uses polarizing, but it is also the only smite buff that doesn't have any secondary uses (Stalker's gives MS when fleeing, Skirmishers doubles as an exhaust, even Trailblazer can delay pushes with its AoE/Stun). On that note, you'll rarely prioritize its primary use unless you're living in the enemy jungle mid-lategame, in which case you wouldn't even need a means of escape anyways. \n\nInstead, why not make it more focused on vision, perhaps spawning a wolf spirit-like sentry that patrols the area.

Meaning the main purpose for it is to either use it on a mobile ganker or CC heavy counter jungler. So this is my take on changing it.\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE- Duelist's Smite: Modifies Smite into Duelist's Smite. Smite can now be used on a champion, minion, or monster to increase damage you deal to the target by 10% and reducing damage the target deals to you by 20% as well as granting 30 tenacity against crowd control effects from the target. This effect lasts for 8 seconds. During this time, if the target moves more than 700 units away from the caster, they are slowed by 10% (+1% per level) and are revealed.\n\nThis change would set up a \"Duelist Arena\" with the target that also gives the user an innate advantage. It can also be useful for ganking if the enemy is incredibly pushed.\n\n\n{{item:3711}} \nThis item is much more for strong objective control and PvE counterjunglers correct? Get in, get out, steal their stuff. Its current problem is a.) Its current effect is weak and b.) Its current effect is very binary. Its a binary, weak effect. However, buffing it could cause a huge Gold crisis.\n\nUNIQUE PASSIVE- Scavenger's Smite: Modifies Smite into Scavenger's Smite. Smite's range is increased to 5250. If Scavenging Smite is used on a monster in the enemy jungle, enemy champions around the monster are rooted for 1.25 seconds, the danage it deals is increased in true damage by 20% of the target's missing health or current health, whichever deals more damage, and the caster gains 11 (+1 per level) extra gold if Scavenging Smite kills the monster or the caster kills the monster after using Scavenging Smite. This effect always occurs against epic monsters.\n\nThis new Scavenging Smite is incredibly more versatile and has a much more powerful effect without killing the Gold Economy. It gives the user much more powerful counterjungling tools AND a directly more powerful Smite against enemy jungle monsters and epic monsters. To summarize the new stuff quickly, much more Smite range at all times. If used on a monster in the enemy jungle, more damage, more gold, and all enemy champions around the target monster are briefly rooted.","replies":[{"poster":"alcatrazEscapee","date":"2015-03-23T18:07:42.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hold on... 5250 range?
