My entire team was reporting lags and getting disconnected. I have been streaming video and other things tonight. It's not on my side. Ping was fine. Framerate was fine. Random lag spikes and disconnects.","replies":[{"poster":"toricloudy","date":"2016-05-11T15:16:35.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been having the same thing on both ARAM and Summoner's Rift. FPS is 300, ping is 65. Can surf the web at lightspeed but get disconnected from League the entirety of the game, and have an \"attempting to reconnect\" screen up at all times and can't move or do anything in game. When it actually does let me play, it makes me lag walk towards enemies and it's impossible to control my character. This only started happening yesterday, I've never had this issue before. Several teammates also reported having these issues, as have many friends of mine who have attempted playing recently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-10T03:09:43.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We haven't seen anything confirmed pop up on our end yet, but there have been a few threads here and there today.
