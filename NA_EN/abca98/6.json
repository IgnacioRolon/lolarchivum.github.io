Especially when trying to get your friends into the game.\n\nSure the dudes a hardstuck bronze 3, but he stills has leaps and bounds of game knowledge and experience over anything a new player will.\n\nIm level 158, and while that doesnt auto make me diamond+.  (I think im silver currently.) But my silver elo means less than my level in my case, **ive never played more than 100 games in a ranked season, but i have over 12,000 unranked games and nearly 5k arams played total(over 150x the experience of my ranked games), and new players are frequently placed higher ranking than i am currently.** So take any ranking with a grain of salt.
