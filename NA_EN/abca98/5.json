Looking at you Vayne.)\n\n-There was some talk about lowering the effectiveness of 'shield whores' ( {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} and even to a lesser extent {{champion:43}} ) to help bring back tank initiator supports like {{champion:89}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} and {{champion:111}} / {{champion:54}} if you wanna be saucy about it.\n\n-A whisper in the wind also talked about some power creep regarding unnecessary strength of certain component combinations making ~2900 gold worth more than ~4000 gold when the other person has a completed item. (This is mainly because of how some completed items synergize specifically with different stats.)\n\nSnowballing will be made more effective/less effective based on individual player skill with the shutdown gold changes, meaning if you are truly better than the fed player and outplay them to shut them down solo, you get ALL of the gold for it bringing you a LOT closer to where they are rather than having to split the gold with a support who is building full AP on Janna without an Ardent or Redemption and a jungler who has been executed by gromp twice. If you play exceedingly well and the rest of your team is garbage, you won't have them ambiently stealing gold from you left and right as you shut down the enemy team, giving you more to work with to carry if you're truly in an ELO too low for your skill level.\n\nSo just hold on.
