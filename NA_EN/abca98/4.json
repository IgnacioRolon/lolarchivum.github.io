I honestly SHOULD have a rewarding experience playing the champion I had to master to get that experience. The entire problem with Yasuo is that he is toxic and no one knows how to fight him. Why? Mainly because they ban him and not learn how to counter him. No one realizes that he's hot garbage even though you can show them the statistics in their face.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nThere is no real way to fix Yasuo's W. You can say \"its strong\" and \"its hard to get past\" and all that, but his W and his passive (the shield one, you know, with the shield that can block 550 damage but still get taken down by 1 single point of any type of damage) are the only things that keep him from being unplayable.

The way it is expected to function (based on the fact that he casts it in a direction and based on the visuals for it) is directional. But it works in more ways than just directional. I have a problem with the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual behavior, and how this affects opponents.\n\n> Well first off, Yasuo&#x27;s skills itself punishes the player. The safety nets is the only thing noobs and decent players can even use to not feed their ass off. Also, if it was auto-win then maybe Yasuo wouldn&#x27;t have a below 47% winrate mid and atleast below 48% winrate top.\n\nMaybe it was unfair of me to say \"Auto-win.\" I was mostly just frustrated by the impression I get, that he uses a skill in the wrong direction and it still rewards him. I understand that timing is still a factor, but I find it somewhat misrepresented if casting it as a reaction like this Yasuo in the video did - and in doing so, aiming it poorly - still rewards him with the safety that would be expected from aiming it correctly.\n\n> I can show you how Yasuo&#x27;s skills punish himself if used incorrectly but that&#x27;s a paragraph I&#x27;d only write when asked to.\n\nBy all means, write on! I welcome opportunities to learn new things about balance. :)\n\n> And what counts for unskillful play? If you mean making mistakes and being rewarded then you have more than just Yasuo doing that, and if you mean unskillful spells then that also counts every targeted spell in the game.\n\n\"If you mean making mistakes and being rewarded then you have more than just Yasuo doing that\"\n\nI mean precisely this. And other champions having a similar problem is no excuse to leave Yasuo with the same problem. You're engaging in 'whataboutism' saying, yeah it's wrong, but what about all those other people who are also wrong?\n\nThat isn't relevant to this discussion. If you want to make a post about how LOTS of champions are rewarded for their mistakes, go right ahead! But please, let's not derail the conversation here with that topic.\n\n> Now I won&#x27;t go off and say &quot;FUCK YOU DUMBASS&quot; because I&#x27;m not a jerk, but \n\nWell, I mean... you kind of did say it. But okay. I understand you are frustrated, and I'm not going to take it personally or get offended.\n\n> Do you know how much time Yasuo Mains put into the guy to even be good at him? I barely get an S at all now, thanks to his neRFz. I wouldn&#x27;t even say I&#x27;m that good at Yasuo, yet I spent such a huge amount of time into him. I honestly SHOULD have a rewarding experience playing the champion I had to master to get that experience. The entire problem with Yasuo is that he is toxic and no one knows how to fight him. Why? Mainly because they ban him and not learn how to counter him. No one realizes that he&#x27;s hot garbage even though you can show them the statistics in their face.\n\nI don't dispute that he takes skill to play. He certainly does. What I'm opposed to is how his mechanics place an unusually large burden of knowledge and skill on both his player and his opponents when trying to play as and against him. The problem isn't the high burden itself, the problem is that a Yasuo main and his opponent do not have the same opportunity to develop those skills and knowledge.\n\nThe Yasuo main has lots and lots of game-time to practice Yasuo and work out all the kinks in their techniques when playing him. While the player playing against him only sees a Yasuo once every 15 to 20 games that they play. See how they might not have an equal opportunity to develop their skills against him?\n\n_(Fun fact: this is also why Yasuo struggles so much at higher levels of play and stomps at lower levels. It's because he has a lot of little things that can be taken advantage of (both as and against him) if you know about them, and at higher levels of play the opponents are more likely to have had the time put into figuring out all of the complex counterplay. And once people know his counterplay he becomes significantly weaker.)_\n\n**I'm not arguing for Yasuo to simply be nerfed.** I want the complex things in his kit to be toned down so that more of his power budget is freed up to make changes that reduce the burden on both Yasuo and his opponents when playing as or against him. I want him to be buffable so that he can be made stronger without breaking the game, and I want him to be made **less** complex to play against so that opponents do not feel overwhelmed by the burden of dealing with his mechanics.\n\n> There is no real way to fix Yasuo&#x27;s W. You can say &quot;its strong&quot; and &quot;its hard to get past&quot; and all that, but his W and his passive (the shield one, you know, with the shield that can block 550 damage but still get taken down by 1 single point of any type of damage) are the only things that keep him from being unplayable. You can&#x27;t figure out how to not make Yasuo garbage while at the same time nerfing W, and it seems like RIOT can&#x27;t either.\n\nIndeed there is a significant problem with Wind Wall. I do not think it is impossible to fix, but I do recognize that it is a significantly complex problem and the act of making changes to address it would affect a very large and passionate portion of the player-base.\n\nThis is why I like having discussions such as this, where we analyze what the problems might be and discuss possible ways to fix them without just fucking over the champion and his playerbase. The more we discuss it the more likely we are to find a great solution!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-12-20T20:37:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's common knowledge that Yasuo wall starts inside his hitbox, he just had the reflexes to do it at the last second.\n\nThe very core of the OP argument is Yasuo being an autopilot for winning, quite weird then that he sits at such low winrates if it is indeed an autopilot.\n\nThe simple fact that this thread is Yauso hate brings in upvotes even without even a resemblance of discussion, just false news.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-12-20T20:46:20.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Stars Shaper,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=79EfJufV,comment-id=0016000000000000,timestamp=2017-12-20T20:37:32.931+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s common knowledge that Yasuo wall starts inside his hitbox, he just had the reflexes to do it at the last second.\n\nOk?
