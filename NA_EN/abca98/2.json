Having a dash means you get a super fast method of repositioning your champion but that's usually only \"once per movement\" and its effects is usually less than a second. Having 500+MS for let's say 4 seconds is like a 0 cooldown \"dash\" in which you can do in any direction and can change that direction whenever you want for 4 entire seconds.\n\nI'd much rather try hit a Lux Q on Lucian or Ezreal than someone like Rammus or Volibear.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2019-06-27T13:32:12.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The movespeed doesn't even have to last that long, a very short burst of movespeed is enough to juke a skillshot that otherwise would have hit 100%.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-06-25T19:54:03.994+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just fire more of them, \nhttps://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/026/513/e85.jpg\nits not like they don't lose damage for mobility............oh.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2019-06-26T00:26:57.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what anime/tv show is that from?","replies":[{"poster":"wolvius","date":"2019-06-26T16:14:04.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=3TWarrior,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=GgbNqUAr,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2019-06-26T00:26:57.681+0000)\n>\n> what anime/tv show is that from?\n\nFate series (anime) not sure which but I think **fate/stay night** or maybe **fate/zero**.
