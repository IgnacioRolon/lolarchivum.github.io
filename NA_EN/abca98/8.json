He didnt steal anything. He played blind pick and chose his role just like its supposed to be. \"Calling dibs\" is not the set rule on picking roles. Blind pick is like the wild west and there are people who want order and those who dont care about order. Calling pick is just a courtesy for those who care about order. Its like a house rule, not an official rule. So your whole basis of trolling is nothing but you attacking an innocent player. Go play draft if you want some semblance of order in the lobby. Riot actually has rules set in place there. In blind, you can play whatever role you want. 2 top? 3 top? Sure. Theres no rule against it! Wanna go duo jungle? Hey as long as someone else will take jungle with you (good luck).\n\nEdit: i dont agree with Riots rules, i just want to inform you on why you got punished. im not accusing you of anything, or insulting you... just showing you why what you did was wrong and why you got punished (important caveat; in Riots eyes). This has nothing to do with my personal opinion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"meowwow7","date":"2018-09-23T18:31:32.176+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm surprised the kennen wasn't going off on the ad amumu as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Agent Corgi","date":"2018-09-23T18:24:39.544+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blind Queue has no lane assignments, so arguing over Role Stealing is a mute point there.
