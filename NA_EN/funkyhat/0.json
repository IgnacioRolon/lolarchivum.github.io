My problem is that before the game it will show something like 'CLG 8-W 4-L' which in itself is fine i guess if i didnt know their score previously. but what mostly bugs me is that sometimes at the start of the broadcast the announcers will say something like CLG is coming into this game with 7 wins! AND THEN I KNOW WHO WINS! whats the point of turning spoilers off if i still have games ruined for me!?!?! Rito please take away the W/L from the schedule screen so i can watch games without knowing the victor :)","replies":[{"poster":"Kail271","date":"2015-03-02T22:40:14.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before the teams play, the standings will show their score before that week's games. I'm not sure I understand the problem. Worst case scenario, if you're seeing the preview screen when picking your VOD, I would say your best bet is going to be deliberately NOT looking at the scores. Yea, it takes self discipline, but you have to weigh that against how much you don't want the game spoiled.","replies":[{"poster":"Oventoasted","date":"2015-03-08T11:14:09.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kail271,realm=NA,application-id=9hBQwnEU,discussion-id=uKuqiItP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-02T22:40:14.355+0000)\n>\n> Before the teams play, the standings will show their score before that week's games.

I'm not sure why Riot has done this. Perhaps to increase live views? Not all of us are able to watch the games live. Either way, hide spoilers needs to be enabled again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Lexer","date":"2015-03-08T02:50:17.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"favorite this: http://na.lolesports.com/vods/","replies":[]}]}
