Enemies were picking one didnt lock in and it said that i did dodge (which i obviously didnt do...) So i lost Lp and got a Queue Dodge timer for an Enemy not locking.

It's pretty likely that the person who didn't lock in was the one who got hit with the queue dodge penalty, and I'm not actually seeing any penalties or punishments on your account. It seems like the other person was the one that dodged, and you were simply exited out of the match and able to queue back up. \n\nLet me know if you were on a completely different account where you got the dodge penalty and I can take a look into that account instead.","replies":[]}]}
