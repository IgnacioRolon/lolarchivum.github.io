Let&#039;s start with the passive. Taric is a utility tank support. By no means should he have an offensive style passive. It feels that his passive was an after thought and doesn&#039;t work with his kit. It&#039;s 2 basic attacks. How is that supposed to help your adc in lane or your team in a team fight?\r\nNext let&#039;s look at the heal. It&#039;s a little lack luster. The charges inhibit it. Overall a flat heal would be more successful and feel less jumbled. Now we&#039;ll look at bastion. I love bastion. It gives a shield and buffs another champions stats. You can change targets. The heal synergies with it and it works hand in hand with the stun. No complaints.\r\nHis stun dazzle. It may not be point and click like before however it can make some serious plays. It was well executed. Finally his ult. This to me is the biggest disappointment for this rework. It was a cool idea and once you get used to the channel time it can help your team but it&#039;s also what kills it. It would be better on a jungler. If you&#039;re ganked successfully when you hit the ult halfway through the channel your adc Is dead. It seems more of a offensively timed move compared to defense which is what his role is. A type of aoe shield in the target areas and gem armor with the bastion target would of been a much better execution and work both offensive and defensively. Especially since the only damaging ability Taric has is dazzle. It feels to me that Taric is in the same position he was before where abilities on his kit fall short for what he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Draqone","date":"2016-04-21T14:37:41.242+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing.\n\n\nTaric's stun is not to \"make plays\", it's mainly to keep your ADC alive for 2.5 seconds. This and the heal/shield should be enough in most cases that don't involve a fed LB or Rengar.\n\nIf it's not, you have access to two more shields from items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2016-04-21T15:29:07.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot specifically stated they didn't not like a tank version of Taric. on that Note he can still be tanky, but less of the godmode tank he has been in the past. He also does a lot less damage if you build tank which is how tanks should be. My only gripe with him is how much weaker his self heal is. Sure, if he hits 5 targets the scaling causes you to heal for way more than in the past with hp scaling, but on yourself it feels like a Sona heal without the shield :(.","replies":[{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2016-04-21T16:18:42.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, he feels tankier.  He no longer loses his bonus armor from using his W and now he has a shield to throw into the mix.  The only thing he really lost was a larger pool of effective health due to his heal not scaling on self-use.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-04-21T15:18:14.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the Taric rework but haven't played support with him yet I have only played him top. I think he is just fine his heal imo is decent but it could be better, his ult is just fine if you have vision which you should just pop ult when you see the jungler coming down and as someone already stated use stun to stall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-04-21T14:45:06.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is Ok, not unbalanced OP needing nerfs like the most recent reworks.","replies":[]}]}
