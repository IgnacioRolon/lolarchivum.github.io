When i did i was unable to and got the message saying your account is in the process of transferring. i waited to see if i could log in a few times but when i couldnt i went to change my password, but still no luck. I had a card saved on the account so who ever stole it must have charged the money and used what ever rp i had before that to change regions.Also the email was received May 15 2017 at 3:19 pm but the date charged was 10:19 pm of that day. I denied both of the charges with my card holder and believe my account is hacked. I contacted riot support but I am still worried I might not be able to get my account back or the Ip or Rp they might use. Has this happened to anyone else Recently and if so what did you do? My main Account is: Elite1178e On NA.\n      EDIT: I have got my account back and everything refunded! Thanks so much to LOVESICKCOMMANDER For helping me out.","replies":[{"poster":"MeGrundies","date":"2017-05-16T23:39:07.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, this same thing just happened to my friend yesterday - he contacted Riot and his credit card company immediately. The attacker is currently saying that the victim is his brother and is just trolling.\n\nIsn't there a way for Riot to see where the log-in is happening at - I suppose there are methods around that for attackers, but according to his ticket, it almost seemed like they are agreeing with the attacker.  \n\nIt seems like two way verification is necessary at this point. \n\nI just want to play League with my buddy :( ....and for him to not be screwed out of his account that he logged thousands of hours into.","replies":[]},{"poster":"damnbomber","date":"2017-05-16T22:41:06.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happened to me but the charges of $200 went through. now i can't even pay all of my bills this month. and riot isnt being responsive at all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-16T03:11:55.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap!!!
