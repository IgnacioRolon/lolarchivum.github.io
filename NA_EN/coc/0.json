( I expect an explanation because this name clearly does not break any terms of use) Please unsuspend my account and I will happily live without the name that Riot suddenly decided was unacceptable after nearly half a decade. \r\n(12:12:47 AM) *** Skeletor joined the chat *** \r\n(12:12:52 AM) Skeletor: heya \r\n(12:13:00 AM) coc: Hello, how are you doing today? \r\n(12:13:04 AM) Skeletor: im chillen friend \r\n(12:13:07 AM) Skeletor: how ya doin? \r\n(12:13:21 AM) coc: Pretty bad since I cant play league right now for the first time since s2 \r\n(12:15:14 AM) Skeletor: Hmm \r\n(12:15:22 AM) Skeletor: so it looks like we had asked you to change the name \r\n(12:15:25 AM) Skeletor: because we found it offensive \r\n(12:15:27 AM) coc: I was wondering if perhaps I could have my suspension reversed seeing as I didn&#039;t flame anyone, wasnt toxic, and don&#039;t see my previous name , Paul Walkers Car, as a joke or offensive in any way. Also, I personally know people IRL who have changed their names right back to what it was as i did and they were not banned. Had i realized this was against the ToS i would have not rechanged it \r\n(12:15:34 AM) Skeletor: and then after giving you a free name change you changed it back \r\n(12:16:16 AM) coc: And the person&#039;s name was indisputably obscene, unlike mine. \r\n(12:16:32 AM) coc: and still is obscene technically since they still have that name. \r\n(12:16:48 AM) Skeletor: Its not obscure \r\n(12:16:56 AM) Skeletor: paul walker died in a car crash \r\n(12:17:03 AM) Skeletor: this is a pretty clear ref to that \r\n(12:17:17 AM) coc: Is he not exclusively known for movies with cars? \r\n(12:17:29 AM) Skeletor: I know this is tough but even if it was obsucre \r\n(12:17:33 AM) Skeletor: we told you to change it \r\n(12:17:36 AM) Skeletor: and you changed it back \r\n(12:17:40 AM) Skeletor: I dont know what to say \r\n(12:17:50 AM) coc: As i said i didnt realize this was against ToS because my friend has done the samethign \r\n(12:17:59 AM) Skeletor: Thats fair \r\n(12:18:01 AM) coc: without a ban to this day \r\n(12:18:04 AM) Skeletor: thats why we didnt penalize you the first time \r\n(12:18:10 AM) Skeletor: the penalty came from changing it back \r\n(12:18:22 AM) coc: My friend changed his name back to what it was after he was forced to change it by riot \r\n(12:18:27 AM) Skeletor: We reached out to you and sent you a message about this when we requested the change \r\n(12:18:43 AM) coc: His name is the same as before riot made him change it. \r\n(12:18:49 AM) coc: He did the same exact thing as me with no ban \r\n(12:19:03 AM) coc: or punishment in any way. AND still has the same name \r\n(12:19:10 AM) Skeletor: Oh \r\n(12:19:13 AM) Skeletor: whats his summoner name? \r\n(12:19:39 AM) Skeletor: I will make sure that the system isnt missing anything as thats not the way the system should wrk \r\n(12:20:46 AM) coc: Would the name Steve irwin&#039;s animal be unacceptable simply because he died because of an animal, even though he is known exclusively because of animals? \r\n(12:21:53 AM) Skeletor: No, if it was Steve Irwins sting ray \r\n(12:21:55 AM) Skeletor: then it would be \r\n(12:22:04 AM) Skeletor: steve was a well known animal expert \r\n(12:22:08 AM) coc: My name isnt Paul walkers Porsche Carrera Gt \r\n(12:22:13 AM) coc: its Paul Walkers car\\ \r\n(12:22:20 AM) Skeletor: I mean im not realy guna entertain the discussion \r\n(12:22:28 AM) Skeletor: The suspension wont be changing \r\n(12:22:33 AM) coc: No reasoning i see. \r\n(12:22:37 AM) coc: Same as the other support. \r\n(12:22:41 AM) coc: Riot support truly is bad \r\n(12:22:49 AM) coc: and logicless \r\n(12:22:53 AM) Skeletor: I mean \r\n(12:22:56 AM) Skeletor: you were given the change \r\n(12:23:02 AM) Skeletor: chance to change it to something else \r\n(12:23:03 AM) Skeletor: and you didnt \r\n(12:23:10 AM) coc: it&#039;s not against ToS tho \r\n(12:23:15 AM) coc: and after 4 years of having the name \r\n(12:23:16 AM) Skeletor: We told you it was \r\n(12:23:17 AM) coc: i thought it was a mistake \r\n(12:23:23 AM) coc: after 4 years? \r\n(12:23:32 AM) coc: and no i was banned without an explanation \r\n(12:23:56 AM) coc: The name is not a joke to me and I had it for 4 years \r\n(12:23:59 AM) Skeletor: We sent you a message about it \r\n(12:24:13 AM) Skeletor: and even if you had the name for 4 years, that just meants that it took time for the system to get to you \r\n(12:24:38 AM) coc: Then your system is once again flawed \r\n(12:24:56 AM) coc: Riot truly is dictator like. \r\n(12:26:12 AM) coc: And i did NOT receive a message until after the ban . In game i was told that i was toxic in chat. \r\n(12:26:24 AM) coc: So i assumed it was a mistake and changed it back. \r\n(12:26:37 AM) coc: I was not told that my name was offensive before i was banned \r\n(12:27:03 AM) coc: I even sent a ticket, and the rep simply banned me after seeing i changed it back instead of answering the ticket \r\n(12:27:26 AM) coc: Then finally after another seperate ticket was placed I received a message \r\n(12:27:33 AM) Skeletor: I can see the logs and time stamps of when the messages were sent \r\n(12:27:40 AM) Skeletor: the account was appropriatly warned about the name \r\n(12:27:59 AM) coc: I was not warned in game \r\n(12:28:22 AM) coc: The in game message was incorrect \r\n(12:28:27 AM) coc: stating i had been toxic \r\n(12:28:30 AM) coc: in chat \r\n(12:28:44 AM) coc: Nothing about an inapproriate name \r\n(12:28:55 AM) coc: So, I immediately changed it back \r\n(12:28:57 AM) Skeletor: thats a differnt issue \r\n(12:29:07 AM) Skeletor: the message that was sent to you was an email \r\n(12:29:15 AM) Skeletor: oh no no \r\n(12:29:18 AM) Skeletor: i see what you mean \r\n(12:29:23 AM) coc: Okay well I wasnt warned about an offensive name before i changed it back to what it was \r\n(12:29:30 AM) coc: I was simply banned before i saw a message warning me \r\n(12:29:44 AM) coc: I wouldn&#039;t have even changed it back had i known riot thought it was offensive \r\n(12:30:00 AM) coc: Can you understand why, after 4 entire years, and the chat message being incorrect \r\n(12:30:04 AM) coc: that i thought this was a mistake? \r\n(12:30:18 AM) Skeletor: I&#039;m sorry, but I cant change the penalty on the account for you \r\n(12:30:25 AM) coc: Who can? \r\n(12:30:26 AM) Skeletor: please avoid these types of names in the future \r\n(12:30:35 AM) Skeletor: i guess thats not clear of me \r\n(12:30:36 AM) Skeletor: i can \r\n(12:30:37 AM) Skeletor: i wont \r\n(12:31:01 AM) coc: please explain to me why. Where have i been so ridiculous in all of this that i deserve to be banned. \r\n(12:31:06 AM) coc: your message was incorrect \r\n(12:31:40 AM) coc: It stated Toxic chat, nothing to do with an inapproriate summoner name at all. \r\n(12:31:54 AM) coc: So I immediately changed it back and began to play. \r\n(12:32:25 AM) coc: I did not receive the correct message until I changed it back. \r\n(12:32:27 AM) Skeletor: I can see that you interacted with our agent on friday \r\n(12:32:48 AM) coc: That was an agent? seemed like a robot \r\n(12:32:49 AM) Skeletor: when our intal message was sent to you \r\n(12:32:56 AM) Skeletor: memes aside \r\n(12:33:05 AM) coc: AFTER I changed the name \r\n(12:33:35 AM) Skeletor: No the name was changed to urgey on the 19th after the discussion \r\n(12:33:43 AM) Skeletor: and then you changed it back on the 20th \r\n(12:34:02 AM) coc: I put that so I could change it back to Paul walkers immediately. \r\n(12:34:16 AM) coc: ANd i did \r\n(12:34:37 AM) Skeletor: I&#039;m sorry, but you were givent ample warning and had a discussion with the agent before you changed the name back \r\n(12:34:52 AM) Skeletor: Do you happen to have any concerns not related to your name that I might be able to help you with? \r\n(12:35:00 AM) Skeletor: or the account suspension \r\n(12:35:39 AM) coc: I absolutely did not have a conversation with this man before i changed the name back. He did not reply to me before the ban and I have the screenshots to prove it. \r\n(12:36:00 AM) coc: Nor did he ever even reply to the initial ticket. He simply stated I was banned \r\n(12:37:59 AM) coc: Him emailing me a warning then banning me before replying is not a conversation. \r\n(12:38:00 AM) Skeletor: I&#039;m sorry, but I have the records and am able to see the order of the events, if there arnt any new quesitons I will have to leave this chat \r\n(12:39:42 AM) coc: Well maybe in your convoluted brains that can pull a joke from Paul Walkers car that stands as a conversation, but not any normal person. You are logicless, robot-like, dictator-like, and flat out wrong because the name is not a joke. \r\n(12:40:10 AM) Skeletor: As there are no new quesitons I will be closing out the chat \r\n(12:40:12 AM) Skeletor: have a good one \r\n(12:43:48 AM) *** Skeletor left the chat ***\r\n--------\r\nSkeletor tried to seem like a support but really is just a sjw baby in disguise\r\n \r\n--------\r\n(12:55:05 AM) coc: I was banned for changing my name to Paul Walkers car, the same name I had for 4 years before I was forced to change it without any explanation.

I&#039;ve been suspended for the first time ever(since season 2) due to confusion. \r\n(01:00:04 AM) Frenchy: what seems to be the confusion? \r\n(01:00:50 AM) coc: Well, I have had the name Paul Walkers car for years ever since he passed away as a tribute to him because he was my favorite actor and he is only known for Fast and the Furious. I had the name for 4 years. \r\n(01:01:15 AM) coc: So, when i logged on to find that my name had to be changed, i thought it was a mistake/ was confused. \r\n(01:01:57 AM) coc: I changed it back to Paul Walkers car, replied to the ticket which explained my name was offensive that i found after I had changed my name back already. \r\n(01:02:13 AM) coc: I asked for an explanation and was met with a ban and no reply \r\n(01:02:27 AM) Frenchy: well that&#039;s not the best way to pay tribute to your favorite actor \r\n(01:02:33 AM) Frenchy: this isn&#039;t a very nicce name :/ \r\n(01:02:38 AM) coc: How!?!? \r\n(01:02:44 AM) coc: He is known for cars \r\n(01:02:53 AM) Frenchy: he died in a car accident man :/ \r\n(01:02:56 AM) coc: I did not even realize this could be offensive to anyone \r\n(01:02:58 AM) Frenchy: this name just makes me sad \r\n(01:03:05 AM) coc: Would the name steve irwins animal be unacceptable \r\n(01:03:17 AM) coc: simply because he died because of an animal, even though he is known ONLY for animals \r\n(01:03:29 AM) Frenchy: if it was steve irwins sing ray \r\n(01:03:29 AM) Frenchy: yes \r\n(01:03:39 AM) coc: Well my name isnt Paul Walkers Porsche carrera GT \r\n(01:03:45 AM) coc: its just Paul Walkers car \r\n(01:03:53 AM) coc: and i couldnt fit anything to do with his whole name and the movies \r\n(01:04:00 AM) Frenchy: it&#039;s specific enough to let everyone know what you mean \r\n(01:04:04 AM) Frenchy: you were warned about the name \r\n(01:04:12 AM) coc: Not before I was banned. \r\n(01:04:16 AM) Frenchy: you acknowledged the warning, and then changed it back \r\n(01:04:32 AM) coc: And yes it is specific, specifically referring to Paul Walker and cars. \r\n(01:04:45 AM) coc: Please explain to me how steve irwins animal is any different? \r\n(01:05:16 AM) Frenchy: yes and we told you specifically we dont want this name in our game and that you&#039;d be suspended if you chose it again \r\n(01:05:24 AM) Frenchy: you then chose to change the name the next day \r\n(01:05:39 AM) coc: Please explain to me how steve irwins animal is any different? \r\n(01:05:49 AM) coc: I&#039;ve talked with other support and they cannot answer that question either \r\n(01:05:57 AM) coc: You and the others simply move to a different point \r\n(01:07:06 AM) Frenchy: does someone have that name? \r\n(01:07:07 AM) coc: If i wanted to troll about paul walker dying I would put PWalkerisdeadlol or something juvenile/ stupid like that \r\n(01:07:50 AM) coc: IDK but both of you said if it was Stingray then yes and did not say that name Steve irwins animal is offensive. I fail to see any difference between the 2 names \r\n(01:07:52 AM) Frenchy: Selecting a Summoner name that is falsely indicative of an association with Riot Games, contains personally identifying information, or that is offensive, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable. You may not use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent this restriction on Summoner name choices. Riot Games may modify any name which, in the sole and exclusive judgment of Riot Games, violates this provision, without notification to you, and may take further disciplinary measures, including account termination for repeated violations; \r\n(01:08:01 AM) Frenchy: we have deemed this name to be offensive. we do not want it in our game \r\n(01:08:17 AM) coc: So i cannot reference paul walker and cars in any way? \r\n(01:08:22 AM) coc: is what you are saying \r\n(01:08:41 AM) Frenchy: steve irwin is known for all animals, paul walker is known for being an action movie star \r\n(01:08:44 AM) Frenchy: he died in a car accident \r\n(01:08:49 AM) coc: Name 1 action movie he has been in \r\n(01:08:53 AM) coc: beside fast and the furious \r\n(01:08:54 AM) Frenchy: you pout his name together with car and you think of his death \r\n(01:09:05 AM) Frenchy: you put steve irwin with animal and you think of his entire life \r\n(01:09:27 AM) Frenchy: but if we did see the other name as offensive, and had you change it, and you changed it back, you&#039;d be suspended for that one too \r\n(01:09:55 AM) coc: Paul Walker is not known for being an action movie star thats ridiculous lmao \r\n(01:10:06 AM) Frenchy: my job isn&#039;t to overly disect offensive names, if it is offensive and has been repoorted numerous times, then we change it \r\n(01:10:07 AM) coc: name 1 single thing he was in besides a car movie \r\n(01:10:58 AM) Frenchy: i will no longer be entertaining this discussion. You&#039;ve talked to multiple agents about the same thing. Our stance on the matte is final, we do not allow this name. \r\n(01:11:07 AM) Frenchy: if you write into live chat again you will be banned from live chat. \r\n(01:11:18 AM) Frenchy: since there are no new concerns I am closing this chat. Have a good rest of your ngiht \r\n(01:11:19 AM) coc: HAHAHA logicless dictators \r\n\r\nRiot has decided that my harmless name is against their terms (which it clearly does not break any rules) of being a sjw baby and suspended my account for the first time (playing since season 2). Riot&#039;s game has gotten worse and so has their support/mentality. They&#039;re are probably tied for the the worst gaming company i&#039;ve ever experienced with Bluehole.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2018-05-21T02:33:49.710+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":">yes and we told you specifically we dont want this name in our game and that you'd be suspended if you chose it again\n\nSeems pretty straightforward to me.

They gave you a chance **absolutely free** to pick a different name.\n\nYou chose instead to use a name you **knew** violated the rules.\n\nYes, your suspension is deserved. Maybe you should reread the ToU - Riot has sole authority to determine if your name is offensive or not. They generally do so based on reports from the community, and they tend not to release numbers of reports to you when it is changed.","replies":[{"poster":"coc","date":"2018-05-21T01:58:27.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Yeah I was not told.

I'm not sure if this went to your email, or was in client, or support, or somewhere else - but honestly it's on you as it's illogical to think \"hmm, Riot's making me change my name because there was no problem with the old one!\"","replies":[{"poster":"coc","date":"2018-05-21T02:09:19.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"I literally did think why and ask support why in a ticket. They replied with a statement saying I was banned for changing it back and not why it was unacceptable. It's just a different ticket than the live chats that i copy pasted. The message stating my name was offensive went to my email. The only message i received in game stated that my communication in game had been toxic. Nothing to do with a name being offensive. I immediately changed it back to Paul walkers car as soon as I was forced to change before going to my email. And yes after 4 years of having this name i thought it was a mistake. My point is Riot is dictator like and you even helped me point by quoting the ToS. Riot has sole discretion. I honestly did not even know this could be viewed as offensive and tried to be reasonable but they ban me without an explanation. They can't explain their reasoning behind banning me. I've talked to 3 different supports and all of them sidestep the question/ are unable to give me a legit answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-05-21T02:11:35.234+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"So, you got an email saying your name was offensive, yet you still chose to change it back, and you're now surprised that you're being further punished for it.\n\nThis does not make any sense.

You had that name before the car crash.  If this was the case your name physically couldn't be a reference to the crash, and accusing you of having a name as a reference to said crash would be the same as accusing you of time travel.\n\n2. You only had that name after the crash.  If this was the case your name was definitely a reference to the crash, and can easily be seen as offensive.\n\nWhat is and what is not offensive is very relative, and stuff like this really needs to take every bit of context into account.  That said, the actions you chose to take in dealing with this situation did not help you in the slightest.  Ultimately it doesn't matter what is right or what is logically consistent, all that matters is what the people with the power think, and you didn't really make your case in a way that would allow them to easily side with you.\n\nI'm not too familiar with what this case is about, but if option one is the case you should get your name back.
