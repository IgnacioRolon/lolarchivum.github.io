When i first downloaded the patch, i reloaded as usual and went straight into a game. The client wouldn't work after champion select, and I had to troubleshoot the entire game to get it to open. A couple games later my game just disconnects randomly for about 30 seconds 2 to 3 times a game, always around the same time. I seemed to fix that, so i hopped in another game. Now, every time someone uses any sort of ability that's big and/or colorful, my frames drop, and Karthus R's crash my game. Also, ever since this update, my PBE will not open anymore, which doesn't make much sense considering the two aren't really connected. Any help? Anyone else having any of these probelms?","replies":[{"poster":"mufasas1lion","date":"2015-02-26T17:53:34.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot can you please fix this, IF you like patching things like the{{champion:254}}  Vi Q flashing in...\nand{{champion:14}}  SION H stutter step ulti\nTHEN.... why cant you fix this problem... for the millions of people who play this game....\ndoes it ONLY matter if there's people who can play them, and nothing at all matters when it comes to people who cant?\nDo you just not care as long as most of the community can play this game?","replies":[]}]}
