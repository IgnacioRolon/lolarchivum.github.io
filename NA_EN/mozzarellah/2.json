The processes show they are there but the client itself isn't. Terminating the processes and trying again, or trying to open it up again and getting the \"another instance is already running\" and restarting it that way don't work.\r\n\r\nThe only way I can log on is by restarting my entire computer, or by waiting about 30 minutes to an hour with the patcher open, then hitting launch.\r\n\r\nI've already tried repairing my client multiple times but to no help, so now I want to reinstall League but can't deal with deleting it entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T03:52:10.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel like the reinstall will fix this issue. These types of issues are commonly caused by either permissions issues or a poor connection to our servers.
