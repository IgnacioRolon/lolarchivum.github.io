Currently, we have most positions of the first roster filled except for Top lane. TTI tryouts are on January 2nd and 3rd at 5 pm pacific or 8 pm eastern. It&#039;s a two day event and is contingent on making both days. If you have friends wanting to try out as well they can. Every role is still up for grabs especially since we are working on a two team system however some roles  are currently being tried out for by the TTI roster of last season. Commitment is a must. Expect to have 3 days of practice for 2-4 hours a week and one day of League games. Featured leagues are still TBD but we participated in the VGL and CL last season.
