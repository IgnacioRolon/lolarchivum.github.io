I don&#039;t have hard numbers on this, but I completed that mission in one game as Jihn and definitely did not ult 20 separate times.","replies":[{"poster":"kattzkitti","date":"2017-11-23T02:36:56.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happens with every champ that has multi-stage or spammable ults.","replies":[]}]}
