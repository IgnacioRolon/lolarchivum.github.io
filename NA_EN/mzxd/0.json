Katarina is largely a noob stomper champion, where proper focus will crush her and she'll be irrelevant in the game. Anyone that knows how to deal with her can completely shut her down with minimal effort. {{champion:31}} for example is a massive counter to her as both his Q and his W will stop her ultimate and obliterate her damage. Cho'gath is also currently one of the strongest mid laners in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-05T13:28:33.360+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easily Shutdown (most hard CC stop her ult).

I would say she is seen as too situational to be worth practicing, so she only comes up if someone happens to play her and she is deemed a good pick for the specific match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jewliciousness","date":"2015-05-07T21:23:45.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the first person said, she's ridiculously easy to shutdown with cc. Any professional player would be able to spot an incoming ult before the person had the chance to even get there and be able to take it out with some crowd control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hasztalan2","date":"2015-05-05T15:05:22.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cuz she is a trash champion.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPiged","date":"2015-05-07T01:55:59.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rude.","replies":[]}]}]}
