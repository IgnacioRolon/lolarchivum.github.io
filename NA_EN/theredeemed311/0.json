You can grab a complete list **[here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins)**. At this time, we don't have plans to bring these skins back. \n\nCurrently, the only promotion-type skins we're handing out are Unchained Alistar for following on YouTube, Riot Girl Tristana for following on Facebook, and Dreadknight Garen for following on Twitter. \n\nThese are promotions that have been around for a while, and something we don't intended to stop doing any time soon. \n\nAs a note, the YouTube redeption is currently broken, so to obtain that skin, you'll need to **[submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)**, so we can credit it to your account. \n\nBack to your original question - there isn't a way to check if you have them in one spot. You would need to go to the Champion Details Page in the client and swap through the skin cards to see if it's owned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-07T17:05:38.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really sure what kind of rewards you're talking about. Riot isn't running any promotions like that currently, so you may be talking about a scam. If you're talking about some older programs they ran you could probably submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and ask about it. If you've got anything more specific, ask.","replies":[]}]}
