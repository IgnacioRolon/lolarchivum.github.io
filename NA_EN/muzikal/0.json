It's becoming a more common thing lately, and its really impacting my play. I've had buddies who will timeout from the PvP.net server during champion select, myself included, and then reconnect but not be in champion select anymore. This causes our whole group to have to wait because leaverbuster thinks they exited the queue, when we didn't leave. I know for a fact its not a specific ISP, we all have different providers(Charter, Comcast, etc.). I wanna say its something on Riot's end, but I don't wanna be too quick to point fingers. I've tried all manners of tests during the supposed time out, and the internet works fine. I was just wondering if anybody else has suffered from this in the past few months. Also, I've been getting huge ping spikes in game, and my friends I play with confirm that its a giant spike, because they have issues as well (One lives on the West coast, the rest of us live in the Midwest). Hoping that this maybe grabs the attention of a Riot employee or something so they could explain whats going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T21:01:13.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this and wasn't able to find any recorded issues going on with the NA servers. While you and your friends are in different areas in the US, it's possible your connection travels along the same backbone network to the server, and there could be issues there.\n\nI'd like to take a deeper look into your route by taking a look at a traceroute log. To run one, you'll need to grab [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/), then boot up the program. Plug in the IP Address 104.160.131.1 and run the trace for 5 minutes, before exporting your results as a text, then pasting the log here in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Muzikal","date":"2016-08-30T22:33:17.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\n\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n\n|                             192.168.2.1 -    0 |  364 |  364 |    0 |    0 |   10 |    0 |\n\n|                             10.171.48.1 -    0 |  364 |  364 |    5 |    7 |   26 |    7 |\n\n|  dtr01wrbgmo-tge-0-6-1-2.wrbg.mo.charter.com -    0 |  364 |  364 |    5 |    8 |   22 |    9 |\n\n|  dtr01stlsmo-bue-50.stls.mo.charter.com -    1 |  360 |  359 |    0 |   17 |   27 |   22 |\n\n|  crr02olvemo-bue-20.olve.mo.charter.com -    1 |  360 |  359 |    0 |   18 |   29 |   22 |\n\n|  bbr01olvemo-bue-60.olve.mo.charter.com -    0 |  364 |  364 |   14 |   19 |   29 |   18 |\n\n|  bbr02chcgil-bue-2.chcg.il.charter.com -    1 |  360 |  359 |    0 |   26 |   37 |   23 |\n\n|  prr01chcgil-bue-4.chcg.il.charter.com -    1 |  360 |  359 |    0 |   22 |   35 |   27 |\n\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    1 |  360 |  359 |    0 |   23 |   31 |   24 |\n\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\n\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting & Cloud Provider\n\n\nHere's the log after ~5 minutes or so.

Your traceroute doesn't show any immediate issues, but I suspect that your connection may get worse at some points and be fairly stable in others (such as when you ran this trace). In order to get a solution for this and to help us in our investigation, I recommend running a set of logs with our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), then attaching them to a [support ticket submission.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n\nBe sure to specifically mention Charter and your connection issues when composing your ticket.
