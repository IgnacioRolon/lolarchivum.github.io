Generally, to get a solo emblem, the vast majority of your last 25 matches need to have been played solo. The emblem can change over time, but you'll need to play a lot of solo games compared to dynamic ones. Complete info on this system can be found in our [Ranked Emblems FAQ. ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209346066-Ranked-Emblems)\n\nLet me know if you have questions.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-07-21T09:49:53.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last 25 games won*\n\n:D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-07-21T09:16:37.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a side note, the news http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dynamic-queue-matchmaking-update says that the threshold for Solo emblem is *exactly* 90%.
