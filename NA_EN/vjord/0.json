USB to install and load leauge","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I am passionate about league of legends, it's basically the only thing I've got in my life right now.\r\nI had a really crappy laptop which could install league and play league the only downside was it ran the game in low FPS, I've recently spent the little  money I have to buy a new laptop. which has a 29gb hard drive (c:) the problem is without installing anything on it, so say it's never been touched before, system files are taking up 20gb leaving me with only like 9gb of storage space. I've downloaded the league euw installer and ran it, after a short install it lets me select the option to run the league client where the other download takes place after scanning through all the files. After a certain point say 25% completed I get a message saying I need 8gb free storage space. so I'm like damn man then I came up with an idea to go out and buy a 32gb USB stick since my laptop doesn't have any way of replacing the hard drive. I was so excited to run home and try this out since i'm desperate to play LoL. everything was working great it was taking a long time but I was still happy then after about 2 hours maybe it got to 26% complete and then It closed and the bug splat crash report popped up, the screen where it asks for a description of what you were doing before the crash, Name (optional) and Email (optional). I filled it out hoping someone could help me get this resolved. If anyone can help me whatsoever I'd be highly gratefully. I just want to play League :'( thanks.\r\n \r\nJord","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T21:38:07.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw geez, I hate to say this but League is mostly designed to run on the default drive (C:\\), so that might be why you're running into problems. A flash drive really may not work from what I know, but you might have a bit better luck with an actual External Harddrive. Give that a try if you can and you should have some better luck getting the game installed.\n\nAll in all, I would say your *best* bet would be to try and upgrade that C:\\ drive in your laptop. Many programs and games need to be installed on the default drive, which you're not going to have the best luck with right now.","replies":[]}]}
