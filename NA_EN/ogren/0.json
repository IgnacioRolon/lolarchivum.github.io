Before Sierra and 7.3, I was easily holding over 60 FPS on lowest settings even in teamfights.  After both updates though, FPS crashes when just farming duo in botlane.  It's gotten almost unplayable...\r\nI've got 16gb of RAM and the CPU and memory don't seem to be getting pushed to the limits (when looking at things through the Activity Monitor) but I'm struggling to keep over 20FPS in teamfights at the lowest settings for every type of windowing mode. Would like to know if this is simply 7.3 or if it's due to Sierra.\r\n\r\nAre any other Mac users experiencing these low FPS problems?\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-17T01:37:36.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Framerate issues on a Mac can be caused by a few different factors, though, they're most often caused by issues with your SMC, NVRAM or game assets.
