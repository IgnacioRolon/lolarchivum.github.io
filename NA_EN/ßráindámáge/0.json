I say 'lag' because not only were my ping and FPS normal, but other computers on the same network worked just fine. The 'lag' lasted between 5 - 20 seconds causing me to either freeze completely for the duration or become very very choppy, causing auto animations and ability animations to be skipped entirely. Yesterday I decided I had had enough and that perhaps uninstalling and reinstalling League would help. I was wrong. I first noticed I might be wrong when the download time for the installer from leagues website took much longer than it usually does and on top of that anything involving a loading screen took much longer than it typically would. Upon finally downloading league and clicking launch I knew it would take a while for the final download so I left my laptop for a while and came back later with it still at 0% and an error screen on the page. I have since then uninstalled and reinstalled league multiple times just to keep getting the error screen. I am currently at \"Step 1/2: Updating interface\" and it never gets past this point.\r\n\r\nPlease HELP!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T22:33:20.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you might have an unstable connection, though your ping seems fine.
