Do you receive the points for only being in the party with someone that plays a char or do you have to play it yourself?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T00:03:13.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an EU only event, so I'm not 100% sure of all the details, but I did do some digging and was able to figure this out for you!\n\n- Each time you *win* while playing as Annie, Kog'Maw, Gnar, Alistar, Maokai, or Udyr you get 100 points. \n- You will earn an additional 100 points for playing as part of a premade group (at least 2 people in the premade)\n\nSo you do need to play as one of those champions and win, but you get bonus points for playing in a premade. Be sure to check out the [**Slumber Party**](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/slumberparty) page for other details!","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-02T00:31:08.680+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally off topic, are you broporo with a name change?\n\nWhat prompted the name change?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T01:10:35.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://ci.memecdn.com/5191932.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2017-04-02T11:33:46.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, I see what you were doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-02T20:32:41.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to see that so many of you noticed our April Fools board jokes, as small as it was ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RalyS","date":"2017-04-01T21:12:13.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to play with one of the listed champions to get points, however, your friends will get 200 points if they play with you as annie (for instance) and you as \"not listed\" champion, it was already answered multiple times btw","replies":[]}]}
