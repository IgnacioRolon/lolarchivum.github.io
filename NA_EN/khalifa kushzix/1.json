The first game when i hit s4 promos everything is fine our ezreal gets a double and the kill score is 7 to 2 with our lead. About a minute later, the ezreal goes afk and stays that way the rest of the game except for a minute when he came back and ran down mid. I would like this kinda crap to be noticed and the player to be reported, or for that to not count as an official loss in promotional series.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-23T20:36:35.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, that really sucks that it happened in a Ranked Match =\\ . I hope you made sure to report him in the post-game lobby, as that's your best way to get our attention for those things.","replies":[{"poster":"Khalifa KushZix","date":"2017-06-24T04:41:16.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I did.
