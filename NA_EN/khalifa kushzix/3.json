My resolution hasn't yet been set to the new monitor's, so it crashes whenever i enter a game. The problem is, I can't change the resolution and video settings without being in a game, and i obviously can't get there. HELP!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T05:31:25.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, this is a pretty silly situation that sometimes occurs when you switch displays. You should be able to resolve this by resetting your input file with the steps below:\n\nFirst, you'll want to **log into the game** then hop into your config folder, which should be in your install directory:\n\n> **C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted these two files, hop into a custom match to confirm the change went through. Let me know if this worked!","replies":[{"poster":"Khalifa KushZix","date":"2016-12-10T19:42:01.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the assisstance - it helped!","replies":[]}]}]}
