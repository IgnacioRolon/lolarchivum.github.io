Luckily this was the beggining, so no one could kill me since i was walking to lane. I DCed and reconnected and the enemy team had surrendered for a remake, right when i got back on. After the game, it said ineligable to earn loot because of AFK behavior. I just wanted to say... what the hell. I DC against my will and come back to play, they remake. I was punished for leaving for 2 minutes against my will?! WHY?!\r\nPlease fix this...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-10T15:09:55.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A remake or being marked as a leaver counts as a disqualification for any hextech chest rewards in addition to a loss for the causer.  Outside of that I wasn't able to see anything that would make you ineligible for mastery chests, so it's important to stay in game.  Even if your leave wasn't intentional, it can still cause negative experiences for other players.  While this isn't something we can remove, I'm happy to help with any technical issues that might be preventing you from staying in game.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-09-10T15:33:05.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So its like, Involuntary Manslaughter?","replies":[]}]}]}
