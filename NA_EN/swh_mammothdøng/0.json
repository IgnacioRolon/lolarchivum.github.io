We are looking to start off by making 2 league teams, starting and sub roster to compete in tournaments and clash. The idea of 2 teams is to have a main team, but both teams with a captain and practice schedule of their own, but that way we have subs available for both teams. We are looking for players of ALL ROLES, gold-platinum players only at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is not a scheduled tryout time, I need to get players in the channel first!\r\n\r\nPlease join the discord channel, under the &quot;tryout information&quot; category please copy and paste the following, and you will be assigned a role asap.\r\n\r\nIGN:\r\nRANK:\r\nROLE:\r\nOP.GG:\r\n\r\nIn the future there will be openings for staff applications.\r\n\r\nAdd me on discord for further inquiries, questions, and for the discord: F0undry #8301","replies":[{"poster":"Unknown Henchman","date":"2018-11-25T07:51:51.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Unknown Henchman\nRANK: G4\nROLE: ADC/Top (Prefer AD)\nOP.GG: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Unknown%20Henchman","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blush uwu","date":"2018-11-25T07:41:11.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN:Blüsh\nRANK:P4\nROLE: AD\nOP.GG:http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Blüsh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jafks","date":"2018-11-24T05:57:05.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN jafks\nRANK Gold 5 in all 3 queues \nROLES MID/SUPP\nop.gg http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=jafks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Otter","date":"2018-11-23T10:33:40.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Mr Otter\nRANK: Gold 5 Solo/Duo Gold 3 Flex\nROLE: Top/ADC\nOP.GG:http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Mr%20Otter","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exillade","date":"2018-11-21T23:23:22.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Exillade\nRank: Gold 4\nRole: I guess my main would be mid but i can play most roles\nOP.GG: http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Exillade","replies":[{"poster":"Denaari","date":"2018-11-21T23:55:56.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"didn't you play ADC last season with me and Sonic?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Denaari","date":"2018-11-21T22:24:04.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey.
