Last game I was dropping out every 3-6 minutes.  I haven't played much this week, and it was my first game.  Is there any indication on what this could be?\n\n[Edit]\nConfirmed ISP problem.  It's happening to people playing multiple games, etc.  The only thing I can find Roger wise in terms of updates is \"We're aware there's a problem in Ont.\" on their main website, and a 3 hour ETA on the fix from about 2h ago.  Doesn't seem likely they'll solve it soon.  Seems like it issue started around 12-2 p.m. today (or at least people started reporting it around then).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tempest Janna","date":"2017-03-10T01:59:58.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in Canada as well and I've been experiencing huge lag spikes within the 1000+ range which is unusual for me.
