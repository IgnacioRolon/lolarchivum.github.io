It is especially bad ingame, as it takes super long to unfreeze and then the game crashes. The crashes are followed by a bugsplat.  Also really weird is that when I force shut down my computer during one of these freezes, my computer always experiences startup issues (i get a missing startup disk error) that are a pain to resolve. I know that the startup issues seem to be unrelated to league, but they literally only happen after a league freeze. Nothing else I do on my computer causes these freezes/startup issues. I have tried repairing the client, uninstalling/reinstalling, etc. I have a macOS Sierra. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I have no idea what the hell is going on rn.
