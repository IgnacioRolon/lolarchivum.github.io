CarnivalKnights implied there is a connection between {{champion:142}} {{champion:134}}, so that kinda means Syndra is going down the path of being corrupted... On the boards, he replied to me regarding Star Guardian Urgot existence with this {{sticker:sg-janna}}, so maybe, MAYBE, he is involved in the corrupting Syndra and Zoe...\n\nIt makes sense Ahri, Jinx, Xayah rejecting and insulting him, because they are less than Fourth Years in the lore, they have absolutely no idea of his Star Guardian self that might just be the source of corruption.\n\nHe might just be the ultimate villain behind all, the one that plans to destroy the lights and take revenge for years of insults, imagine the skin paying nod to the jokery in effect wise to a degree, but make it equally unnerving at the same time, if they dare to go legendary+ way. \n\nEdit: Zoe's lore for Star Guardian skin is this: \"A member of the ancient, first group of Star Guardians, Zoe's heart desired not love, but chaos -- twisting her newfound power into a malignant expression of cosmic madness. After numberless eons of hunting the First Star's chosen, she has finally come to Valoran City, hoping to destroy the latest generation of Guardians as she has countless others.\" \n\nCHAOS is the shtick of the 'Got, the one he thrives on. What if he truly is behind all, as the first guardian long forgotten by everyone? \n\n#Justice4StarGuardianUrgot","replies":[{"poster":"Cind3rkick","date":"2019-08-28T08:57:29.706+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's going to be the ultimate skin for leagues 10 year anniversary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2019-08-29T18:32:00.038+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urgot can be the First Light from which all star guardian powers originate.....................","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carnival Knights","date":"2019-08-29T00:01:19.966+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheDangerousTaco","date":"2019-08-29T00:26:22.136+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Carnival Knights,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=TmUJVZru,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2019-08-29T00:01:19.966+0000)\n>\n> {{sticker:sg-janna}}\n\nyou shall not escape this meme.
