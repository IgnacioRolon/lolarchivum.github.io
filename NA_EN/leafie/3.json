So I have to go with the ones that I actually require to keep living.\n\nThanks to all the friends I&#039;ve made over the course of being here. It means quite a lot to me to have people that care. Growing with all of you since yellow GD has legitimately been an honor. I know some of you pretend to be autistic or whatever but that never really bothered me. I love you all.\n\nI know you&#039;ll all miss my art, or me calling everyone Summoner, or just me in general because let&#039;s be real, I&#039;m pretty awesome. But I&#039;ll be back. I&#039;m just gone until I can get back on my feet I guess. Maybe a few weeks, maybe a few months. But I&#039;ll be back.\n\nLooks like I&#039;ll have to put my dreams of being a voice actor on hold. Just for a little while, yeah?\n\nI&#039;ll be doing a few games later tonight before I call and cancel my internet line if anyone wants to join. If not, that&#039;s cool too.\n\nEither way, whether it&#039;s later tonight or in a few months from now...\n\n\n**I will see you on the Rift, Summoner.**","replies":[]}
