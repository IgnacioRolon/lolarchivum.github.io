I assumed most of the team reported me for feeding but I was trying the best to my ability to do well since this meta kinda screws you if you fall behind. I can understand why I was banned to a degree but I don&#039;t really think its fair that my honor level should be locked again and when it asks me if I understand I don&#039;t and i&#039;d like to not click I understand since their system pisses me off. Im usually not toxic but sometimes you have a bad game and your team is toxic first or they try to get you to curse which is why their system is so useless. It just takes a few reports if you have one or two bad games in a row and puts it together to bann you, i&#039;d just prefer to be permanently banned instead of not being able to chat with my teammates or not be able to play clash with my friends all because a few trolls pissed me off. Welp thats my opinion i&#039;d like you hear yours and be as harsh as you like.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-24T04:51:37.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wish to close your account you may make a support ticket requesting to close your account.\n\nYou are fully within your rights to not click I understand for the punishment you have recieved, you just can't play the game if you choose not to, although really all you are saying you understand is the summoner's code which you already agreed to follow in order to play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silent Gravity","date":"2018-06-24T04:38:56.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds angry, but it's for effect:\n\"The IFS doesn't fucking care about what fucking words are used.\"\n\nWhat the IFS does care about is using chat to belittle, harass, annoy, spam, blame, argue, or give up.
