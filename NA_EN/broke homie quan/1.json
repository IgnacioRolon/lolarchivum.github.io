I think it will be a great feature for jungles and supports I know there may have to be some tweaks for it so it wont be Op or anything like that but this was just an  idea I had on my mind","replies":[{"poster":"GrievousFetus","date":"2017-10-01T23:28:23.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that wards that provide combat advantages beyond raw vision are a bad idea. \n\nI'm totally open to new wards though.

If they are using up your ward slot then it would also lead to people providing less vision, which is much more powerful than stats.\n\nBasically, it would be a noob trap or cause severe turtleing.","replies":[]}]}
