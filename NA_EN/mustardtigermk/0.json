After how they saw Ezreal was at fault everyone was actually friendly, we played well and so did I. We made a come from behind win! My KDA may not show it but I was giving my all and hit some huge key skill shots to help end the game. I was typing and stepped out too far, I died got embarrassed and played it like I was trolling by walking forward instead of trying to back **I got caught out and was dead no matter which direction I went because I messed up and Ezreal refused to help me. He started crying int while having more deaths than me or very close to the same. My KDA was actually better than this guys. I know all that doesn't matter but I mean someone is getting everyone to gang up on me I was defending myself and actually won my team over. Half of the game we were actually being friendly but if you only see the context of arguing then yeah it might seem worse, it is completely out of context and out of how many other games I've played, with being GG> enough to reach honor 3. I don't mind the chat restriction, sure you could argue that I stepped out of line for sure telling someone to shut up in response to them saying stfu you piece of ****. Take my chat away but do all my rewards and honor have to drop to 0 and be locked? Does that honestly seem fair to anyone?? This chat log also represents 1 strike of very few to completely losing my account and the money I put into it, not to mention the time. I'm fine with zero tolerance for sexism(Riot?), racism, vulgar words, threats etc.. I've lost all my rewards/honor/have a strike for responding to ultra negative chat, turning the whole game around, becoming friendly and we won (which should be the most important part). Now this guy that was revving me up like a jerk knowing he was going to report me and now he probably has a message from Riot saying his reports punished someone. The guy is freaking laughing and Riot is letting it happen. BTW there was only 1 Game given as an example.  \r\n\r\n\"Why'd he flash?\" was when we started to be friendly, the rest of the chat is like drawn out 20 minutes maybe 30? I can't remember tbh, we were typing when dead or with a big break in the battle. It makes me look like a jerk but they were asking why I left lane and I told them Ezreal was sabotaging me and I explained how he was doing it. With how people are living these days you'd think the game you love to play wouldn't pile it on by restricting you for one game of negative chat.\r\n\r\nIf anyone of importance reads this and can get me more example of when I was reported/acting unsportsmanlike. You know odds are if this is the one game they have as a reason of why I'm restricted out of like 700 games I think? Maybe something induced it like super toxic teammates. \r\n\r\nOn top of all this - I was reported out of spite....the guy was a willing participant arguing/talking then reports me? Hmmm... This guy better have also gotten chat restricted, I don't think I even reported him because we ended up bonding as a team and winning, thought everyone was cool.\r\n\r\nAnyways I know I'll get a lot of hate out of this but I just want to know if I should dispute this punishment and refuse to accept this chat log as an example of something that should be punishable.\r\n\r\nSo upset it has been like nearly a year or something to get to honor 3... I'm so butt hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-08-22T04:17:44.125+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try to submit a support ticket but you might not get the response you were hoping for.

You can breeze through a 10 game chat restriction in 1-2 days without it negatively impacting you at all. \n\n Honor is obtained easily so long as you stay positive, but even then you're just losing out on some free rewards for a little bit. It's not like you're getting shoved into a low priority queue for the next 3 months, you're just going to miss out on some keys and chests for a little while, they'll be back.\n \n> Also - We didn't argue or be negative the whole game, if you read what I said, I mentioned that close to halfway through the game we bonded and we were positive with each other and won the game. \n> \n\nMustardTigerMK: ezreal you shut up buddy\nMustardTigerMK: youre doing 0 dmg in exchanges\nMustardTigerMK: and its been the difference\nMustardTigerMK: youre typical adc\nMustardTigerMK: who doesnt do dmg\nMustardTigerMK: then blames support\nMustardTigerMK: if youre not goingto hel;p\nMustardTigerMK: im not going to stay\n\n\n I did read the entire chat log, and I also read the context of the match even though that wasn't relevant. \n\n Telling people to shut up, calling someone a \"typical adc who doesn't do damage then blames support\", and threatening to leave your lane is all considered negative behavior by Riot and most players. If you guys made up, that's cool, but that doesn't change your behavior for the first half of the game (which someone felt like reporting you for.)\n\n Also, obligatory mention, I _did_ say you could file a support ticket if you wanted to try and appeal the punishment. The reason I said \"you might not get the response you were hoping for\" is because your chat logs don't actually contain any apologetic behavior. You didn't drop an \"I'm sorry Ezreal/Fiora\" or \"Are we cool? We all made mistakes\" or anything like that. \n\n So if you filed a support ticket, it would be hard to make the case that your punishment was unwarranted when you didn't directly apologize to the person you argued with in the first place. Look at it from their perspective. \n\n> I'm not saying my chat shouldn't be restricted, I could care less but my honor and rewards? Too much for this chat log if you ask me... and only one offence? ... come on.\n\n Your Honor will unlock quickly if you stop this behavior.

Saying something like \"Man, stop fucking dying Jinx.\" is considered negativity whereas \"Jinx, let's play safe so we can scale up.\"/\"Jinx, try and sit back a little more.\" is not.\n\n Honestly, a lot of it comes down to common sense. Obviously that's subjective but most people tend to understand the ruleset upon reading the Summoner's Code, ToU/ToS, or forums like Reddit + the Boards. Even then, players are given multiple chances in the form of 4 separate punishments, starting out lightly with a 10+25 game chat restriction and then escalating from there.  So whether the person agrees with the rules or not, they should be able to easily understand what is considered rulebreaking behavior and conduct themselves accordingly. \n\n As I mentioned in my previous comment towards the OP, some of their behavior in particular was pretty much textbook negativity. Calling out someone for their performance with no intent to help them, making personal attacks or insults towards their character (_ex._ \"typical adc players\"), and arguing back and forth with people all game (which detracts focus from the game and annoys the other players on their team) is something that most would consider rulebreaking behavior. But again, this is a light punishment. The 10 game chat restriction will be over in no time and getting Honor 0/1/2 is simple.\n\n_________\n\nEdit: Also, forgot to mention this.\n\n One of the reasons Riot doesn't have a strict guide as to what you can and can't say is because that would act as a \"guideline\" of sorts for toxic players. If you know word for word what you **can't* *say, you can deduce what _is_ allowed, thereby opening up more methods to flame with.

That's unfortunate, and I'm sorry you had to deal with it. If this misbehavior happened in chat (including emotes or ping) and they don't respond positively to a _single, courteous, constructive request to focus on the game_, your best option is to mute that player. Submit a report after the match. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by asking them to keep it down and then notifying library staff and moving to another area.\n\n_Do not respond with misbehavior of your own!_ If you do that, your teammates may mute and report _you_, and those reports would be valid. This is equivalent to dealing with a noisy person in a library by getting into a shouting match with them. Just because someone else started it doesn't justify you in continuing it. I'm sure you're familiar with the \"s/he started it\" trope, where two children get into an argument or fight and then try to claim innocence of any wrongdoing by claiming that they didn't instigate it. As any parent, teacher, or other supervisor of children will tell you, that excuse doesn't fly. When Dad is trying to drive you to Disneyland and your annoying brother starts making faces at you as he's previously been told not to, you should calmly ask him to stop, and then, if that doesn't work, calmly notify your parents of the problem. Making faces at him or shouting at him has never been a good way to get him to stop, and it makes you just as guilty of that as he.\n\nRiot doesn't care who started it. Someone else's misbehavior does not justify your own.\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-):\n\n> * Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other player’s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n> * Reports are a vital piece to the puzzle. If you are not sure of what sort of behavior is reportable take a look at the [Reporting a Player FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player)\n\nIf you misbehave but a teammate or opponent does or says something even worse, you should definitely report them after the match, just as someone reported you for your own misbehavior. Yes, that's certainly possible. Reports are not a limited resource. Any time someone believes that another player violated LoL's behavioral standards, they can report that player. Punishments are similarly not limited: if more than one player in a game merits a punishment, they can both get a punishment. This can happen even if the players in question were antagonizing each other. The IFS doesn't need to weigh the severity of all reported players' actions and then \"award\" the \"winner\" with a punishment; it's not a contest.\n\nThink of it like dealing with a noisy person in a library: ask them to keep it down, and then notify library staff and move to another area if that doesn't work. If you get into a shouting match with them, you're just as likely to be removed, even if you weren't shouting _quite_ as loudly as they were. The goal is a quiet library.\n\nThe only chat messages included in your chat log are your own for a single, extremely good reason: they are the only ones taken into account for your punishment, because they're the only ones in your control. The things other players said and did in your match might produce in you an impulse to do certain things that may include breaking LoL's rules, but your behavior is your own, and you are responsible for it. If you really think about it, this is a good thing. If a toxic player's goading could exempt you from punishment for your flaming them, calling for reports, etc., then it would logically go the other way as well, resulting in punishments for players who didn't necessarily break any rules but weren't quite as friendly and positive as their teammates. Can you imagine a world where \"didn't participate in the dance party and ignored all of our jokes\" was a valid report that could get someone suspended for two weeks? We don't want that situation anymore than we want \"called our support a braindead waste of space\" to be considered an _invalid_ report just because, say, the support was telling their team to harm themselves while they merrily ran it down mid.\n\nYou are certainly allowed to defend yourself from toxic chat, which is accomplished by muting. This is a 100% effective method. Flaming back is a 0% effective method that also constitutes unacceptable behavior and thus opens you up to reports and punishments. Read about this in more detail [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Pqc6PJUE-players-who-flame-back-in-self-defense-dont-understand-the-meaning-of-those-words).\n\nLoL's Honor system rewards you with things like Honor, BE, and key fragments when it deems your behavior good. LoL's punishment system (the IFS, or Instant Feedback System) places a punishment on your account when it deems your behavior bad. Behaving well sometimes doesn't mean you behave well all the time. In this instance - and possibly others, since the IFS punishes based on severity and consistency, and the reform card doesn't necessarily display logs for every match where you were validly reported - you behaved poorly. Poor behavior is very impactful and thus carries a lot of weight with the IFS, so to regain Honor and avoid losing it you'll have to work on controlling your behavior. The IFS does forgive the occasional bad day, but if that kind of behavior becomes habitual, you might be greeted with a reform card telling you to rein it in, or with a permaban message if the temporary punishments haven't worked.\n\nIt's true that some Riot staff have been accused of various types of misbehavior. However, that has no connection to your punishment. You are the one who agreed to a set of rules and then broke that agreement. Other people causing harm by breaking other rules in another place doesn't give you the right to cause additional and completely separate harm by breaking these rules in this place.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.\n\nIn a perfect and just world, everyone who deserved a punishment would get one. In reality, it is possible for some punishable behavior to go unpunished. First, punishments in LoL can only occur after a valid report. Second, punishments take into account the consistency and severity of the punished player's misbehavior: if two players in a match break the same rule in the same way, one who consistently misbehaves in this way might get a punishment while the other who almost never does so gets away without a punishment (this time). At the end of the day, though, all this does is explain how differences in player behavior over many games can produce different results for equivalent behavior within a single game. It doesn't excuse poor behavior. One person having a rare bad day doesn't give a consistently toxic player the right to join in. The only behavior that matters in your punishment is your own... and a good thing, too: how would you feel if you behaved yourself but got punished anyway just because all your teammates were spectacularly friendly, communicative, and positive?\n\nFrom [Riot's support knowledgebase](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025054153-Understanding-Your-Temporary-Account-Ban):\n\n> We can not discuss other players’ actions with you but you can always report them at end of game and mute them when in game. There is no excuse for raging back or responding to people trying to get you to tilt. You are the only one responsible for your actions and your words which is what we are trying to address with these bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MustardTigerMK","date":"2019-08-22T04:18:16.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I said it's 2v1 bot I meant ezreal was creating a 2v1 environment where I was the 1....I had to leave lane...team got upset..
