Because I feel the odd time someone disc it is either a heavy heavy troll, someone who lost their internet or computer crash both of which nobody should lose LP over. Count it as a loss but take 0 LP imo....I've had 2 x AFK like their name was X out...lose 17LP like why? If you're in a duo you don't have disc protection if the person leaving is in the duo...that would avoid any colluding or cheating with it..... \r\n\r\nThe system is too dry and robotic to be friendly to humans..","replies":[]}
