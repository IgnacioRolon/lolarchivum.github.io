Then we request a ganked from our jungler player which was Master Yi. So about 10-15 minutes later, no sign of him coming to help and we were getting shut down really bad because enemy jungle Twitch came back and ganked back to back really bad. Things started to get heated due to our jungler Master Yi refuse to help ganked. So I started to be toxic and our jungler was making excuse that he couldn&#039;t find a time to ganked for 10-15 minutes and say he was busy getting rift herald but at the same time he wanders off to enemy jungles. And all those time he say he couldn&#039;t find anytime. Master Yi haven&#039;t ganked mid but only top once and that&#039;s it. So we all lost lane due to enemy ganking lanes back to back. Also through out the game Master Yi has the rift herald and didn&#039;t use it through out the game. Pretty sure he&#039;s making excuse that he couldn&#039;t find time using rift herald through out the game\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the chat with Riots banning me.\r\n----\r\nT O P Senpai\r\nOctober 8th 2018, 6:02:35 pm\r\nWhy am I getting penalty for this much day and when other player play in game did a shitty job on there position and ruin the game for us are not getting the penalty as we do. I understand that if we BM we get penalty for it but, do you guys ever take a look at the game-play and see why we are getting BM so much to them. It&#039;s because of them ruin the game for us and that&#039;s why we BM so much towards them. And on top of that, players that ruins the game don&#039;t penalty for it and we do if we BM for them. It has happen to many other player games before and those player who ruins other people game don&#039;t get suspension from it but why the people that BM gets the penalty and they don&#039;t. And it is not fair that the people that BM other player don&#039;t receive the same penalty. They are the reason why we BM so much to them because they are ruin our game and our time for the game. They should be the one who gets the penalty for ruin the game for us, not us. Also the player that ruins the game for us, that player did not even have a team com. at all. That&#039;s like saying if I ruins other people game for them and they BM me and I report them they gets the penalty for it and I don&#039;t get the penalty for it. Then I might as well do that for every game because it kinda seems to enjoyable for the player to get them mad and you here to waste other player time and report them for being BM and they get the penalty for it. Right now it seems corrupted by the ways how Riots sets the penalty for it just for being BM and the penalty for it and player who ruins the game for them does not gets it.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBlitzcrank Bot\r\nOctober 8th 2018, 6:02:46 pm\r\n\r\nGreetings, human! I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\r\n\r\nThis penalty stems from demonstrating negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.\r\nHere are some chat logs from games where you were heavily reported:\r\nGame 2883277673:\r\nPre Game Lobby:\r\n    T O P Senpai: sup\r\nIn Game:\r\n    T O P Senpai: can er get a gank?\r\n    T O P Senpai: dude we are getting ganked back to back where the fuck u at?\r\n    T O P Senpai: dude i said it like ten min ago and ur bitchass still wont show ur %%%%%% ass up\r\n    T O P Senpai: dude stfu u\r\n    T O P Senpai: u dont know how to jungle or somthing\r\n    T O P Senpai: yeah due to a ganked\r\n    T O P Senpai: its cool we dont have to win this game\r\n    T O P Senpai: yeah we asked ur %%%%%% ass for ganked after we got ganked 2nd time and ur fumbass still dont do shit and try to tell us...\r\n    T O P Senpai: sigh u got the rift and u didnt use it what a wasted of time\r\n    [All]T O P Senpai: report yi please\r\n    T O P Senpai: i feel like i dont wanna hook no more i just miss my hook on pupose\r\n    T O P Senpai: u need to stfu when u know whos wrong for this game. u fucking nub\r\n    T O P Senpai: stupid ass\r\n    T O P Senpai: oh so now u %%%%%% wana talk now?\r\n    T O P Senpai: this is wat going to happen when u dont have time to gank bot. stupid dumb ass\r\n    T O P Senpai: ah yah duo\r\n    T O P Senpai: this akili do u even know why people like u exist?\r\n    T O P Senpai: nvm u smart only to the dumb peopple like you.\r\n\r\nI know these can be subjective concepts. I myself was once banned for calling my teammates &ldquo;weak, fleshy underlings.&rdquo; Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I&rsquo;m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.\r\nSometimes it&rsquo;s best to ignore the mewlings of your teammates and only focus on what you can control. If teammates anger you, try saying so out loud to yourself, not in chat where they can report you. After an annoying game, find a satisfying way to blow off steam. I&rsquo;m told humans find catharsis in music, so try listening to Mozart or the dulcet sounds of &ldquo;LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR.&rdquo;\r\nI hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond. There isn&rsquo;t much more information a human specialist could provide, but if you want any further questions answered, you may select the option below.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nT O P Senpai\r\nOctober 9th 2018, 12:07:18 am\r\nOkay, so lets say that if I was a playing as a jungle and all I do was roaming around the forest and when people ask for gank, and I refuse to do it. Now they lost their lane due enemy jungler came to help them and me not helping me when they asked for it and now they started to flame on me due to a lost lane. So I ignores other player&#039;s request knowing that I can do it but they started to flames on me. Player lost their lanes because I know that it could of been avoid if I could just lend a help for them. Now the game is lost and due to me not cooperate as a team player and which I could of prevent it from it. Okay so after the game if I reported them for being toxic and flaming me, they get the penalty for it but I don&#039;t, just because they flaming in the chat-box and I wasn&#039;t and all I did was just farming in the jungles and didn&#039;t want to cooperate with the teammates. And so now therefore we get to report them for being toxic and they get penalty for it but I was the one who is ruin thirty minutes of the game for them.\r\nSo what I&#039;m trying to say that if we play it and just didn&#039;t want to help other teams. Now player started being toxic in chat-box. We report them and they gets penalty for it. We get away for it just for ruin other player game. Then I might as well do that just to have fun reporting people and ruin their game for them don&#039;t help team member when they ask for it. If that&#039;s the case then I might as well do it, so I can be a Reporter Sports-Manlike. Just don&#039;t care about other player and pretend to play like I really want to play and just waiting for them to be toxic and report them. Because right now, I&#039;m being report and gets penalty for it just because of what I was telling you guys of whats happening in my situation now.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSanguineDogma\r\nOctober 9th 2018, 12:49:36 am\r\nHey there T O P Senpai,\r\nSanguineDogma here with the Player Support Team, and it&#039;d be my pleasure to help you out today!\r\nI totally understand that other players in this game can be vicious and tilting and negative, but that doesn&#039;t give us justification to respond to their behavior with negativity of our own. Looking over your account, I can see that this 2 week ban was placed on your account because of your decision to use homophobic slurs.\r\nWe take homophobic slurs very seriously, as those words are steeped in years of hatred, and the community just doesn&#039;t want to see them being used in games. Just because they aren&#039;t hurtful to you doesn&#039;t mean that other people in game will share your same sentiments. We have a strict Zero-Tolerance policy for the use of any kind of slur, racial, homophobic, or otherwise. The first offense for language like this warrants an immediate 2-Week ban, which placed your account on very thin ice. Any further instances of negativity, no matter how minor, are very likely to result in your account being banned permanently.\r\nIn the future, I highly recommend muting players in-game when they&#039;re exhibiting behavior that upsets you, and then remembering to report them at the end of the game.\r\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to let me know! I&#039;m always here to help.\r\n\r\nSanguineDogma\r\nPlayer Behavior Agent\r\nZaun Alley-Dweller\r\n&quot;I licked this bolt for you!&quot;\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nT O P Senpai\r\nOctober 9th 2018, 10:35:46 am\r\n\r\nSo you&#039;re saying that if I, later in the game playing as a position and not being vicious or tilting the game for them and they request for a help and I don&#039;t want to participate with them I don&#039;t have to do their request for them, and lost their lane. Later on in game they&#039;re being negativity behavior towards me because of me not wanting to be the team. So after the game I get to report them for being toxic and I will get away from it just because I don&#039;t want to help with the teams. Am I correct?\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSanguineDogma\r\nOctober 10th 2018, 1:42:53 am\r\nHey again, T O P Senpai\r\nNo, that&#039;s not what I&#039;m saying. What I&#039;m saying is that our expectation is that each time you play League, you work together with your team and try and win the game in a way that is fun for everyone involved. Intentionally refusing to work with your teammates just because they&#039;re being rude like this isn&#039;t what we want to be seeing. League of Legends is a team game! You need a full team in order to win.\r\nIf you have any new questions or concerns, let me know. Otherwise, I will be closing this ticket out soon.\r\n\r\nSanguineDogma\r\nPlayer Behavior Agent\r\nZaun Alley-Dweller\r\n&quot;I licked this bolt for you!&quot;\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nT O P Senpai\r\nOctober 10th 2018, 2:49:55 pm\r\n\r\nSo then why ban the people who&#039;s being toxic in Chat-Box only. Why not the other player that causing the game to be lost. There&#039;s a cause and effect, you learn that in school. Don&#039;t you? Everyone did. But why can&#039;t you guys does it. Instead of banning people in Chat- Box only, why not ban the other who cause it too then? I don&#039;t understand why only the player that are being toxic in Chat-Box only. I understand that you guys are in busy schedule but this is a major issue. There&#039;s is a lot of people who&#039;s been in this situation but yet why don&#039;t guys find some time to fix this judgement when this is not equal. There&#039;s a lot of people that who just wanted to be toxic for no reason and just being bully, but in this situation right now. It is not even close to this category where people just wanted to be toxic for no reason. On the other hand when there&#039;s people who just wanted to be intentionally feeding in game. They deserve to be ban but most of them gets away with it. So why not bring this situation equally then.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2018-10-10T19:47:51.420+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, you shouldn't have flamed him and you definitely shouldn't have used that language.","replies":[{"poster":"T O P Senpai","date":"2018-10-10T20:00:20.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"So you're saying it is okay for the person to troll and ruin the game and don't get ban for it but it is not okay when you're being toxic?
