I verbally abused another player and griefed my team. I deserved the ban and it has been upheld for a few years now. This kind of behavior is toxic and abusive towards other players and I know better than to behave like that. RIOT: If you uplift the permaban on my account it would mean a lot to me to be able to play on this account again with a reformed attitude.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2019-08-26T23:37:49.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Permanent is forever.
