Creating a thread on his behalf is a little naive. You honestly do not know one way or another if your friend was cheating. You should of let him do something (like contact riot), if he was innocent.\n\nAlso a d5 should know what scripting is. Hell anyone that does any amount of pc gaming knows what a script is.
