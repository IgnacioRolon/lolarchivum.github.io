I believe you mixed that up with a different thing that released with 5.1.\n\nThe void gate can be destroyed. Voidspawn will only barrage your turrets for 150 seconds if you can't kill that.\nThe voidspawn also lose health over time. If they manage to take a tower, usually they won't be able to take another tower. Very risky positioning of the void gate does allow it to take multiple towers but it's very easy for the enemy to access in those cases (like placing it between two enemy towers).","replies":[{"poster":"Hexnacaius","date":"2015-02-08T06:05:58.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if they, say in a game I recently had, have four people using them, they would plant it, wave clear, and keep us away from the voidlings and portal while the portals decimated our towers and inhibs","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-02-09T19:24:49.587+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"They invested a lot of gold into non-offensive stats for that.\nThe voidspawn ignore champions.

This reminds me very strongly of when teams would stack Promote or Fortify, which you guys removed. I love when there are nonstandard things a team can do to win, but I've kind of just come to assume that whenever anything other than \"win teamfight then push\" or \"sneak baron then push\" becomes viable, then it'll get patched out soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Reinboom","date":"2015-02-11T19:16:40.439+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I don't **plan** on nerfing it.\n\nThe balance of Zz'Rot Portal and the *perception* of the balance of Zz'Rot Portal is tricky.
