His kit is way too overloaded and he is somehow allowed to be one of the strongest champions in every single phase of the god damn game. He's a giant lane bully, a great mid game fighter, and a late game hyper carry. There's simply no falling off for the guy. \n\nAlso for a champion that's supposedly designed to be very hard to pick up, Yasuo has too many safety nets and training wheels. Ultimate putting you outside tower range. Passive shield. Wind wall. Tornadoes recharging in 5 seconds if you miss them. \n\nIn addition, CC isn't too effective against him due to his wind wall and high mobility and camping him in the early game doesn't work either since no matter how far you put him behind, as soon as he hits 2 items he'll be shredding through your entire team thanks to conqueror and his passive.\n\nHe's had one of the highest ban rates in the game for the last 4 years now and no one really likes playing against him. \n\nSo please just do something. To summarize, his kit is overloaded and he has too many safety nets for a supposedly high learning curve champion. \n\n\" Bullshit aside Yasuo is a broken champion. People say he's a high skillcap champion, but the secret with Yasuo is knowing how to control yourself while playing such a overpowered champion. Yasuo's weakness comes from the fact that he is too strong. His laning phase is so strong that after the laning phase people do not know how to keep calm and throw the game. \"\n\n- Dopa Apdo\n\n\nEdit: Removed ending note because new infinity edge on Yasuo doesn't work like how I thought it would.\n\nEdit 2: Please, if you're going to disagree with me, at least use decent counter arguments instead of just insulting me or saying I don't deserve to talk based on my rank. If you truly believe I don't deserve to talk based on my rank then as a higher elo player, feel free to refute me. You must have a good counter argument right? As due to being a higher elo player you automatically know more than me when it comes to game balance.","replies":[{"poster":"ThePikol","date":"2018-05-10T10:34:04.548+0000","up_votes":93,"down_votes":9,"body":"You know why Yasuo is so stong?

I'm sorry straight bullshit this allows Yasuo to reach his power spike with two items. \nDOES NO ELSE REALIZE CRIT ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL DAMAGES IN THE GAME, \nthe same mechanic that Riot makes sure adc's can not get till late game because of just how strong it is should not be able to just be given away for free.\"\n\n\"This is a huge problem because even if you shut him down in lane it doesn't matter he just needs 2 items and he is just a strong as most champions with 3 or 4.\"\n\n\"It makes you feel so bad to realize wow I shut him down and made him fall so far behind but since he gets double crit and 50% armor shred (That's right 50% armor shred from his ult for 15 seconds that's more than adc's get from Last Whisper items.) from he ult he will still do crazy damage. \nThis begs the question what is even the point of shutting him down if it doesn't do anything? Ever other hyper carry champ is gated by needing a huge amount of gold and multiple items (Vayne, Kog, Twitch, Jax, Fiora etc) but not Yasuo he's get a free shortcut like were playing CandyLand over here because of passive that simple breaks item balance in the game.\"\n\n**This about his Q:**\n\n\"I'm going to be honest here this ability isn't really an issue.\"\n\n**About his W Windwal:**\n\n\"If this is thrown down in a teamfight the other team can not do anything.\"\n\"...this ability stop's champions ultimate's (were talking champions whose kit's are balanced around there ult get fucked by one ability people like Rumble(yeah it stop's his ult) is a perfect example, sej ult, varus ult etc etc) just about anything from going through it, this ability single handily negates the adc existing in the game,...\"\n\"Yasuo's Windwall takes away whole champions kit's,...\"\n\n**His E Sweeping Blade:**\n\n\"So minions are in every lane where Yasuo is played and this ability allows Yasuo to just dash around like Disney on Ice when they are present. 6 minions show up congrats Yasuo now has 6 dash's.\"\n\"This ability is a pain in the ass because there is also no clarity on it. \nYou can't see the little cool down circle on the minion's only he can. \nHow does Riot expect anyone let alone low elo players to remember which minions he dashed to first and keep 6 mental timers going, while having to look at the mini map and last hitting etc.\"\n\n\"But wait there's more here each dash gives more damage to the next one, and guess where people try to stand behind in lane that's right there minions (who would have guessed this /s) So now it does even more to you because on his way to hit you with that drive by E it's like he picked up hollow point rounds just getting a little more free damage on you. Oh and the free passive shield gets to charge up every time he E's because he's moving so this is even more of hidden benefit to the ability.\"\n\n\n**And His Ultimate Last Breath:**\n\n\"So again this ultimate has some good balance but one really stupid extra passive. This ultimate is gated by needing a knockup, so he either needs to stack his Q 3 times or somebody on his team needs to knock them up.\"\n\"What isn't ok is the passive armor shred for 15 seconds after using it.\"\n\nI recommend you to read it all on reddit.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheGreatNinx","date":"2018-05-10T20:47:50.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Note to the OP:  Two it isn't that good anymore. 40% damage of that damge is true  135 (since it needs two Zeals items now) ad.

And you have to take into account many people ban him so he does not end up in THEIR team. He is not very strong early by any stretch of the imagination, and he is garbage whole game vs any armor stacking champion or any bruiser and most control mages (control not burst) and he gets oneshot by adcs lategame anyway. He is terrible at 5v5 too. And whenever he uses a W he will 80% die in the lane because the jungler has so long to punish it. As an added negative to him, he can only be picked after you see the enemy's pick because even a braindead person can destroy yasuo if he just picks malphite or rammus or azir or viktor and so on. So the cases where he even has a chance to win are very very slim.","replies":[{"poster":"Vizulix","date":"2018-05-10T22:18:04.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK I was wrong about the high part since my brain derped when you said diamond+ and I read it as high diamond.\n\nBut yeah a few people might ban him to stop their team mates from picking him but at best this'd account for maybe 1% of his ban rate since he's generally seen as a decent-op champion. Like people banning Yasuo to stop him from getting picked by their team mates does not seem like a widespread phenomenon.\n\nYasuo is definitely very strong as a lane bully and is not countered by control mages because windwall and his e.\n\nHe is not completely rendered irrelevant against armor stacking champions because of Conquerors 20% true damage and the armor shred from his ultimate.\n\nHe does get killed in four seconds by the enemy adc, but thats how ADC's work in the late game.

He generally always has at least 2 shields (passive and {{item:3072}}) , and on top of that, {{item:3046}} reduces opponents' abilities to reduce chip through those shields.\n\nHis passive, RESOLVE: Yasuo generates a Flow stack for every 59 / 52 / 46 units he travels by any means. At 「 100 stacks 」 and upon taking champion or monster damage, Yasuo consumes all Flow to shield himself for 100 - 510 (based on level) for up to 1 second.\n\n..... Charges so fast he can use it 2-3 times per skirmish, and while players are chipping through it, his {{item:3072}} shield is charging.\n\nAnd then vs Mages..... of whom are his primary counters, he also has Nullifying Orb and {{item:3156}} , which at low life even puts him up to 30% Life steal, and offers 1-2 more MAGIC damage shields.\n\nI even had a Yasuo take {{item:3190}} the other day for ANOTHER shield, because his core 3 items, {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3046}} .... are just all he needs with his current Q and E cooldown scalings...... \n\nHe doesn't even need to build CDR items..... What other champ in the game gets 1.33 second spams that reset auto attacks, without CDR?\n\nLet me put it this way: \n\nI can SOLO the current Baron with Yasuo without taking a SINGLE point of damage, because I can Shield my way through the entire fight.\n\nAnd it's not just Yasuo...... \n\n{{item:3072}} is why {{champion:222}} and a few other adcs are just unkillable but kill YOU when they trip their special features. When excited, it's almost impossible to exist in Jinx's range when she has a {{item:3072}} , because she's putting out 900 damage per hit, healing up about 400-500 per hit, and most of that is OVERHEALING into a reserve, so people rarely even dip into her HP.\n\nIf Riot nerfed the on hit shield access, or Yasuo's own shield, he'd be far more manageable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2018-05-10T14:20:57.002+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":14,"body":"The main reason i hate posts like these are the plain: \"He is overloaded rework him\" You can replace Yasuo with any champion and the outcome is the same.

Instead of watching videos about how to deal with yasuo. Or play yasuo themselves to find his weaknesses they would rather rant about him with their likes here.  You can never get through to them with logic because they do not care about that. They never self-criticize to see how the hell a weak as fk early champ actually killed them. Whenever I play top with jax/rene/olaf/darius i pray the enemy picks yasuo because its such an easy win. With darius especially it feels like you can just right click him go afk and come back to see an extra kill in your score. Not to mention Vi or trynda top lul xD\nFor mid just pick rammus/malphite/anivia/annie even god damn ziggs destroys him which should never happen since OMG WW SO OP.\nPS: I never play yasuo and never will, I am trash with him.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-05-10T16:33:53.709+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":"actually, it has less to do with learning yasuo's weaknesses, but more with that yasuo disrupts gameplay in unhealthy ways\n\nhe can negate abilities and auto attacks\n\nhe also scales quickly with his passive\n\neven if you beat the crud out of him, it doesn't change that he is STILL an annoying champion that can make that one \"play\" that stops what the other players have to offer\n\nAs the best way to put it, people enjoy playing the game against other players, not against the game itself\n\nfor example:  you have to hit yasuo with a basic attack to trip his passive, or else his shield will eat an ability almost entirely.

Or that after using WW he is vulnerable for a gazilion seconds. just saying stuff is not evidence. + The claim about the \"one play\" is ridiculous since yasuo is useless in a 5v5. One could also say that if you miss your Q you cant ulti.

His e should be changed to have some setup required, like only reset on kill or reset on auto. Im sad that brainlessly spamming e and smart uses of e have very little difference, which means you can play him poorly and not get punished.\nAlso missing q's isnt even a big deal most cases with how riot overtunes attack speed over the years.
