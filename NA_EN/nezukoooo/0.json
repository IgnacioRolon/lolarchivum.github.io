I try to change my password on my other account (because it doesn't work), but I can't because my yahoo email password isn't working. I click \"forgot password?\" and it brings me to the recovery email/number thing. I made this email a long time ago, so I don't remember the recover email's password (or the email got deleted??) and I don't have a recovery number. I know this might be the wrong place to be typing this discussion, but I just wanted to know from Riot to see if they can do anything about it. It's my fault anyways that my pass for my lol account doesn't work because of a dumb thing I did xd. If not, just let me know so I can stop worrying about it please &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-31T22:01:47.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broporo ooooon duty! {{summoner:31}} \n\nEven if you can't get into the e-mail that you used to create your League account, we can still get your password recovered. Reach out to us through our [**Account Recovery Form**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416), and we'll be able to go over everything for you there.\n\nBe sure to stay signed out when you fill out that form, and you'll be back on the Rift in no time ^_^!","replies":[{"poster":"nezukoooo","date":"2017-04-01T04:23:11.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! but my friend actually helped me out getting my yahoo email to work so now I have my acc back!
