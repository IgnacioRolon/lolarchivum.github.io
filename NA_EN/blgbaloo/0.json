The ticket will be forwarded to the appropriate department. There will be an option to attach a document at the bottom of the ticket, or you can upload the image to another site (such as imgur or gyazo) and link the image URL in the ticket. Don't put it on the boards, because that isn't allowed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-23T17:21:58.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with DTN that [submitting a ticket](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/osqw6G4M) would be the best option.
