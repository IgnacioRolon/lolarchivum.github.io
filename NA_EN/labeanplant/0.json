On top of being stuck you can't log back into league without restarting your computer of course. But by that time they've already re matched and I have gotten fucking 20 min leaver penalty que's. Every single time this happens after every patch. And I know i'm not the only one who has encountered this problem this has happened to many people. Here's another person adding onto the body count of people they have lost in the last few months. Game used to be great, sad to see it go down the shitter.","replies":[{"poster":"Labeanplant","date":"2016-07-29T15:17:19.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should go look around the forums and read the posts, you will see that it is obviously not a connection issue on our side. Its on your guys side. That guide is useless to me. I need you to remove all the leaverbuster penalty's you keep giving people for connection issues that are not their fault. But who am i kidding, we all know that's not gonna happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T15:36:11.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There doesn't t appear to be any server issues, and the connection issues guide should get you fixed up.  Leaverbuster treats all players equally because it causes others a negative experience regardless of intent, and cannot be removed without playing through the required games.  \n\nI'm happy to help if I can, but it's up to you to try them out.  Should you select not to, that's totally fine; however, please don't go into other posts where players are seeking help to spread misinformation.","replies":[{"poster":"Labeanplant","date":"2016-07-29T19:07:20.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we're seeking help and yet you keep pointing us to a connection guide that's asking us whats wrong WITH US CONNECTING TO YOU. WHEN ITS NOT US IS THE PROBLEM IT IS UR SERVERS THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I have to type in caps so maybe you'll actually read what i'm saying. I have already tried all your little connection guide tips and reinstalled uninstalled, repaired, linked to firewall, took it off fire wall, restarted internet yadda yadda. Its not a problem on my end its on your servers end. There is NUMEROUS posts linked to this problem. All you have to say Porocles is that you don't have a solution to the problem and you're sorry until they fix it and i will understand like a normal human being. But for you to keep directing people to a \"solution\" that you know doesn't solve the problem is just plain dumb. Trust me I fully understand \"Leaverbusters system of treating everyone fair\" more or less we dont wanna deal with peoples problems give it to a bot and ban everyone solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-29T20:31:07.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the detailed information; letting me know what you've tried and what didn't work helps!

It looks like a connection issue might be catching a snag and leaving you behind.  I recommend going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide, which will provide a series of steps to get this fixed up.
