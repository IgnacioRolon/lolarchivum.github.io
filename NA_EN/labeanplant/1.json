The only solutions to fixing it are i have to repair my launcher EVERY single time i open up the client, then it allows me to play. I don't want to have to do that. I have looked it up and read many articles. Nothing seems to work. \r\nThings I have tried:\r\n1. Restarting, obviously.\r\n2. It's not my Razer i have turned it off and tried still doesn't work.\r\n3. Repair launcher (works, but only for 1 time use.)\r\n4. No firewall problems\r\n5. I have went to my folder went through patches > rads > deleted all that shit on three different occasions and it still doesn't work.\r\nSo if anyone could find a solution for me that actually works that would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Labeanplant","date":"2016-12-13T16:02:42.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I deleted Lol_patcher and Lol_client, after doing so many things and it let me play but idk if its a one time use, will post again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-14T03:50:26.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to hear you resolved this for now.

Have you tried running League as admin? Simply right-click the shortcut and select *run as administrator*.\n\nLet me know if that caused any sort of change.","replies":[{"poster":"Labeanplant","date":"2016-12-17T06:53:30.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I have still not working. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-18T22:08:24.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll need to dive into some of your system logs to figure out what's going on.
