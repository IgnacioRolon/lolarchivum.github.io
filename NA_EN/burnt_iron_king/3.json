It's always good to see feedback from the community, so no worries about the number of threads going on. We'll offer some more insight when there's some more stuff to discuss. \n\nMost concrete thing we can say at present is that we will be nerfing Rylais regardless of what direction we go in. Wouldn't worry about it becoming a bigger damage item and therefore greater issue than it already is on some champs. Even if we did go for a non HP approach wouldn't expect it to gain offensive stats at all.","replies":[{"poster":"MistroTTC","date":"2016-10-11T00:37:55.016+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any plans to buff champions like {{champion:27}} {{champion:82}} and {{champion:136}} who have ryalis as core items?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-10-11T01:30:25.840+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally we want to adjust champions hit by item changes the patch after once we've had a chance to see how affected they've been (we've overbuff significantly in the past when trying to predict ahead of time). That'd probably be the case here, whatever the Rylai's changes are. Another possibility might be buffs to some of the other slow providing items that, for some Rylai's users at least, are reasonable alternatives or close to good choices (GLP especially, plus Randiun's or Dead Man's on some champs).","replies":[{"poster":"6Sfool","date":"2016-10-11T21:43:22.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel that rylais is core on some champs only because they should have natural slows in their kit.  You're the expert, but that's just my 2 cents.\nLast night I made a post suggesting a rework for Singed that would reduce the need for rylais.  I was hoping it would gain some popularity and you'd run into it browsing the forums, but it got buried fast since nobody wants to read a 3 page in-depth post.
