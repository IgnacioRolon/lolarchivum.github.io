Annoying, but good for the game, having an ADC that scales with AS instead of crit is a good step imo.  I'll admit, it's been ages since I went against a good Kalista, and I rarely play Singed / Volibear, beyond the point though.\n\nI'm starting to assume that for the most part, Riot tends to avoid suggestions pre-rework phase.  Similar circumstances happened with Cass, and I'll assume other champions before.  In turn, Cass did undergo numerous changes before this live version, and Mordekaiser did get a poor self casted W back.  Neither was everything the community wanted, but it was something.  \n\nQ was always impossible to use with his mobility.  It was mainly wave clear, or excess poke against melees.  It was incredibly rare for a ranged mid to be close enough to get splashed by the AOE.  The change seems more like a power shift then a nerf imo, but opinions.  I'll admit, I do enjoy the rework, more from the fact that he's more based around getting a ghost, and holding it, but dragons pretty cool as well.\n\nWin rates, statistics.  I love these things.  Which site do you use?  I know a lot of people lost faith in Champion.gg after their first mistake with Mordekaiser, and I kind of question if that has happened again.  But, assuming that they're accurate, mid mordekaiser has completely fallen off.  Now, I have to wonder why.  62% ban rate might be a cause, coupled with the assumption that he's only viable as a duo laner.  Still, I doubt that the playstyle completely fell off.  I'm not sure this is the best patch to look at statistics for honestly.  Riot made a statement somewhere that they believe Darius is fine, and want to wait out, so that people can play against him and realize that.  \n\nAgain, I'm getting off topic.  It's a shame you're on EUNE, and a lot of other people complaining about Morde aren't on NA.

The guys doing a tough job and taking some risks to make champs that aren't so cookie cutter. Sure they don't always work out but how about cutting him a little slack for mistakes due to taking risks. He could play it safe and crank out a bunch of Season 1 depth champs which would be much easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-09-23T17:40:55.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His champs NEVER work out. Also, you think hes the only one taking risks? Have you been living under a rock! Look at Tahm, look at Bard! Both are unique champions, are they broken like every CertainlyT champion ever made? NO!\n\nThere is a difference between taking a risk and then dealing with the consequences and taking a risk and not caring what will happen after (CertainlyT route).\n\nI still wonder why people defend this guy!
