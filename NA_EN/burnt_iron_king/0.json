Hybrid deck, from the days before Synchros existed, where man-eater bugs and trap holes reigned supreme. It focused extremely heavily on beatsticks and destroying enemy monsters. It ran all kinds of kill cards like Raigeki break, tribute to the doomed, Trap Hole, Fissure, etc.\nBack then, there wasn't a lot of spells or traps that could overcome the sheer field control.\n\n2. Burn deck. An absolutely satanic deck that used stuff like level limit area b, gravity bind, wave motion cannon and dark snake syndrome to burn off tons of lifepoints. It was also an old deck, and it lacked a lot of good cards that would make it better, but for the entire duration I had it, it was the most effective deck bar the next deck.\n\n3. Madolches.\n\nTiaramisu is absurd. She basically forces enemies to shuffle their entire field, spells, traps and monsters, back into their deck, two at a time. Madolches are already a swarm deck, so it doesn't take long to flood the field with multiple Tiaramisu while simultaneously removing all options opponents had left.\n\n4. My favorite online deck is definitely my Soviet Russia deck. Made in 2012, (apocalypse) it focuses and setting up Arcana Force XX1 - The World so that it would instantly win you the duel.\n\nThe effect was this: When summoned, flip a coin. If heads, you can tribute two monsters at your end phase to skip your opponent's turn. If tails, you add the top card of your opponent's grave to their hand every end phase.\n\nCombine it with cards like Gellenduo, (can't be destroyed by battle, counts as two tributes for the summon of light monsters ~ like the World) Aroma Pot, (can't be destroyed by battle, +500 LP every players' end phase) Reversal of Fate, (reverses coin flip result) and tons of spell/trap removal, (Malevolent Catastrophe, Emergency Provisions, Mystical Space Typhoon - Works great when combined with good goblin housekeeping) and finally Treeborn Frogs and Samsara Lotuses. (Can be special summoned during Standby/End Phase If you have no spell or traps) and it actually works a decent amount of the time.\n\n\n\nThe end result of a successful setup was this: You would continuously special summon Treeborn Frog/Samsara Lotus and tribute them for the World's effect, skipping your opponent's turn infinitely. It allows you to draw your entire deck without your opponent being allowed to react, until you drew all five pieces of Exodia and win.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-06-12T01:08:35.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you truly are satan for using a burn deck","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2016-06-12T00:34:42.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i ran a deck with light and dark monsters with dragons being a main theme to it.Also it focused on banishing monsters to summon them again.\n\n\nhttp://yugiohblog.konami.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/MegaDragonsFromSPAAAAACE.jpg\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/0/05/PhantomofChaos-BP01-EN-C-1E.png/revision/latest?cb=20120530134601\n\ni would summon lots of monsters to the field plus i had an anti Xyz monster \n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/b/b0/GalaxyEyesPhotonDragon-SP13-EN-C-1E.png/revision/latest?cb=20130510085126","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2016-06-12T00:34:32.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I 'tried' to have a dragon deck.

Throw out a dark magician (via skilled dark magician or magical dimension) for a quick & disposable 2500 ATK beatstick. This deck needed a bit of ramp-up time, so it fell behind rather quickly with the advent of \"pump out as many monsters as possible on your first turn\"-style meta (although a Kaiser Colosseum can quickly rectify that). \n- A deck that revolved around the use of \"SpellBook\" spell cards. Can do lots of funny things with it... you can get Hermit of Prophecy (start off at level 3, 1200 attack) can get to something like 2700-3300 (+1000 per spellbook of power, +100 per spellcounter on star-hall) ATK, level 13-17 (spellbooks of: secrets, masters, power, plus any 2-4 of tower, crescent-library, starhall, wisdom, depending on your luck with the crescent-library) in 1 turn.
