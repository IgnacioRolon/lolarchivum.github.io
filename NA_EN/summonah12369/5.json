Now in this game i didn&#039;t use an ADC build for him, but rather my jungle build and playing him in the ADC role. And at the end we finally won and i was so pleased with it. I don&#039;T know if i was just lucky or if this thing actually works. Basically you go Warwick in the ADC role obviously. The build is:\r\n\r\nTitanic Hydra\r\nMercurial Scimitar\r\nMercury&#039;s Treads\r\nDead Man&#039;s Plate\r\nSpirit Visage\r\nThornmail\r\n\r\nThis is mostly the build i use for mu jungle, but instead of Mercurial Scimitar on the Jungle role i use Skirmisher&#039;s Blade however, Riot doesn&#039;t let me use that in the ADC role so i use Mercurial Scimitar as an alternative. I suggest this build but if you have your own tanky build of Warwick then i guess that&#039;s fine too. I mostly recommend this if you are good with Warwick and are loosing allot. Not to ruin other peoples&#039; games, but rather to ya know have a good game.\r\n\r\nTry doing this if you&#039;re on a loosing streak and are trying to find something to fix it. Make sure you are aware of how Warwick works and what adc is.\r\n\r\nI also go with Flash and Heal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso this was re-posted due to being removed from being in the wrong section, i wasnt sure which section to put it in.","replies":[]}
