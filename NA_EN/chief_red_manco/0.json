Takes like repeated attempts at re-connection to get into game or even doesn't connect sometimes. Haven't played in two weeks because of this issue. I reinstalled, disabled peer to peer as recommended by other users with this problem but to no avail. Any tips would be very much appreciated....so annoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-27T03:01:51.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting d/c'd in champ select there's a good chance it's just some weird hiccup in your network connection. Check out our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) but pay extra attention to the steps on port forwarding and how to configure your DNS settings. Those two typically help people get a more solid/stable connection.","replies":[]}]}
