Something about making me do small patch.\n\nUpon logging in this morning I saw I was incurred a loss (naturally, I mean I was the leaver) but that I was also demoted. I don't believe this is entirely fair as I couldn't control it, it was not my internet, computer, etc. I have never had an issue with new client to date, besides last night.\n\nIs there anything to do about this or do I just have to tough it up and try getting promoted again? Trying to be civil here instead of berating all the devs like some of the client related posts. Things/bugs/crashes happen, no reason to flip out at the people who supply us with a good game, but i'm relatively demoralized and would appreciate some light on the matter.\n\nThanks for any help.

While we can't do much about leaverbusters or lost LP here on the boards, I'm more than happy to help you try and figure out the main reason it happened so that it hopefully doesn't happen again. \n\nIt kind of sounds like your client noticed some damaged files during the game, and when it crashed the patcher realized it wouldn't be able to run properly on the current patch. The patcher then tried to download the patch again to make sure that you had a stable build of the current patch. You should be good to go as long as the patcher was able to get a clean update, but let's make sure by using our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to run a force repatch just in case.","replies":[]}]}
