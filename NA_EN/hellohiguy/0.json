Previously i had anywhere from 160fps to 200-300 some fps and can run most if not all games on max graphical settings however this is were i believe my story differs from most others, when im in game in league i DO actually get the 160 fps even in team fights and then for some reason i get very rapid fluctuating fps drop. Sometimes the fps counter in the top right doesn't show the fps fluctuating and other times it shows my fps going rapidly up and down from 160 to as low as 1-2 frames screen stutters included. This issue appears to be irritated by something unknown to me because it will do it for either a few seconds or up to a few minutes and then revert to the steady 160fps, Additional i HAVE noticed this behavior in a few other games including Star Wars: The Old Republic and Hearthstone but ive also noticed having zero issues in my 1-5 hour sit downs with Diablo III when my friends started playing that yet i cant go through a 20-30 min game of league with-ought it happening.\n\nSpecs: \nProcessor: Intel Core i7-6700 @3.4ghz\nRam: 16 GB\nVideo Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070\nand not that it matters but i get around 70 ms \n\nalso maybe worth noting my drivers are up to date and when the fps issues occurred i did open, Open Recourse Monitor to see if anything stood out, granted i didn't know what i was looking for but all lvl's seemed normal\nand sorry if this issue isn't 100% a league thing i just need some help. \nThank you for your {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-21T04:55:05.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds to me like you're probably having issues with packet loss. Test for that really quickly by running a quick traceroute to the NA servers (104.160.131.1) using something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).

There definitely not any packet loss going on from that trace which is good (since it can be rather hard to fix), but we still need to dig a little deeper to see what's happening. I want you to generate some game logs with the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and send those over to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
