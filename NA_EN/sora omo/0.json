I don't think Twisted Treeline was even being played until it turned out to be a perfect way to farm levels. Riot are you going to remove Twisted Treeline for URF or Clash, either way, I didn't play it so I don't care what happens to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-11T23:37:16.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmmm I haven't personally heard anything about TT being removed entirely, it may have just been swapped out to help test the clash feature. I'd be sure to ask this over on the PBE boards for sure though!","replies":[]}]}
