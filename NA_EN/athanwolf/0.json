Can’t call him a support because he is not a support at all. This player bring nothing to the adc and passive is useless for the adc because it only work on him. Riot please do something so other person would get troll like this and plz give some feedback on how to stop this, MAYBE something like just STOP PLAYING the game will help me don’t you think? Cause you will lost customer like me. {{champion:80}} was the support in this match.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-15T02:23:55.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's always a chance that player might have just been trying something new out, but if you ever suspect someone of botting you can always smash that report button in the post-game lobby.
