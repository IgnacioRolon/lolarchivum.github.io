That worked (hurray), and now in-game I play with 60-80 FPS and 15-30 Ping, nothing too crazy right? After a few games this annoying problem started to happen, in champion select everything is fine, the loadingscreen is fine too but whenever the game starts my laptop just completely freezes and won't react to anything at all.\r\n\r\nSo I restart my laptop and launch LoL again and afterwards when I join the game again I can just play and nothing happends. I usually miss 0-3 CS and none or a little experience so it's annoying and I have no idea what is causing it.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done:\r\nRed a lot of forums but that suggest repairing your laptop/pc, which I did,\r\nRepair LoL and the patcher, which I did,\r\nClean your ventilation because overheating causes it too, but my laptop has never overheated because I have a special \"Ice Cool\" system of Asus which prevents that. \r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions what it is, please let me know. It's driving me insane.

Disable the [Xbox Game Bar ](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) to get that fixed.  I also recommend taking some additional measures as well since you have a fresh OS, like updating all of your drivers.  I suggest using our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide for a list of steps to tune-up your PC.
