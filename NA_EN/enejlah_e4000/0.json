I hope Riot adds multiplayer to the practice tool, even if its just 2 players. The ability to practice a specific match up at a certain time of the game would be invaluable for us who want to learn match ups and get better.\n\nSay If my Brand Vs Velkoz game was actually making me pull out my hair, a friend of mine could play the practice tool with me and PRACTICE that match up.  We could play against each other, but when it got to level six, we could set the level to 6 and have it not change, so we were lv 6 forever, just practicing vs each other, dodging skill shots, learning attack patterns and movements in a 'controlled environment' where we didn't have to worry about anyone else in the game. No junglers or bottom laners, and didn't have to go through the entire game and start a new one to practice levels 1-5 again.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-06T01:58:34.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your points are definitely valid and I can see a lot of players finding use out of something like what you describe, however that's just not how the practice tool is designed. It's fine to think it could be better, but we in Help &amp; Support aren't Devs. We can't fix something that is working the way it's meant to, and we can't make game design changes. \n\nSince you feel so strongly about this, I'd highly suggest posting this idea about the practice tool over in Client Discussion or General Discussion to get the Devs attention and see what other players think of your suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"enejlah e4000","date":"2017-11-21T17:53:12.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
