I have my fingers crossed that a Red will take notice which is why I need YOU, my fellow players, to bump the hell out of it.\n\nAlmost every single issue in this game (excluding balance, items being removed, changed, added, champs being 'renovated' etc) comes down to one very large problem: Assholes.\n\nEvery game has assholes, trolls, intentional feeders, and people who go out of their way to ruin the experience of others. This isn't an issue exclusive to League of Legends. Every MOBA has this problem, it comes with the territory. Games take a lot longer to play than a 5-10 minute COD match or a 10-15 minute Battlefield match. The longest game I've ever played in league (back in season 3 or 4) was over an hour and a half long. The longest match I've played in DOTA 2 was close to 2 hours and 45 minutes. But I digress. The time factor and often the anxiety/stress felt towards the ranked system by players who desperately want their promos to go well and end up demoted again and again appeals directly to the troll's instincts to ruin a good time. I don't think I need to go any more in depth with the psychology of trolls but suffice it to say... League and games like League attract trolls like moths to a flame.\n\nThe current system does nothing, really, but I'm not suggesting a replacement for the current system. Currently, the system punishes people for \"toxicity\", and while I disagree with this, and have no problem with a bit of banter in an online game, I understand where Riot is coming from and why this is an important issue for them.\n\nWhat I've been thinking about is a way to make the system even better and more effective, particularly for people who exclusively play ranked matchmaking.\n\nAs I've mentioned. Trolls and assholes flock to games like League of Legends, and lets be honest with ourselves and each other, prolonged exposure to games like League of Legends and Dota 2 can turn once decent players into trolls and assholes out of sheer frustration. I don't agree with this, but I've seen it happen time and again both with randoms and with friends who \"snap\" and start feeding or trolling or playing like an asshole to \"punish\" other people for their previous suffering, I won't ramble on about the behavioural psychology behind this, but 99.9% of people have the capacity to \"snap\" and stop thinking rationally. The rational thing to do is to turn the game off and play again the next day and many people can do this, other people hit their breaking point and \"snap\" and take, in their minds, revenge on players. This is a fact of life we all have to deal with and the current system does not really punish this behaviour.\n\n#2 THE IDEA\n\nThis is why I propose augmenting the punishment system and changing certain elements of it. As it currently stands the punishment system operates like this:\n\n    >First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n    >Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n    >Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n    >Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n    >https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2\n\nAnd that's all well and fine for consistently \"toxic\" players who scream slurs and insults.\n\nWhat about feeders? Trolls? Assholes? What happens to them? Is a 10 or 25 game chat ban going to effectively curb a feeder's behaviour? Of course not, they will be in the next queue ready to troll your ranked match into the dirt and cause you yet another loss. What can be done with them? Low priority and reform pools. I do not believe that people should be banned for having a bad day. For intentional feeding, trolling and being an asshole there should be a second tier of punishments. For example.\n\n    First Offense: 5 low priority reform pool WINS\n    Second Offense: 10 low priority reform pool WINS\n    Third Offense: 25 low priority reform pool WINS\n\nWhat would this\"Low Priority\" game be? Simple, the matchmaking system would prioritize their account LAST, maybe it takes 3-5 minutes to find a game.\n\nWhat is this \"reform pool\" about? Simple. The players account is flagged and ranked matchmaking, SR normal blind pick, normal draft, ARAM, etc are all locked except for normal blind-pick twisted treeline. Ideally the system would force people to play against other people with the reform flag unless there are none who can be found after 5-10 minutes.\n\n#3 HOW THIS HELPS\n\nThis is the perfect system for everyone, even those being punished.\n\nSay, for example, someone is having a bad day and they choose to take their frustrations out on the player base. This person would be removed from ranked matchmaking and lose the ability to play and ruin other people's gaming experience. Second, it protects the player being punished from being banned as I believe it's only fair that players in the punishment pool lose the ability to report other players and to be reported. Let them scream at each other in the containment zone. In fact, not only is it preferable that players lose the ability to report other players who are also being reformed, it's necessary that the reform pool be as toxic and awful as possible. The idea is to make genuine players who simply had a bad time feel like they NEVER want to end up back there again. They will reform themselves or their next stay in the reform pool will require even more wins, prolonging their punishment.\n\nSecondly; this will isolate people who have no intention of playing seriously in ranked. As an aside, trolls, intentional feeders, bots and assholes will lose interest in trolling and ruining the game. Some might just make a new account to bypass the punishment but obviously this second account would be ineligible for ranked matchmaking until level 30 and therefore would have zero impact on players who want to play the game seriously.\n\nMost MOBA games have a system like this in place. Dota 2 forces players to win random draft games where you can choose between 3 randomly selected heroes and every other game mode is locked. I believe this will be equally effective in league of legends.\n\nIf you've read this post and agree with it, please upvote so Riot might take notice","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-06-10T00:34:19.316+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">What about feeders?

It's just harder to detect with machines, so it happens less often and is therefore less visible.\n\nThe rest of your argument has been suggested many, many times before. One of the core problems with it is that it rests on a perceived value to ranked play that is probably not what you think it is. Ranked participation is actually less than 50% of the active player base, at least according to the numbers I heard a couple years ago.\n\nAlso, by locking them into blind pick TT, you are not only creating a \"prisoner's island\", which is something Riot has long been dead set against, but you're also ruining that format for people who actually enjoy TT.","replies":[{"poster":"CarpeConundrum","date":"2019-06-10T02:12:38.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ulanopo,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YMJw1ErU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-10T00:34:19.316+0000)\n>\n> Intentional feeding starts at an escalated 14-day suspension.

I haven't put any emphasis or value on ranked anymore so than what should be placed on actual competitive game modes.  The reason I've singled out ranked more than other queues is because in normal blind/normal draft you don't potentially slide into a lower bracket if you lose a key game.  \n\nYou're right, it's purely anecdotal, however you do have to ask yourself; \"Why does it seem to be that league, above any other MOBA or MOBA style game, suffers from these problems and why do these problems seem less prevalent in other more accessible games?\"  \n\nCSGO is arguably an action MOBA, it's certainly not a classical FPS.  It's not COD and any pro player will tell you that.  CSGO has voice chat enabled by default.  Yet it's maybe one in 100 games I hear someone with an audio bot or someone say something horrifically racist.  People largely take ranked matchmaking seriously, even in wood tier, silver 1, people don't troll the mic, because the game will lock you out of ranked mode for being a tit.\n\nSimilarly with Dota 2.  As I've described in the OP.  There's a system in place to punish intentional feeders and trolls by placing by locking every game mode besides random draft.\n\nI've never played overwatch or fortnite (thankfully) so I don't know how their systems work and given the number of 12 year olds on fortnite I can only assume it's a raging hell hole of squeeks.\n\nI wouldn't call it a prisoner's island.  It doesn't function this way in any of the games I've played and have described.  It's literally just locking you out of some queues until you've shown you're willing to play seriously and take the game seriously.  \n\nYes; this is an anecdote, I've logged 1200 hours on Dota 2 and I've only been in the punishment pool once because I never ever wanted to go back into it.  \n\nI would rather have good players who go on a losing streak and get reported one too many times have a way to earn their privileges back rather than have everyone, troll and unfortunate tilter alike, simply wait 14 days and learn nothing from the experience.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-10T05:00:11.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CarpeConundrum,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=YMJw1ErU,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-06-10T02:12:38.270+0000)\n>\n> I wouldn't call it a prisoner's island.

Nobody's motivations for playing any game mode are more important than anyone else's motivations, and Riot isn't going to make it more difficult for people who are playing for fun and playing to win, vs. those who take ranked \"seriously,\" which usually means (to me) that this person has declared themselves leader of the team and spends the whole game shotcalling and annoying everyone.\n\n> not only is it preferable that players lose the ability to report other players who are also being reformed\n\nJust because someone was punished doesn't mean they shouldn't be able to report others.\n\n> it's necessary that the reform pool be as toxic and awful as possible\n\nThis is prisoner's island, and Riot is vehemently against it.

And, if memory serves, the community was a lot cleaner then too.  I did really well in seasons 1-3 on my original account, season 4 was pretty good too, and then around season 5-6 the community really started to wane.

This person would be removed from ranked matchmaking and lose the ability to play and ruin other people's gaming experience. Second, it protects the player being punished from being banned as I believe it's only fair that players in the punishment pool lose the ability to report other players and to be reported. Let them scream at each other in the containment zone. In fact, not only is it preferable that players lose the ability to report other players who are also being reformed, it's necessary that the reform pool be as toxic and awful as possible. The idea is to make genuine players who simply had a bad time feel like they NEVER want to end up back there again. They will reform themselves or their next stay in the reform pool will require even more wins, prolonging their punishment.\n\nThe perfect system for players who repeatedly and/or egregiously break the rules of behavior is a permaban, because that's what better for the 99.994% of players who don't get permabanned. There is absolutely no need to protect toxic players or spend any kind of resources on accommodating them in any way.\n\nBriefly: no.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CarpeConundrum","date":"2019-06-10T05:29:58.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Everyone here is being contrarian without offering an alternative idea.  I think we can all agree here that the system is flawed when there's a troll or feeder in more games than isn't.  \n\nIf my idea is bad, and you're just going to mindlessly repeat \"riot said XYZ therefore it's bad\" then what's a better solution.  Frankly, I think Riot is wrong.  This system works in every game that has implemented it.  Ask yourself this.  Why *doesn't* riot want to segregate trolls and feeders from decent, serious players?  Why *doesn't* riot want a \"prisoners island\"?   The only answer I can come to is \"money and numbers\",  it has nothing to do with creating a supportive, positive community of gamers who are dedicated to a company and their product,  if Riot cared at all about that then they would definitely have a system in place to clean up the literal bots, the intentional feeders, the trolls and everything in between that contributes to a negative playing experience,  if that means segregating them for the sake of the positive, good, honourable players then so be it.   Hell, I wouldn't even be complaining if honour factored into matchmaking instead of essentially being a cosmetic for dick measuring.\n\nAt the end of the day, every system has a downside.  Anyone who has ever micromanaged a small group, or operated an IRC/discord channel/website/forum/etc  knows that you can't please 100% of people and there will always be a few who try to find loopholes/exploit the system.
