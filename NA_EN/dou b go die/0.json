Others have suggested some kind of pool toy for the weapon, but I think there's a lot of possibility for a skin like this. \n\nAs you've seen with several lines - most recently Pool Party - we don't limit ourselves to five champions (team comp), which means, just because it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it's off the table for the future. :]","replies":[{"poster":"terkmc","date":"2015-06-11T22:23:03.946+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"We are still waiting for that Brorelia skin :|","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-06-12T02:16:31.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"No.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-06-11T20:08:49.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hijacking topic for a second, but what do you think about a Keyblade Irelia skin?
