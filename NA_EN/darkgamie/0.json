We can only remake if they  never connect to the game to began with for us to vote for a remake. So if a level 1 person connected after 5 minutes they will help the quality of the game? I dont see why we cant vote for a remake when we clearly have a level 1 player still in the fountain at 5 minutes into the game. I been playing countless game like this where i have a level 1 player in the fountain with 0 cs at 5 mins and cant vote for a remake and force to either open mid or wait until 20 minutes to ff. Something need to be done about this remake system with afk players.","replies":[{"poster":"Chibi Deviljho","date":"2016-10-28T03:29:59.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm under the impression that they have to be disconnected for 90 seconds of the first 180 seconds of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkGamie","date":"2016-10-28T03:51:13.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope  as long they are connected to the game you cant not vote to remake. For example if they never connected in the loading screen then you can remake. But if you connected and buy items then go afk you cant vote to remake.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T20:32:06.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is incorrect. A player doesn't have to be completely disconnected in order to trigger a Remake. If a player is marked *inactive* for 90+ seconds within the first 3 minutes of the game, the remake will become available at 3:00. If they aren't inactive long enough to become marked, or if they go AFK later in the match after the 3:00 mark, a remake will not be available.\n\nCheck out our [/Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details, let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
