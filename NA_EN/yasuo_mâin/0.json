\r\nYasuo Mâin: im recording it so ya know i can go back \r\nYasuo Mâin: lol \r\nYasuo Mâin: verbally assualy \r\nYasuo Mâin: assault \r\nYasuo Mâin: lol \r\nYasuo Mâin: do \r\nYasuo Mâin: you make tickets on people you think are toxic \r\nYasuo Mâin: feelsbadforriot \r\nYasuo Mâin: spamming? \r\nYasuo Mâin: yasuo \r\nYasuo Mâin: mute \r\nYasuo Mâin: you're not supposed to make tickets \r\nYasuo Mâin: you're supposed to report and let the system take care of it \r\nYasuo Mâin: ashe ok\r\n\r\nThroughout these matches I avoided being toxic at all costs. \r\nIn the first game I got joined with a diamond and a few of his friends I was pretty sure that I got mid so I told him I had mid, he got super mad and started flaming me calling me trash and that i needed to kms. I wasn't toxic to him at all I just kept telling him that I would be reporting him after the game. Somehow i was the one punished for that match even through I didn't think that punishments were determined by how many reports you get (they were in a team) instead of toxicity. \r\nIn the second game I was queued with a trist and someone else but the ashe that went bot with trist seemed relatively new to the game and was still learning the ropes. Trist decided that ashe was to much and he couldn't handle bot so he came top (I have no problem with that). Until trist started to flame ashe in which case I told her that toxicity is a sign of a bad player not offensive but just a toxic player in general. Trist didn't like the idea of me calling her toxic so she proceeded to say \"I'll show you toxic\" and she started running to top lane to run under tower and int throughout the game. I thought this game was no big deal because Trist said in chat that the account she was currently on was a troll account and she used it to troll people. Immediate red flag. Not sure how I was toxic in the first game but in the second one I was passive aggressive because i didn't feel that trist picking on the new player was beneficial to the new players (ashe) experience in the game. \r\n\r\n(The TF got no punishments probably cause he's diamond)\r\n(Not sure about trist)\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain how I was being 'toxic' compared to calling someone trash and running down mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-25T23:52:33.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanted the hard details, I'd suggest hitting up the player behavior agents in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), but my personal opinion on these chat logs?\n\nIt looks like you were using the chat quite a lot simply to argue or belittle others, whether they were teammates or not.
