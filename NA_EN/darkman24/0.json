My only issue is the IP and RP values are hard to see when specific pictures are put into the picture rotation. The imgur link shows a specific picture that caused, at least me, to have a hard time seeing those values.  I like and understand the idea of having the picture throughout the entire client screen. It looks very seamless. However, when you create something like that, having icons or some form of data (IP and RP values) within that, you have to take being able to see them to mind.\r\n\r\nPossible Solutions:\r\nOutline the white font with black or vice versa\r\nDon&#039;t have the IP and RP values in the client ribbon\r\nCreate a different background for those areas\r\nDon&#039;t have a seamless picture throughout the top portion of the client\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts. What does everyone think?\r\n\r\nlink here also:[](http://imgur.com/RNpicwf)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-11-09T04:26:29.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We already did some adjustments related to this,  check them out with the next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkman24","date":"2016-11-11T15:03:50.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"great!","replies":[]}]}]}
