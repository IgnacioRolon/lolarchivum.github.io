Riot said that they'd like to make sure that they get it right (and rightfully so, it'd be a damn shame if the new system let toxic players off the hook, or even worse punished people who occasionally blow up in an extremely toxic game) but since then, I haven't seen any word about it. I'm not even certain if they plan to bring it back at all, maybe the new Tribunal IS automated punishments? I just think it'd be nice to get an update about how the reconstruction's going, if we can expect to see the Tribunal again in S5, what the main changes would be, etc etc.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-16T03:09:51.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lyte actually commented on the status of the Tribunal [in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2pdinq/if_the_tribunal_is_down_where_exactly_are_our/cmvwnm8).","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2014-12-16T03:12:54.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"RiotSweet also posted a thread with the reply on the boards about it, if you should prefer that over reddit.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/majPomTZ-where-are-tribunal-reports-going","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-16T03:13:53.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Siachi,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=rkWahFrx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-16T03:12:54.366+0000)\n>\n> RiotSweet also posted a thread with the reply on the boards about it, if you should prefer that over reddit.\n> \n> http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/majPomTZ-where-are-tribunal-reports-going\n\nGood catch!

At least in the old system toxic players actually were banned.  Where in the new system they aren't, at all.  Because if they were, 50% of games wouldn't involve toxic players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"alaskaneagle","date":"2014-12-16T20:37:12.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"54367\n\nThat would be to bad but letting off the hard core toxic people and punishing the ones who had a bad day (despite lyte or morrello saying they wouldn't).\n\nI've been around to long to think riot is actually going to do much more than talk big for a bit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tribal 21","date":"2014-12-16T08:57:39.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to use the tribunal ;_;......","replies":[]}]}
