{"poster":"Riot KenAdamsNSA","date":"2019-01-12T01:36:57.723+0000","title":"Update on Yesterday's Capsule Pricing Error","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n\nYesterday an error in League's in-game store briefly made some expensive content available for Blue Essence. We want to explain a little more about what happened and how we'll prevent similar errors in the future.\n\n**What happened?**\n\nAt 10AM PT on January 10th, the new Blood Moon capsules and Prestige Points went on sale. Because of a configuration error that resulted in PBE content making it to Live, you could purchase individual Prestige Points as well as individual Blood Moon capsules for just 1 BE apiece. \n\nThe error was live on the store for 14 minutes. During that time, a few thousand players across all regions were able to take advantage of the situation and buy both Blood Moon capsules and Prestige Points using BE. In many regions, fewer than 100 players were able to take advantage of the error. \n\nYesterday [I announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KenAdamsNSA/status/1083506611052634113) that we'll be reverting and refunding all BE-purchased Prestige Points along with the Aatrox Prestige skin. \n\n**But what about the capsules? **\n\nFor reasons I'll explain here, we won't be able to revert or remove the free Blood Moon capsules that players were able to purchase using BE. Lots of you have pointed out that this feels unfair, so we want to explain why we decided to do this.\n\nIt's not too complicated of a process for us to manually remove **most** items from your inventory if we need to. If it's a single skin or a champion, we have tools to remove those quickly and effectively. \n\nHowever, it gets more complicated when we talk about capsules and other loot items, because it's a lot harder to track what players have done with the capsules after they open them. You can disenchant skin shards into orange essence, or reroll them using other skin shards you already owned (including ones you earned legitimately). Instead of reverting a single item, we'd have to revert potentially thousands of transactions made in the loot system. This would take us months to undo, as it’s a very manual and delicate process to ensure we don’t wipe out legitimate transactions accidentally. Additionally, it could revert perfectly normal actions, like LP gains, Mastery tokens, and more.\n\nSince we don't keep easily reversible backups of an earlier version of your account's state, properly reverting the capsules purchased using BE yesterday would be nearly impossible and come at the expense of other features we’re working on for players. For this reason, we're choosing to only take away the Prestige Points and Blood Moon Aatrox Prestige Editions that were obtained with BE.\n\nWe're already taking steps to prevent this sort of mistake from ever happening again. \n\nOur first action will be to make internal test prices reflect Live prices for store content. This way, if content that shouldn’t be on Live accidentally makes it way out, it won’t be exploitable or priced incorrectly. \n\nIn the long term, we're going to continue to explore the work needed to address issues like this in the future. In the off chance this happens again, we'll be able to respond quickly and appropriately.\n\nThank you so much for your patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Marksmen Player","date":"2019-01-12T01:44:08.076+0000","up_votes":366,"down_votes":35,"body":"Just cause you explained it doesn’t make it feel any less unfair.

What amounts to inaction from Riot on this makes me sad.\n\nWhen I saw moobeat tweet that the new skins were available yesterday, I logged in to obtain them and noticed the error. I assumed it was a bug, and I feared repercussions to my very valuable account with every skin. I feel that nearly everyone who abused it had enough common sense to also know it was unintended.\n\nI didn't do it though. I could've bought tons of these capsules and received every new skin for free for years. Now, I'm hesitant about even playing or buying RP because this is the first time in multiplayer games that I've been the one heavily punished for refusing to abuse what was very obviously a bug. It hurts. To make it even worse, this one has real money value of potentially thousands of dollars.\n\nRegardless, I guess this is just the reality of this situation since it sounds like this is the final word we'll get on it.

On me and my hard work.\nI have 895 skins for now and I've been working to get them since season IV by playing many tournaments and paying whole lote of money. Now people are getting something I've been working on for so long\nI dont remember the exact time but I believe it was season II or III, there was a similiar bug in the store. I got permabanned for \"stealing\" 1000 RP. I lost 15 skins that time and I never managed to get them back. Except that I lost some summonersicons which showed that I was a veteran, I mean the beta icon.\nI don't want any punishment for those players but I really remember this ban. When I saw tbe chests for 1BE I was afraid if I  was gonna get banned again or if you were just gonna piss me off saying you cannot do anything for 1000RP. I lost my account with really rare skins when they weren't punished for stealing 300 000... And Aatrox which you take back from them can be simply rerolld\nWhen the packs were available on the server I didn't buy them because I was afraid that I was gonna loose my account again.And I could get skinshards which would provide me new skins till the end of season 15 actually\nSometimes you don't want to give me another skin for the one I already have from the chest for another one\nWhere is the fairness?","replies":[]}]}
