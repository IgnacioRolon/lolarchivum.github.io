Long story short the 3 attacking me reported me and I was given chat restrictions. From now on I'll just mute them but my question is how long or how many honors is it going to take to get from lv1 to lv2 honor?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T03:30:46.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound like it really sucks, it's best not to fight fire with fire and mute them just as you mentioned from now on =(.\n\nIt shouldn't take *too* long, but there isn't a set amount of honors you need AFAIK. Keep playing games while avoiding any dishonorable stuff and you'll see that rank rise sooner than later. Just so you know, your honor progress is locked right now, but it will unlock shortly as long as you don't get punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WilsonMagna","date":"2018-01-23T14:20:48.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I'll do that.","replies":[]}]}
