Now he&#039;s just a sack of shit that likes to sit back and tickle you with his autos because of the stupid build path you have to follow for him to even be remotely good. The shield given from your e is practically useless and non existent and half of the time I don&#039;t even notice that it&#039;s there (yes I know you have to pass through an enemy for it to proc). If your just gonna leave him as he is you might as well take him out of the game because I&#039;m more than positive I am the only one still trying to play him and I don&#039;t even know why.","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2015-10-03T00:09:39.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that it's pre season they have no excuse, they need to revert the Q and E nerfs and try something new. Meddler did say they'll be doing something with him before the end of the year though, I just hope hes taken the feedback he got in that thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-10-01T04:27:12.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir's current state seems to shove him into a champion that secures a dominance in lane, against most match ups but after laning phase he is for heavy zoning with decent chunking damage on his Q and W. \nHis passive tower counters sieging and it lets him hold areas really well if he sticks around but it's a tower and by the time mid game hits everyone can easily slip through it to catch/kill squishies like himself and get out even if barely alive. \n\nI personally believe allowing Azir to create a 1 tower per lane, not just one tower at a time will boost his anti-siege/siege playstyle, considering how weak the towers are to being killed when he is forced to leave its immediate area even on minions, it won't be too strong. Once late game hits Azir's tower passive can't even hold a siege minioned wave back, it's kinda pathetic.
