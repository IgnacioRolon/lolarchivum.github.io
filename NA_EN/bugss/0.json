How dare you make such an amazing champion with the best backstory in the game, to die for voice acting and possibly the best dance action ever and then make him mostly useless.

Then, for several patches, Tahm Kench dominated in top lane in solo queue, but only in short games. He was toxic as an enemy and as an ally because he would win his lane without difficulty and then fall off harder than a Lee Sin in a 45-minute match.\n\nHe cannot have more utility than a standard support or he dominates in competitive play. He cannot have more damage or crowd control than a standard tank or he dominates solo queue.\n\nHe was an abomination and the gutter is where he belongs until Riot can give him a proper VGU.","replies":[]}]}]}
