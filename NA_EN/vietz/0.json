Im not sure if it was in normal game or not but earlier i played a team builder and it had the rose bouquet ward.\r\nIs this new or did the icon always gave the ward in game or is it a bug?\r\nAnd does this work in normal and ranked also?\r\n\r\nI dont want to test it and leave in a normal game cause im bout to head to bed right now.\r\nAny information will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe new icon looks great and ill continue using it regardless, but if it isnt a bug that it gave me the bouquet ward that would be awesome.  Like poro, using icon to change in game skins is a great idea.","replies":[]}
