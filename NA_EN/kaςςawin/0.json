If a few days before s7 starts (which means the last days of the pre-season), I get demoted to Silver I, will I get the gold div rewards, or the silver div rewards?\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fargo79","date":"2017-08-19T15:38:58.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate to necro this thread but i have a question in regards to what ranked qualifies for the Gold + end of season rewards... does Flex queue also receive the rewards??\n\nand also to clearify the question on this thread i think he was asking if he made it to gold in the preseason does he qualify for season 7 rewards...

Nothing in Season 7 Preseason will matter for Season 6 rewards. You can find the breakdown [here.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230496748)\n\nI hope that clears this up. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2016-11-04T22:05:11.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rewards are given based on your rank at the end of a season. So if you end Season 6 (Nov. 7th is the final day) at Gold V, then you will get the Gold V rewards.\n\nWhat you are during the pre-season or at the start of Season 7 will have no effect on your rewards for Season 6.","replies":[]}]}
