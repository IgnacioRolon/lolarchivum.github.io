One thing I noticed was that the opposing characters were Headhunters, so I got three questions for you (in order of what I think is likely to unlikely to be answered in a straight forward manner).\r\n\r\n1) Does this mean that Omega Squad and Headhunters are in the same Universe (like Project and Mecha)?\r\n\r\n2) And if you can answer, does this also mean that Omega Squad battled Headhunters in that universe given the info in this trailer?\r\n\r\n3) And I doubt you&#039;ll be able to answer this clearly (as in without being confusing about it), but does this also mean that the Headhunters won the battle? I&#039;m only asking because, correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but when Omega Squad Teemo came out, I think someone said he was the last of hos squad or something, or it was heavily implied he was.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2017-07-28T04:01:38.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trailer is just showcasing the new skins - they aren't in the same universe.
