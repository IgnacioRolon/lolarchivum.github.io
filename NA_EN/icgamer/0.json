Please Insert a disk into drive I:.\nI have the options to cancel, try again, or continue.\n\nIf I cancel I can log into the game...but it eventually pops back up at the most inopportune times. \n\nNow I see no actual interface for GamePanel, but some research has led me to believe this may be associated with the actual xbox app and related to being able to record game footage, so I've launched the XBOX app and saw it had an inventory of all my games, Including LoL, I removed LoL from it's inventory, and turned off every single option however this still did nothing to stop the error.\n\nThank you very much for your speedy response, not sure we'll find an answer, but here is hoping for hopes sake.\n\nv/r\nICgamer","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-27T22:39:31.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not totally familiar with this issue, but I'd like to ask some questions to see if we can get to the bottom of this.  Does this panel appear if you press Windows + G keys?  Do you have a keyboard that might have a game mode function when you press it?   Do you have an Xbox controller wired to your PC, and if so what happens if you unplug it?  \n\nWhen the game bar appears, you may be able to mouse over it and find a settings option.  There should be an option to disable it there.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
