Okay, I get high pings at very random times, like I don't know when. Sometimes I think it is because my internet company sucks but no other games demand stable high speed internet like league does. When everything works fine, YouTube, Steam games, Google, but League lags. WHY? I never had these problems with Battlefield, Borderlands and World of Tanks and for god's sake why does league lag? And it is totally RANDOM!!! I played 4 game with 30 ms then fifth game it goes up to 900 ms. WHY? Sometimes it's during dinner time, sometime it's about 9 pm, I even had 1000 ping lag at 2 am midnight. NO ONE!!! was using internet but me! Losing games because lagging is probably the MOST tilting thing ever. Like when you know you can play very well but you can't do anything because your champion just refuses to move, that's THE most tilting thing ever. Sometimes I even reconnect 3 times but it still lags. Honestly I have to admit that my internet provider sucks big time but if other games can run perfectly for years then why can't league be stable? Not just me, my friends also experience lags. We play on weekends and sometime we just can't play ranked because one of us is having bad ping. I can never have one time that I can just straight go play ranked and worry about nothing. I always have to test my ping. I seriously hope Riot does something about this, it's more serious than adc being weak. If you had any frustrating ping problems, share your story. I want to know about other people's lags. Plus why does league lags? We all gamers here and probably player many other games. I never played a game that lags so often like League.","replies":[{"poster":"Faustavian","date":"2017-01-15T21:41:15.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I've had a problem with is location. I'm about 10 walls away and across the house from the  source of my internet and I can spike up to 11k (often tbh, i've stopped playing until I can move to a different room)\n\nCheck your location, some games require more internet usage than others and this tends to have an impact.  Server location may play a part too, depending on where you live compared to other games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-14T23:43:49.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if your net works fine elsewhere, you can still have issues connecting or having a strong connection with a specific server.
