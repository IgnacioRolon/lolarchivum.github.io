So the legendary Skraner randomly uses, the basic Skarner&#039;s quotes. Sometimes is says the only legendary quotes, sometimes only the classic, and sometimes both (first the basic then the legedary). As i noticed it happens only in case of movement quotes. I play on EUNE, engilsh game language. Fix my favorite robo-scropion please! :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-04-25T17:08:21.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Aria ßlaze! \n\nThanks for the report!
