Over the course of 35,000 some odd matches. About 50% of all games will have a troll of some sort trolling away, being verbally abusive, intentionally feeding, griefing the team, afking, scripting, or ddosing. This is part of the reason the game has no competitive integrity. Half of all matches are like this. Been that way for 6 seasons.\n\nYou even asked players who played with me before such as Leaf of the Lake and they confirmed this to be the case. I do NOT limit the troll % to just MY teams either.

So YEAH, of course over a community of MULTIPLE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE and elos, if you average it all together, solo players have a 50% winrate, and premades have a 50% winrate--sure, that sounds fair. But that doesn't mean jack shit for the average player. Let's say you play less than 30 games a week... that's so few, you can't even get a good number to see if you really are having a good win/loss rate. But that's still a lot of games. In that time, you could be playing top/jg solo, and then get 3/4 man dived in tower, or get your buffs camped. Your premade on your team isn't even paying attention to you, because they're all having a jolly time in their own lanes.\n\nPerhaps you even win that game. It was great, your premade carried you. But how was the solo player's experience? Shitty, right?    Were they able to solo carry the way they might have last season? No. Do they even get to really participate in the game? No. If they do well, do they get accolades? Nope. If they do poorly, is their team likely to treat them nicely? Hell no, their premade is going to flame them up because they can do no wrong.\n\nThere is no statistic that can capture the feeling in Bronze/Silver/Gold of seeing plays that you could NEVER hope to get right without voice chat on your team because you're low elo and you all suck ass, but seeing yourself get fucked over by these perfect teleport ganks and 3/4 man tower dives, and as you're sitting with your grey screen, you look over and see that support with teleport, jungle and top are all in the same club...\n\nThere's just no statistic that can correctly take that into consideration. It is a statistically unlikely thing to happen--statistically. But that happening once or twice every 30 games can make it FEEL like you're getting shafted, especially when, once again, you could never hope to pull that stuff off, because how do you ping \"hey I'm tanking the tower so maybe you can KILL THEM pls\"? No pings for that. Or how about \"hey, that's warded! Don't gank yet!\"? Is there a ping for that? Or maybe, \"5 bot lane, push top hard?\"\n\nNo, I have to go walk up to my tower and type for that to happen, and by then, the opportunity might have been missed. And so even if I could have done it, even if I am as good as them, even then, I can't, because I just do not have time to stop moving/using abilities in a game where milliseconds count.\n\nLow elo players are allowed to have opinions about the game. We are mechanically unskilled with a lack of game knowledge, not newborn idiots that are deaf and blind and can't read club tags or have feelings. Surprise! Bronze/Silver/Gold scrublords can, in fact, feel feelings and think thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-06-10T20:06:24.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"statistics are going to more accurately determine game balance than your whiny feelings.

It has nothing to do with players losing games or winning games because of premades. It has ONLY to do with a significant portion of the community who feels that the QUALITY of their gaming experience has been degraded by the addition of DQ regardless of win or loss. This is empirically proven to be true. Even Riot states there are issues they are working on, the fairness of matchmaking has degraded significantly this season. You know this because the average MMR difference of the highest ranked player in a match and the lowest ranked player in a match was about 75-100 in previous seasons. This season it is in the 200-300 range. That is a HUGE jump. This means matches, this season, are 100-200% more volatile on AVERAGE due to the high variance of the skill levels of players involved. For obvious reasons this has degraded the quality of competitive integrity so dramatically that Riot has already limited high level players like myself to 3 man teams and no more 5 man teams. We will no longer be seeing a bunch of Master/Diamond players playing against a full professional team.\n\nMy skill range is not the only one affected. ALL skill ranges are affected by the MMR variance in matches to a greater degree this season than in any prior season. Naturally this means the quality of ALL players gaming experiences is LESS than it was in the past. This was the opposite of what Riot intended when they introduced the system in the first place, which is why they are now going about ways to try to resolves some of the unintended issues they caused. Of course, players like myself told them on the boards this would happen 6 months ago when we first heard the news about DQ being launched. But we were ignored. Its kind of a big slap in the face to us. And none of us are pleased about it.\n\nSee? Discussion was had here. Discussion that contributes to the direction of the game. Right here, in this last post of yours you managed to contribute something worthwhile and spur actual discussion. Without being offensive or rude or hostile. That is appropriate boards behavior. Please continue to do THIS in the future as this is acceptable. Do not fall into your previous pattern of inappropriate boards behavior as it can, and will, lead to a boards permanent suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"Elikain","date":"2016-06-09T12:01:17.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spare me the \"spiritual discussions\" of yours.

All fine opinions to hold. All fine to express. I would highlight that you mention one player can ruin your game and in the past this most often occurred because of a poor pairing in which a player dramatically less talented and with a much lower MMR got stomped by players who were better than him. This is and always has been my issue with the systems in place, they consistently pair players poorly (to a greater degree now) and are incapable of ranking players appropriately on an individual basis if they take into account no individual skill metrics. No one calls Alex Gordon the best player in baseball just because the Royals won the world series last season, he's not paid like the best ball player, why does League have a system that only rates players based on the performance of the team? This was fine for 5s teams ranked queue in the past but is never going to be a system that functions properly for a queue that allows less than a full team.\n\n> That doesn&#x27;t mean i don&#x27;t want anything to change nor that i feel like everything is fine, but that i am willing to wait for the changes.

Just because you do not feel as strongly about an issue does not mean that another player who does feel strongly is in the wrong for expressing that opinion, just as you are not wrong for expressing yours in this response. You must allow others to express their opinions as well, whatever they may be. If it is an opinion that aggravates you then you don't have to click the thread. Nothing changes the fact that we are indeed having some valuable discussions on this topic in this thread and in others. That's a positive contribution to the community and other players can perhaps benefit from it down the line. We are performing community service here, all of us, in the hopes that our input can make a difference one way or another.\n\n> #If it has been asked and answered, compile it in a single thread and pin it to the top of the boards. If we have already answered some questions, then they should be visible the moment you hit Gameplay or any related boards - the lack of visibility on this issue is why i think boards are nothing but shit.\n\nIf we could combine everything into one thread and keep it there it would be nice. Sadly Riot does not participate on the boards as much as they could (or some players feel as they should) and so we have some clutter. That's just kind of the way it goes and we all have to deal with it. I too would agree it'd be nice to have some better visibility and much more Rioter interaction on this topic.\n\nIn regards to your offensive posts and moderation they have taken no action because I have not spoken with Curator or Keyru about them. You show the ability to participate in a constructive fashion and are not repeating your mistakes from those previous posts. It would appear that merely my admonishment was all that was needed to make you realize you have something worth saying and that you needed to find a more polite and constructive way of saying those things. I don't take that kind of step lightly, it should be reserved for the most egregious repeat offenders and clearly you are not one of them. Your post history says more than enough on that and everyone should be forgiven for a minor transgression made in the heat of a moment. Its not like you do that all day every day to everyone. No real harm, no foul I say. I must say that it is appreciated however that you have chosen to participate in a far more constructive manner and thank you for making that change. Well done.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
