However a VERY low demanding game like LoL hard locks my computer... Any ideas as to why this is?\r\nI did it in compatability mode run as admin all that jazz and LoL is the ONLY game that does this.\r\nUninstall, re-install, run full repair, lower all graphic settings to the lowest, lowest resolution and it still hard locks my system.\r\nPlease some help or insight...","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-01-08T06:01:24.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What exactly happens when it locks up?\n\nThere is really no way for the game (or any user software) to do this unless it is doing something specific that is triggering a stability flaw in the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Bekkwin","date":"2020-01-08T11:35:29.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The majority of the time is after a game going from game back to the launcher.
