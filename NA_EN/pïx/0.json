This way I could update my message automatically, so that my friends won't spam my chat looking for me when I'm playing other games, for example. Is there a way to do that? Thanks.\r\n\r\nBest regards","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T22:38:10.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm I don't think there's going to be a way to have it automated. Your best bet is to setup your status before queueing up, or possibly just changing your online status to busy.","replies":[]}]}
