Because I had reached it before once, I had a free win to start the promos. The first game in my promos I played Malph Top and lost, nothing unusual except for that everyone (or atleast 5 in total players on both sides) in the game crashed before getting into the loading screen. Everyone had to exit the client and log back in. So after losing that game I had: One Free Win + A Loss. So in my last game, I won a game as WW JG. That should've been enough for me to promote, but instead when I got into the end lobby my Promos looked like this: One Loss + One Win in that order.\n\nThis might just be a visual bug, kinda like how alot of players were complaining about how a remake counted as a loss. However if this is not a visual bug, then I do not want to be cheated out of some LP. I planned to play some more right now, but now I do know know if my next win will turn into a meaningless promo win or worst case, I lose and I get kicked back into Gold 4 for no reason.\n\nI created a support ticket, but just in case others might have some explanation for this bug I created this topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-26T21:52:00.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and it sure did look like what you described: a loss + a real win then another win. Congrats on the promotion btw! \n\nIt doesn't look like you were previously in a series for the Gold 3 and lost out. Promo helper would only apply had you previously been up for Gold 3 series and then lost out, then got back into another series. Sorry, if that's confusing, check out [our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h6q2) for more details.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"WUVCdisPp2","date":"2016-09-27T19:10:07.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for that FAQ, I realize what was the problem now, I reached the promo, but then fell out of it and lost a division too. So that what made me lose my Promo Helper. However I pretty (99%) sure that when I did get into this promo it showed a Free Win, sounds like a visual bug for people who have lost the Promo Helper, but the system still thinks they have it until they play another game, just so you guys know.","replies":[]}]}]}
