It can be recreated through the following steps.\r\n1. Have yuumi and kha on opposite teams\r\n2. Have yuumi attach to any ally\r\nThis has happened every game I against a yuumi\r\nThe second bug is caused by having an enemy use zhonyas next another enemy, the enemy which did'nt use zhonyas will not be isolated. This bug can be recreated through the following steps.\r\n1. Have 2 enemies next to each other.\r\n2. Hace one of them use zhonyas.\r\n3. The remaining enemy will have not be isolated\r\nI understand that the the first interaction was not there when yuumi was initially released, however this bug was not repaired when kha was hot fixed, is there a reason for these bugs remaining?","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-08-10T22:35:55.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should look up the definition of the word \"isolated.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-08-10T06:06:39.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bug.
