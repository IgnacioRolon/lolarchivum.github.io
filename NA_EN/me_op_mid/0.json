literally counting \"bad words\" (i mean the word \"idiot\" is not even bad i dont believe anyone feels hurted after that, i wouldnt care if someone calls me an idiot the whole game, but words like kill your self can actually hurt. same goes for \"shut up\" and \"trash\")\r\nas a software engineering student, i dont understand why in 2019 riot doesnt use AI which is the normal algorithms nowadays. just a trash company, only if blizzard had this game...","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-07-22T11:53:59.932+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a software engineering student, you probably should try to learn the system before talk like you know what it is.","replies":[{"poster":"me op mid","date":"2019-07-22T11:58:43.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zPOOPz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RXiRtAAn,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2019-07-22T11:53:59.932+0000)\n>\n> As a software engineering student, you probably should try to learn the system before talk like you know what it is.\n\nthis is the only way this system can work if you get banned for that, ive seen alot of videos too. there is no human checking the chat logs unless you send a ticket, try exploring the internet you will see everyone say the same. also i have friends who play this game from season 2 and 3, they say the same that the banning system has been always bad (they didnt even get banned they just know it because literally everyone said it over and over).\nfrom my expierence the only way this system can be so bad is that its not based on AI. i guess a better algorithm is too much for riot, after all this is not google here.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-07-22T12:21:25.146+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if I told you the system is a machine learning system that learns toxicity based on people report pattern?","replies":[{"poster":"me op mid","date":"2019-07-22T12:29:08.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=zPOOPz,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RXiRtAAn,comment-id=000300000001,timestamp=2019-07-22T12:21:25.146+0000)\n>\n> What if I told you the system is a machine learning system that learns toxicity based on people report pattern?\n\nthen this makes no logic at all according to so much examples of chat logs. also reports are bugged. i once played with 3 premades and we reported the last player who was trolling and flaming and he wasnt even banned, 4 reports. and that happened after he was doing the same the last game before according to his match history","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-22T12:31:55.102+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=me op mid,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RXiRtAAn,comment-id=0003000000010000,timestamp=2019-07-22T12:29:08.504+0000)\n>\n> then this makes no logic at all according to so much examples of chat logs. also reports are bugged. i once played with 3 premades and we reported the last player who was trolling and flaming and he wasnt even banned, 4 reports. and that happened after he was doing the same the last game before according to his match history\n\nIt is just as true that more reports increase the likelihood of a punishment as it is that the system looks for bad words and ignores context... that is, not at all.\n\nAs a software engineering student, you need to learn to look up [documentation](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player) for the systems you use.","replies":[{"poster":"zPOOPz","date":"2019-07-22T12:35:44.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's technically half right.

All the system cares about is **IF** a person was reported in a game. Any extra reports have no effect. When it comes to trolling, the system is simply not going to be very good at that and usually has to wait for a manual review for such situations. The ambiguity of detecting if someone was making mistakes intentionally or unintentionally makes a computer inadequate at making accurate decisions in many trolling cases.\n\nYou're not in control over what punishment the system gives nor are you aware of their standing with the system. They could have received a chat restriction or they may not have been pushed into their next punishment yet.\n\nThe feedback system that informs you if someone was punished due to your report is sporadic at best.

(i have played overwatch for 2 years also and never got banned, how is that?) from what he said it was obv thier system is 10 times smarter than riot, i dont even need to prove that riot system is poor, because everyone knows that riot does not care about quality, it is well known and you cant say this is a quality company, which is why i am so sure the algorithm must be poor, like many other things in the game. the only thing holding this game alive are changes and creativity by the balance team. there are so much changes every patch... so much champions and people ignore the fact that this game is a complete trash game if you talk about graphics/bugs/client and more. it is obvious that riot are not using softwares like blizzard because they DONT NEED to make the game's code actually good, they just need to keep being creative at the balance team. \nyou can rarely see they are adding very little things to the part of the game that is not balance, like the loading screen, client, etc. most of the time they are dealing with balance and not techincal issues (except bugs, but there will be new bugs right after anyway). why do u think they are not focusing on things that are not balance? because this is not thier way to get money. simple as that.\n\nEdit: all of that and i didnt even talk about MMR and matchmaking system which is the worst system in this game with many players complaning over and over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pxerkza","date":"2019-07-22T11:41:57.314+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"go play blizzard games\ni've played since season 2\ni've personally never been even chat restricted\nand i've said worse things\n\nthe difference being i say those things once or twice a month\nand you probably get reported on a daily basis","replies":[{"poster":"me op mid","date":"2019-07-22T11:51:47.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Pxerkza,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RXiRtAAn,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-07-22T11:41:57.314+0000)\n>\n> go play blizzard games\n> i've played since season 2\n> i've personally never been even chat restricted\n> and i've said worse things\n> \n> the difference being i say those things once or twice a month\n> and you probably get reported on a daily basis\n\nso i can say worse things once or  twice a month for 7 years?\ndo u understand how sad is that the system cant determine you are toxic if you do this? because you say worse things, and u do not reform basicly... you just dont write it alot but u keep writing it 1 or 2 times a month... i think this is considered toxic if the words are actually bad.  i dont even understand how the words i said are \"bad words\"... like anyone would cry after i tell him trash or idiot? im not  telling him to suicide or get cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"Pxerkza","date":"2019-07-22T14:40:01.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the system punishes for repeated offenses or extreme cases\n\nif you start hard verbal abuse or racial/sexist comments you will get banned for 1 game\nbut saying fucking r%%%%% once will not get you banned\n\neveryone slips up if you've watched rioters play you would notice that they sometimes flame as well\n\nnot everyone can have full control of their emotions and impulses always\nbut you not having any control of those emotions and impulses validates a punishment\n\nconsider yourself lucky that you got chat restricted\nthere are plenty of people making posts on these boards for getting 14 day bans and permanent bans for similar offenses to yours","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-07-24T05:36:19.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=me op mid,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=RXiRtAAn,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2019-07-22T11:51:47.555+0000)\n>\n> so i can say worse things once or  twice a month for 7 years?\n> do u understand how sad is that the system cant determine you are toxic if you do this? because you say worse things, and u do not reform basicly... you just dont write it alot but u keep writing it 1 or 2 times a month... i think this is considered toxic if the words are actually bad.  i dont even understand how the words i said are \"bad words\"... like anyone would cry after i tell him trash or idiot? im not  telling him to suicide or get cancer.\n\nYou cant INSULT players.
