The crew that worked on MvM aren't as keyed into the latest on balance changes or the movings and shaking of the e-sports scene or whatnot.  But we'd be happy to chat with you about MvM, talk about our process (and occasionally, lack thereof), or provide whatever insight we can as to what we've made and why we've made it.

Rinse and repeat over the next 3 years. Find an incredible artist to make the gameplay come to life. Run hundreds of playtests and get more feedback. Iterate. Panic. Question every design decision we've made. Get more feedback. Panic slightly less. More feedback, more polish and more iteration, until we made something we were happy with. Ultimately, we hope it's something you enjoy. We had an amazing time making it :)\n\nAs for future updates, we're not sure about that right now.

Firstly, the lore behind Rumble in association to the Yordle Academy of Science states that \"(...)Rumble refused to go. He believed that Heimerdinger and his associates were 'sellouts'...\" Rumble chose to forego the best possible engineering education due to the fact that he saw the professors as \"sellouts\", now why in the world would he form a school? (I'd like to point out that Ziggs is technically titled \"Dean of Demolitions\", I'd even wager that Ziggs would be more likely than Rumble to have a proper school)\n\nSecondly, I understand that Ziggs and Tristana are friends of Rumble in the LoL canon, but Corki and Heimerdinger would both be considered by Rumble to be part of the \"enlightened\" class of yordle educators whom he looks down on.\n\nThird, there seems to be some clear design similarities between the outfits worn by Corki and Heimerdinger to Heim's own contraptions. The other two mechs are clearly constructed by Rumble since Ziggs is infamous for his explosive contraptions not performing as intended, and Tristana doesn't have a proper background in engineering. So my question is, are we to assume that Heimerdinger and Corki are riding in blatantly plagiarized inventions? I find it hard to believe that as scatter-brained as Heimerdinger is, he should easily be able to tell when his designs are being re-used and modified.","replies":[{"poster":"ElyCyan","date":"2016-09-19T22:21:54.043+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't the Yordle Academy!

This is his own school in his own junkyard!\n\nRumble doesn't really like Heimerdinger, and is probably ambivalent towards Corki, but he needed some way to convince Tristana to come to his new school so he can try to woo her.
