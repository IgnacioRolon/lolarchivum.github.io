It&rsquo;s been a long time in the making, so we&rsquo;re really excited (and a little nervous) to be talking about it with all of you! We&rsquo;re going to be doing a few posts about the process of making the game, but wanted to start just by talking broadly about the gameplay in MvM and some of the major decisions that went into it. First up: the decision to make the game co-op.\r\n\r\n**WATCH MY TEAM WORK\r\n**\r\nIt may come as a surprise that the game isn&rsquo;t PvP. We definitely tried out PvP iterations of the game, but in the end, the co-op version of the game&hellip; well, it was just a lot more fun. We don&rsquo;t have the luxury of online matchmaking, but wanted the replayability and depth that a good, online PvP experience would be able to provide, and we felt closer to those goals when the game was fully co-op. We also wanted the game to be fun for the experienced player as well as the brand new player, even if they&rsquo;re in the same game. We went through a LOT of testing to get as close to that mark as we could, and we plan to spend the next post talking about those design&mdash;and testing&mdash;challenges. The design choices became a lot easier to make once we found a theme to match to these mechanics&hellip; \r\n\r\n**MECHAYORDLES!\r\n**\r\nIn MvM, the players act as one of four yordles and &ldquo;program&rdquo; their mech with different ability cards. Each turn, the player can add one of these abilities to their command line, and soon the mech has a series of commands that it executes every turn. The idea is to build out a minion-stomping machine that you masterfully pilot through the mission&mdash;but it&rsquo;s easy to run into technical difficulties, especially once you start taking damage. In our games, we kept driving into walls, or bumping into teammates, or wandering the wrong way altogether. We asked ourselves: what kind of champs would accidentally walk into lava? There was no other option: it had to be yordles.\r\n\r\nWith a game set in the League universe, we took the opportunity to tell a story with familiar characters and have them go on a journey. MvM uses a modular board that changes as the story progresses and includes lots of dialogue (both written and recorded!) to deepen the story and give the game that distinct yordleiciousness that we wanted.\r\n\r\n**ONE (MECHANIZED) STEP AT A TIME\r\n**\r\nWe&rsquo;re super excited for the launch of the game. We earnestly hope that everyone who plays MvM enjoys playing it, but we also know that it won&rsquo;t be for everyone. Every choice is a trade-off, but we prized fun gameplay above all else. Even the most carefully painted miniatures can&rsquo;t make up for a snorefest of a game, so we erred on the side of gameplay depth when in doubt, and we leaned on the full campaign to introduce that complexity over time. \r\n\r\nWe really wanted to make a game for League players as well as core tabletop gamers, and choosing not to license the game out to another developer meant developing MvM entirely in-house. Once that decision was made, we were fated to learn a lot of lessons&mdash;the hard way&mdash;about what it takes to make a board game. We&rsquo;ll be talking about that in the next post!\r\n\r\n-Kades","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderspam","date":"2016-09-27T18:47:59.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, looks fun.\nAny idea of price range yet?","replies":[{"poster":"BluePenguin9","date":"2016-09-27T18:55:09.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I read somewhere $70 US\n\nseems steep for a board game.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron of Bread","date":"2016-09-27T19:26:06.771+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually pretty cheap for what it has in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sivrit","date":"2017-01-08T08:46:43.031+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"most board games are like 20 to 40 bucks what  black market board games are you buying and do they have meth?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Emojay","date":"2016-09-29T02:31:32.190+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you SEEN the prices of WAR-HAMMER? or about ANY board game like this?

This seems more likely too complicated a board game for a casual video game player though MvM won't be the most complicated board game I play. I have a feeling you have no clue about modern board game culture. Anyways LoL is super fucking casual, you don't get 100 million players without having casual fans. \n\nOne of the main reasons they can sell it so cheap and still make money is they are distributing it themselves. Their is no double markup one from production costs and one from wholesale to retail cost. Using their own preexisting property and an in house art team who are salaried employees would be sure to keep costs down. I am sure they are making a profit on this game still. It does seem to be a passion project, if we end up seeing expansions for MvM the game would definitely be a money maker. And they are selling it to the board game audience where it is getting massive praise from all the popular youtube reviewers. \n\nIt's not being sold yet and you can't preorder which could be one reason nothing on the client had shown up. Nothing was on the client for world's more than a week away from it starting and this still has two weeks until it launches.","replies":[{"poster":"Herazalila","date":"2016-10-02T08:10:25.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you missunderstood me.\n1)No lol or every MOBA isn't for casual gamer.My parents/sister can play Fifa or cod for fun and from time to time but they can't play lol from time to time this is way too complicated and you need to play it a lot .Casual gamer is someone who don't play video game a lot(exept the simple one like candy crush).So maybe  i don't understand \"casual \" but if you play between 10 or 20 a week for video game you aren't a casual gamer(even if you are a bad gamer).\n2)By bordgamer i mean Boardgamer who are actually not really a  video gamer.I'm not stupid enough to think boargame community and videogame community share nothing.And what imean it's you will not have a lot of new lol player thanks to that boardgame.\n3) We had litterally one news.And only on english's website (i'm French and we didn't have the news ).
