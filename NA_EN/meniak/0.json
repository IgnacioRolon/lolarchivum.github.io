This includes Legendary and even Ultimate skins! Legacy skins will also be obtainable as a Mystery Skin EXCEPT Achievement skins, Collector's Edition skins, PAX skins, Rusty Blitzcrank, Urf the Manatee, Championship Riven and Riot Squad Singed.*\n\nHope this clears things up! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Meniak","date":"2015-03-20T00:41:02.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks Khaos! I'm glad that these posts get such fast responses!\n\nEdit:Riot KateyKhaos, I just reread you're reply and I noticed that you Were referring to the **mystery gifting option**. I am wanting to know about the **mystery skin event**; where you buy a mystery skin for yourself and not your friends. The event until March 24th, 2015. Do the same rules apply?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Zilean","date":"2015-03-19T21:26:12.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any skin that was available for purchase directly in game is obtainable.
