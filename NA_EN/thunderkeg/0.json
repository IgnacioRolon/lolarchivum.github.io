You can still move and stuff but you can&#039;t move the minimap or ping. Happens on Gnar, Syndra, Renekton (slice n dice rapidly especially), and of course, Ryze (ALL THE GODDAMN TIME!). Disappears after spamming spells more, but I can&#039;t tell what in particular fixes it. Sometimes spamming gets rid of it again and sometimes not.  Please help me and fix this bug, it is infuriating and it makes navigating the minimap really hard since you have to drag your curser to the side to move the map manually.","replies":[{"poster":"EineMegane","date":"2015-06-16T01:06:39.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blue Socialist","date":"2015-06-16T00:09:17.583+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm.

I also encountered the bug while playing Gnar. If you want to sloppily circumvent it you can check a box at the bottom of your keybinds menu that says something like 'use spell after spellcast'  In my keybinds it is the last option available.  The reticle still bugs out, but you can left click and ping like normal after using another ability (q, w, e, etc).  So far I haven't found any negative consequences to having this box checked, but I only have one or two games under my belt.","replies":[]}]}
