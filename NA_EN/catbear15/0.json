Annie and Yi don&#039;t need more new skins!!!\r\n\r\nYou have a bunch of champs with 1 or 2 mediocre skins, but Ahri and Ezreal got 2 new skins with particles within the last year.  \r\nWe want more diversity in the skins.  I&#039;ve been waiting since Illaois release to get a good skin that I would buy the second it came out.","replies":[{"poster":"Felaze","date":"2017-09-26T22:58:44.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who make these comments seem as if they don’t  understand how Riot stays afloat. Skins bring in money, and actually, the skins are one of the only ways League brings in money to keep it going- so yeah, very popular champions will get more skins then champions who aren’t as popular to make them the money they need to continue developing the game we all know and love.\n\nI agree that I don’t necessarily want to see a new Yi skin, or Ahri skin so often, but hey! That’s the beauty of his game! If you don’t like it, you aren’t forced to buy it! And because of that, I can patiently wait for skins for champions that I play frequently. Remember: Riot doesn’t owe you skins, and actually, skins are simply a fun, and exciting bonus feauture to the game that doesn’t really HAVE to be there, you get what I’m saying?","replies":[]},{"poster":"jinxedleblanc","date":"2017-09-26T23:05:15.180+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champions get skins based off popularity. People would only buy skins for champs they play. Not that many people play Yorick or Illaoi. Lots of people play Ahri and Annie. Also, this is the year of new champ skins. Cass and Yorick have gotten skins, and Riot has promised to get skins for other underrated champs like Illaoi and Viktor. So just wait patiently. We've had 2 patches in a row with skins for forgotten champs, so Illaoi should be on her way. (NOTE ABOUT YI:2010:First 2 skins after release. 2011:3rd skin. FEB 2012:4th skin. THEN A 3 YEAR GAP TIL SEP 2015 with Project Yi. Bet Yi players felt pretty bad during those 3 years. Then 2 years til 2017 with Cosmic Blade. It just feels like he gets lots of skins because we've already gotten one for him in 2017.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"łnśane","date":"2017-09-27T01:04:30.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want my Legendary skin for MF and/or new VO.
