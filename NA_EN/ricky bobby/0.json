Before we look into your routing, we'll first need to ensure your local network settings are configured according to our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). This will make sure your network settings aren't configured in a way that they hinder or block certain types of connections to happen over the League Client.\n\nLet me know if these steps caused any change for you.","replies":[]}]}
