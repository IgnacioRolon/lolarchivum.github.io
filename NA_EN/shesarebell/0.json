Coming into the match late can happen if the game server puts you on idle for some reason.  This can happen if you have a third party program or firewall setting getting in the way.  See if auto-configuring firewall settings can help via our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  Check your anti-virus as well to make sure it's allowing League as an exception, and definitely disable any mods you have running for League.\n\nIf these steps don't help, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can investigate further to see what's up.","replies":[{"poster":"BetterAtBrewing","date":"2017-11-16T20:32:53.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Porocles, and everyone else,\nI think I resolved my problem: I had a third party program, indeed: Lan Killer (http://www.killernetworking.com/) supposed to manage my network...
