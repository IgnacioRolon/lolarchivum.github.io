Game 1 was a win. Game 2 was a remake, which was apparently counted as a loss. My match history reflects this. The other team had an AFK and the game was remade, but I was given a loss in my series. When we lost game 3, I was denied my promotion. I don't believe this is an intentional element of the remake tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-25T18:46:44.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seemed strange, so I looked into this and found that you dodged during your series.
