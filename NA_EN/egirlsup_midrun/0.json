My team was doing good job we got 2 inhibits and elder dragon and we were about to take baron but suddenly I got disconnected while my team was taking baron. My internet was fine i had good fps and ping. Oh actually one of my teammates also got dced at the early game. anyway I tried to reconnect rightaway but we lost that teamfight so hard and the enemy team just finished the game. I think this is not a problem of my computer or internet cuz i never had this kind of problem before. i know you guys wont put me back to diamond 4 but i just wanna say im so upset and pls fix this problem. thank u for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-04T20:48:53.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really sucks these disconnections had to happen during this very important match! :'(\n\nTo prevent this from happening in the future, I recommend investigating to find the core cause to these terrible disconnections. Most of the time when I see this issue, a problematic local network connection or ISP routing are the cause. A good place to start is our [connection troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as it offers the most common solutions for this.\n\nLet me know if you continue to have these disconnections.","replies":[]}]}
