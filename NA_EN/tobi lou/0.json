You may be wondering why I was reported.. well during champ select in the banning phase I banned Malphite. Immediately after they all started raging at me because their top player wanted to play him. I had Twisted Fate hovered in mid and their top player is 2 picks before, he locks TF (Twisted Fate) and says that he is mid now because I banned his champ so he takes mine. So I&#039;m forced into top lane, where I went because I&#039;m not giong to stoop to their level. Over the course of the game they wouldn&#039;t leave me alone when I lost my lane and just continuously bashed me telling me they were going to report me and spamming all chat &quot;Report Darius he&#039;s trolling.&quot; So not only did I get my lane stolen, I had to play a lane I didn&#039;t queue for and had a bad game at that, as well as the guy that stole my position ALSO doing horrible in the lane phase. So I think it is a little unfair that I get my rewards taken away by a group of friends queued together because they have the numbers in the end game to report me enough to just force a chat restriction on me through. Now because of the chat restriction.. I can no longer earn rewards.. I can&#039;t earn rewards because someone stole my lane. Seems fair overall.\r\n\r\nGive me your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-21T10:40:24.839+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> because a group of friends decided to report me all together\n\nThat won't result in you getting punished. Punishment is calculated per match, not per report, so even 9 reports have roughly no more weight in a single match than one.\n\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133766694594\n\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133759089858\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work\n\nWhatever your punishment was for, it was legitimate and not because some people joke reported you.
