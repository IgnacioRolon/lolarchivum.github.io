Mostly by keeping up your ultimate while in a teamfight, trying your best to zone while going directly for those tasty ~~chickens~~ squishies, only to realize that you(&#039;re) screwed up when your mana-bar is suddenly gone and you&#039;re helpless.\nThe more games you play, it becomes steadily easier to estimate the time you can keep your extremely badass raven-form up, while still being able to cast your black magix. While I love this playstyle, having to manage your resources in combat that is, it can be pretty annoying when constantly having to look at your mana bar and at how much it is declining, so you know when it would be the best time to turn it off and potentially disengage, maybe even indicating your team to do so as well. _\"Strategic Withdrawal!\"_ \nOf course the passive helps to keep up your ultimate, but it cannot always be relied on. \n\nA great way to help Swain-veterans and -beginners alike would be an icon that indicates the amount of mana it consumes with every second, much like Kassadin, right at your buff-bar or R-icon. With this, mana-management during teamfights and skirmishes would be \"simplified\" in a good way. It wouldn&#039;t take away Swain&#039;s weakness, but it would make it better to deal with, especially when everyone around you is going nuts and you have to keep track of everything at once.\n\nAll hail our glorious leader Swain! For the age of world-domination (and dragons, Riot pls) may come!!!","replies":[{"poster":"KING OF MASKS","date":"2015-04-20T19:14:57.035+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you've played Swain enough you develop a sort of sixth sense with regard to the mana management of your ult, to the point that glancing at your mana is almost unnecessary.

I personally feel like I wouldn't use the indicator, but I'm sure it would be useful for others. It would not hurt in the least to have it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-21T02:40:15.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His R racks up costs every second, so having an indicator could potentially cause performance issues. Unlike Kassadin's R, his R gets new numbers every single second. While many players, like myself, won't notice anything, it can become a bit too harsh on others when it's not necessary to do such. We all know when to stop using his ult. Your mana bar is very visible, even when you play with your stuff scaled incredibly down since your healthbar and mana bar are RIGHT there. His ult ticks down. When you see your mana beginning to go a bit too quick, you stop. When you're not around enemy champs, you stop it. When you're not taking damage, you can turn it off. \n\nSwain is about micromanagement, which fits his thematic since he's a 'Master Tactician'.","replies":[{"poster":"Awoof","date":"2015-04-21T06:25:27.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QrvZOgRI,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-04-21T02:40:15.109+0000)\n>\n> His R racks up costs every second, so having an indicator could potentially cause performance issues.\n\nYeah... I highly doubt that.\nI mean what you said is right, but it's hard for me to imagine that a changing number on your R icon would be... I don't know, too much to handle for someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-04-21T06:43:23.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Others have mentioned it to be a stacking thing so others can see it for...

Like really early game. He gets mana back from ulting a minion wave and if you try to punish him for it he will just root you then combo so he out trades u while gaining mana.
