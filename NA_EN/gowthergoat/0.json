So the banning system is just stupid. It shouldnt matter what i say to offend. someone i really shouldnt be banned. Its their fault. When you first make an account you have to INTENTIONALLY turn off the chat filter in order to see bad words. So if you&#039;re complaining about what im saying maybe turn it back on. Also we are given mute buttons. Whats the fucking point of giving us these mute buttons if not to help us ignore people we dont wanna hear? Its effective at that. However banning me is not effective as ive been banned 4 times already and im gonna keep coming back. Just pointless way of punishment. So really you have no reason to be mad if anything its your fault. I should not be banned. Instead of appealing to the sjws and the people who&#039;s feelings ive hurt oh so much. Appeal to everyone. Encourage these ways of ignoring people you dont like. The bill or rights says i have the right to be an asshole. It shouldnt be bannable unless youre like feeding or something completely understandable to ban a feeder. Anyway this is mainly to riot cut your shit stop being so easily offended.","replies":[]}
