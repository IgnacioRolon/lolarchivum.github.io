As a female gamer, my anatomy should never be the topic of discussion in the middle of a game, especially if the topic of conversation was unsolicited and is unwanted.  I shouldn't feel the need to defend my gender or ward off attacks of prepubescent trolls asking for beaver shots.  It's disgusting.  I don't know how your parents raised you.  Do you think your mother, sister, grandmother, aunt, girlfriend, or wife would appreciate being asked to strip down and take a porn shot to trade characters in ARAM?  I bet not and guess what it just happened to me and another girl.  While we may be fewer in numbers, we still pay the same prices for skins and play the game the same as you.  We deserve the respect that we give you.","replies":[{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2014-10-27T20:33:50.588+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right, it's not acceptable.
