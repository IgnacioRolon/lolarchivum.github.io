I downloaded a replay, recorded just a few seconds, and found the highlights in my Documents/League of Legends/Highlights folder, but when I try to open it using the league of legends client, it just opens the game itself. Also, would anyone be able to suggest a way that I can put a bunch of highlights into a compilation for YouTube? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-24T02:59:52.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Once you've got the highlight recorded, you should be able to watch it through the client too! Click on Profile in the top bar, then in the list below that choose Highlights.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/3d05c6132c80f710143b842f3e305889.png","replies":[{"poster":"SonicFlyht","date":"2017-07-24T03:20:21.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, idk how I missed that.

So, it is \"*.webm\". You can use vlc media player which is free of charge to see it. If you want to create a compilation, you can do it via youtube directly, upload all your \"*.webm\" files to youtube (set them to private.) Go to video manager, and create a new video. Youtube has a free of charge video editor, where you can cut videos, add songs and so on. \nHope it helped you :)","replies":[]}]}
