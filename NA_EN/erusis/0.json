I havent been banned and i play a ton of games and get honor frequently and the level wont budge. There are people on my friends list with less games and less honors then me at honor level 5 which is really strange to me. Can someone help me out with this and tell me whats going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Erusis","date":"2017-09-26T05:22:04.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm okay , we play together and talk over ts so thats how i know","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-25T20:44:13.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might feel like you're stuck in honor rank 2, but I *was* able to confirm that you're still gaining honor and progressing at the normal rate. You're not able to see how many honors someone else has, so I'm not sure what data you were looking at for your friends, but the honor system isn't designed for you to compare yourself to others regardless.","replies":[]}]}
