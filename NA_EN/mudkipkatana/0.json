Miss Fortune, Kog&#039;Maw, Graves). Their reasoning is to give each ADC their own identity. Miss Fortune is gonna be more Wombo Combo focused, Graves is gonna a burst, up-close shotgun user, Kog&#039;Maw is gonna have a max of 5.0 Attack Speed when using his W, and Quinn is gonna me more of a roaming champion. The thing is, they already have identities to fit those descriptions. Quinn is no exception. Riot&#039;s plan for Quinn is to remove the blind from her Q and replace it with another way to activate her mark and make her Ultimate, Tag Team, a channeled ability that allows her to use Valor as a mount of sorts to get around faster. Did I mention that they&#039;re nerfing the reactivate of Tag Team, Sky Strike, into oblivion? The thing is that Quinn&#039;s blind was semi unique to her, shared only by Teemo, the only difference being a skill shot that could hit multiple targets. This blind is what makes her so good against other ADCs in the bottom lane, let alone auto attack reliant Top laners that she could easily zone. Besides her blind though, the changes to her Ultimate are several times even more infuriating because it&#039;s a channeled ability, cancelled by any damage she receives during said channel. The movement speed is mediocre compared to the live version, they are removing the Attack Speed steroid that Valor receives do the fact that Valor is no longer a combatant and more of a mount, and then Sky Strike no longer executes, it&#039;s a flat AoE ability. This is absurd. In all the time that I&#039;ve been playing Quinn, the only thing that I&#039;ve ever felt needed a change were her numbers. Her attack range is slightly to low and her early attack damage barring her Harrier Mark procs leaves much to be desired but besides those I&#039;ve never had a problem with roaming as solo lane Quinn, or even doing my job as an ADC in the bot lane. I&#039;ve seen game-play for the new Quinn and it wasn&#039;t a pretty thing. Riot is butchering a champ that was plenty unique to the game. And the reason, I feel, like they&#039;re doing this is because too many people complain that she isn&#039;t that good when in actuality, she&#039;s very good but has a slightly steeper learning curve than other champions. It took me awhile to her down, and now, she&#039;s my favorite champion. And the worst thing about this is that I never feel like Riot listens to the vast part of the player base that actually have good ideas on what to do with a champion. They seem so focused on the professional scene that when somebody says something negative about a champion, item, or game element that doesn&#039;t see much competitive use, they take said negative feedback at face value. This means that no matter what we say in contrast to these absurd change, Quinn mains won&#039;t have any say in the matter despite being the best people to give feedback on what should be changed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, since they&#039;re probably dead set on butchering Quinn, I&#039;ve got a couple ideas for the new rework. \r\n\r\n#1.) Her E should proc her Harrier Marks before re-marking said Harrier Marks. That way when we do a Q then E it will shave some time  off her combo\r\n\r\n#2.) Her Ult should be one of two things, either a faster but weaker Pantheon ult (Considering the fact that she has to channel) where she flys off with Valor but when she lands in a couple of seconds she Sky Strikes for an attempted execute. Or instead of channeling for two seconds for a mediocre speed boost, remove the channel, that way she has a way to escape from ganks, because that is yet another benefit of the live Tag Team that Riot is butchering.\r\n\r\nBut like I said, Riot doesn&#039;t listen to the regular player-base so, in light of our lack of a voice in the ears of Riot Game(s) I say this: \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve spent money on a game that I don&#039;t have to spend money on because I enjoy playing this game, I genuinely do. But when Riot decides that the very people that pay for the game (A.k.a. Their customers) aren&#039;t as important as their precious LCS (Which by the way I and a vast amount of players don&#039;t even watch or pay attention to) I start to doubt whether or not I should even be playing. One could argue that I can just not play, and you would be right, I could just uninstall and go along my way but I&#039;ve already committed time, money, and effort into this game. And would like to see it change for the better. I&#039;m just have self doubt about my respect for Riot Game(s) as a whole.\r\n\r\n{{champion:133}} Quinn...

I disliked the rework for Darius. Well now, you can literally change his title to The Bench(ed) of Noxus. I loved the old Darius and what the old Darius could do is not more obnoxious to the new one. _**You just have to accept it and relearn that same champion.  **_ The new Darius has even better stuff than old darius did not have. The main change was the Bloodrage passive. That idea is pretty good. \n\nYou are also forgetting the fact that there are many many item changes. I've used the new Quinn before the buffs she recently received not too long ago and she is pretty good. \n\nAs for the blind removal, I'm completely against that. If they bring back the blind, then this rework will be pretty awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"FracturedJupiter","date":"2015-11-02T03:56:27.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loved Darius when he was first released....\n\n\nDeath followed with every stroke of that bloody cleaver.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-11-02T06:19:36.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now it's of every stroke of that Black Cleaver.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-11-02T05:09:43.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except the Darius rework made minor changes to his kit and playstyle, and he was relatively untouched aside from that. For Quinn, they are changing everything that was core to her. It's not a matter of power, it's a matter of identity and thematic.\n\nHow would you feel it if during the Darius changes, they said that \n>\"we are focusing on Darius being able to poke, so we are changing the ult to 'Darius channels for 2 seconds, then throws his axe out, dealing damage equal to a percentage of his AD'. Also, we are removing the tools that made it possible for him to lane or even go against the usual champions he could face, so he can only be played successfully as a jungler now. Yeah.\"\n\nBecause that's what they've done with Quinn.","replies":[]}]}]}
