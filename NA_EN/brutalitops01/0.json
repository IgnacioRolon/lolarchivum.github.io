And I don't have any tokens left. Which that's another thing, I read on the initial post for the refund tokens that they were supposed to be 3 forever, but I've heard other people saying they've been getting an extra 1 per season. I've never gotten any extra I'm fairly certain. Looking at my account, I'm still at 0 and I used them all up years ago. Just want to ask if I'm supposed to be getting more or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T00:32:49.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, we haven't granted or restored refund tokens.
