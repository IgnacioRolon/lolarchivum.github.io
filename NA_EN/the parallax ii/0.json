I want to level up quick so I can start playing ranked but I don't want to just keep, for lack of a better word, crushing the new players. I really do feel bad for doing so.  \r\nSo here's a question, is grinding Coop vs Ai a good method to level up?  Is it as effective as playing normals? Tbh I feel like Riot should in a way enforce/encourage smurfs to play Coop vs Ai rather than normals in the case that this isn't as effective.","replies":[{"poster":"SeCKS Egai","date":"2015-01-06T19:11:08.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Co-op is efficient to a point - though you'll often see afk leveling bots in the lower levels.\n\nDon't feel too bad, too many new players think they're awesome and need to be taken down a peg or two.  Whether it was co-op or pvp, I lost count of how often new players tried to advise me despite me running circles around them as a random smurf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-01-06T19:59:08.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember seeing the math done on this once and seem to remember that, on average, it's generally more efficient in terms of XP and IP to spam bot games than it is to play vs. players simply because you nearly always win co-op matches.  The small but guaranteed gain from bots outstrips the random boom-and-bust gains of PvP.  So if you already know how to play and are just looking to grind, co-op with a day-long IP/XP booster is probably the way to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2015-01-06T19:56:02.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, even though you might feel bad playing against new players \nits much better than playing against bots\nPlaying against new players(if your good enough)will teach you how to be a leader of a team\nplaying against bots will teach you nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"FarRockBF","date":"2015-01-06T19:16:52.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be very efficient if you rush Mejais/SOTO and win the game under 20 min.

Its faster xp and ip and you'll almost always win.","replies":[]}]}
