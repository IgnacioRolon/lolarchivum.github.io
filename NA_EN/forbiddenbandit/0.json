They also cleaned up UI in order to clearly indicate what is happening on your screen and did the same for champions and effects.\nThey've cut Leveling by half, to make sure new players don't spend an eternity leveling their accounts, both T2 and T3 runes are super cheap and who knows what other kinds of optimizations they can make in the future.\n\nQuite frankly, i feel League is becoming very receptive of new-ish players, not just pampering the old timers like myself (7 years and counting) who are used to heavy grinding for a single 6300 IP champion that was coming out, still not having a single rune under my belt.\n\n##This is something i do enjoy seeing and i like that Riot is trying to reach out to more players of various skill levels and gaming backgrounds.\n##This isn't just my game, this should be everyone's game.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2016-05-05T18:32:34.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not pampering to old players, its embracing the game for what it is.
