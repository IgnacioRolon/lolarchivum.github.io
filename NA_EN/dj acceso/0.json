We understand that it can be difficult to know where the line is, which is why we provide chat logs and we have a few tiers in the ban process in order to allow for you to learn and grow.\n\nThere is nothing in Riot's behavioral rules that excuses toxic chat as long as it's factual. It's technically possible for someone to literally be matched with the worst player on the planet, but there's no reason to spend the match calling them the worst player on the planet. It won't make them better at LoL, it won't make them feel better, and it won't help you win the match. All it will do is make them feel worse, annoy your team, and get you punished for breaking the rules, \"facts\" or not. It's technically true that 2+2=4, but if you announce that fact to your team every four seconds, that's spam and it will annoy them until they mute you, followed by a report and a punishment. It's a true fact, but spamming it is still punishable. Announcing a struggling teammate's score every time they die might be a recitation of fact, but all that does is harass the teammate by calling attention to their poor performance. It won't improve their performance; it might actually exacerbate the problem by tilting them. Scores are factual, but that doesn't make it okay to harass someone.\n\nYou weren't punished for misbehaving in one game. You were punished for misbehaving in _one more_ game, in a consistent pattern of negative behavior that breaks the game's rules. Additionally, the reform card doesn't always show all the logs that led to your punishment: it randomly selects up to several logs. You might see three logs, but you also might see as few as one, even for players whose punishment stems not from a small number of egregious infractions but rather from dozens of instances of mild toxicity. The purpose of the reform card is to tell you how to reform, so it shows you an example of the behavior that prompted your punishment and explains that such behavior is inappropriate and should be avoided if you want to maintain an account in good standing.","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Acceso","date":"2019-08-21T01:57:54.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=i0A5APkx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-08-21T01:48:06.648+0000)\n>\n> You repeatedly call for a forfeit in chat, you call your teammates \"blind\" and \"bad,\" you argued and complained the whole time, you harassed your team by throwing their scores in their faces.\n> \n> Your opinion of the rules is of zero relevance.
