There are many counters like Blitz,Alistar,Taric,Fiddle,Janna,Thresh and other .\n\nThere hole point of picking Zilean was that 40% of total bonus exp . Now its 16% ( technicly even less because you not gona be by ad all the time) . Its not worth it! Imagine cutting down passive of other champions by 60% to 80% ! It would make them useless .\n\nWithout global effect his Passive doesn't really help you in bot lane at all . You will still likely be behind because other champions can zone you .\n\nHere are few ideas:\n\nTimeshift - When Zilean uses an ability it reduces cooldown for all friendly champions nearby by 0.5 second . I think this will help Zilean with late game teamfights considering that he spams his abilities . \n\nDistorted Dimension - Zilean has passive aura that slows all nerby champions by 3% . This aura would help support Zilean poke more safely and also help mid Zilean as well .","replies":[{"poster":"Miku Lv101","date":"2015-01-28T23:02:07.340+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see his passive changed, too.  He's not very exciting and his passive is the only reason he's so good at high level play.  Get to a little a few seconds before enemy team?  Take such a ridiculously huge advantage of those few seconds that he was good just for that, even though there's not that much special about him otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-28T17:26:35.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive it's useless I'l make his actually \"Rewind\" like his passive and put acompletly new skill in his E, he is a Mage Time a very cool theme that can be exploid with a better kit.\n\nNew Passive: Rewind: After using a ability Zilean reduces the cooldowns of all of his other abilities by 6/ 8/ 10 seconds. COOLDOWN:  15 / 11 /  7 at levels 1 / 7 / 14\n\nAdd a little buf in his Time Warp:\n\nZilean slowing an enemy champion or increasing an ally champion's movement speed by 55%** (+ 5% AP)** for a short time.\n\nAnd add a completly new E, something that cause damage (Actually only his Q make damage)\n\nE: Time-Retro-Shift\n\n\"Zilean creates a lapse in time around his target enemy damaging after the shift or friendly champion giving instanly  % dmg reduction.

Enemy team is doing baron and your jungle wants to try and steal, pop this on him, he jumps in smites steals and you warp him back out.","replies":[{"poster":"SouL1ess","date":"2015-01-28T19:12:17.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit no\n\nGlimpse / X marks the Spot are both OP as hell.

CDR of any kind should be specific to said champion, and not altered by allies or enemies. \n\nThe slow aura just seems to be oppressive if it actually worked. Considering that they removed the on hit slow from Randuin's.\n\nPersonally I feel like he needs a kt rework. He has a predicable pattern late game. Which is to get his Ultimate off cooldown as fast as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-02T00:10:15.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you propose?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-01-28T15:35:33.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"zilean need a full rework he is so toxic to play against when he is good","replies":[{"poster":"CoolSpot2","date":"2015-01-28T15:58:21.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No that would be Fizz","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Wild AP Sona","date":"2015-01-28T15:53:05.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CoolSpot2,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=c37AOE55,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-28T15:27:00.633+0000)\n\n> Imagine cutting down passive of other champions by 60% to 80% !
