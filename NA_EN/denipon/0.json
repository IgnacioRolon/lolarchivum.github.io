Whereas Sona has been in this sorry state for 12 whole weeks.  During the initial 4 weeks on PBE, she received both blatant nerfs as well as trade-offs that ultimately resulted as nerfs as well.  Since hitting live, not a single thing has changed other than \"bugs\" nerfing her Q range by up to -150 units.  The -50 range bug that's been around all 12 weeks and the new -100 range bug that appeared in patch 4.16.\n\nPoint being, the team working on Cass is putting in effort, whereas the Sona rework team never cared from the beginning and immediately abandoned her after being rushed to live, contrary to a promised extended time on PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiropat","date":"2014-09-24T19:29:06.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sona is sitting on a +50% win rate in all ranked queues except challenger (and trying to pull meaningfull statistics out of a sample size of 200 is foolhardy).
