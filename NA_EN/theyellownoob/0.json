People just cry 'Oh you're ranged blah blah thats so easy to win', but his sustain and damage is just disguting. You take short trades, he heals back with passive, long trades are hard to win because it gives him a shield and more damage, and post 6 he can just Ult > E > almost guarantee the W.\r\n\r\nI know he's getting slight nerfs next patch, but his damage is untouched and I feel like he just out sustains completely. Any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2020-02-27T21:52:22.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same way you fight any toplaner, afk under tower and wait for botlane to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Nixzilla","date":"2020-02-27T22:54:51.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tr4shB4NSYST3M","date":"2020-02-27T23:14:00.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Earlygame His haymaker is 18sec cooldown, especially as ranged abuse him while its down, make sure to bait it before ganks.  Because of his passive regen it definitely can be tough to finish him off solo unless you're a champ w/ a super strong all in like darius, but if you bait out his W before a good gank he will most likely die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CRIMSONFKR","date":"2020-02-27T23:03:21.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you losing to Sett as quinn then you doing something seriously wrong. Espically if you running a range champ into a melee one.\n\nYou do short trades yes but you want to pressure him off minion waves, and try to freeze it near you. \n\nHe have no real gap closers his q is easy to walk away even in early levels without boots, try to bait out his e since you don't want him to catch you when you e him.\n\nBut other options to take Sett is Aatrox since you can easily poke hime out and with his e you can reposition your self out of his e and w with no problem and your passive healing and ult.\n\nMorde is another good pick with seeker and ninja tabi rush follow up with liandry's make the match a cake walk since morde when he get seeker and ninja tabi sett won't able to hurt him other than center hit w . and ult'ing him is not a bad idea since his stats are good to steal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Slaiyer","date":"2020-02-27T22:02:29.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3006}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iljos","date":"2020-02-27T21:44:17.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"get the fuck out of top lane with the most aids pick in the game eh?","replies":[]}]}
