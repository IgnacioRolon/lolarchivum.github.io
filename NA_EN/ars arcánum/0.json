My wifi dropped and caused me to leave a ranked game, and when I got back in to win the game with my team, I lose all my LP and get a Leaverbuster throw in for good measure. \r\n\r\nI get that it's to hedge against people going 1/9 and saying fuck this and leaving, while their team wins with a handicap, but what about players who have no control over it happening? \r\n\r\nRight before I left, I was carrying this game. I was ganking bot and top when they were losing, taking objectives, and even securing Baron while my jungler farmed up. Disconnected with a score of 12/4/6, and was so ahead I came back to everyone the same level as me. Had it not been for me, we would have had to surrender no doubt. If it were under control, I woudn't have left at all.\r\n\r\nSo why do I get slammed with such a harsh punishment? The system needs to be revamped.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T05:14:51.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You still received leaverbuster penalties because you had left the match long enough to be marked as a leaver.
