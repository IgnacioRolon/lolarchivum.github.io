Such as Sheen and its upgrades, and champions with AA-modifiers such as Vayne's Tumble, Orianna's passive (If that counts?) \n\nThanks in advance~","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2013-10-01T07:54:53.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand it's only basic attacks but let me confirm tomorrow and I'll loop back here.

Apparently the taunt mitigates any autoattack modifier that buffs the damage prior to it being dealt versus it dealing additional damage on top of the basic auto attack. So from what I understand, it could be related specifically to magical damage bonus procs vs. physical damage (in that physical damage can be folded into the initial attack, whereas magical damage is added after).\n\nSo Sheen / Tumble / physical damage bonus modifiers would be mitigated.\nOrianna passive / Lich Bane / etc would be added on as bonus non-mitigated damage.\n\nI think!\n\nComplicated yo.","replies":[{"poster":"ElvenStrike","date":"2013-10-02T02:00:50.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Pwyff!\n\nSo that means things like Aatrox W, Jax W, Ziggs passive and almost everything else should be mitigated.\n\nBut, from the context of the patch, it means in that the exceptional  case of Poppy, her entire Q damage should be halfed right? \n\nSorry if the question  came late! I was going through  possible  magic autos to make sure we got this clarified :D\n\n-Elven","replies":[{"poster":"PWYFF","date":"2013-10-02T17:43:05.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU'RE MAKING THIS MORE COMPLICATED. From what I understand, Aatrox W would be mitigated, Jax and Ziggs would NOT be mitigated (as it's magic damage buffed on top), while Poppy... Poppy would be mitigated? Because it replaces the entirety of the auto attack?\n\nIt's the way things are coded. I assume it's not arbitrary but it requires a little more nuance.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lunie","date":"2013-10-01T19:34:06.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the details about this have me confused about whether it affects on-hit effects.
