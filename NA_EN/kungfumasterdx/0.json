I've been using my resolution I always have been using. All of a sudden it says \"cannot display this video mode, change computer display input to 1680x1050\" hehe sry for my potato but if I put it on 1680x1050 I lag but if I lower it to 1024x768(the lowest I can) what shows above pops up? Is there a reason why this happens as I lower my resolution? Another note, when I increase it the problem still persists","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-13T05:35:59.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're experiencing the known bug with Fullscreen resolutions in 7.1 listed on the [**Service Status Page.**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/) You hit the *Alt+Tab* keys at the same time once you enter the loading screen to workaround this issue.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
