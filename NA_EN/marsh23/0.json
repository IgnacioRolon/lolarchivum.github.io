Shortly after, the patching was gone and when I tried to reopen client, it didn't open. Went through Hextech and reinstalled multiple times. After I reinstalled, I had to upgrade to the new client. After it finished loading and I hit launch, the client disappears nothing ever launches. I know many others are having this problem. I guarantee it's no connection issue and something with the new patch is causing issues on MAC. Anyone have any solutions? Also, can riot see that so many people are having this problem and it's not our connection???","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-19T23:55:00.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's weird that it would stop responding suddenly, but I'd like to help!   Give your pc a reset just in case something crashed in the background.  If it's still happening then something could have happened with your connection that's failing to launch the patcher.  Run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help, but be sure to use the Mac instructions.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Marsh23","date":"2017-05-20T22:35:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: I've reinstalled, gone through connection protocol, done Hextech, and rebooted computer (mac).  Now that my game has reinstalled, I have to launch the new client. When I hit launch, the client disappears and nothing opens. Lots of people are having this problem on their MAC. Can riot look into this or are you guys going to keep saying it's our connection? Been at it for the last 6 hours and have made ZERO progress.

Connection is perfect, and I have followed all the steps on \"patcher not working\". Honestly it's the patch not going well with MAC. It's not connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Draconic PoweR","date":"2017-05-20T00:22:39.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot made a topic about Direct X Errors but haven't even made a topic regarding issues with the MAC client, despite many more posts being about that then anything else in the help and support sub section. They know it's the patch that is causing the issue. They just don't have a fix yet and making some of the  other Rioters use copy and paste quotes to keep us at bay for now. Well, it's the weekend and they aren't going to be wanting to work on this issue, I'm sure they will wait. Sucks for us, but it doesn't matter to them. It is not a connections issue,  nor a permissions issue. It is an issue with patch 7.10. This is why they should not have abandoned the Legacy client so soon imo. The new client is clearly not optimized enough yet to support both Pcs and Macs.","replies":[{"poster":"Marsh23","date":"2017-05-20T19:41:18.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree. I went through their whole connection issues and everything matched but still doesn't work. Hope they can fix this. I don't understand why some of my friends (with MAC) have their game working.
