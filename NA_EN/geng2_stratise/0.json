They introduced a feature where if someone on your side of a Co-Op vs AI is totally inactive then the AI would compensate by shutting down Bot Player 2.

Patch 8.14 was deployed on 7/18. That was the patch when they introduced the \"play a bot game with a friend below level 15\" mission. So they changed something in the Coop vs AI game mode and did not test it thoroughly. Hopefully, they did not do it intentionally to make it easier for the low level players. That mission is going on for another 3 weeks..... The problem is not with the AIs themselves, because custom AI games work fine. It's the Coop vs AI game mode that is messed up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xaintrix","date":"2018-08-04T19:11:28.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which means preseason next year at this rate.","replies":[]}]}
