This scaling problem only appears on resolutions 1366x768 or lower. Until we fix this problem with the login screen, the only workaround is to adjust your resolution over 1366x768. \n\nThanks for the report none the less!","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Hug","date":"2015-02-13T20:04:37.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it's been like that for me too, ever since a few patches before. If you stop the animation, it goes back to normal again, but of course, it'd be cool if the animation would fit too.\n\nNot the biggest of problems at all, but it would be cool if they fixed it sometime when they have time on their hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goggalore","date":"2015-02-13T17:37:55.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been happening to me too. Mainly I just want to know why. If I remember correctly it went back to normal at the end of the Kalista screen, but then they switched to Rek'Sai a day or two later and it went right back to this.","replies":[]}]}
