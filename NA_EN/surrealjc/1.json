Please.... let me be rewarded for practicing 1v5s.  Its way too difficult trying to master champs against other highly skilled OR skilless players.  Is there any logical reason for not allowing IP for custom games that give you a disadvantage?  Bots exist, they're going to join public games anyways so this is not a preventative measure.","replies":[{"poster":"Tehemai","date":"2014-12-07T08:20:38.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They won't do this because then ip farming bots can be made.","replies":[{"poster":"SurrealJC","date":"2014-12-07T08:35:31.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"IP farming bots have been made... and they join the public ques in 5v5's.  I suppose they might get reported if people notice.  They can only get so much IP per day anyways.  The only difference I see is that people might report them if they're forced to join public games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ƒæµ","date":"2014-12-07T08:23:19.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you want real practice you can play normals, dom, or TT. Custom games giving IP would cause a ton of issues with IP farming bots and we would have a flood of boosting, sales of accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-07T12:28:02.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots flooding custom games would be a good thing.

Playing vs people is intense but its not really good practice.  You don't get punished as badly for trying out new spell combos vs computers.  It's not really practice when you feed your opponent then just get crushed over and over.  Id rather spend 1 long game vs computers than 4 long losing games vs people before I know how to use my champions spells for optimum damage/time output.","replies":[]}]}]}
