Which is the one thing people absolutely hated about her. Now she busts tanks more than she busts the squishies early game, and is still one of the easiest to gank ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-11-29T20:34:24.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is they tried to shift all of her dmg to her silver bolts, but they didnt take away her AD. They claimed her dmg would come from her W but the problem is noone builds bork on her anymore...which was a low attack dmg, but high % dmg item. This, in turn, kept her AD rather low but gave her more % dmg. Now everyone just builds a bunch of high AD items and she ends up having the same amount of AD as every other adc, while still having massive % dmg. She gets the best of both worlds, thats the problem. And until they find a way to balance it out, shes going to be broken. like i suggested before....maybe she should only get 50% or 75% of the normal AD she would get from items. Then she would HAVE to play around her silver bolts cuz just poking with autos and constantly switching targets would severely hurt her. It would give her a weakness, cuz right now she doesnt have one. Her laning phase is weaker than it was in season 5, but its still way too good. I also think they should remove the bonus AD she gets from her ult cuz she doesnt need it at all. I dunno i could talk for hours about how broken she is, just as an overall champion period, not just her kit. But alas.....it'll be in VAYNE!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MiTsuO Akai","date":"2015-11-29T18:22:46.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OH NO!!! Don't say that...

On a 600 health character like Jax, that's like ~90 at the most for the proc. It doesn't help Vayne that Jax is one of the champions top lane who absolutely destroys her, as is Quinn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Francisco Pires","date":"2015-11-29T18:52:04.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AND THE WORST IS FUCKING VAYNE TOP.\nI was playing as renekton top, the enemy had vayne top, with flash and exaust.\nI tried to play defensive, because I knew she would just kite me if i tried to fight. she kept poking me, by auto attacking , pressing q auto attacking (wow, those skills). So I tried to be agressive. At 3/4 hp, I used my E, she immediately knocked me back before i could even press Q, then exausted me and simply auto attacked me to death, I couldn't even run to my turret. First blood. I teleported to lane, let her farm 1 entire wave, so I could farm in turret. she kept auto attacking me at max turret range, if i wanted to lasthit 1 minion, she would use 3 basics, half my hp was gone, and she would Q away, taking 1 turret hit. My jungler refused to gank.\nEnded 1-9-2, report renekton for feed... Vayne PUSHED UNTIL TURRET THE WHOLE LANING PHASE, easy to gank. I couldn't trade, even less kill,  couldn't farm and the only way to survive was staying afk in the middle of the turret, without farming or doing anything at all.","replies":[]}]}
