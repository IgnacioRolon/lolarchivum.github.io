First off his voidlings shouldn't have the movement speed that they do...you cannot even come close to out running them. Second of all their leash radius is insane. I just played {{champion:157}}  against him (which is a bad matchup for {{champion:157}}  in the first place) and he was able to just barely get in range of me to land his malefic visions, which made the voidlings instantly target me. I tried to run away but you cant, got all the way behind my tower and they were still chasing me at the speed of light attacking me. Couldnt outrun them so they did almost 700 dmg to me at lvl 6-7. There is literally no way to play around that stupid shit. You cant just wait and farm under turret cuz then malz will just poke you to death. You cant get near the minions in lane cuz if you get hit with malefic visions youre dead, due to the voidlings aggro'ing you instantly. Oh and wait....if you try to just say \"eff it\" and go aggro on {{champion:90}} , rather than getting zoned out or poked to death under tower, he's got that OP passive shield and his silence! LoL Being stuck playing a melee champion against him is the most oppressive thing i've come across in the game in a long time. You cant farm for crap, you cant stay safe under tower, and you cant even try to trade with him in short bursts cuz of the shield. Also you cant really even say to trade with him when his W is on cooldown b\\c when it IS on cooldown, his army of voidlings is out...and when its not he'll just spawn one right on top of you which will spawn another one, and another one, and so on.....plus the malefic visions again. The whole damn kit is broken. Who ACTUALLY saw this kit at Riot and thought...yea thats good?! Holy hell man....","replies":[{"poster":"Arkale","date":"2016-05-10T04:45:33.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But they get one shotted by the tower, and if you pass a minion after malefic visions wears off, they will be attracted to it instead.\n\nMoral of the story: don't get hit by malefic visions and stay at your minion wave","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcade Andrew","date":"2016-05-10T03:50:57.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they literally just nerfed him, also this is healthy for him, he was very underpowered before the mage update","replies":[]}]}
