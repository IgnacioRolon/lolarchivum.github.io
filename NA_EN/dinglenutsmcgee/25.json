But now i realize its more than that. I just played a game where i was tristana adc and the enemy veigar would try to ult me every single fight...(smart on his part cuz i was doing the best on my team). But his ultimate was doing just under 1,500 damage. I was playing adc....i dont even have any ability power and his ult is allowed to do that much dmg. How is that even remotely balanced?! He's supposed to be an anti-MAGE....his ult needs to be adjusted so it does less damage to AD champions. Just think if youre an AP midlaner against him. He doesnt even need to press any other button. just walk up to you, press R and do 2,000 dmg. It can stay the way it is now, just the dmg and scaling needs to be adjusted. Just my opinion tho","replies":[{"poster":"Void Nargacuga","date":"2015-10-25T23:01:00.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Got this from [here](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Veigar).\n\n{{champion:45}}'s WHOLE kit info:\nPassive - Equilibrium: Veigar's mana regeneration is increased by 1.5% per 1% missing man\n\nQ - Baleful Strike: Passive: Veigar permanently gains ability power every time he scores a kill/assist against an enemy champion.\nWhenever Veigar kills a unit with Baleful Strike, he gains +1 AP, doubled to +2 AP against large monsters, large minions and champions.\nActive: Veigar unleashes a bolt of dark energy, dealing magic damage to the first two units hit.\n\n    Magic Damage: 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+ 60% AP)\n\nW - Dark Matter: Veigar calls a mass of dark matter to fall from the sky to the target location, which lands after a 1.25 second delay, dealing magic damage to all units hit. \n\n    Magic Damage: 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 / 320 (+ 100% AP)\n\nE - Event Horizon: Veigar forms a cage around the target area which materializes after a 0.5 second delay and lasts for 3 seconds, Airborne icon knocking down and Stun icon stunning all units who pass through its edges for the first time. \n\n    Stun Duration: 1.5 / 1.75 / 2 / 2.25 / 2.5\n\nR - Primordial Burst: Veigar blasts the target enemy champion with primordial energy, dealing them magic damage. \n\n    Magic Damage: 250 / 375 / 500 (+ 100% AP) (+ 80% of target's AP)\n\nGetting something like {{item:3156}} &/or {{item:3139}} would be good items. Maw gives a magic damage absorbing shield and Scimitar gives you a {{item:3140}} active to cleanse his stun. {{item:3102}} Is also a good item to use against him. He isn't \"Broken\" just learn to deal with him. Weirdest item that can make a Veigar player mad: {{item:3157}} due to its passive making his ult go poof and be wasted on ANY target if used when it comes at you. Its a TARGETED ult once it travels it WILL hit... Unless a {{champion:157}}'s Windwall or {{champion:201}}'s Unbreakable get in the way. Those work too. Hope this helps you make (eventually me) any {{champion:45}} main MAD as hell.","replies":[]}]}
