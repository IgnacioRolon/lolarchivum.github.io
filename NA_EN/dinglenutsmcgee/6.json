This is basically an indirect nerf to a lot of champions who purchase these items which have abilities that scale off of AP.  {{champion:42}}{{champion:96}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:83}}  {{champion:81}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:120}}  {{champion:24}} . I feel like Riot really didnt think this one though. Unless their adding another similar item that grants AP. I dunno.....im just not a fan of this change as it stands. Too many champion indirectly affected. Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2015-10-30T16:59:27.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only a few of those champions actually buy it.
