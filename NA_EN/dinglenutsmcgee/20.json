You used to be able to take him and assert your dominance during laning phase, but now all the other adc's can easily keep up with him damage wise. So without the crazy early damage, what does he have to offer? Nothing. You can get too eeeeeasily out-traded now in almost every encounter. Before you could hit the enemy with like 2 spinning axes and get them to around 50%-60% health, but now you do that and then get hit with one spell and an auto and its even. I dunno....{{champion:119}}  just seems like the thing hes supposed to do best, which is out damage all the other adc's, he cant do anymore. Which then leaves him in this weird limbo where hes not garbage tier, but hes also not very viable either. Maybe some sort of mechanic where the damage on his Q amplifies with every axe catch?? And then when you stop attacking something it resets, or if you drop an axe. This is all just from my experience and games with him, what does everyone else think?","replies":[]}
