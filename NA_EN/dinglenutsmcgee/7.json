If youre using thunderlords on ADC's period then i feel bad for you. The dmg output you get from fervor is 10x's higher than what you get from thunderlords. Ive done both on Lucian recently and fervor is just soooo much better. Just reminding everyone that there are other good keystones and thunderlords isnt the only one that exists","replies":[{"poster":"KirynDawn","date":"2015-12-22T15:21:21.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use undying grasp on adc's usually","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2015-12-22T15:30:09.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KirynDawn,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=grfI1W7h,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-22T15:21:21.036+0000)\n>\n> I use undying grasp on adc's usually\n\nUmm so you can do an extra 30 damage and healing every 4 seconds?
