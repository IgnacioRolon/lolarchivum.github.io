Riot claims its one of the smartest AI's they've ever made in game. From what I've seen so far, that isnt saying much. Numerous numerous times in the gameplays that i've watched, Ive seen his ult lady take turret aggro in situations where it makes no sense. Example....she'll be walking down the lane with a wave, and instead of stopping for 1-2sec to let the minions go in front of her, she keeps on going and walks into turret range tanking the turret until she dies in a couple seconds. Seems like a complete and utter waste to me since you cant control her to move her away from the turret to drop the aggro. For an ultimate ability shes pretty damn stupid as an AI. If she were a non-ultimate ability then i could understand her being stupid, but shes not. Its almost a waste of your time to use her for pushing down turrets cuz she will just walk in, take aggro, and die 3 sec later. If she could detect turrets and turret aggro then she would be a decent ultimate. But until then its a pretty bad ult for what its intended to be","replies":[{"poster":"CrazFight ","date":"2016-09-06T22:26:21.562+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Best AI\" - Looks at riots other AI, realizes that i shouldn't expect much.","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-09-07T03:16:55.148+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"Best AI\"\n\n*Coded as minion*","replies":[{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2016-09-07T22:31:08.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Coded as {{champion:266}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Veltox","date":"2016-09-06T23:52:53.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Other reason we need the new client asap.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2016-09-07T20:49:34.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Client and the actual game use two different programs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S0kaX","date":"2016-09-06T22:30:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazFight,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=1EagEsUo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-06T22:26:21.562+0000)\n>\n> &quot;Best AI&quot; - Looks at riots other AI, realizes that i shouldn&#x27;t expect much.\n\nYep","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-09-07T09:47:39.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just realized {{champion:83}} is going to be one of the few champs that can get a buff from just improving the AI's intelligence on his ult.

Though he gets gold for what she kills, it looks more frustrating to yorick since he looses the ability to manage his map pressure.

A champion I can see why, but minions? That's more of an issue with yorick being fun to play in the first place due to being unable to retain control over his abilities. \nImagine if marksmen's auto-attacks didn't go towards who they clicked on, but randomly at whoever was in range; yeah it'd be most frustrating to said marksman, that's what I'm getting at.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2016-09-07T16:46:46.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the \"best ai they ever made\" means they copied Tyler1 play pattern and put it into a minion.... \"run it down mid\"","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2016-09-07T18:07:10.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only improvement I can see, is that it prioritizes attacking champions over minions, lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BobaFlautist","date":"2016-09-07T16:56:19.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if she gets tilted and goes into \"Run it down mid\" mode (by approaching a lane) but then you e a nearby jungle camp or enemy champion in the jungle within her aggro range?
