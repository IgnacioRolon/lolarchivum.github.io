They claim to hate toxicity, yet they're enforcing a meta/gameplay style that breeds it. How healthy is it for the game to be balancing on a knife's edge for the first 10 minutes?? One team reaches 5 kills to the other teams 0 and its GG ff@20. In the 5 games I've played today thus far, 4 of them have been exactly this way. 2 in my favor and 2 the other way. It's the most unfun this game has ever been to me. The entire game balances on whichever team doesn't feed wins, 9/10 times. And then the losing team starts pissing and whining at each other blaming everyone and calling them feeders. Idk...its just pretty hypocritical to me that Riot claims to want to get rid of toxic players and then forces a gameplay style upon you which causes major tension between teammates. It's extremely unhealthy for the game in my opinion. \r\n\r\nI also think a major factor in Riot's reasoning for forcing this meta is b\\c they felt the LCS was quite boring last year. But here's the thing Riot....99% of LoL players couldn't care less about the LCS. It gets like 50k-150k viewers on twitch.tv when its on....which compared to the 67 million players worldwide is a pretty meaningless number. So why base balancing changes upon the LCS or what happens in it?! The whole thing is rather mind-boggling to me honestly but whatever. If anyone has anything constructive to add then feel free, but I wont respond to thoughtless or rude replies. Have a lovely day!","replies":[]}
