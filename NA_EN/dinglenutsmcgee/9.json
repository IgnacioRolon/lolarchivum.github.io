If youre having constant ping problems all game then please just explain your issue and then afk (most decent ppl wont report you). That is way better than being useless to your team and feeding free kills to the enemy. Just had a talon who claimed his ping was over 2000 and still continued to try and play. Didnt exit league and try to reconnect, nothing. Teamfights and objectives come up and since your there, we expect you to do your job....but no he would end up literally standing in place until someone killed him. That is way more detrimental to your team than just going afk.","replies":[{"poster":"Resolution","date":"2016-05-16T18:17:39.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should be a minimum ping cut off that disallows you from playing League - I know some shooter games do this if you have over 400 ping, they won't even let you enter a game. Riot dosen't get that having someone with 500 permanent ping on your team only hurts your team, not only them - and there's 0 recourse for having someone who can't play on your team... but still runs around going \"SORRY CAN\"T PLAY!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Vindictive Ex Gf","date":"2016-05-16T18:47:31.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This will cut off people playing from other regions. A person playing from overseas can sometimes have high ping spike periods in game. Honestly I just think if people are going to complain about others having high ping then we shouldn't be allowed to play region to region.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-05-16T17:39:45.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think something does need to be done to those players who do play with high ping and don't care about team mates....random ping spikes happen, but if it's a constant high, then either have it go back to Queue and find a replacement for them, or just have the option to have everyone leave game, with no punishment and loss prevented.","replies":[]},{"poster":"daemanic","date":"2016-05-16T17:36:43.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a game last night where the yas dc'd for the first 5 min i was vieg he came back to state he was having internet issues and then proceeds to run down mid stop right infront of my tower just out of range and stands there gives me a kill and proceeds to do it over and over again after about 5 kills he jsut started standing under tower and being exicuted (lets put it this way i felt so bad for the jung i couldnt keep using him like that) just for kills he ended with 17 deaths and 1 kill he got when he wasnt standing around and his whole team was so nasty to him its just sad he should have just sat in base til stuff came back relogged and see if that helps since he could have came back if he had jsut restarted at the start","replies":[]}]}
