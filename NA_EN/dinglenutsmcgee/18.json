Its completely unbalanced to remove mana pots altogether. Top lane is where i see the biggest issues with this coming into play, but also the other lanes. Champions like {{champion:266}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:157}} can completely dominate the lane b\\c they dont use mana. It's going to create an oppressive meta where mana using champions cant stay in lane long enough to do anything without running out of mana. My thought process is that if riot is removing mana pots, then they need to ATLEAST double the base mana regen on all mana champions. Not give everyone +50 starting mana in their pool, thats a joke. How can they possibly think removing mana pots without giving some sort of bonus to regen is a legitimate plan?? This is the most mind-boggling decision i have ever seen Riot make. What is someone like {{champion:91}} or {{champion:54}}  supposed to do in laning phase?  They absolutely depend HEAVILY on buying mana pots to last in lane. Whereas Riven or Garen can stay in lane for 20 min if they want without any issue. I dunno.....Riot has completely lost me on this one and it makes absolutely 0 sense to me. And i know theres that stupid thing thats similar to flask now that has 5 charges, but it costs 500g!! Seems a little asinine to me to spend that much of your early gold income just for that item alone.","replies":[{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2015-11-12T15:20:57.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:8}} It's our time to shine.\n\n{{item:3123}} is purchased for 800G.\n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:8}}  Well, it was fun while it lasted.\n------------------------\nFor the removal of Crystalline Flask and Mana Potions, it's honestly not that bad for a lot of champions.\n\n{{item:2033}} is basically a combat-oriented Crystalline Flask.  While you can't buy additional potions with it, it now gives bonus true damage to champions on basic attacks and abilities while you are consuming charges.\n\nChampions who rush {{item:3070}} , {{item:3110}} , or {{item:3057}}  can start with Sapphire Crystal (which now gives 250 mana) and either 3 Health Potions or a Refillable Potion.\n\nAP champions can continue starting {{item:1056}}  since the mana regen on the item was buffed significantly as you level.  It starts out on 3-4 Mp5 and increases as you level up.\n\nAnd if you can't take either of them, you can always take Meditation in the Cunning Tree.  You sacrifice the damage amplificiation while they are below 40% health, but you are basically trading burst damage for mana sustain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"61939590DEL1","date":"2015-11-12T15:19:28.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to savage your mana or you may need to buy 2 items. {{item:3040}} {{item:3174}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swizzle","date":"2015-11-12T06:52:56.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had no problem with this nor has any of my teammates all day.
