I was playing an aram in this last installment of dealing with her, as varus. I bought a Maw for the MR and armor pen, a Steraks for the massive shield, and i had Barrier (i know Maw and Steraks dont stack anymore)....she presses R and her ult goes thru all of it + my whole HP bar. THAT is broken....not to mention the unnecessarily huge range on her R and E. Press Q a couple times to get some spheres out and then R.....2000+ dmg....such skill, much wow. You ppl think im crazy but im telling you, i've always been good when it comes to telling if something is just strong or needs nerfed. There is a difference. Syndra is quietly hiding behind a low play rate &amp; middle of the pack win rate....but she's OP. Just watch.......it'll happen","replies":[{"poster":"archerno1","date":"2016-07-24T16:15:54.171+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"She isnt op, her high damage output compensates for her lack of mobility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scary Door","date":"2016-07-24T16:30:30.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra pros and cons: \n\n_Pros:_  \n\n- High/burst damage, arguably top 5 highest damage combos in the game.  \n- Hard CC,\n- Spammable/low cooldown abilities (Q/W especially), \n- Good waveclear\n- Throws minions, monsters and other objects, pretty fun!\n- Does a great job at killing squishies\n\n_Cons:_\n\n- **No mobility.**  In a game with mobility creep this is a HUGE negative.  \n- Abilities are relatively easy to avoid/Fairly obvious.\n- Three-out-of-four abilities are skill shots. \n- While abilities _are_ spammable, fairly high mana costs make her easily pushed out of lane if not careful, which leads us to...\n- Uses mana - Yasuo and Zed do not use mana... better make sure at least one of these is banned or it's no fun to play Syndra mid. \n- Decent in team fights, but far better at nuking a single target.  \n- Not good against tanky teams\n\n--\n\nSyndra is actually fairly balanced right now, she has generally been in an okay spot but her skillcap makes her far less desirable to play because there are better, more mobile, more casual-player friendly champs out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheUltimateSpear","date":"2016-07-29T01:23:18.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A full-damage glass cannon champion like Syndra will not be OP so long as other damage heavy champs can effectively itemize hybrid offense/defense items while she cannot. \n\n{{item:3155}} {{item:3156}} ( {{item:3001}} {{item:3139}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madra","date":"2016-07-24T16:22:27.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra is strong, but drawing conclusions from an ARAM isn't that valid.  The ARAM map removes her biggest weakness while prioritizing her long range CC and damage potential.  I mean, she's always going to have targets in front of her so she can stack orbs to her heart's content and there is no flanks or ganks to punish her when she misses her stun.","replies":[]}]}
