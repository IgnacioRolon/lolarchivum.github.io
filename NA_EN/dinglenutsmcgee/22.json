I can't put up with the bad players anymore. People don't understand simple concepts, and basic strategies of this game. Its all teamfights and 1v1's 24/7...for no reason other than for the hell of it. If you aren't going for an objective then there's really no reason to be fighting the enemy...unless the % of winning it is clearly in your favor. But all anyone wants to do is play TDM...and thats not how you compile a successful win rate in ranked. Playing smart and making good decisions in game is how you win at a decent rate. But when I'm the only person who understand this....I get held down by everyone else who thinks the fight 24/7 way. \r\n\r\nAll anyone does is feed. You're guaranteed in more than half of games to always have 2 people on your team that feed uncontrollably. I'm not saying I don't have a bad game or 2 sometimes, but I rarely ever die 10 times in an entire game, let alone 7+ times in the first 15-20 minutes. It's at the point where I've started playing Smite instead of League, and its way more fun than League is to me nowadays. I've pretty much always been a mid-gold level player, this season I'm silver 1 cuz I haven't played much ranked. The will to climb just isn't there for me, when I know I can expect people to feed in every game I play. Constantly being held down by your team, who combine for 20 deaths in the first 15 minutes is ridiculous. At that point it doesn't matter how well I play, there reaches a point where the enemy team is just too far ahead for one player to carry a bunch of ppl who fed. Idk when the game got this way, but players only know one way to play the game now...balls to the wall aggressive...feast or famine. They constantly fight their lane opponent over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over trying to get a bunch of kills and carry.....when more often than not, it results in them getting wrecked and feeding. Ppl don't understand the concept that if you die to your lane opponent even 1 time....you should avoid fighting them at all costs for the rest of laning, unless you get a gank or they make a really stupid mistake you can capitalize on. Just 1 kill puts you behind in items and gold. What happened to using smarts and strategy to win your lane?! I farm like crazy and always wait for the right opportunity to strike. If you play smart like that, you'll win your lane more often than not. But other players don't think that way....they act as though there's some contract they signed which stipulates that they must try to fight/all-in their opponent at least 15 times in laning phase....even when really behind. Idk how it got so bad....but people don't want to learn the game anymore, they just want to play team deathmatch and hope they come out on top. Good luck with that strategy. You're only giving yourself a 50% chance of winning if you play like that....cuz you're either going to destroy or get destroyed. Wheres if you play smart, farm it out, capitalize on mistakes, think 2 moves ahead, you can increase your % of winning by not making stupid decisions. \r\n\r\nLike to me, laning phase is fun. I like the whole farming and trading aspect of it. Whoever has better micro skills, will usually come out on top. But I swear...the only reason other players are ALWAYS fighting their lane opponent is b\\c they get bored just sitting there and farming. Like if they aren't 1v1'ing their opponent they're bored, and they start a fight just for the hell of it. LANING/FARMING IS PART OF THE GAME...GET USED TO IT! You don't have to get 15 kills in laning phase to win the game...if you farm well and play smart (by not dying) you can come out of laning ahead, or at worst break even. So what if you don't have any kills yet?! You got plenty of farm and now you play as a team and use the items you got from farming to make a difference in teamfights and objectives. You may not have gotten any kills to snowball in the early game.....but guess what!? You also didn't put your team at a severe disadvantage by dying 8 times in laning phase either. I would much rather have a teammate come out of laning phase 0/0/0 with plenty of farm, rather than have a guy who went 7/7/4 in laning phase. You may have gotten kills yourself, but you gave just as many back to the enemy....so its even!! You didnt come out on top! \r\n\r\nIt's not even the game anymore that frustrates me, it's the playerbase and their inability to play the game the right way. I swear I'm the last of a dying breed...a player who uses his brain and thinks before i do things in game. I don't fight my opponent just for shits and giggles and hope i win...i wait until my chance of winning a fight is highest, and then i go. That is how you use your skill to your advantage. Outplay/outsmart the enemy. But if you fight just for the sake of fighting....that is how you end up feeding my friends. But unfortunately thats all anyone in this game is good at anymore. They're either going to get 15 kills in laning phase and carry.....or they're going to die 15 times. No consistency from game to game. League of Legends is not Call of Duty.....it's not about killing every single person you see, the second you see them. While killing the enemy IS part of the game, its not everything. I see crap like this everyday....where if someone on your team sees an enemy in the river/jungle...they immediately (without even thinking) run directly for them with no regard for where the rest of the enemy team is, or if you have vision of the area or not. 9 times out of 10 I watch this teammate run blindly in the fog of war, chasing after an enemy, only to come around a corner and come face to face with 3 other enemies. Boom, your dead! Your insane over-aggressiveness and lack of thought about the situation got you (and maybe others) killed...again. \r\n\r\nThere just comes a point in a game where your teammates put you at such a disadvantage, that there's no way to come back from it. Its not like they're all of a sudden going to change their ways and play smart after dying 10 times. The damage has been done. 1 player cannot make up for the mistakes and insane feeding of half (or more) of his team. When i have bot lanes who finish the game 2/19....or add the top laners score into that, and the 3 of them combine to go 6/31...IN GOLD ELO! How in the hell do you make up for garbage like that?!? You cant man! It would be one thing if this was a once in a while thing, but its not. Its damn near every other game, or every 3rd game. I don't even know anymore....I'll be playing a lot more Smite from here on. I'll check back with League from time to time, but I dont expect things to change...players are just bad now. Peace I'm out\r\n\r\n**RANT OVER**","replies":[]}
