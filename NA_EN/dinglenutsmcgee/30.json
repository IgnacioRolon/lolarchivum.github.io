Also the end of season ward...thats the best anyone can come up with?! look at season 3's ward...it had movement to it and actually looks like it took some thought. this years ward looks like ya'll didnt even try. whatever tho....i'm just one fan who's extremely disappointed this time around. all that hard work on 3 accounts in ranked for nothing","replies":[{"poster":"Zombiemaster","date":"2015-09-02T18:35:44.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope you know that the Championship skins ARE NOT the ranked reward skins, the Victorious skins are, and this year's Victorious skin has yet to be announced. The Championship skins are the ones that are released in the shop for 975 RP sometime after Worlds, like how Championship Thresh and Shyvana were.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinister Anubis","date":"2015-09-02T16:25:59.714+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The skin looks amazing and she was probably one of the strongest and most played adc this season next to vayne. She still my top pick this season with over 150+ games\n\nEdit: She still has same skin from release and she was release almost a year ago something like 11 months","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cardmant","date":"2015-09-02T16:25:03.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the championship skin dosen't even look good; it just looks like a chroma for original kalista","replies":[]}]}
