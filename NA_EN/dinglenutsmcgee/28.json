During the game, everything on my screen will basically just freeze in place. Sometimes everything is frozen except for a champion or 2 just wandering off in a random direction. And it does this for about 5-10 seconds and then unfreezes. Then a minute or 2 later it'll do it again. This happens all throughout the game, not just once or twice. Its unplayable. Sometimes the attempting to reconnect message appears when this happens and sometimes it doesnt. I've seen other ppl online have the same problem, and they claim their ping jumps to like 500 when this happens, but that doesnt happen to me. My ping remains the same as it always is when it happens. I only have a connection issue with LoL, no other games at all. It's not my internet, and i have a really nice pc...so im completely lost on what the problem is. My girlfriend also plays league and sits right next to me while we play. This will start happening to me, while she's experiencing no problem at all on the same internet connection. Which tells me it isn't my internet. Does anyone have any idea whats going on here, or how they can help??","replies":[]}
