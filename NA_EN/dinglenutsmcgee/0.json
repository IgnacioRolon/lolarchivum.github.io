Why is this exactly?! I would definitely play that! It would be a nice change of pace from 5v5 SR solo queue. Lets say youre having a bad day in SR solo queue but you still want to play some ranked, you should be able to go into 3v3 and play. Idk maybe its just me who would like this but anyone else have thoughts??","replies":[{"poster":"MudintheWater","date":"2015-09-30T17:41:15.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I had to guess I would say it is because 3V3 is already a fast paced game that requires better coordination and fastr responses than 5V5 - a 2s delay on a missing ping can mean a death in 3v3, and if you're solo queuing that coordination is harder to achieve. I could imagine 3v3 SoloQueue being super toxic with lots of \"gg nobs don't ping\" because of this.","replies":[]}]}
