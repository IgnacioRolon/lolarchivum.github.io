Though I can't check the overall match on what items where built when. Especially when I look it up with [Op.gg](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=LastBreathX). If I had the actual match history maybe I could pull more infomation. But with op.gg its pretty lacking since its not a ranked game. Maybe I could try checking Replay.gg and see if the match was recorded but that takes some time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Siyther","date":"2016-07-13T17:20:23.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a yi gets deleted in game      good lol     her damage is fine you are squishy","replies":[]}]}
