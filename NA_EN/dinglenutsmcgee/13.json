It gets to the point where all the enemy has left is their nexus. I start attacking the Nexus....my team starts pinging me 100x's to back off and not hit it. I said Im trying to win the game, isn't that the point?? One of the ppl responded with, we're trying to have fun. Then I said I think its unsportmanlike to rub destroying them in their faces and i dont want to be that piece of crap. Fast forward to end game chat, and my team says theyre all reporting me and asked the enemy team to do it also. I got reported for being sportmanlike and winning a game!!! Is this what this game has come to??? Where if you do the actual right thing you get reported by everyone?!? This community is sickening. Riot needs to take away the report button from people. I did absolutely nothing wrong, in fact, I was the ONLY one being sportmanlike on my team and i get reported for it?!?! Srsly people?! Just because i didn't want to rub in their faces by extending the embarrassment....just.....WOW!","replies":[{"poster":"LaoBushido","date":"2016-01-15T18:46:12.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an unjustified report you may get a warning because that is an automated system but you won't get punished in anyway shape or form for ending the game , unless you type something like ggez","replies":[]}]}
