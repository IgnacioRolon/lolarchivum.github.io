But i have played 6 games so far today and in every single one there has been at least one person disconnected from the game. MY g\\f is also having the same exact problem...to this point shes played 4 games and has had atleast 1 dc in all of them. This is my biggest issue with Riot and LoL. There are just waaaaay too many disconnects and ppl who never connect at all. Yet since ive been playing league, over 3 years now, i have yet to see connection problems get any better. In all honesty i would say that there is a dc in approximately 35-40% of games.....thats absolutely ridiculous!! There is no excuse for that Riot!","replies":[]}
