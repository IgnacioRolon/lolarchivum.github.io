Im ranked in gold and I cant play a single game without having AT LEAST 1 troll on either mine or the enemy team. I used to love league but now, i cant stand to play it for longer than a game or 2 before i get pissed with the trolling and quit. I just played a game with a velkoz support and i was adc....velkoz took smite instead of exhaust and proceeded to steal every single cannon minion from me, on top of constantly using his abilities on the wave and stealing half my farm. He then also fed the enemy ashe 7 kills in less than 11 minutes, because every time he returned to lane after dying he proceeded to immediately try to dive on the adc and fight her again. Then he had the nerve to tell me that im the problem b\\c i suck and cant win a fight against her.  Apparently the fact that i have a bf sword to her IE, boots, and shiv i guess, has nothing to do with it (sarcasm incase u cant tell). This is just the latest example of what i see regularly. 7 out of my last 10 adc games, i have had either troll picks as support, or they pick a traditional support and troll\\feed my lane opponent. This game has gone downhill in my opinion. Some of us like to play to try and get better at the game and climb ranks...we take it seriously i guess u could say. But people like this completely ruin the entire experience by either completely trolling or turning the game into team death match, which is just as bad in my opinion. If i wanted to play tdm i would go play call of duty, not League. Sorry for the rant but ive reached my breaking point with the ABSOLUTE WORST gaming community ive ever been a part of","replies":[{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-05-21T02:32:50.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played 15 Bronze 1 ranked games and I haven't encountered a single troll.
