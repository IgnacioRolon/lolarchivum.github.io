Therefore making the new player think &quot;why should i play this game if i&#039;m going to get wrecked with no counterplay&quot;. Now if you are an experienced player you know that there is a way to counter it, but new players don&#039;t. this is also one of the main reasons why league is going downhill (losing their player base) if you don&#039;t believe me look it up yourself. you may say, &quot;that&#039;s what bots are for&quot; but bots can only teach a player so much. playing against other player around their skill level is what helps them move forward and learn the game, if you are just getting completely wrecked by smurfs just about every game you aren&#039;t going to want to play that game anymore as it is no longer enjoyable to play.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-04-30T04:22:03.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give me a reliable way to stop them and riot would implement it in a heartbeat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamaree","date":"2016-04-30T04:19:03.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a way to stop them.","replies":[]}]}
