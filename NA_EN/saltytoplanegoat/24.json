Two teams dance around each other for 30 minutes, and the one who then makes the firts mistake loses. Pretty much 30 minutes of nothing for a few moments of action. And since that kinda sucked, Riot was like \"well, what if we made games faster so they are cooler to watch?\", completly disregarding that the esport group, while it is vocal is just an abyssimal minority when compared to the total playerbase of this game.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are where we are now, where people demand a surreder vote at 10 ot 15 minutes, and for the first time since season 2, I see people actually supporting that idea.\r\n\r\nYou can either have a game that is fun to watch - or fun to play. Both at once is impossible. And since this is supposed to be a GAME, I'd rather have fun in my own matches, even if this means there will be less tounraments where we will figure out who is the best asian at this game.","replies":[{"poster":"NastyMcOutplay","date":"2017-01-19T17:20:30.910+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":2,"body":"i preferred the long matches, much more strategy","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2017-01-20T17:35:04.827+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only had about 4 or 5 matches in my 3 years of playing League that even made it to 70 minutes. I think only 2 (and that was WAY back in season 3 when I began) that made it to about 2 hours for just one game. I didn't care about dying because it never critically hurt my team (from what I saw) and I never got too over powered from going on a killing spree. You could itemize whatever you felt like (even if its as simple and stupid as just Bloodthirsters or Rabadon Deathcaps) it was fun and we felt like *we* were in control. If I wanted to go AD Teemo probably in that time, no one would had cared as much as they would now. \n\nNow, not only has Riot done this, they stopped doing fun give aways for the heck of it, they won't give an increase to IP for new players, and game modes are taken away so that players **must** focus on only Normal campaign. You do get a choice in either going in Summoners Rift to play in either a Ranked mode or Normal mode. But it overshadows the Twisted Treeline map. \n\nI honestly miss how much freedom I had in Team Builder. I miss Trinity Force having AP. I miss the original Zeke's (that should had stayed since we don't have that many support items...). I've lost my will to play. Everyone around me tell me to either quit, do what I feel, or tell of how they don't like the game. I will miss this game. I made it to the PBE, I got very close to getting all the Champions (just 40 more :'|), but none of my friends or peers play it and though its still a popular game on Twitch I can't see myself playing it when there is more to do than waist more time on a game that makes it impossible for new players to even begin, only cares for money, and only has a handful of staff that even look on these boards from time to time.

People have been saying that the strategy element of League is dying ever since you could reasonably start saying it. In strategy games, there tend to be things like counters to work around that you have to play around very carefully, assuming it doesn't invalidate you outright, which is a distinct possibility. It's only in mechanically-oriented games that counters stop being very hard and everyone has the chance of playing around anything with anyone. Part of the strategy in a strategy game comes from seeing what the enemy has planned and countering that plan as much as you can while they counter yours, which in itself requires good game sense and long-term thinking so you can enact your plan or improvise a new plan as your current one is countered. \n\nLeague doesn't require as much strategic play because it focuses on mechanical play. This isn't to say that the strategy isn't there, but it's not as deep as other games' strategy elements.
