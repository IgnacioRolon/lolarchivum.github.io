Could it be... that he really has been in love before?\r\n\r\nAnd that would explain something in his backstory that never made much sense for me: how did the Targonians trick a comisc, star-creating dragon? In the version we have, they made a fancy crown and Sol, the vain fuck that he is, immedeatly decides &quot;I&#039;m gonna rock that look&quot;, put it on and is suddenly enslaved.\r\n\r\nHowever, where did the Targonians get the knownledge of how to bind him? And why did he accept the crown even if the primitive and &quot;crude&quot; magic as he calls it would have been detectable? That would literally go against all logic... unless, the great remover of all logic and rationality was involved: love. \r\n\r\nLet&#039;s just assume that Aurelion Sol fell in love with a Targonian, who finally either betrayed him or was forced to betray him in the end. Now the story makes a lot more sense, right? He didn&#039;t just put on the crown out of vanity, he put it on because he truly trusted the person or being that he was in love with. However, he&#039;d rather look like a vain moron than to be reminded of this betrayal, so instead we have the version we all know as a main-lore that leaves out details such as this.\r\n\r\nAnd now: even more speculation: Who was the targonian entity that Sol was in love with? Pantheon surely not, the Protector seems also unlikely, and apart from that we only know of the aspect of the sun and the aspect of the moon. If he had a relation to one of those he&#039;d surely have a specific taunt for Leona or Diana, so that is also unlikely. He has taunts for them, but none that would suggest something like that.\r\n\r\nHowever, what if we were talking about a &quot;fallen&quot; Targonian here? Like, a cosmic entity that was &quot;banished&quot; in some way after it had been forced to betray Aurelion or opposed the plan to enslave him? \r\n\r\nThinking about it we only have one &quot;fallen star&quot; in our mass of champions, or at least someone who might fit the description: {{champion:16}} \r\n\r\nHe even has a taunt for her: &quot;Twinkle, twinkle, little star, do you wonder what you are?&quot;, implying that he knows something about her that she does not. But how would Soraka not know about something as once having dated a gigantic space dragon? Well, as I see it a memory-loss is not very unlikely when she was really &quot;banished&quot; as a targonian aspect and &quot;downgraded&quot; from a cosmic entity into whatever she is know. That would also explain why Soraka had a magical &quot;leash&quot; that would prevent her from using her magic to harm others: the moment she used the full extend of her powers to get rid of Warwick&#039;s men she got her goat hooves... (I hope that still is the canon version of the lore). It would make sense if she was banished and sealed, mostly because she poses a danger to the other targonians.\r\n\r\nOn another note I am kind of fascinated that a gigantic entity like Aurelion Sol can even flal in love. I wonder what&#039;s his type when it comes to partners tho, apart from &quot;don&#039;t be a targonian&quot;... or would he even look at a being as long as it was less than a cosmic god?

HOWEVER, love as a force, as a raw strenght and natural power, that is usually a metaphor reserved for the burning flames of romantic passion.\n\nAs a matter to the \"who?\"... there is a number of transcental beings in this universe that we know of, yet most of them are too \"detached\" to feel love I'd say. The Kindred, Bard, or even Tham Kench are not exactly beings one would even think they'd be able to love.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-10-24T15:33:09.959+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"> HOWEVER, love as a force, as a raw strenght and natural power, that is usually a metaphor reserved for the burning flames of romantic passion.\n\nYeah usually, but not always. The sense of loss that Aurelion Sol feels when a star dies is so profound that we as mere mortals could never even fathom it. It's the kind of feeling that'd probably instantly just send people slinking in to clinical depression based on how its been described. The stars are a part of Aurelion Sol, and the love one feels for their creations, or perhaps their children, can exceed any kind of romantic love depending on who we're talking about. I'm very willing to believe that Aurelion Sol's love of his stars far exceeds the love he would feel for anything else, as the stars are the thing that literally give his life purpose and meaning.\n\nAlso among the transcendental beings that are on Aurelion Sol's level, we've only seen Aurelion Sol. Kindred and Bard operate in different ways and we have yet to see other beings that Aurelion Sol shared the early cosmos with. Other beings that were responsible for the other fundamental forces of the universe are things that do exist, but have yet to be explored, and what the Star Forger's relationship with them beyond Targon forcing him to fight some of them hasn't been explored either.\n\nI'm far more inclined to believe that some of those beings would be more likely candidates for Aurelion Sol's affections than a being of Targon, especially considering that Aurelion Sol's interactions with Targon were limited before being enslaved. They weren't as much of the great celestial question marks they are now back when they met Aurelion Sol, it took them time to get there if memory serves, and I don't think the great Star Forger would look to beings of that kind of existence with anything other than his initial curiosity.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon1xx","date":"2016-10-25T00:32:35.686+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically, losing a star=losing a kid.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-10-25T01:04:01.452+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the worst analogy there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-10-25T06:39:12.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Bard X Sol is cannon?","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-10-25T12:35:28.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. And it's not canon either.\n\nWe don't know Bard's origins so it's not easy to link him in to the birth of the universe as we can with Aurelion Sol.

The two lovers are impulsive infatuated teenagers who know each other for a week and get oodles of people killed in the process.  THAT'S the point of Romeo and Juliet: the pointlessness and ultimately self destructiveness of blood feuds as well as the recklessness of youths.  This was of course part of Shakespeare's (and all of England's) fascination with the previous century, which was dominated and disrupted by the War of the Roses, which was a dynastic feud between two houses (also the inspiration for Game of Thrones) that was effectively a century long civil war.  That's why most of Shakespeare's history plays are about The War of the Roses (Henry V, Richard II etc etc).  The lovers are just the plot device around which the blood feud can play out as well as serving as the moral lesson at the end.\n\nWorth reading again maybe.  Definitely read about the War of the Roses.  It's a bit obscurant but it's really really fascinating.  I recommend \"Bosworth Field and the War of the Roses\" by A.L. Rowse.  It's a bit dense but he goes SUPER in depth and it's a fascinating and bloody tale of power grabs and murderous revenge.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-05-22T01:02:55.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I've read this modernist interpretation before.  And while it makes the story less idiotic, unfortunately it doesn't hold water.  While the original response from Friar Lawrence to Romeo is basically \"Oh, really, you're in love? Cuz last week you were on about Rosaline.  Dumb ass.\"  That's really the only support for the theory.  In fact the Lawrence character later gives a speech about how Juliet's love is true when she starts saying how she can't live without Romeo.  \n\nThat and the concept of love at first sight is frequently used in Shakespeare's works.  The Tempest, Merchant of Venice, The Winter's Tale all mention love at first sight for their protagonists.  Then there's Midsummer Night's Dream which does play around with the concept of love at first sight, with one of the girls being in love with someone who hates her.  Only for faeries with magic roofie-juice to make everyone happy with the previously established love interests, despite two of them having nothing in common and there is no development for their romance.  The romance is portrayed straight as soon as the roofied individual sees the new target of their romances for the first time.\n\nAs an aside, who doesn't know what the War of the Roses is? Ignoring all the significance in English history.  It's basically what most of Shakespeare's historical plays are about.\n\nIn any case, mate, I've read Rome and Jules twice from school, once when I decided I wanted to read all of Shakespeare's plays in order, and was in the bloody play when I was in high school.  I've read the damn thing enough times.  And I can say, if I never have to read that piece of crap again, I'll die a happy man.  I would rather read the scraps of Timon of Athens again, with all the characters that don't matter and plots that go nowhere.  Worse than that, I'd rather read the entirety of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, with all the statues that stop communism, naked armies, and chickens that are not chickens.  I'd go through all that crap, rather than crack open Romeo and Juliet again.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-10-24T12:34:11.836+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"...\n\nFanfic writing urges rising.\n\nThe only thing I want to point out is that Soraka is Ionian.

We dont have a celestial being right now that actually gives life.
