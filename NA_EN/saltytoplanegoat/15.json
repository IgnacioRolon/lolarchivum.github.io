Then something got me thinking. In that Music of Legends thing there was a piece called \"Shaco's and Lulu's quicky encounter\"... but why should there be an connection in between the sorceress and the jester? I thought about this a little bit and then it hit me: Shaco is a human that has entered the Glade and got his powers there (or maybe he's a full creature of that realm, who knows?).\r\n\r\nBut why would the Glade produce an totally insane murderer with bad humor?

These creatures are not particularly violent or cruel* within the expectations and boundaries of their own society*, but have little understanding or empathy for humans and/or human culture. This isn't because they're evil, it's because they're far removed from humanity as whole. \r\n> \r\n> Lulu is very much the same way. She doesn't understand that to many, her magic isn't a game - she grew up among the fey, where changing forms and wild magic are extremely common, and where things like audio/visual perception and the concept of death don't necessarily mean the same thing they do to the rest of Runeterra. \r\n> \r\n> She's not a sociopath. She's a child who never grew up.\r\n\r\nIsn't Shaco somehow... the twisted counterpart of that? He's carefree, crazy and just does whatever he wants to have his fun. The only difference to Lulu is that his \"games\" involve psychological torture and murder - something he seems to view as completly normal. But why is there no visible connection to the fae? My guess is that the glade is home to more than just the fae... or that some of them are just really fucked up xD\r\n\r\nLulu is the example of a child yordle falling into the glade - what would happen if a human grown-up would end up there?

They've already shown that even champions with a large amount of lore behind them (original multi-paragraph lore, League Judgements, and Journal of Justice articles— speaking of which, you should read Shaco's JoJ article; it's great) can be simplified into pitiful, two-line excuses for character backstories.\nEvelynn's problem is that her lore is vague, and her kit doesn't seem thematic at all, other than her passive (not to mention that she's intentionally kept weak by Riot, while Shaco is more viable if mastered). She's a mysterious assassin-for-hire... but why? What is the point of her possible connection to the Shadow Isles? She doesn't seem undead, though she could be a sort of vampire. Why was she trying to curry favor with the Summoners? She doesn't seem motivated by anything but the joy she finds in killing people (according to her in-game dialogue), but that doesn't really explain her lore more.\nShaco might be mysterious in that no one knows exactly what he is, but, at the same time, everyone knows exactly what he does and why he does it. *He thinks killing people is funny,* and he's good at killing people in ways that could be thought of as funny (boxes, clones, etc.). He revels in the fact that mankind (and other races) don't have any factual explanation for him, his methods (invisibility, teleportation, self-multiplication, an endless supply of deadly traps... There's a reason for him being called the Demon Jester), and his motivations while continuing on his merry, murderous way. \n\nEven if you don't believe me and lump him together with Evelynn as a lore-less \"mysterious murderer,\" I hope you can agree that he's better off with a full page of vague lore than two lines of crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Awoof","date":"2015-03-16T07:22:29.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arrevax,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=c4EWf2lW,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-16T01:19:02.120+0000)\n>\n> speaking of which, you should read Shaco's JoJ article; it's great\n\n{{champion:35}} \"I'm an equal opportunity killer.
