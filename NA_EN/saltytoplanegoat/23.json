Maybe the initial placements should determine whether or not a player is ready for ranked play. Maybe instead of trying to encourage players who probably aren't ready for ranked play to start (Clash), the opposite approach should be taken.

The top 1% would be the 10 millionth best player.\n\nNow put the 10 millionth best tennis player in the world in a match against anyone in the top 200 of the ATP. I would be utterly shocked if he wasn't beaten 6-0 6-0 6-0. I'd actually be surprised if he got more than a handful of points (almost all won off of the pro's unforced errors / double faults). \n\nAnd yes, if you had that game and had a stadium of fans in it who didn't know what was going on, they probably would call that 10 millionth best player \"garbage or bad\". \n\nEven if you wanted to restrict it to people who actually played tennis, you'd get the same result. \n\nEspecially as you approach the top tier of games or sports, the discrepancy in skill gets larger and larger. It's hard to believe, but the difference in skill between a tennis player on his high school team and the worst kid in the skill is probably less than the difference in skill between the 500th best player in the world and the 50th.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ez mental boom","date":"2018-10-21T01:28:34.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People get their opinions from influencers.

It states that as you put more effort in the higher you go the less you get as a return. It's why you can climb to Gold only knowing how to cs well and then group on a gold lead.

Think about it, I am in the top 4% of players in the game yet I am still \"low Elo\". They say this because it makes them feel better because they are low Elo, but everyone apparently is in low Elo until Diamond 1 or higher which is funny because that is only .12% of the playerbase. Diamond 1 = .07% Master .03% and Challenger .02%. I consider anyone plat 3 or high elo as it is the top  5% of the player base but that is just my opinion.","replies":[]}]}
