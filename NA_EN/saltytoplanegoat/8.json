There are some people so toxic  you do not want to win a game with, so I decided to do something else instead of wasting my energy for a person I can&#039;t stand.\n\nFirst of all, the misleading name. It&#039;s not a queue, it&#039;s a time penality. But the idea behind that is reasonable: you made your team waste up to potential 20 minutes until they could surrender - now you&#039;re going to sit through those 20 minutes too! (Multiple times ofc for the multiple games you did that).\n\nHowever, 20 minutes is too much . Not saying that it is too much of a punishment, but that it is so much you can simply do something else during that time with no need to actively pay attention to your punishment.\n\n1st 20 Minutes: I read a manga and waste some time on tumblr, almost forgetting I have the queue on.\n\n2nd 20 minutes: I watch the latest episode of Dimension W (Interesting and unique Sci-Fi series airing this season - lenght: 20 minutes). Generally, every anime and many western shows have an average episode lenght of 20-25 minutes. I could just start marathoning a random series I havn&#039;t watched yet with league brakes between the episodes. I wouldn&#039;t even notice the punishment anymore xD\n\n3rd 20 minutes: I go grocery shopping (time spend without hurry: 15 minutes)\n\n4rd 20 minutes: I do the dishes then take a long hot shower to relax myself.\n\n5rd 20 minutes: I lurk around on the lol boards, writing posts like this one.\n\nThat all is stuff I would have done anyways. Literally all this &quot;punishment&quot; did was to re-arrange the schedule a little.\n\nA true low priority queue has people sitting in front of their desktop for 10 minutes because they don't know when they are being matched and have to accept - and that in a time frame that is still tolerable to make one wait before they stand up and do something else (aka 7-10 minutes). But 20? Lol no. if you really want leavers and afks to go down, you might want to rework this system a little, because right now it doesn&#039;t feel any punishimg to me at all ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-03-22T00:10:57.607+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you ever experienced the low priority queue?

It's annoying at best, but hardly a punishment.\n\nIn the old system you could be banned out of the game for a week straight for AFKing.\nThat was WAY harsher than 100 minutes worth of queue time.\nEven for people who could only play one or two games a day, the old Leaver Buster was **at least** four times as severe.\n\nIn retrospect I didn't expect anything else from things Mr. Jeffrey Lin had anything to do with, though.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2016-03-22T15:33:39.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Strange.

I feel that it's not really a punishment at all.\n\nWhat I would suggest is X amount of mandatory 5v5 bot game wins. Bot games would act as a waste of time for players who've afk'd purposely far more than the 20 minute low priority, since it's extremely simple to do something else during the time, while bot games force players to actively participate. For players with internet issues, it forces them to check their connection in a bot game. And if someone does leave during the 5v5 bot game punishment, it doesn't really matter to the teammates at all, bots are quite easy to beat even 1v5, you're not really harming them at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneakos","date":"2016-03-22T13:58:31.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"God I hate people like you.
