While Viktor considered this feature a brilliant means of reducing the frequency of construction accidents, Jayce found its indifference toward free will immoral.\" \n\n* His reasoning for developing this tech wasnt to be the king of the world - it was so people wouldnt hurt themselves by succumbing to panic and/or disobeying orders as a result of their irrational fear. At the end of the day, Viktor wants to save lives. \n\n\"The two nearly came to blows over the design and ultimately, after Jayce warned the academy of Viktor's invention, Viktor was stripped of his honors and ostracized from Piltover's scientific community.\"\n\n* We dont know why, exactly, he was stripped of his honrs and ostracized from Piltover. Maybe because Piltover has a very strong (and maybe in Viktor's eyes, illogical?) bias against chemtech? They love hextech but seem to look down on everything and everybody else, especially taking into account all the talk of nobility in Piltover and how they treat those beneath them.\n\n\"Since his expulsion from the Piltovan scientific community, Viktor had commenced work on a secret project in Zaun. He'd finally learned how to achieve his dream - how to eradicate disease, hunger, hatred.\"\n\n* Doesnt paint him as a villain in my eyes. This actually opens up a door to the misunderstood villain theme. \n\n\"Dozens of corpses, their skulls sawed open and hollowed out, their brains transplanted into an army of immobile metal soldiers, hooked up to the now-pulsing crystal.\" \"Their eyes were dead, their faces emotionless. They were definitely Viktor's boys, alright: drugged punks from Zaun's sump level whom Viktor had pumped full of hallucinogens and hypnotics. Chem-stunted thugs who would follow Viktor's every whim whether they wanted to or not.\" \n\n* We dont exactly how Viktor got these people - maybe it was by choice, maybe not. After all, these arent noble and heroic folks - they are the lowest level of poor in Zaun, a city plagued by pollution and violence. Maybe their bodies and minds were already destroyed from years of drugs and pollution, and this was the only way to keep them alive. Maybe they were already dead and he found a way to reanimate their brain. After all, if Viktor wanted mindless automatons, he could have made them. If he wanted autonomous robots, he could have made them (He made Blitz, after all). To me, this is the biggest question that could open a lot up for Viktor - **What is the benefit from using a human mind, especially when an automation would have served the exact same purpose without all the hassle? ** An entire army of these \"chemslaves\" powered by the most powerful crystal in the world was basically brought down by a scholar with no combat training and just a shard of the crystal - an automation army couldnt do worse than that, so whats the purpose behind it? \n\n* Also, we arent sure whether or not this was a forced experiment or a voluntary one - in League lore, there are lots of people who voluntarily would give up their free will to serve their \"greater good\", especially with all the military power around. Take a look at the description of Demacia's military: \"Their 'zero tolerance' moral code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike. In combat, this means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender under any circumstance.\" If thats their highest value, dont you think some soldiers would voluntarily undergo Viktor's experiment so they woujldnt succumb? \n\n__________________\nLastly, remember what they did with Xerath and Azir. What we have is one side of the story - the story from Jayce's point of view. What we dont see is why Viktor did what he did, similar to how Azir's story doesnt show Xerath's side of things. When you hear the villain's story, suddenly they become more relatable - Xerath went from a psychopath traitor/mass murderer in Azir's story to a poor boy who was brought up a slave, who raised Azir to new heights for the promise of equality and freedom, and was denied that basic right over and over again (\"Azir’s face was thunderous as he reminded Xerath that he was a slave and should remember his place.\" \"The soured promise ate into what he was, and what he could have been. Denied a small, simple thing, the right to live his life.\")\n\nXerath's story makes him human, relatable, and ultimately misunderstood as a villain. A simple misunderstanding - Azir, who kept his plans to abolish slavery secret, and Xerath, who felt that Azir lost his moral compass (after all, Azir confined in him everything else) - started the entire feud. \n\nSo basically what I'm saying is dont lose hope for Viktor.","replies":[{"poster":"Finikksu","date":"2016-12-11T00:04:52.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro!!
