Just letting a thread be because it is so hostile that there can' t be collaboration is not hiding, is saving time!\n\nAlso, you are justifying being hostile to the devs. No. There is no justification.

They have all the right of taking critics and we have the right of being pissed, but we are dehumanizing them this way.

I am explaining WHY people are hostile. You should never call for someone's job, or be a dick to them. But if you start a line of \"communication\" but only state your feelings/beliefs, and do not accept feedback then you are not communicating. You don't have to DO what boards/reddit say. But you need to understand WHY they are saying what they are saying. It's business relations 101. \n\nIf Riot, as they have stated MANY times, admits they are bad at communicating then maybe they are bad at communicating? Ghostcrawler, Meddler, even Bio/Katey have admitted as much. Look at Dev Corner. It started out this REALLY good idea. And now there hasn't been a post for 23 days. With Pwyff saying it's going to take another month or so before they start it up again. \n\nDid you read the Fiora story Riot put out? (on the development of her new kit/model) [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/editorial/champion-update-and-flawed-fencer)\n\nIn it Riot Rumtumtummers states: \n>\"The outcry was a stark contrast from what the ChampUp team had expected. It seemed as though the team and players had dramatically different visions for Fiora’s identity and how that identity should be represented.\" \n\nRiot Rhee states: \n>\"but ultimately it felt like us and players may have started with different understandings of Fiora.\"\n\nThis is due to a lack of understanding how players view the game as opposed to how the devs view the game.\n\nNobody expects what Riot Repertoir did this week as the norm. If they do, they are crazy. But as you see, a LOT of hostility was either diminished or completely removed because a Rioter took time to communicate. Not just give a statement (ie State of the Season) and leave with no follow up. But an honest to god give and take. \n\nMaybe the answer is Riot hires people to act as a middleman on the boards. (I don't mean hiring someone just hanging out on the boards, but an honest Rioter with a back ground in communication) Someone that can help filter and deliver posts to the Rioters that can answer those posts.\n\nAs for Rioters being \"afraid\". That happens. Let's take the Stashu/Cass debacle. I'm not talking about how good/bad the rework was. I mean the response to it. When we are told, over and over, that Stashu will keep a close eye and follow up on it, players are at least accepting. But after 6 months of NO feedback, we find out (as Meddler said) Stashu was moved off Cass and that NOBODY was keeping an eye on her. CT and his work on Morde has been basically universally panned. Yet the person who did the change doesn't talk about it. It's left to other Rioters to pick up the slack on that. Both of these can be called \"hiding\".\n\nAgain, you CAN'T gain good will without work. If you have ever worked in sales, you know that you must deal with people you don't like in order to bring them back. And Riot wants this \"free form\" communication that they use now, then they need to change how they handle the \"free form\" feedback.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jorencice","date":"2016-01-10T14:16:37.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"U can't adress blind hate.\n\n I know people that won't be satisfied till he's fired and all the champions he made erased.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"iainB85","date":"2016-01-10T00:13:58.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never knew this Dev Corner existed until you just mentioned it and I am a regular news/forum viewer.

I believe he goes above and beyond to communicate ideas with the community because he's just that passionate about League of Legends and wants to do his best to provide the best possible experience for the players. His is a noble endeavor, indeed. You're also right about another thing, madam - he does put some of the other Rioters to shame, but they're the very small subset of Rioters who I like to refer to as the rebellious \"Fringe Elements\". They know who they are and unfortunately, they'll probably never follow in Repertoir's example. This is not because they don't care, it's simply because their egos are too big for them to admit their errors and learn from their mistakes. Aside from the Fringe Elements, I think the vast majority of Rioters already do a great job of providing an open dialog for players, including yourself. I'd try to fit a CLARITY meme in here somewhere, but I feel like that horse has already been beaten dead. Finally, if you see the bae Repertoir soon, please do tell him to get some sleep.

He's made mistakes, but he's always done his best to remedy them when the players were unhappy. He's got one of the best reps among the Rioters, and people like him. He's open and honest, and doesn't talk down to players that question his decisions. In fact, he seems to take player suggestions quite easily; that's mind-blowing when you're used to other Rioters.\n\nNow just imagine if CerT or Stashu made a thread like that. The amount of hate and vitriol contained inside would drip from it and run down the front page. Half the posts would be nonconstructive criticism or just outright insults. They'd have to start the thread off with an apology and admitting that they've made mistakes to even begin to have a civil discussion, and even then it would probably turn into an \"I'm sorry\" thread rather than the intended FAQ thread.\n\nThat being said, there's other Rioters that could probably get away with a civil FAQ thread. Meddler would be a hot one since he's seemingly got his hands in just about everything. KateyKhaos would be a very civil one as well, if perhaps a little underwhelming. Lyte would just be hilarious since banned players would fill the thread with all kinds of nonsense, although that would block most reasonable discussion.

When Riot doesn't answer hostile threads that insult them and demand responses, the people posting them get mad and accuse them of dodging sensitive issues, but if a Rioter gives an honest answer, they still get mad for Riot not giving them what they want, particularly since many requests in those threads (i.e. \"revert X rework\" or \"fix this champion who's had serious kit issues for years within the week\") are just not reasonable. If Riot comes to talk with players without anything conclusive to say about sensitive topics, e.g. Mordekaiser, Cassiopeia, Rengar, etc., other than they're working on it, then it's not really going to help with people who come in looking for a confrontation, nor will anything else, even if it's useful for most others.

It's not something that dies out, and even when it's not about a particular hot-button issue there are many users here who create threads on a semi-regular basis, or jump on existing bandwagons, to use whichever issues are most relevant right now to vent at Riot. There hasn't really been any single case of boards \"discharging\" aggression and then mellowing out, even with RiotRepertoir's threads, and if anything the opposite tends to happen, with what few posts by Stashu or CertainlyT getting picked up and thrown around in outrage across the front page every time they try to answer something, with no real long-term change in boards toxicity thereafter.\n\nI also don't think it's really fair to expect Rioters to throw themselves to the lions just so that the boards can vent their pent-up anger at them -- they're people, not punching bags, and even if they've made mistakes in the past, they still made those mistakes while trying to work as hard as they could to make a better game for us all. The onus here isn't on them to offer themselves up to people who constantly belittle them and their work, it's on us to take a step back from our personal frustrations and meet them halfway in establishing more productive discussion. This whole issue of hostility and confrontation should, by all rights, not exist -- we're all on the same team here, playing the same game and trying to reach the same goals of fun for everyone. There is no sense in us treating Riot like it's some enemy trying to screw us over at every turn and deliberately ruining our fun, and the fact that so many people here seem to genuinely think that shows a serious lack of maturity. This isn't something that can be solved by just getting it out of the boards' collective system, it's a core problem with the system itself, and we need to defuse the toxicity on these boards if we truly want to make the best use of everyone's time in developer discussions.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-01-09T16:24:07.908+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel \"leading by example\" here goes both ways: the reason that thread was so positive wasn't just because RiotRepertoir took the time and effort to talk to us, but also because most of the people there were willing to engage in civil conversation and ask him interesting questions.
