But they still fit the magical girl trope less than 'girly' girls, even in their own anime.\n\nA tomboy Magical girl is contradictory in that Magical girls often wear very girlish clothes which goes against the tomboy concept. It happens because there's an audience for it, i'm sure some anime made the girl unhappy with what she has to wear at first but not giving a fuck 5 episodes later.\n\nAside from that Vi is imo not just a tomboy. Vi doesn't give a shit and breaks shit down to get where she has to be. And while her outfit isn't as revealing as other champs it's still feminine, with the frills, cleavage, \"corset\" n such.

Lux and team will need to overcome this on their own. They could receive occasional help from Ahri, but Ahri and group are not going to play the role of saviors.
