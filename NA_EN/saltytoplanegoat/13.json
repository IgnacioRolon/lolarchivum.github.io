You know, imagine it if Riot would bring out an retro looking game, but one that has a story and deals with some aspect of the lore? And it&#039;s not like that would consume too many resources, after all we are talking about simple game concepts here. \n\nAlso, then Riot Games would be more... living up to their name instead of being \"Riot Game\".\n\nBut what kind of small games could they bring out? And with what lore connected to it?\n\nWell, I thought of some ideas, but as always they are not perfect or anything, just random stuff that came to my mind. These games can have a light hearted touch, but I would almost prefer them to be filled with more serious writing... Also, I&#039;m not really expecting like 40+ hours of gameplay from these small things. A few (if even that) would be enough, as it&#039;s suppsed to be only an addition to LoL.\n\nIdea One: A game featuring Riven. Now now, ya all calm down, no need for Riven hate in here! Move that to the balance boards. You guys surely remember the old Legend of Zelda games on the SNES. Protagonist with a sword on a journey? Well, I wonder what kind of character that might apply to...\n\nIdea Two: Lucian&#039;s lore. Would be perfect for a 2-player coop game, a sidescroll jump&shoot game set on the Shadow Isles. You can play either Senna or Lucian. Well, we all know how this ends, but until then you can shoot up some ghuls and mini-bosses, and maybe gather some information about this weird place that is the isles... Sounds pretty awesome to me.\n\nWell, these are my ideas so far... what do you guys think of it? Or what ideas do you have for something like this? Just post it all here ^^\n\nEdit: Oh got a new Idea: \"Super Noxus Bros\", featuring Draven and Darius... No idea how to get lore done on this, but it sounds awesome enough for me xD","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken Sailor","date":"2015-08-22T16:03:58.610+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idea 3: Cooking Simulator ft.

Now we won't need to work on the lore much because it's already been done. Some retouching would be nice to make it fit into an RTS genre.\n\nNow, they need to make models and animations for workers, buildings, and a whole bunch of combat units. Then we need to balance those out. Then they'll need to make maps for each level. In Warcraft 3, each of the four races got their own campaign (not counting the expansion), and had about 7~8 levels each, disregarding cutscenes. The expansion added basically the same amount of work for the new campaigns.\n\n\nI think the minigames are okay.
