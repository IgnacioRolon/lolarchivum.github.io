Who I am? No one cares. Am I qualified to talk about any of this? Not sure, but given the nature of this board I get the idea that it has never stopped anyone from making a thread. Is reading all this a gigantic waste of your time? I hope not, at least I&#039;m trying to make it a somewhat _informative _ waste of time.\r\n\r\nDay and night, night and day, this board flows over with complaints. And some with good reason, after all a game can be good, but I would never go as far as to call it perfection. So there is always a reason for the complaints, at least for some of them. Sometimes the reason is obvious. An overtuned number here, a bugged interaction there, you know, the usual stuff that tends to get fixed sooner or later. In some cases a lot later, which is also a problem at times, but these are not the issues I&#039;d like to explore in this text. These are all things that can be easily changed, modified, or even removed within a few days - and without changing the game drastically. Oh sure balance might shift, the meta might be in shambles, but League of Legends will still be League of Legends, no matter what part of the champion roster currently takes the spotlight.\r\n\r\nNo, the problems I want to talk about run deep, deep in the very structure of this game. To some part they were previous mistakes, some have even been fixed already, and some are almost impossible to solve now as they are inherent to the MOBA genre as a whole. \r\n\r\nOut of all ludic (meaning defined by mechanic and not by setting) videogame genres, such as &quot;The FPS&quot;, &quot;The RPG&quot;, or &quot;The Puzzle Game&quot;, &quot;the MOBA&quot; is one of the most fascinating subjects for historical analysis. For one it is not an &quot;independent&quot; genre. Puzzle games and Roleplaying go back far far beyond the times someone filled a gigantic room with metal parts and called it a calculation machine, and the shooter has been there since the dawn of the genre, with the old &quot;Doom&quot; often being cited as the source of it. But the MOBA came later, a mod created from another game, a frankenstein-ish creation by taking parts of RPG and Real-Time-Strategy, but mostly RPG. That in itself is nothing new, genres in every medium tend to mesh, just look at the last 100 years of movie history. But in this case something weird happened: some of the core elements used were not suitable for a transition from Singleplayer or CO-OP to competitive Multiplayer - at least not suitable as the elements of the shooter or other genres were. \r\n\r\nAnd this is why some mechanics and archetypes that worked perfectly fine in their &quot;original genres&quot; suddenly start acting up here or have to be completly removed - like the Dodge stat. Randomness was completly fine in RPGs and still is a massive part of them - after all every single Dungeons and Dragons session is still played with dice. And who&#039;s going to complain about it being unfair to play against? The monsters you slaughter on every run? Hardly.\r\n\r\nCrit also falls into here, as it is a problem to why marksmen pretty much run this game since season one, but less about that now, I got a more important point to make: \r\n\r\nBut the even bigger problem is how entrie archetypes were taken over into this enviorment that is not suitable for them. I will now list three (there might be more to find) examples of archetypes that can only work in this game if they are massively undertuned and can cause massive problems if they are even a teeny tiny bit too strong:\r\n\r\n**1.) Damage over Time**\r\n\r\nEvery single DoT mage has proven problematic. Cassiopaia? Reworked, then the Rework Reworked, and still an inaesthetical excuse for a lack of art and vfx ressources on her updates. Mordekaiser? Let&#039;s not talk about it, or Malicious will probably get PTSD or something. Yes he needed a rework, BUT NOT LIKE THAT FOR HEAVEN&#039;S SAKE! Malzahar? Had his DoT power-budget removed and stuffed into the ultimate. And Ryze? Let&#039;s be real, at this point reworking him once a year has already become some sort of tradition. Can&#039;t wait for the next version.\r\n\r\nThe core problem with damage over time is that it has to be PERFECTLY balanced for it to work. Either you kill the enemy fast enough or you don&#039;t. Given that you play against burst-champions that means your DoT has to be &quot;slightly slower burst&quot; to be able to compete, which means that either you are brutally OP or you are absolutely useless, depending how the numbers are tuned. Or the numbers are so high that you might as well call it &quot;burst per second&quot;, in that case you started playing a burst mage with a seemingly infinite rotation. That&#039;s the worst case scenario to so speak. The problem is that once you are not that strong or close to it, those champions feel so abysimally weak to play that they completly vanish from the game. \r\n\r\nThis makes balance a nightmare if you ever want these champions to be even remotely viable.\r\n\r\nTechnically marksmen also fall into this category, but for some reason here the solution is not nerfing it down but instead pumping up the damage of assassins and mages and melee carries so they can be killed so they need more damage to not be completly countered which needs more damage to... - and so on and so on, and here we get some fun damage creep in. \r\n\r\n**2.) Melee Carries\r\n**\r\nThis is maybe a bit less problematic and potentially solveable, but the way it is handled now is... not good. The melee dps character is a staple in every good RPG, digital or on paper. The warrior, the barbarian, the berserker, etc. etc. It fulfils a certain aesthetical- and power-fantasy that mostly includes jumping into a crowd of enemies and smashing them all to pulp. And in the RPG or Dungeon Crawler world that is completly fine and without any problems. The only issue now is when it comes to a player vs player setting. We all know how nasty a strong Yi or Xin or Yasuo can be. And we also know absolutely shit they are to play if they are not on that state of power.\r\n\r\nThe ranged high damage dealers of the game usually also have weaknesses, mostly in a lack of mobility, a lack of defensive tools, or with their main damage being gated by cooldown and ressource, as well as mechanical skill required to utilize it. HOWEVER, a melee damage dealer needs survival tools and mobility to even be remotely viable, or he will be kited into oblivion. But with an inherent weakness of the core-design removed, that can only lead to problems. \r\n\r\nAgain an archetype that worked wonderfully in the world of PvE, because even when they were strong you didn&#039;t need to play against it. \r\n\r\n**3.) Dedicated Healers**\r\n\r\nThis here is more of my own experience. I&#039;m not sure how often you broke my poor banana-goat&#039;s back with the nerf bat, but apparently it was not enough. I recently have more than a 100 games with her, she is my highest mastery champ, and most of these games were played FULL AP TOPLANE. Oh and I also hold a good winrate with her that way. This is not for bragging (ok maybe a little bit. Scrap that. A GIGANTIC BIT. I&#039;m proud of my goat.) but to make a point: Dedicated Healing as a core mechanic of a champion&#039;s design is borderline gamebreaking and and absolute pain in the arse to play against, and that&#039;s not even accounting for the boring botlanes she tends to cause. Never before have I seen enemy teams self-destruct that hard when losing against a team that was pretty much immortalized by me.  \r\n\r\nFor all the Magic Players here, imagine playing against the nastiest counter-deck you can imagine. And now imagine it runs infinite counter-spells. Everything you do, everything you try will just be negated, even your biggest team effort, as long as it does not insta-kill my entire team will be negated by me just pressing &quot;R&quot;, and that&#039;s not even accounting for the normal healing. \r\n\r\nJust as with the &quot;melee dps&quot; the healer is a core element of every good RPG. Mostly because you don&#039;t really have to play against it. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem of the game appears the be its &quot;historical baggage&quot; that runs deep in the game, and it all crosses over with that a champion is supposed to be: a POWER FANTASY. Those are exeptional characters, they are like the superheroes and super-villains and super-grey-characters-that-meddle-somehow-and-are-relevant of this world. So no matter the archetype, you want to feel powerful. \r\n\r\nAnd in this highly competitive game there is no room for a weak archetype. Healers want to heal death away, Warriors want to smash and claim victory against even the craziest odds, and DoT players want to see their enemies health bar melt away. The problem is that the moment they no longer do it against an NPC-enemy, and just for their co-op mates but also against other players, they are not allowed to be strong, because even in a weakened state they can throw an entire game upside down once they can even build the tiniest lead and play out their strenghts, which is a massive disortion of game balance. \r\n\r\nAnd in a competitive game of power fantasies, none is going to settle with a &quot;weak archetype&quot;. You can&#039;t just nerf the problematic ones until they  CERTAINLY don&#039;t cause trouble. You&#039;d have to break them down so far not even the most crazy die-hard mains would dare picking them into a ranked game anymore. Either it&#039;s useless to play or frustrating to deal with, a sign that it just doesn&#039;t fit into the game, no matter how you twist and turn it - at least not in these iterations of the archetype. At the same time this game is much less of a &quot;teamgame&quot; than a Co-Op RPG. As much as Riot wants to push teamplay, organized team esports, and so on, in SoloQ and generally we are usually lone wolves, and if we fight in a team then more in a way that five individuals charge into the same direction by coincidence, not because they are a &quot;team&quot; of any sorts, even if we all give our bests.\r\n\r\nThe Result: The &quot;empowerment&quot; this game givies is primarely on an individal level, not on a team scope. That also makes it harder to tune archetypes down and just point at the &quot;teamplay&quot;-aspect - because the majority is not going to play a champ that requires others for them to unlock their fullest potential. \r\n\r\nI think the most important thing people should realize that a MOBA like League of Legends follows radically different design-rules than the rest of the gaming world. Just because you know Dedicated Healers exist in all other games doesn&#039;t mean they will work here, and the same applies for other archetypes. They don&#039;t really belong into the game in these forms, they are baggage from the very origins of the genre. A genre that was not defined by a groundbreaking, well-thought-out game, but rather by dozends of people mashing around with map-editors and then slowly building up from there more than a decade ago. \r\n\r\nThese are the spots you will have to aim on if you want to change this game for the better. \r\n\r\nI am not saying that we should remove these archetypes all from the game completly - nono don&#039;t be crazy. But they all need a massive overhaul from the ground up, properly re-defining the principles those champions stand on in this kind of game. \r\n\r\nThe problem is not Yasuo&#039;s stupid Windwall, or Lee Sin&#039;s stupid Ward-Hop, or the stupid burst of assassins, or the stupid whatever the borderline-insane-yet-also-astouningly-stupid-at-times-boards-hivemind will find to complain and circlejerk about. \r\n\r\nThe problem runs deeper, and it needs to be adressed if this game is supposed to evolve in any way. \r\n\r\nI hope this made any sense at all and thank you for your attention. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}  \r\n\r\n(There really needs to be a proper sticker for this, like one that bows to an audience or something like that - this one feels a little silly in this context, but still is the only one that remotely fits &lt;_&lt;)","replies":[{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-07-05T06:17:44.816+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":">But with an inherent weakness of the core-design removed, that can only lead to problems.\n\nbecause melee characters come with their own weaknesses and they usually  fill a completely different role. where ranged ADs were originally meant to be the champions you pick to take objectives because of safety, melee AD carries were the champions you should pick who would actually wreck a teamfight because of their stronger combat steroids. if anything ranged champions are the issue because now they do both, almost across the class not a single marksman is actually 'bad' in teamfights anymore. \n\nnot to mention that riot has been giving melee carries _unique_ strength profiles that can't be said for marksmen, arguably the most generic and outdated class right now. \n\nobvious bias but to me ranged carries and the emphasis on them has dumbed this game down to an absurd degree.\n\nand i'm kinda tired of people saying that hard counters are bad. picking strategy should be part of the game. any active effort to reduce that or remove it entirely just ends up with a game that constantly feels samey. i can't remember a single champion that's come out since i started playing that i would actually say is a 'risky' design, and there've been like maybe 6 releases that i thought were good and brought something new","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2017-07-05T17:02:52.221+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"How aren't hard counters a problem?

Not without a jungler. Not without a team.\n\nIn which it bleeds into the match being winnable, rather than the lane you put so much emphasis on. Laning phase is an early game of tower defense and you're along for the ride to grow stronger and someone on the enemy team is there to check your advance. \n\nWhen you start valuing a fair laning phase to the point where you want to jeopardize the concept of lane bullies and slow starters (the bullied), you start taking champions like Darius, Renekton, and Pantheon, and telling them that they can't use their early game strength more than a person who has a far superior late game like Fiora, Jax, or Trundle.

When that Heimerdinger pick turned into your lane opponent for top lane, there is no deity that can save you the anguish of being pelted or farm-starved to death. \n\nPerhaps I've played this game too long and I am close-minded. Who knows? It just seems right that some lanes are not winnable, because there is a trade-off to that. Veigar loses to Zed only to burst his team to smithereens should he reach his late game potential. Jax loses to Renekton until he becomes a pubstomping monster. Ziggs gets offed by Talon only to wreck his turrets and nab his team objectives.\n\nJust my two cents on the subject.

But some hard counter lanes are incredibly one sided. Its too much.\n\nThat's the point of a counter-pick. It's supposed to be one-sided to prevent you from getting gold, or drawing your jungler's attention. If it wasn't very one-sided, we'd have more cases like Fiora or Jayce, who don't have any true counters to stop their scaling.\n\n> I don&#x27;t want to go to an extreme.

Of course you can't get near them, they'll kill you. O they use that and stand in your wave, happily slow pushing the wave while you are zoned out of XP range. And when that minion wave finally crashes into your turret, you have trouble getting all the farm your opponent did.\n\nThe best way to offset this is to have a jungler who can help kill them. If I'm playing Nautilus and the enemy Darius is zoning me and pushing, my jungler, preferably in this case a Master Yi or Elise, can gank and we can nab them a kill to start a snowball. It seems too perfect, but this is honestly the surefire way to deal with a lane bully: play into their self-confidence and destroy them.\n\nLane bully counterpicks suck. But it's all the better knowing that you're not alone in dealing with them.\n\n> This seems like a problem. You can&#x27;t change characters in game and you can&#x27;t see who your fighting before you lock in (not all the time that is) so it can feel like a roll of the dice. You can&#x27;t do anything about the terrible situation your in.\n\nIt's more about strategy and counter-strategy. You pick a tank top lane to be your team's front line and engage. Enemy team picks a lane bully to make you miserable. But your jungler can off-set that by picking a DPS monster like Jax or Yo, and your team can load up on pick potential to make a snowball on the enemy team more risky to keep rolling freely. \n\nThe laning phase is only a small part of the game, albeit crucial to it, but the mid-late game is more important. The game isn't a 1v1 duel to the death and shouldn't be treated as one. It's good to work as a team to even out the odds that you deal with. The situation, remember, may be terrible, but there is a natural stopping point when you can go help your team force objectives and push the map in your favor. Then your problematic lane matchup is forced to leave his throne and join his team, most likely not able to contribute as much as you.\n\n> No problems here.

Build pure damage just to hit buildings? That was never going to be a long term thing. \n\nRanged carries aren't a problem as a class (never too weak or too strong) in HOTS though. Why is that? And no they don't really have meaningful turn rate either. \n\nTo me it's\n\n1: Heroes can bodyblock other heroes which means it's a lot harder to get on a carry, but a lot easier to stick when you DO get on a carry\n2: Damage is just much, much lower. A full rotation from most burst characters won't 100-0 a carry unless the carry is really out of position or really behind.\n3: Talents > Items mean characters (especially carries) aren't hyperscaling out of control.\n\nBasically, if you want melee carries to be viable, you have to DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of burst in the game for all characters, or make characters tankier (as in 350-700 HP at level 18 with more defense and MR). Or even do both. \n\nSo my list of changes would be\n\n1: All characters get between 100-200 more base HP depending on class (squishier classes get more), and get 12-24 HP per level. \n2: Critical Strike is removed, Critical Strike on items replaced with AD. Infinity Edge cost increased to 3800, gives 100 AD and increases the damage done by basic attacks by 30%. Essence Reaver is now 2800 gold, 60 AD, 10% Lifesteal, 10% CDR, Gains 1 AD and 0.5 CDR minion kill up to a cap of 20, unique active - activate this item to consume all stacks to heal .75% of missing health and mana per stack (Cooldown 15 seconds).

Or the numbers are so high that you might as well call it \"burst per second\", in that case you started playing a burst mage with a seemingly infinite rotation. That's the worst case scenario to so speak.

Neither of them are DoT mages - they are DPS mages - that means they use a lot of abilities in order to deal sustained damage. Cassiopeia also is more of a DPS mage than DoT mage (and her rework was heavily criticized for it). DoT mages, like the name suggests, **use Damage over Time abilities in order to deal most of their damage.**\n\nCurrently, there are very few DoT mages (and all of them have important secondary roles):\n{{champion:50}} {{champion:27}}  {{champion:90}} {{champion:17}} (Yes, I omitted Cassio, because as I said - she's more of a DPS mage than DoT mage and most of her damage come from E, not W or Q (she used to be a DoT mage though))\n\nAnd important to note - none of them were problematic because of their DoTs - but by different parts of their kits (Swain - Sustain, Singed - Proxy, Cassio - E, Malzahar - Lockdown, Teemo - Invisible Traps). And currently most of them are fine (Malza might be a bit overperforming, while Singed is underperforming - but only by a very slight margin).\n\nThat said - most of what you said can be applied to DPS mages - which makes them mostly identical to marksmen (Magic damage vs Physical damage). The problem is when they can build a decent amount of defense and still be dealing carry level of damage AND that's number 1 problem with Ryze ever since I remember.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2017-07-06T04:05:06.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A very good summation.

In every lol game there are several ways to deal with problematic archetypes. For example if one faces extraordinary healing, then one can choose to counter said healing with burst and grievous wounds. Riot is progressing towards a game in which nearly every archetype will have a counter. Look at their more recent (as in over the past couple seasons) for evidence of this. Not only are there ubiquitous counters, but archetypes work together in different ways. Some archetypes support each other, for example healers are much stronger when paired with archetypes that need sustain. Divers are much stronger when paired with hard engage.\n\nBecause of how flexible each team can be, archetypes help players build and counter build teams. For the reasons I've stated I don't really think any of the archetypes you mentioned are problematic. Rather I think it's just that certain champions can be unbalanced. This can happen with any champion, and any overpowered or underpowered champion feels bad whether it's a healer, tank, mage, or anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-07-05T06:15:57.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am not sure if the comment on the style of writing is constructive criticism or a compliment, and at this point my sleep-deprived brain is too fired up by coffeine and self-destructive brain chemistry to come to a proper conclusion to that. \n\nAnyways, back to topic: the problem cannot be solved by having certain archetypes cancel out each other, that's what got us this horrid damage creep in the first place. Imagine if every archetype was a pillar holding this game up. At some point other pillars can make up for pillars that don't fit well enough and prevent things from breaking down completly. That however doesn't change the overall instability or potential tilt in the architecture. \n\nMaintaining the status quo to prevent things from getting worse is a legitimate strategy, but that also prevents things from getting better. Wouldn't it make more sense to just lift the whole thing up, get the unfitting pillars out and then place the game on a bunch of specifically new-made ones? Sure, it would be more work, but way more effective in the long run. \n\nThe problem with these specific archetypes is that simple tweaking doesn't cut it, and this game has by far not the depth that to every archetype you can cook up something that can counter it. At least not yet, and at the current pace we will take some time to get there, which would be a challange in itself to get it right, given that competitive games function best on simplicity.\n\nGenerally your statement of archetype interaction is true, it does only really work with those that do not stand in direct conflict with the nature of the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Need Gold 4 Tent","date":"2017-07-05T08:19:43.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When it was a lot simpler, what I called the \"balance triangle\" existed in a few aspects of the game.

And now imagine it runs infinite counter-spells. Everything you do, everything you try will just be negated, even your biggest team effort, as long as it does not insta-kill my entire team will be negated by me just pressing \"R\" and that's not even accounting for the normal healing. \n\nWhat? \nJust run a different strategy, if someone is running [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46741) counterspell, you run [aethervial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=420593)/[Mistcutter Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373727) type of decks.\n\nEven [shit like this](https://youtu.be/M8vq7GxCg2o?t=45s) is capable of being dealt with, even if its annoying as hell.\n\nSame goes for dedicated healers, because damage is wasted on non healers as long as the healer is nearby, you adapt and try to not have teamfights and keep people split or focus the healer. Healers force teamwork and in a team based game that's a good thing to have.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-07-06T05:04:21.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DoT champion:\n1. {{champion:25}} \nbalance changes:\nseason 0: 4 changes\nseason 1: 19 changes\nseason 2: 0 changes\nseason 3: 5 changes (only 2 of them were balance changes)\nseason 4: 1 small nerf\nseason 5: 4 changes\nseason 6: 0 changes\nseason 7: 1 change (happened due to everyone receiving a bit more mr)\n\nlook, a balanced DoT champion.\nsay bye bye to your point ;)\n\nhttp://lol.gamepedia.com/Morgana_-_The_Fallen_Angel#v7\npatch history for more details","replies":[]}]}
