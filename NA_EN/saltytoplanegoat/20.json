Objectives ARE more important than kills, but seeing as we had just taken drag not sure what your point is......\n\nTahm stun after Devour is literally a quarter of a second?

Support switched from {{champion:432}} to {{champion:106}} so we could have all animals and we just made jokes about it all game. The end of the game the opponents asked if we were a 5 man bc we were joking and screwing around so much, and at least 3 of us were solo and just apparently ranked is the land of random fun shit now instead of being serious.\n\nLol, the best part is it was probably the least toxic game I've had in a while bc we didn't get behind and were just joking and having fun all game, and I got 24 LP at the end of it.","replies":[{"poster":"The Deckowner","date":"2016-04-13T03:57:36.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog isnt an animal, should play twitch","replies":[{"poster":"warmcorntortilla","date":"2016-04-13T09:17:40.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's a critter. he counts.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"blkKalameet","date":"2016-04-13T02:48:39.910+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is no season 6, this is just an extended preseason for s7.","replies":[{"poster":"GenghisEmo","date":"2016-04-14T05:14:24.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly my thoughts XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mael bro","date":"2016-04-13T12:13:18.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Classic boards QQ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Secretlolz","date":"2016-04-13T00:19:57.690+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"This game is a complete joke and It's dead to me.

Things get shaken up every week.  I look forward to the mage update though.  I play a lot of mages and get tired of seeing heavy AD comps with multiple hexdrinkers.\n\nI also find it weird to see that people don't believe mages are supposed to do damage.  In any other game that I've ever played one of the definitions of a mage is a long range glass cannon.  I mean honestly... diablo 3 (not the best game, but a good example) the wizard has an option for a talent literally called \"glass cannon.\"  If they only bring utility that's functionally a support, and not all mages are supports.","replies":[{"poster":"Leetri","date":"2016-04-13T14:56:48.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a side note regarding mages, I find it funny how the D3 Wizard in Heroes of the Storm had the longest range poke (could literally take down at least 1 tower without taking damage before Minions even spawned), the highest damage, the most mobility, being the tankiest character because of a massive shield on your teleport and healing for a quarter of your HP every time you get a kill or assist, the shortest cooldowns AND a complete reset on cooldowns on kills or assists. She's an ungodly chimera of pre-nerf Kassadin, Vel'Koz, Katarina and Aurelion Sol, the avatar of Overloaded. \nRight now she has a 99.3% popularity (pick/ban), what even is that?

This solo q god is going to 1v5 all the lcs next split claiming his gold border pedastool. there is a running meme out there right now based on people who only played ranked games and yes it is \"solo q masters\" whether its in challenger where they really are masters and you silly golds who are also \"quote on quote\" masters\"\"\".
