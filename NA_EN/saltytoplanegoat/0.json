You can test yourself if you don't believe me; make a custom game with a Trist bot, or an Amumu bot, or a Ziggs bot. I guess Amumu's easy to confuse for a yordle, I mean even Riot thought he was for a long time.\n\nSo in line with that the \"Why would I need a spirit's help?\" Is probably the question for a question a yordle might pose: \"Do you seek the blessing of X?\" X being whatever spirit Illaoi is referring too. We know little of how yordle culture works in the new Runeterra, but my assumption is that there is a god or powerful entity within the yordle's culture. What exactly that thing is is up for debate, but considering the whole Keeper of the Hammer deal, I personally think that Poppy's long lore might give us a few details.\n\nConsidering she knows darkin are a thing, and just about NO ONE knows about them, I doubt she actually thinks yordles are spirits.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-11-28T18:44:01.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something to do with the origins of the Yordle race?","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2015-11-28T18:47:40.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if we are talking about origins here... especially the comment with the \"inspire\" makes me think.\n\nOn another note, maybe there is a connection to the Fae?

That's actually pretty complicated and hard to discern considering we don't know where the horribly named Yordle Lands are in new Runeterra. Assuming there's some similarities geography wise to old Runeterra then yordles come from a part of the world so remote that it's honestly acceptable that some humans have no idea what the sod a yordle is and have never met them. Before you yell at me for that one consider the following about Poppy, if we consider a massive continent like Valoran and her travelling alone and by foot:\n\n- Poppy's aim is to get to Demacia.\n- Poppy's journey starts in Bandle City, on the _opposite side of Valoran_.\n- She'd have to go through the Kumungu,\n- Then through the hundreds of miles wide Shurima desert,\n- Then around Mount Targon,\n- Then what would be the Kaladoun if that still exists,\n- And then through the entire Kingdom of Demacia to reach the capital, which is the most likely place she'll go.\n\nThat's a LONG distance. Let's remember that yordles evolved in the jungles of Valoran and only resembled modern day yordles in any way a few thousand years ago, back when human societies were already developed. The oldest record we as readers have of yordles living in Runeterra is Gnar's cave drawings, which are likely from several thousand years ago, when the Frozen Watchers had a massive conquering of Valoran going on thanks to their Iceborn servants. And let's also not forget their empire was not the first major human civilization of recorded Valorian history; the Madelords and Protectorate were. \n\nWith that in mind yordles likely only entered the scene of developed societies in Runeterra fairly recently, and seeing them outside of the yordle lands would've been unheard of for the longest time, or got you accused for being drunk and seeing diminutive furry people.\n\nNow on to the inspiration line, well really that sounds like a yordle thing to do considering how upbeat, optimistic and cheery they are. Considering yordles being so unheard of until more recent times, potentially up until as early as a century ago if we really want to push it, then any stories that actually had yordles in them might depict them as just being inspiring as individuals across the board, due to them being so naturally positive. I can imagine old folk tales where people meet yordles and it was thanks to the yordle's inspiration people managed to overcome adversity. \n\nOf course that could all be a load of bollocks, what do I know?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot ShadowStorm","date":"2015-11-29T05:58:31.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=eLmcd5VT,comment-id=0004000000010001,timestamp=2015-11-28T19:09:41.644+0000)\n>\n> Now on to the inspiration line, well really that sounds like a yordle thing to do considering how upbeat, optimistic and cheery they are.

Illaoi seeing one is an insult to her strength and fortitude. Tahm Kench wants to exploit mankind, so he rivals helpful yordles. Gregor from the Howling Abyss is insulted by a visiting yordle because their appearance before him would imply that he is not a proud Iceborn warrior, but a regular human. Yordles physically manifest according to their spiritual nature (militaristic ones will appear as soldiers, scientists will be exaggerated as such, and a righteous one such as Poppy will look like a Demacian soldier), which explains why they all look different.\n\nIn lieu of Tahm considering certain yordles to be rivals, and Illaoi seeing yordles as spirits...\n\nI think it's plausible so say that yordles, in general, are viewed as helpful spirits by peoples outside of Bandle City. (Poppy is a good instance of this. She is trying to deliver a legendary hammer to a worthy hero, and would probably be viewed as a helpful wandering spirit trying to give away a fantastic weapon)\nWhereas Tahm Kench (and his considered ally, Aatrox), seem to be more malevolent spirits that represent different thematics (such as Desire and Wrath)\n\nOf Tahm's rivals, Corki, Heimerdinger, Rumble, Tristana, and Ziggs, all have some form of technology about them, whether they are pioneering it or using it. Tahm Kench hangs around Bilgewater now, and Bilgewater seems to be a bit more primitive in terms of technology, and there is a kind of mythological/spiritual culture about the place. Tahm Kench, being a spirit himself, would thrive here. The technological advancement of the 5 technological yordles contradict a culture of spirituality. Tahm Kench cannot thrive in a world where technology pushes out spirituality.\n\nLulu and Gnar were suspended in time, so they are technically very old. Perhaps Tahm dislikes them because they know of the world long ago, and may have an inkling of Tahm's true nature, before he assumed the form of the charismatic catfish. \n\nKennen, being a part of the Kinkou Order (I think that's what it's called??), is a fighter for balance in the world. Tahm thrives off imbalance in the hearts of people, so Kennen and Tahm's ideals conflict in this way.\n\nPoppy, being attracted to Demacia and looking up to the likes of Garen, probably has some ideals pertaining to lawful righteousness and mental fortitude. Again, contradicting Tahm's ideals and success.\n\nI don't know what to make of Tahm's relation to Teemo and Fizz. \n\nAnd the bottom line of all of this: _**Illaoi recognizes yordles to be spirits who aid humans**_.\n\nAnother thing of interest is that Gregor (ghost shopkeeper on Howling Abyss), says to visiting yordles \"A yordle?! Gah!\"\nWhat comes to my mind is that Gregor takes pride in being an Iceborn (\"I am Iceborn!\"), and having a yordle appear to him is insulting his being. Gregor says that the Iceborn \"were human once\", and he takes pride in being an Iceborn. Having a yordle appear before him would be to imply \"you are not Iceborn, you are a regular human\". So to Gregor, seeing a yordle is a bit insulting to who he is. \n\nSetting aside the ideals of the above yordles and how they conflict with Tahm, reconsider their spiritual nature: helpful spirits to mankind. Tahm seeks to exploit men for the sake of his own gain, and helpful spirits would undo that. Yordles being spirits would also help to explain why they look so different from one another. They physically manifest according to their thematic/ideal, which may have some implications for Teemo and Fizz's purpose, based on how they look.\n\nAll just hypothesis though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sardonic Sloth","date":"2015-11-29T14:01:43.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kyoki Shinkuro,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=eLmcd5VT,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-28T18:24:47.021+0000)\n> Also...
