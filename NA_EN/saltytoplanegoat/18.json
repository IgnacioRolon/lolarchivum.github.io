It would make sense for a species that spends 99% of its life underwater to have adapted like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also know that the vastayan come from an ancient union of humans and aetherical shapeshifters, so we never know how big the human influence is on this - and so there is the chance that what we are talking about is not an air bladder but indeed fish-boobs.\r\n\r\nSo what of the two is it. Or is ot both? \r\n\r\nI know the question is silly, but for some reason I REALLY NEED TO KNOW. Some people are kept awake at night by questions about existence and philosophy, and I wonder if one of my favourite champions has boobs or not. Not sure how weird my brain is, but hey what can you do about it?","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-04-27T16:04:22.160+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are boobs. marai are vastayah, vastayah are human/animal hybrids. the human part is mammal, therefore the fish people are atleast part mammal, and that means that they can be breasts without any logical fallacy.

The human body is relatively poorly suited for swimming due, in part, to our lungs' location, making our bottom portion very non-buoyant relative to our upper body.\n\n Preferably, an aquatic creature would have any sort of air bladder located close to its center of mass, or have a number of small air bladders spread evenly throughout the body. Having her breasts be air bladders (or, at least, the only air bladders) would be impractical on many accounts, since they would leave her extremely unbalanced - they are not only on her upper body, but also on the front of her body. That would make it extremely difficult for her to swim, since they would pull her upright and on her back.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2017-04-27T21:06:46.635+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"easy solution\nher booty is also filled with air","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-04-27T21:13:04.206+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't argue with this kind of logic, folks.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-04-27T22:47:56.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And he might even have a point.
