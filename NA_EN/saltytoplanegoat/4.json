Very weird.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really a weird problem. In the loading screen my ping is shown jumping in a range between 200-2500 ms.\r\n\r\nSeveral ping spikes and short dcs happen then in the first two minutes of the game. The rest of the match is playable with no disruptions and a smooth 29 ms ping.\r\n\r\nTbh I have absolutely no clue what is causing this. Firewall is adjusted to the game, every other online application works just fine... can't think of anything. My personal fear is that it suddenly starts going beyond the two minute mark and loses me a game for it. So... any clue what this could be any how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-11T16:58:26.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!

However, as I am somewhat familiar with the topic the offered solutions are usually only working if there are constant issues.\n\nHowever, as I did another game I could observe it again: there are no lags or pingspikes after the 2 minute mark. ONLY before it. So this isse might be a bit more weird/complex.\n\nI can post the log here if you think that would help. Meanwhile I consider using the Hextech Repair Tool...","replies":[]}]}]}
