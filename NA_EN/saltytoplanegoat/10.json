Yes sure Rhaast is loud, and loves playing the \"muahahaha I'm so evil kill them all\"-part, but then again the ego of an edgy teenager is enough to keep him in line and his weapon is the most clunky thing you could ever use in close combat. Even when you have the necessary strenght to make it lethal, a farming tool is a farming tool, and not a weapon. Like I could understand if a Darkin was banished into a random object if they were a mage or something, but Rhaast is obviously more on the warrior-side of things. \n\nAnd we also know that all the Darkin are the surviving ascendants of the ancient shuriman empire, those that were purged by an targonian intervention and sealed. The only ones who survived this were Renekton, who like Xerath was sealed away and probably thought dead by most, and Nasus who at that point had become a hermit driven almost insane by grief. Azir was pretty much stuck in the RAM-Storage of the sun-disk as his ascension had an unscheduled shutdown with a server downtime that spanned several thousand years. \n\nSo at some point those Darkin were one big group or rather family. And if you look at it from that perspective, doesn't Rhaast appear a lot more, I don't know, \"childish\" compred to the others? He tries so desperatly hard to look evil and murderous to the point of even picking a weapon because it looks evil and cool over its actrual fighting capabilities. Meanwhile, the others don't \"try\" to look like they are about to end the world. It's pretty much their default state.\n\nBy my theory human Rhaast was never really a scholar or a warrior, but someone who through countless accidents became a shuriman hero, ascended, and then tried to find his place in a group that he knew he was definetly not qualified for to be a part of - and to compensate for that he tried so, so hard, to the point of it actually backfiring on him. \n\nMy guess is, that Rhaast is the \"most human\" Darkin there is, because he was also one of the \"weakest\", and most human ascendants - and that opens an interesting plot line for Kayn and Rhaast: when the evil demon weapon now suddenly the one with more humanity than the one wielding it. Because let's be real, Kayn is one giant murderous mess psychologically speaking. Child-soldiers turned assassins are not exactly known for their mental stability OR their exceptional moral compas - and I think we can also blame Zed's possibly nonexistent parenting skills on that one. \n\nThe Darkin will \"turn good\" at some point, or at least they will stop trying to end the world, but one of them has to turn first. The typical (lame) storyline for this would be to have the love of Kal and Valmar convince Varus to let go of his harted, but who wants something as cheesy as that anyways?

Literally everything that stands between me and my morning caffeine is pretty much asking for obliberation. But all silly jokes aside, I get this weird feeling that Rhaast doesn't want to even dominate. The darkin have spend centuries in total isolation, deprived of even the most basic sensual stimulus. Sure, some got a little bit mad like Aatrox, but for the most part, imagine if after all this time, you have someone you could just hang out and talk with. Isn't that just the best thing?\n\nIf he takes over Kayn, the only \"friend\" he has had since centuries if not millenia of isolation, will be gone, and he will be alone again. I doubt that is the price he wants to pay. He would never admit that tho, dude's probably a hyper-tsundere resulting for centuries of pretending how much of a strong and badass acendant/darkin he was in front of the others. \n\nThe Darkin are not some crazy magic space parasites that take over people as their nature - they are just tormented beings sealed BY crazy magic space parasites that take over people, aka Targonians. The human/darkin relationship can as well be a symbiosis instead of a parasitic takeover, and that is probably the best thing, as that would be just a massive middle finger into the face of Targon. Both Varus and Kayn are examples of that even when you purposefully turn them into parasitic monsters, they don't have to be what they were doomed to be and can be so much more.","replies":[{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2018-10-24T10:43:44.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would find that idea rather interesting--I love the idea of them working together as a host and sentient symbiote.\n\nAt the same time, their marketing and everything has literally been based around \"one will triumph, the other will fall.\" If they ended up synergizing to the point of achieving a balance with strengths of *both* in-game outcomes, without being able to replicate that outcome in-game, I think that would be a bit...dissonant, shall we say?\n\nOn the other hand, if Rhaast wins Kayn's soul still exists (it's just \"weeping in the abyss between worlds\")--meaning that in theory Rhaast *could* perhaps give back the body to some extent if he felt lonely...","replies":[{"poster":"NotaRobot1006","date":"2018-10-24T15:08:08.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> On the other hand, if Rhaast wins Kayn&#x27;s soul still exists (it&#x27;s just &quot;weeping in the abyss between worlds&quot;)--meaning that in theory Rhaast *could* perhaps give back the body to some extent if he felt lonely...\n\nOoh, I like that idea.
