Should he not evolve off his current path, he will learn all the wrong lessons instead of the right ones and become a villain. \n\nThat said, you SHOULD worry about Ez. It's what we do for characters we love. Care and worry makes for good stories. It's not as dire as you paint it, but it could get there. He's on what's called an \"evolution plot\". If he doesn't change his ways, he moves to the opposite path, a \"devolution plot\". To see what this looks like, watch Better Call Saul. \n\nBTW: you can root for a character and not like them.

It’s so cool to talk to the people writing this.\n\nI object to the word “mature,” since it implies that children are naturally like Ezreal and must just grow out of it.  Children, like adults, generally understand right and wrong.  But some of them just don’t care.  They only get worse as they get older, so we must notice them early and not delude ourselves about what they really are, or squeamish about what we must do.  Isolate, confine, and _forget_.\n\nEzreal is one of them.  Even if he had his parents, he would not have been much different.  He belongs in jail, with his estate confiscated by the state.  And speaking of Better Call Saul, Saul is just a degenerate who disgraces the ethical oaths he swore for a quick buck.  When the judge finds out about his misdeeds, we can only hope he adds a lengthy felony stay in state prison to the removal of Saul’s license.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSchizzle","date":"2018-10-26T14:08:15.110+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, you are arguing nature vs nurture.

Empathy is fascinating.\n\nMaturity is a general term that implies biology, emotional, and psychological elements. In Ez's case -- he's immature. He is like a child. Not all children are like Ez -- that's your projection/definition -- and in no way does that mean all kids are like Ez. \n\nIsolate, confine, and forget is how we get monsters lurking in the closet. \n\nEzreal is not a monster. Again, he has one inside and he could potentially become one, but to me there's a heart in Ez that yearns to come out into the light. Then again, as a tireless optimist, I believe in the best in all people. Decision, consequence, and change whittle us into new people one stroke at a time. Do not be so hasty to dismiss and condemn. The fact that we are having this conversation means that new Ez is working.

That's honestly a Herculean effort and going against what I believe about characters. Once we judge a character, we cement who they are in our minds, and only further stories can convince us otherwise. I don't want to interfere directly with someone else's perception of the character/work. All I will say is each choice, each line, and each story beat was intentionally placed. Some people, for reasons I can't understand, solve bits of the puzzle and then get mad at the puzzle. \n\nThere's an old saying about storytelling: \"the villain at noon is the hero by three\". If people don't like where we placed Ez in League, that's okay. Strong reactions indicate passion. My only hope is I get to share with you all the long term and short term arcs I planned for Ezreal while writing him, because there is a LOT more to say with him. \n\nIf you can't see or find the heart of the character hiding under his obvious overcompensation, that's okay! I'm not going to point it out to anyone. You can not like things and disagree with an author's choices. I accept this. If someone wants to believe Ezreal is a sociopathic affluenza monster, well I'm really not one to invalidate anyone's opinion. My guess is that characters who don't earn or suffer for their rewards infuriate others who have to suffer and work hard. This is VERY true in life. People have very odd reactions to those who lead \"charmed lives\" like Ezreal. Not to be confused with Semi-Charmed Life by Third Eye Blind, one of the most underrated rock acts of the late 1900's/early 2000's (and still going strong today!). Those to whom it seems everything comes naturally or easily are prone to being immediately hated or discounted. \n\nAnd yes, Ezreal is very distrustful of more bilgewater residences. He does love a good game of Krakenhand, even though he doesn't know how to play.

His attempts to act cool and cocky to gain recognition feels organic, considering he's missed the love and attention from his parents for a good majority of his life, he needs to find approval from others to compensate.\n\nThis makes him, I would say...desperate?

In my experience early on women respond to leading, emotions and validation especially younger girls like Lux (she's like 21-22 right?)\n\nOn paper, logistically I would say Ezreals' chances are very good based on his background. He's an explorer that goes to exciting new places and Lux comes from a very insular oppressive society that would look down on her for what she is. The real world parallel that immediately comes to my mind is slut shaming in conservative third world countries, girls coming to America as exchange students from countries that have very narrow views on extra-marital sex are usually slamdunks because a natural urge has been suppressed and can now be explored in a vacuum of complete non-judgement.\n\nYou see where I'm going with this right?\n\nOf course it's hopeless because Riot is writing Ezreal to be a bumbling idiot in front of Lux, even though with his qualities it doesn't make a lot of sense. He's confident, well traveled, independent, fits the \"pretty boy\" mold very well (according to the LoL community lol) all extremely attractive traits.  Maybe the direction they want to go with this is Ezreal wants Lux, but she rebukes him until he becomes more empathetic and in the process she makes him a \"real man\", can't blame them it's a very mainstream notion, a little overdone though.

She would see right through him.\n\nAnd what’s behind him isn’t pretty.  He’s just as obsessed with his image on the inside as he is on the outside, and he’s just as reckless in private as in public.  There’s no reason for Lux to want to a second date, if he could even convince her to go on the first.\n\nThird, Lux doesn’t seem repressed in general, and it’s a stereotype that kids who aren’t ‘allowed’ to do things at home will necessarily go wild in college.  Some just don’t want to.  Lux, in particular, just wants not to be hated and feared for her powers.  I doubt Ezreal is sensitive enough to help her with those feelings.  And that’s just the problem: there’s nothing to like about him that isn’t superficial.\n\nSo when the time for the redemption arc comes, Ezreal just won’t redeem himself.  He has no reason to.

Of course men and women are are different in many esoteric indeterminable ways, I never suggested they weren't or that there is a \"one size fits all approach\" to women, BUT there are undeniable patterns that you start to recognize that are separate from simple personality differences. Constants that are more associated with age, upbringing, social norms and cultural differences. Constants in any seduction that are simply effective because they prime someones biology bypassing everything else because it appeals to them on a more primal level. It's like they say, Attraction isn't a Choice (google it, it's a good read). That's more what I'm getting at. Of course these surface level differences are still important which is why you should always try to determine the girls \"blueprint\" beforehand.\n \nSecond you seem to be confusing my point. That attraction is NOT based on a moral standing or strong ethical boundaries, quite frankly I wish that was true would make dating in general simpler. Just be a good dude and get all the girls lol. Unfortunately that's a very one-dimensional way of looking at it and overly idealistic to boot in my opinion. Without an overarching strategy and a good \"hook\" you're just going to be playing the numbers game and probably not going to be attracting many quality girls. A \"hook\" in this scenario could be the unrepentant bad boy that the girl wants to \"fix\" him. I actually don't like this hook in real life as it can be disingenuous but you would have to be crazy to admit it isn't compelling. Just one look at the media targeted at women confirms this (50 shades, romcoms etc etc).\n\nThird. While you are right the \"small town girl in the big city\" stereotype is very much a stereotype, but like all stereotypes there is some truth to it or it wouldn't exist at all. In my own personal experience being a former college student and working for a big company that employed a lot  exchange students, it's one that was proved true with almost freakish regularity. You may be different, associate with different kinds of people or have a different experience of life and that's fine, but this is what I have experienced and I'm sure many others who are open-minded can corroborate that they have seen a similar side to people.\n\nAnd finally\n>  By your logic, Piltover should have plenty of others.\n\nNot at all. I was merely applying a \"blueprint\" to Lux that I have found effective when comparing to other girls that are in a similar situation to her. If Piltover already is the free \"America\" in this context doing that would be COUNTER to what I suggested. You are right in a way though. Abundance is always good so Ez should also learn how to attract women in Piltover/ in general and not just rely on gimmicks that can make you very much a one-trick pony so to speak.\n\nAgain League of Legends lore is a work of fiction and is thus subject to the injection of ideals, values and group-think mentalities above raw attraction so that it is easy to digest for all. A conventional pickup cannot work because it doesn't convey a message that can be mass marketed. Ezreal will get the girl because he changed for her and we should all strive to be better OR he won't get the girl because Lux is a strong independent Demacian who don't need no man. A story like Lux was intrigued and made curious because Ezreal represented a side of her that she never got to express. Or Ezreals' disregard for others signaled that he held himself in high esteem made her feel all tingly inside, won't sell even though they are more true to life. Unless this story was being marketed as a romance story and had some nuance in it. In the mainstream true love conquerors all is much more... palatable I guess is the word I'd use.\n\n\n- Peace","replies":[{"poster":"Ifneth","date":"2018-10-25T17:19:13.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could just say “Hi,” ask them about what they do and what their interests are, and see if you have anything in common.  If so, then enjoy the conversation and ask for their contacts once one of you must leave.  If not, then on to the next one.  Even if they turn out to be taken, you’ll still have had a nice conversation and made a good acquaintance or friend.\n\nWhile this does work on strangers, you have better odds of meeting someone you like at places where you can meet people you like, such as book clubs, churches, non-profits, etc.  Look around, and if anyone there interests you, just say “Hi!”.  There’s no trick—just the effort and patience it takes to make anything that lasts.\n\nThere is no trick.  They know what you want, and if you’re polite, considerate, and genuinely interested in them as people, they’re generally _happy_ about it.  You would be, too.

Or Freedom, Justice and the American Way! Or saying money won't make you happy. All true in their own way but NOT completely true. Saccharine sweet ideals that aren't nuanced enough to explore a deeper side.\n\nIt's hard to explain what I'm saying because technically every point you made is correct. Make interesting conversation, play the field, be patient but there is another side to it that you are completely ignoring.

It’s not that hard.\n\nShe does know that guys often judge a girl who initiates, yet she still wants someone as much as they do.  So, she either just says the heck with that, and believes everyone should be able to talk to everyone else, or is kinda traditional and does hope a boy comes by.

It was warm and stern and curious—and she was smiling just like him.  With a blush, he walked over and said, “H-hi!”\n\n>”Luxanna Crownguard of Demacia,” she replied, curtsying her little skirt.  Ezreal tried to speak, but he couldn’t find the words.  The princess filled the awkward pause with practiced grace, “Tell me about your discoveries!”  Ezreal sighed inwardly, relieved to speak of something more familiar than that feeling, which by then had crept all over him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-10-25T13:33:45.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is like 17, so is Ezreal.
