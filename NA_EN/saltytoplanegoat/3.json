Those are however easily indeintified: they make a massive mess, the lesson is learned, and the mistake will not happen again - and somewhere in between the dude is fired. Sadly, Ghostcrawler is none of those. The problem with him is that he has the completly wrong visions and goals about something that will inevitably BREAK by trying to force it to fill into those goals. It&#039;s like a political ideologist ignoring all reality for his grand project, no matter how many problems it causes. (*add &quot;communism&quot; joke here*)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that such a process is slow, so there&#039;s no &quot;big bang&quot; that will make the company just slam the breaks and correct the course. If anything, once enough energy and effort has been invested on such a &quot;wrong route&quot;, they just keep going, because &quot;well we already put so much into it!!!&quot;, which is the absolute opposite of it being helpful. \r\n\r\nNow what am I talking about in specific? Not really the runes, or the preseason, it&#039;s about the general underlying philosophy. Now I remember him saying things like making this game a thing for generations, something extremly big and whatever - and already here I&#039;d say &quot;No. Stop. This is not how any of this works at all&quot;. While it is true that LoL is a massive part of gaming history already and surely a landmark of geek culture, that is not a basis to develop a game on - mostly because even of the best medial product people will grow tired off. Starcraft 2 is a massive part of gaming culture as well, and it was a big deal while it lasted, and now it&#039;s coming out as F2P and none cares anymore. That&#039;s just how things are - and Blizzard did the right thing that any gaming company would do: bring things to an end and do what is your job as a game dev, which is MAKING A NEW GAME, which they did with Overwatch.\r\n\r\nBut how does this affect LoL? Well, Riot as a studio is completly fixated on this ONE GAME THAT TOTALLY IS THEIR LEGACY TO THE GAMING WORLD or whatever according to Ghostcrawler. Since it is their only product aside from some random merch, they have to profit from it because a game company doesn&#039;t run of air and water. Now, that inevitably sends the focus towards the ECONOMICALLY MOST PROFITABLE PLAYER GROUPS.\r\n\r\nAnd those are: Esports and New Players. \r\n\r\nEsports is where the game celebrates itself, and where the most high sums of money flow - simply the money you could charge for ADs from sponsors must be enormous. Or the sponsors of esports teams - in South Korea there&#039;s a whole industry around it. At the same time you have a certain star-dom for your playerbase, which is also nice to have. Not much needs to be said here. \r\n\r\nNew Players lack most of the content, so they are most likely to spend the most money. Also they are not invested enough in the game to actually see any of its flaws properly yet, making them the perfect cashcow to milk.\r\n\r\nNote that both groups are ABSOLUTE MINORITIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE NORMAL PLAYERBASE. Yet, all design goes towards those two groups, and it all boils together when suddenly the game gets designed around the idea, how fun it is to WATCH ESPORTS FROM A NEWBIE PERSPECTIVE.\r\n\r\nThe thing is tho: a video game is something you PLAY, not something you primarely WATCH. So gearing a game towards watchability is obviously pressing against the core principles that made it a good game to begin with. Faster matches, more damage, RANDOM THINGS FLYING AROUND AND GO BOOM!! Who gives a shit about immobile champs? No one, they are not funny to watch or make big plays. Even trades? No, we want people to go for the 1vs5 sole-hero narrative and GET AWAY WITH IT, because that is more &quot;exciting&quot;.\r\n\r\nNo one at Riot cares about the millions and millions of people who a) don&#039;t watch esports and b) aren&#039;t easily fascinated newbies who are potential whales (&quot;big spenders&quot;). They don&#039;t even give a shit about the &quot;old whales&quot; either - those have no more money to spend after all, and if then only for the occasional new skin. Not comparable to the amount of money a new one could spend.\r\n\r\nAnd in the position Riot is in now, they are forced to keep on that because they are economically dependant on their one single game they have. \r\n\r\nYou know what they SHOULD have done? Used the fact that they have build a recognicable brand and popular characters to expand with new titles. Used the lore as a springboard for new games and then distributed then over their already existing audience for cheap. Like, imagine they made something like a nice and neat metroidvania platformer about Ezreal exploring the world or some other nonsense, and then sold it for RP over the client, maybe for 10 or 15 bucks. Given the million-strong audience combined with a relatively low development cost, they would have raked in MILLIONS in profit, while at the same time they would have expanded on the story, which in turn would have opened up more options. Not to mention the whole universe they&#039;d could have established in modern geek culture...\r\n\r\nBut in this case they wouldn&#039;t be dependant on SPECIFIC MINORITY GROUPS to keep their actual big title going. \r\n\r\nThat&#039;s what a smart game studio does: producing games. And since Riot has not produced a single thing in the last years aside from a number of extra characters and a whole flood of irrelevant cosmetics, I think it is safe to say that as a gaming company right now they are an utter failure. They tied themselves to their game, sink or swim, with Ghostcrawler being the figurehead of it all.\r\n\r\nBut it will sink. That&#039;s not pessimissm or me wanting the game to die, it just a FACT. In five to ten years LoL will be &quot;history&quot; and new games will take the stage, as it has always been. The mere idea that you can keep a game running forever is already nonsense, the attempt to design around such a concept is already taking the first steps to making sure it dies even faster.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s kinda fascinating how the pattern repeats: back then WoW was THE thing. It was the thing that would stick around forever and ever, then A CERTAIN SOMEONE build on that vision despite it going against the fundamental principles of the medium itself, and then that fucked over a lot of things did a lot of damage. \r\n\r\nNow we have a game that is seemingly THE BIG THING THAT&#039;S GOING TO BE AROUND FORVER, and yet again there is a certain someone, WHO&#039;S ACTUALLY THE VERY SAME PERSON, who does the exactly same thing which again fucks over a lot of things because of the very same reasons he fucked up things before. \r\n\r\nGames are not meant to last forever. No form of media does. Sure, some become classics, but even those are barely watched. It&#039;s something people as a mass maybe have seen once, or something academics talk about at times, but nothing they binge on regulary. So the very notion of pushing a design on that way is going against all reason, and can only end in disaster. \r\n\r\nYa should have focussed on lore, because stories and their protagonists go on over generations. But game design? Not so much. So maybe give Ghostcrawler a slap and teach him his place, before he does not only bring the game down, but also the wonderful potential all the lore around it has.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2018-02-16T00:44:22.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Threads that are old and do not have active discussion (i.e. have \"died\" proverbially speaking) are not permitted to be \"bumped\" to reinvigorate them.

(Spoiler: I think it's fine). \n\nHowever,  I'd love a chance to talk about how we view League's long-term strategy, which may be a topic that not every player often thinks about.\n\nThe traditional way to make a game was to package it in a box for 60 USD or whatever and put it on the shelf in a Gamestop, or going way back, an EB or something. You wanted players to love your game, but you also wanted them to finish your game, because you only made money on the box, and you needed them to not only value that box, but to want the next box, and the one after that. We sometimes talk about this consumer product strategy as \"planned obsolescence.\"\n\nThe first game I worked on that didn't follow that strategy was an MMO, where much of the revenue came from a subscription. The strategy was to keep players so engaged that they never got bored and risked unsubscribing. Turns out this is pretty hard to do. Players do eventually move on to other games, so to keep your revenue constant, you need to keep bringing in new players.\n\nThis model tends to be even more extreme in microtransaction games, especially mobile ones (and especially low quality mobile ones) where players may quickly get tired of your nonsense and paywalls and running out of resources. The business model here is to constantly get new players (or rope current players into bringing in their friends) because if you ever run out of new players, you quickly run out of money.\n\nThe reason we think League can be evergreen and last for many years is that it works really differently. The game is free to play and there is no subscription. Much of League's revenue comes from optional cosmetic content. This creates a situation where players don't often feel the need to formally quit - there is no unsub moment or anything. The icon is still sitting there on your computer when you want to go back to it. So compared to many games, our churn rate is really low. Players may take breaks, but many come back. This also means we are less dependent on new players. Our strategy is to keep current players engaged and happy. Historically we've made very little effort to attract new players.\n\nIn terms of evergreen games, I often use examples like Magic, D&D or possibly Pokemon. Those are games that you can drift in and out of for years. They evolve.They release new products. But they are still recognizable over time and have been around for decades. Will they last forever? I don't know. But they last a lot longer than most games. That's what we aspire to do with League (and no, we're not there yet).\n\nRiot as a company invests heavily in esports, but on the League team it is not always forefront in our minds. Our balance philosophy for example focuses on players in the high Plat / low Diamond skill level. Balancing only for esports is a little short-sighted because you are tuning the game literally for a few dozen people, while probably making the game worse for tens of millions. When we do make changes specifically for esports, it tends to be right around Worlds and is also focused more on esports viewers than pro players. In other words, we don't make a ton of changes just for esports, and those we do make are often targeted on making a game that is fun to watch. The vast majority of our features (things like missions, champion mastery, matchmaking, Star Guardian Invasion) have almost no impact on esports at all. They are for the rest of us.\n\nAs a company, esports does have benefits and that's why it's an important part of our company strategy. We don't spend much on traditional marketing, and in a way esports is part of our marketing. Pro games also provide a way for players to stay connected to League if they're taking a break from the game as I mentioned above. Esports can also be aspirational because it's inspiring to see players playing the exact same game as you but doing things you didn't know were possible. It's an opportunity for the community to come together. It's a celebration of League.\n\nDoes Riot want additional games? Absolutely. We want to be a game company that stands the test of time, and we know we need a whole library of games to do that. But we aren't willing to shift so many resources away from League and towards new games that we hurt the one successful game that we do have. Remember, we don't need that planned obsolescence model that I mentioned above. More games will come in time, and we have time.\n\nI know that was long, but I hope it helps provide a little more perspective about how we think about product strategy.","replies":[{"poster":"BerylCrab","date":"2017-11-11T10:35:39.031+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghostcrawler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OwBA1Kct,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-11-10T22:51:26.913+0000)\n>\n> Hey there.\n> \n> I don&#x27;t really want to use this as an opportunity to defend my record.

I personally have fun on this patch, exploring new ways with runes, and only thing that is a little stingy for me is BE. By reverting the game to the previous state, you would literally revert the biggest **good** change that has happened to masteries and runes since the beginning of league. Masteries were impacting your game, but not to the point they should as pre-game modifier. New runes might not give you the expected level of engagement as for some champions one keystone is literally go-to but you can take 3 other runes and secondary path out of 4. Also, previous runes were just a base stat amplifiers and didn't influence your playstyle other than \"I'm against Zed so I'll take armor yellows\" or \"I to push on Ahri and roam so I'll take mana regen and play safer\".","replies":[{"poster":"MysticDreams12","date":"2017-11-12T04:11:09.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) Basically shoeing us into a small build path for champions, and not letting us customize as much as we want too.\n\n2) Completely taking runes out together, and giving us a small crappy patch of masteries as compensation.\n\n3) Completely shafting AP again, like they always do.

I hear the excuse of \"It would be abused by premades\" I'm sure your system knows who is premade and make the premades take the same damn penalty while the innocent players are not severely punished for something out of your own control.

It's common knowledge for crying out loud!\nif you don't want to ban people from the game just ban people from ranked mode when it's clear they are nothing but a hinderance to everyone around them. c'mon.

This aint rocket science! have the same queues as we already have just add solo queue... jesus... it should not have to be said...\n\n- there is no way to escape a game  when players want to hold you hostage on an obviously lost game.\n\n- brand new level 30 accounts get placed in silver........................... this one should be self explanatory, this creates what people call ELO hell.\n\n- I'm tired so I will make it the last one but all of the above and more does nothing but breed more toxicity into the game.\nThis sense of unfairness and Bullshit will and has created more toxicity then you would like to admit.\nI mean, I'm even guilty of it.\nit's the only reason I ever rage and i'm a very calm person in real life but this game and the shit i have to endure every single fucking day rubs me the wrong way.
