Back then in old lore that might have made sense, but right now in new lore we actually have a whole cast of body-snatching-spirit-thingies from outer space. The targonian aspects to be exact.\n\nAt first I never thought about it, because Freljord and Mt. Targon seem to be completly seperate worlds to me, but nevertheless they are connected and part of the same universe. But what exactly could Brand be an aspect of? I mean, we got the sun {{champion:89}} , the moon {{champion:131}} , the protector/life {{champion:44}}, a certain constellation {{champion:432}}  (bard is not related to targon, but as a celestial being  he still needs to posess a material body to act in thew world) and {{champion:80}} ,  and the stars/the night sky itself {{champion:136}}  (who, as a matter-manipulator, can materialize at will).\n\nHowever, there is something missing. What about a falling star? Pantheon&#039;s lore mention a falling star, although he might as well be refering to Aurelion Sol in that moment.\n\nNow imagine the following scenario: celestial body crashes down on valoran while filled with gody power. Usually it would eradicate everything in its surroundings due to the excess energy. HOWEVER, it crashed right into a giant block of true ice that basicially locks up the giant meteroite and the being it contains. \n\nHowever, it can still form a connection to a sentinent being, even when seperated in matter of space. Pretty much just how the protector &quot;pulled&quot; Taric onto the mountain, it draws a nameless Lokfarian to it and takes him over. But the fall and the long imprisonment in ice that is potentially void-corrupted might have caused some little mental damage (if the being was not insane already before dropping down to earth), and now it&#039;s oddly fixated around burning everything. (if that wasn&#039;t its thing before, just how pantheon&#039;s thing is war).\n\nWhat exactly that fallen star once was? No clue. Maybe a Targonian that has turned on his friends and was defeated? Aurelion Sol&#039;s lore mentions that there had been &quot;more voices&quot; in the past that echoed through his crown. Internal conflicts of the Targonians were mentioned as well, so Brand might be a causality of that conflict.

So literally anything you suggest could be factual. And let's be clear: Riot's never been afraid from making massive, character changing reworks. (Remember the Freljord or was that before your time?)\n\nSecond of all, again, all of the things OP listed are headcanon as well. You can approve or deny it or say \"IT HAS LIKES TO LORE\" but that don't mean a damn thing. It's still headcanon. It still has just as much relevancy as anyone elses, whether you like it or not. (From the downvotes, I'd assume not).\n\nThirdly, all your spouting about \"THEY'RE NOT FROM THIS WORLD\" is pointless because Riot has already established that they're making this a cohesive, singular world.  Notice how Renekton and Nasus used to be from another world but are now Shuriman? Notice how Taric used to be a gem knight from another dimension but is now a Targon aspect? Saying \"NO NO IT CANT BE THIS BECAUSE THE OLD LORE\"- Old Lore is dead chap. Deal.\n\n(Nocturne's also headed for a massive rework because his story is STILL all about summoners so hold onto that while you can.)\n\nAnd why should headcanon have to have direct ties to old lore or pre-existing lore? Why should one HAVE to work with old lore? Let's get one thing straight: Old lore, just like new lore, has problems. Old lore is not some friggin' sacred golden cow that can't be touched and is a bastion of narrative excellence. Arguing an idea for lore change to better suite the world (Which it would, considering it explains things better than current lore) doesn't make it wrong.\n\nYou're dismissing headcanon because you're saying it doesn't tie to the original canon.

That is not acceptable to be called a proper headcanon if I'm brutally honest here.\n\nA headcanon should fill the gaps in between what is said, not twist everything around and \"give it a new purpose\".

As an example: What are the strings to your own theory? Brand is a star because.....there are celestial bodies that exist and Brand could be one of them because he possessed someone. That's just as strong as my own. You're basically giving Brand an entire origin that in no way references anything about his previous characte other than \"stars are fire too\"r. I disagree, but I'm not going to say \"Your thread is garbage\" because I don't agree with it. (Which seems to be what's going on here)\n\nAnd if we're being brutally honest, you're cutting out just as much from Brand. He's no longer a chaotic fire elemental, he's a celestial star. Why would a star care about setting a world on fire? Does that mean Janna is an aspect from Targon as well because a wind elemental bound to her and she's the winds of the cosmos? How much are we going to cut and slash so that we're agreeing that \"it fits the universe better\"? Why is it ok for you to bend the rules of a character and make him from an entirely different realm but it's not ok for me to do similar things, just with other characters that share a thematic element?\n\nOverall, I really don't agree with head canon fitting 1:1 in the bounds of a universe. Head canon shouldn't just be about fitting puzzle pieces, it should be running with threads, seeing where they go and imagining things in new lights. Does this mean I'm passing my story/idea as law? Course not. It's just head canon. Am I completely and utterly destroying these characters to fit them to my whim? Again, of course not. Just building on what the character is.
