Or even better, make it two: one who totally hates the outfit, and another who totally ROCKS it.\n\nI know I have seen art of Gragas, Braum, Urgot, etc, but let&#039;s be real here: that body type is not fitting the aesthetic. So instead of the big buff bara men (and the cyborg) we should look at these champs: \n\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:4}} \n\nI mean, we have now three human women, two yordles, so having one or two men in the group surely can&#039;t hurt ^^\n\nAlthough... Taric technically already is a Guardian. And he is already fab as fuck (especially with the pink skin), so maybe he shouldn&#039;t be on the list ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T02:32:06.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what i'm hearing is... you want star guardian taric?\n\nOutrageous... truly truly truly outrageous.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2016-09-20T02:38:34.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I already have his pink skin, but if that one would turn out to be even MORE outragous...\n\n(Is that even possible?

The rest I don't see fitting the thematic.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2016-09-20T02:21:36.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven fits into EVERY thematic.

That guy is more brains than brawns after all ^^","replies":[]}]}]}
