Grand idea.\" The city was already an established Shuriman city, so naturally, the Shurimans in the city would have constructed mausoleums and tombs beneath the city for the dead royals and people of power. \nAlso, to the OP, the chemicals and toxins in the air come from the mass production and exploitation of chemical powered engineering, not some ancient Shuriman curse. That'd be like blaming the traffic in London on the fact that it might be built over some Celtic burial site.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scathlocke","date":"2018-09-24T21:35:23.384+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, is it not...?\n\nBRB, I've got to call my parents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2018-09-24T21:49:45.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't know man, just look at America. All these murders and crazy shootings makes you wonder if it might be related to the fact the the entire country is founded on a massive indian burial ground. (that's the meme I was getting at with this for those who still have not noticed,)\n\nThe Zaun people just did what they always do: completly disregard everything in the past that is no longer useful for the present. From what we have seen, their mentality is one about surviving today and maybe becoming better tomorrow, a mentality that is forward faced, with no time to bother with the past. \n\nLet's be real, IF there was a culture that would completly not give a shit and literally just build over a \"sacred site\" or whatever, it would be Zaun. Noxus might absorb cultures and unify them under overarching noxian paradigms, Zaun on the other hand... just eats up everything and leaves nothing behind. That's just how they are.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2018-09-25T01:14:12.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But for a \"sacred\" site to be sacred, you have to actually believe that they are. If you don't, you'll quickly find that most \"sacred\" things lose a lot of power over you. Zaun clearly values science over religious hooey, so I doubt they'd believe that any of their ancestral mausoleums would be able to do damage to them, and any damage they do they would understand to be their own doing, since most science minded societies are pretty self aware of their impacts. \n\nHowever, in the case of Runterra, there IS actual magic, but as Ezreal witnessed, it's not doing much of anything until someone violates the chambers it's protecting. So even though there are legitimate curses in the tombs below the city, they're not actively doing anything to the city because the city isn't disturbing them.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2018-09-25T03:51:55.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait.

At least two of those still remain... Most Darkin that are released from their prison kind of do that with causing a lot of death and destruction. However, our current boys are \"normal\" weapons (plus a farmers tool). There's a limit to how much chaos you can cause with these. Now, a MAGE Darkin on the other hand, that has spend the last millenia sealed away and only remained sane by improving the structure of his magic time and time again, kind off like Xerath? The release of such an entity would only happen with a massive BANG!\n\nThe incident, the Darkin, Shuriman legacy... seriously zaun has more narrative lines converging than any other place in Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Binding Eclipse","date":"2018-09-25T04:19:18.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SaltyToplaneGoat,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=qTXEVqE2,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2018-09-25T03:51:55.164+0000)\n\n> \n> The incident, the Darkin, Shuriman legacy... seriously zaun has more narrative lines converging than any other place in Runeterra.\n\nYeah, because Shurima is being shoehorned into literally everything.
