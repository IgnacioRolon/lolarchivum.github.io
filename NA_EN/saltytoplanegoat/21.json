{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-03-22T23:36:10.872+0000","title":"\"I fought a house once! Pretty sure I won!\" - Galio. Wait a minute...","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":56,"down_votes":3,"body":"First of all, this implies that it was a magical house. Galio only wakes up when there is magic around, so that element has to be involved. And at the same time that house must have had some weird properties and not just have some mages inside throwing fireballs at Galio. Just crashing into a house doesn&#039;t really count as fighting, that&#039;s just accidental property damage.\n\nBut the more I dig in my brain the concept of a &quot;magical house that is able to move (and therefore to fight theoretically)&quot; DOES ring a bell. \n\nIs anyone here familiar with the fairy tales about the witch Baba Yaga? Comes from East-European and Russian folklore I think, an old woman with mysterious magical power that lives in a house that is able to walk around on gigantic bird-feet. In some stories it is implied that the house has a will of its own, but is always loyal to its master (if you steal something she will know for example).\n\nSo there is a Baba Yaga like character in this world - and possibly even still alive, considering that Galio is not EXACTLY certain if he won. The enemy retreated at some point and left him alone, so technically that&#039;s a win, but then again he didn&#039;t get to squash his foe. (Mages make that funny sound when you do that! No fight is complete without it!).\n\nFor years I&#039;ve been waiting for an old woman character in this game, especially since the herbalist/traditional witch trope is completly unused yet when you look at the cast.","replies":[{"poster":"Adanim","date":"2017-03-23T02:18:40.469+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2425713","replies":[{"poster":"EMeta","date":"2017-03-23T07:04:28.868+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Came just for this, thanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoyUnPrededor","date":"2017-03-23T07:58:03.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping this would be in the OP, was disappoint.\n\nHave an upvote, good sir.","replies":[{"poster":"Demosthentine","date":"2017-03-23T14:55:16.414+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.
