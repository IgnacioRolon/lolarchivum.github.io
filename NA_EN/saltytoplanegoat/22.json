It&#039;s a heroe&#039;s journey through three entirely different areas to save her family from the great evil. Ironically, Azir has probably zero business with enslaving people. He would probably invite all shurimans to live in the city, to fill it with life again. Full citicen rights and all. Heck, he would probably welcome her with open arms...\n\nAlso I get the feeling our rock-bending bird might cause quite some trouble during the Freljordian Civil War. Maybe we finally get some more lore from there too?\n\nWe have to keep in mind that both Freljord and Shurima are both falling into the &quot;unfinished events&quot; category. And now we have a champion who will travel both areas.
