So someone once build this gigantic structure right in the middle of nowhere. But for what reason?\n\nGiven that no other party in lore seems to even know it exists, that means it must be in quite some remote/politically-economically irrelvant or maybe even dangerous region. Which means that either the entire civilication that build the rift vanished around it, eradicated somewhen in the Rune Wars, or that it was hidden there on purpose.\n\nBut what purpose could the Rift have? Just why would you have a gigantic mountaintop turned into a battlefields where beings from all over Runeterra appear to punch each other&#039;s crystal to death, only to repeat the process over and over and over and over again with some variation in the summoned beings?\n\nAnd what benefit could the builders of such a place draw from it? At first glance, pretty much nothing, unless they want it to be an infinite generator of salt, which is also valuable in medival societies, but probably nowhere near the point that it would justify the effort of building the darn thing.\n\nBut there is actually something you can get from this: Information. Being able to summon all sorts of beings (if they are real, parralel existences, or mirror images that just exist in this little world has to be debated at a later point) allows to run COMBAT SIMULATIONS. For once for training, for the other to allow predictions about the future: Runeterra is a world drowing in war by our modern day perspective. Even in our Middle Ages, war has been a completly normal tool in the arsenal of interstate relations. &quot;Peace&quot; did not mean the same as it does today. Like, when I say today that Germany and France are at peace, I mean that the very idea that these countires could attack each other is downright nonsencial, and everyone who thinks otherwise is probably a serious nut-job. In 1913 Germany and France were also &quot;at peace&quot;, but that peace was literally just &quot;an temporary absence of war&quot;, that could easily change from one day to another.\n\nAnd that second scenario is what is normality for Runeterra, even more so in the past with the Rune Wars.\n\nAnd now, imagine the chaotic Sengoku-era in Japan: countless factions tearing each other apart in a civil war. And NOW imagine that more than half of these faction have a weapon of nuclear-bomb-class at their disposal, in this case, a world rune - and that they are not hesitant to use it. \n\nThis is the reality of Runewar-Runeterra.\n\nAnd to operate within such an extremly dangerous enviorment as a nation or tribe, you need information. Who can you trust? Who will betray you? If group A and group B fight, who will come out as a winner? What if the battle is intervened by a thrid party? What is the extent of their individual power? Can you start a fight with a group or is it smarter to abide to their demands instead of risking obliberation? Who are the best allies?\n\nInformation is Power, and being able to run hundreds, of not thousands of such simulations, allows stochastic calculations that might even come close to &quot;predicting the future&quot; - and even with with some margin of error that is an extremly powerful tool, which would also explain why the location is quite &quot;hidden&quot; as it seems. After all you wouldn&#039;t want to let this fall into the wrong hands.\n\nBut how does it work? Well, for that I am grateful for a Rioter to once confirm the existence of &quot;leylines&quot;, a network of magical power-lines that occur naturally, forming a network over and through the planent. From a world-building perspective, the existence of such lines changes things quite a lot. My theory is that the rift is directly build on a massive intersection of such ley-lines, where as many of them as possible cross. \n\nFrom there on, the Summoner&#039;s Rift accesses a natural magical network that encompasses the entire globe, and draws information from it. \n\nThe theory goes as follows: Individual &quot;A&quot; has impact on the world. Impact on the world means also impact on the leylines. The moment a minimum degree of &quot;impact&quot; -set by the creators - is met, information gets collected and formed into a perfect copy of &quot;Individual A&quot; to appear in the Summoner&#039;s Rift. Repeat the same for Individual B and observe their interaction as many times as needed. As allies, as foes, etc. etc. Not-as-impactful individuals supporting them would be simulated as minions.\n\nHowever, this would also explain where the biggest flaw of such a device lies: flawed input values. The civilication that build the rift is no longer around, which means they got defeated. But how can you be defeated when you have such predictive power? Simply by having the &quot;impact&quot; value set too high for when the Rift considers an indiviual on the world an &quot;relevant champion&quot;. One or maybe even several key-indivuals kinda &quot;flew under the radar&quot; and ruined their calculations, effectively leading to their downfall. Another possibility would be that the Rift cannot access &quot;all&quot; of the leyline network and that there are &quot;blind spots&quot; of some sorts.\n\nAnd today? The builders are gone, but the Rift is still running, infinitely powered due to the leyline-nexus it is sitting on. And so it does what it was made to do: running simulations for all kinds of scenarios while drawing information from the global leyline network. \n\nBut from an outsider&#039;s view this would probably look different: a mountaintop where regulary explosions can be heard, and dangerous magical discharges happen in completly unpredictable intervals. People who have tried to climb the mountain have been frozen by giant Ice Arrows, blasted into pieces by hextech bombs, had dark spheres knock them into their deaths, had energy blasts slicing their heads of, had their bodies cut apart by wind alone, were frozen by true ice that was suddenly creeping from the top, and so on and so on. \n\nPretty much everything that would &quot;fall of the map&quot; would be lethal to a normal climber or even someone remotely close to said mountain, so it wouldn&#039;t be weird for the entire area to be deserted, because &quot;of the strange phenomemon that has been raging since the Runewars&quot;, which the world itself has really no shortage of. And given that the Rift might be running dozends of simulations at once, it wouldn&#039;t be weird for the mountain to be constantly shrouded in a maelstrom of magical energy blasting out, truly giving it the impression of a fucked up weather phenomenon, even if it is not visible from &quot;inside the simulation&quot;.\n\n---\n\nTl, dr: SR is a gigantic artifact for simulation purposes, drawing information from a global network of power-lines. If there is a connection between the &quot;summoned being&quot; and &quot;original individual&quot; beyond one being a copy of another is unknown.\n\nFurthermore, the artifact itself is extremly dangerous should the world learn of it: the position of a leyline nexus this powerful alone would be enough to start a world-war in struggle for control of it, the technology being just the icing on the cake. Imagine not only drawing information from the leylines, but also altering them. One would be able to alter the magical structure of the planet, power that goes far beyond a simple world rune. I doubt many could resist such godlike-powers, and a lot of them would set the world ablaze to get their hands on it.","replies":[{"poster":"bill84","date":"2017-06-21T23:41:56.311+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"So at some point there were just a bunch of Kha's falling out of the sky?\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-arYBInnxBxo/V6QXbQ-SBlI/AAAAAAAAScE/D3F_72F7WqY3L3DgPtNA4zuUKg0J3ZExQCLcB/s1600/PS3fp5t.gif","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-06-22T02:49:20.300+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"They will not expect this!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-06-22T10:40:10.457+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:121}} \"I will soar over them! ...and past them... and crash next to them... and sink under them... you know what, I really didn't think this through.\"\n\n{{champion:107}} \"Ditto that.

More importantly, this would mean that the simulation puts someone like Garen, who is just an above-average warrior, on the same tier as Aurelion Sol, a celestial star god. It doesn't help that the scenario somehow makes situations where these characters are somehow weaker. Graves, guy with shotgun, defeating Bard, the embodiment of cosmic balance? \n\n* In what scenario would it try to solve?\n\nOn the actual scenario, let's say that you're correct. What is the battlefield we're trying to solve? Am I supposed to believe that this is accounting for a 5v5 what-if scenario if these characters were given constant power and legendary weapons? In what circumstance is it really pertinent for a warring faction with unlimited magical power to ask what would happen if Aatrox threw down with Poppy? Sure, this goes back to \"It's just a game\" but the problem is still here.\n\n* People have been there.\n\nSorry but that dude in the hot-air-balloon probably isn't a construct. \n\nThese flaws aside, I don't think you're far off. However, rather than a simulation, this is an arena that calls to those who have burning purpose or an overwhelming desire. It's why every league champion has some powerful or world-spanning goal they wish to accomplish. When two desires meet and they directly clash (See: Jarvan vs. Swain), they're unknowingly sent to this field of battle. The magic of this area means that those who die will come back but when they do return and the battle is over, they don't remember a thing.\n\nThis is a simulation, in a way, but a simulation using real people. It might have been an institute of war at one point and these makeshift battles could settle disputes but these days, you just wake up in your bed with a sore back and no clear idea what you did yesterday. Likewise, some guys are just there to profit. Say what you will, Hot air balloon guy gets to interact with amazing people and make a KILLING in the process.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2017-06-22T17:56:12.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To One: \"Impact\" is an abstract size completly independent from the technology and magic used. Everything you do as a sentinent being is to interact with the world and therefore change it through your interaction, if not ever so slightly. It's kinda the whole \"you can never jump into the same river twice\" thing, because a) the river ever changes and b) your presence in the river has already changed it.\n\nAnd in theory, the leylines this global magical network IS in some sense the world, or rather \"Its magical nervous system\" if one would compare it to an organism. So everything an individual does is somehow reflected in their \"effect\" on the leylines, even if it is ever so insignificant. There was just an minimal limit somoene once set on what beings are considered \"relevant\" enough to be copied as champions - and there is probably also a limit in how powerful a being can be recreated.\n\nAlso the shown power of the being in the rift doesn't exactly need to match their actual power. It needs to match the power they have already displayed on the world, therefore having done \"impact\" with it and the data being in the network, so to speak. Bard for example is immensely powerful, but he always interacts with the world in very indirect and sublte ways. And that's why he's just a support and not a magical being capable of lifting the entire enemy base and banishing it into the night-sky, at least not on the rift.\n\n\nTo two: I guess it's an abstract combat simulation focussing on the impact of powerful individuals. \n\nMy current theory is that the rift is without guidiance and currently running on some buggy auto-pilot mode - like a buggy computer program stuck in some sort of loop, repeating itself over and over and over again, unable to turn of by itself as long as it is fed by energy. And just like in all simulations, you can run smart scenarios, or silly ones. There's an \"who would win simulator\" where you can send 300 spartans vs 1000 romans and see who would win. You can ALSO send 1000 chicken vs 12 T-Rex. The latter makes a lot less sense, but is still in the realm of what can ba simulated.\n\nWithout someone actually simulating certain parties and carefully selecting all individuals involved for the calculations, the knownledge gained is practically worthless, obviously.\n\nTo three: we both gotta admit that the whole burning desire thing sounds cheesy as fuck, and would have extremly weird implications for the entire lore.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2017-06-22T18:32:57.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While true for the first point, it still doesn't explain why these specific people are brought into the simulation. If it's based on anyone connected to the leylines, then theoretically ANYONE could be brought into the leylines. Even hapless foot soldiers such as Helmet Bro.  But your comment that \"It reflects on things they've done\" would obviously mean that certain people who affect the world in enormous ways should be in there even if they aren't realistic fighters. Jarvan III is a billion years old but he likely has more impact on the world than, say, his son because of his kingly status.\n\nAnd while you are correct in the idea that this giant simulation machine would be buggy and fucky without someone manning the controls, it doesn't really explain why the simulation is relegated to a 5v5 scenario if it was meant to be a battleground for two warring factions. You could argue they just fought with their best but even then, this doesn't explain the imagry on the rift of two warring factions of various, large-scale conflicts.\n\nAs for your criticism, while it does sound cheesy, let's not pretend League's lore is a bastion of serious and dark stories. Sure, there are more high fantasy stories now than before, we also have an angry badger who poisons people, the chillest tree in the world and a racist angry man riding an immortal lizard. I also don't see the weird implications, because it would mean that there is some sort of sensibility to what you suggest; People with purpose rather than who is merely the strongest or who has the biggest impact on the world.

It is a MOBA its endless battles between same Champions and sometimes mirror matchups happen like wait there is 2 Lucians? Like how would you describe lore behind that sort of gameplay? Doesent make any sense at all. I get it that all champions have story and Lore and it does make sense, but when it comes to strictly gameplay and goal it just doesent. You destroy nexus and there is another battle and another and another and it just goes forever. Why would anyone want to fight so hard to destroy nexus crystal if it doesent matter,if its gonna be there next game :D \n\nMaybe only way to put this in lore is to describe it as sport between champions to kill time  in between actuall quests they take outside of the rift.
