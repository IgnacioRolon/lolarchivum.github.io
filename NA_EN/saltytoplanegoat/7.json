Heck, I even repaired and then re-installed the entire darn thing again, and the problem perists. \r\n\r\nThe weirdest part is that after 2 mins the game just lets me play normally, as if it just realized I'm a player and not someone it must kick from the sevrer immedeatly. In really rare cases there is another mini-dc midgame, but that's it. \r\n\r\nAnd now something that might be even weirder: usually I'm a solo player. But when I queue up with my neighbor for some nice evening normals from time to time, SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WORKS. Until I go into the next Solo game, and everything is how it was before. \r\n\r\nIt's not stopping me from playing and winning... but it makes early jungle cover or invade plays impossible, and that sucks big-time. I even wrote the tech supp some time ago, played a game, sent logs, and all I got back as a response was like \"wut no clue\".\r\n\r\nIs anyone else experiencing this?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnd another question that might solve the problem, or might be completly unrelated: Is there a 64-bit client of league? I got a 64 bit system, but whever I download the game it only gives me the 32 bit version for some weird reason - at least all processes in the task manager say (32 Bit). I hope at least this can be answered fast...","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-23T02:34:07.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went ahead and checked up on those past tickets to see what we had already tried, but it doesn't actually look like you've ever submitted any tickets =\\ . Let's  make sure to start with the more common troubleshooting fixes first then, as there's a pretty good chance that your connection being smoother when playing with your neighbor is most likely a coincidence. Double check you [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) again, making sure to go through every step in the guide.

I remember interaction with your service, but despite their attempts to solve the problem it couldnt be fixed and I kinda gave up back then.\n\nAlso my network setting dont really matter. I reset the entire household network in an attempt to get things back to normal. Didnt do a darn thing tbh.\n\nAnd yes at first i thought that it was coincidence too, as we tend to play only at rare times (he so busy with work the lasty ear her barely can game. Poor guy.). But the consistency is always astounding. For several months I have seen this pattern repeating, and I can't think of a logical reason to why. I just can't make sense of all this tbh...","replies":[]}]}]}
