It says \"Please close the \"League of Legends\" client before restarting\" please help I need to get this gone I have tried deleting the patcher and Client file in the application folder under league of legends all the way under RADS. I also deleted the game which is weird because I didn't think it would let me delete it while the client was still open, but it did and it's still open I also managed to try to reinstall the game which also still kept the client open just had the launcher right over it, but the launcher was just a white dot which is another problem for another discussion, but right now i just want to get rid of the white screen please help I can't even restart my mac.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T04:54:43.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd recommend force restarting your mac by holding down the power button for 10 seconds then powering it back on.
