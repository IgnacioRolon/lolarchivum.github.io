If so (which the answer is yes in your case), then you'll get permabanned eventually.\n\nYou can't even say you didn't know, as it was clearly written in your 14-day ban reform card /email that your next punishment is a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"HotBandAid","date":"2016-10-22T01:18:58.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Never have I ever:\n-Been warned\n-Been banned\n-Been chat restricted\n-Been emailed regarding a ban\n\nI really think this would have been a chat restriction if anything...","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-22T10:19:29.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you wish to contest it, then please submit a ticket to Riot support.

You did act fairly toxic, but nowhere near enough to deserve a perm ban, i guess it comes down to previous behavior and punishments. Have you been chat restricted recently? Riot tends to stomp people make zero changes to their behavior after a punishment.\n\nThe fact you reacted that way to trolls in a blind game (seriously, blinds is for goofing off, chill) suggests you realy need a better control over yourself before playing online games.
