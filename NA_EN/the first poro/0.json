So when you get a Capsule, you can get more than 12 Frags for those 28 days.\n\nBut this post here seems to contradict that understanding. Can you clarify, please?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T21:44:14.801+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, yeah way to necropost!  :P  I know it can get pretty confusing, I'm really sorry for wording it so!  You get 12 drops, they can be either a fragment or a capsule.  What's in the capsule won't count towards the limit.
