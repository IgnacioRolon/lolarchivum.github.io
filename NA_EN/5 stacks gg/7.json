Not my favorite option since I don't think loading his passive even more is a good idea, but adds to the fantasy that once his passive is up he's a complete juggernaut that needs to be avoided or CC'd accordingly.\n\n2) Make it heal over 5 seconds. This adds more counterplay for both players, Darius and his opponent. You know he's going to heal, but it won't be right away so you can potentially press your advantage or get punished by him healing up and backing off. \n\n3) Scrap the heal and change it to a shield based on Q damage (before resists).

After the hotfix buff, Darius' short trades have become way more potent (...again) and are actually an easy way of bullying most opponents out of lane, especially if those rely on long trades themeselves, in which Darius stomps them even more. His dominance in short trades makes him an ideal lane bully again, even without the use of Bloodrage and his amplified 175 attack range(and this IS worth noting!), and that's too much for a character who brings so much raw mid-game power now.\n\nThe second thing I noticed is how much damage the passive does in Bloodrage currently. It doesn't feel skillful to see half of their ADC's HP to simply bleed away after you hit your Decimate but lost reach. In early lane, when your enemy is foolish enough to let you proc Bloodrage, it's not all that extreme, but still, it has lead to a lot of \"First Blood\"s for me due to my opponent underestimating not only my bonus ad (that part's fine), but also the damage he suffers per second. Currently the ratio of 5 stacks (->Bloodrage, solid bonus AD) is 150% bonus ad over 5 seconds (~~30% per second~~ EDIT: oops, only triggers 4 times in intervals of 1.25 seconds after the rework -> 37,5% per tick). Combined with the armor reduction from Black Cleaver and some flat armPen from any source, the bleeding frequently deals up to 600 damage as a DoT debuff in the later game. As said, painful to watch, even for me, the Darius player.\n\nI'm not all to sure about the healing on a 3 sec CD with max CDR (even though the heal itself should be really here to stay, you can outplay Darius, playing around Decimates functionality), but cutting the damage buff of the hotfix in half (30/50/70/110/130 from 40/70/100/130/160) and reducing the ratio on Bloodrage'd Hemorrhage (say 120% from 150% total, ~~24% from 30% per second~~ 30% from 37,5% per tick) would remove some unnecessary strenghts he has, which are leading to really easy bullying in lane and too much colateral damage in team fights (while effectively applying an armor reduction debuff aswell with Black Cleaver, making your ADC die of laughter). \n\nAnother reason for the peviously immobile champions to rise is Dead Man's Plate's insane MS-steroid (It's basically a better version of mobility boots, as the MS does not fall off completely when simply taking damage or getting hit by anything). But I don't think it's this discussion's purpose to treat that.\n\n[And I apologize for any errors of language, I'm not a native speaker]\n\nWhat do you think of these suggestions?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taigongwang","date":"2015-09-22T19:49:40.480+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Darius Player, I'm gonna tell you straight up one of the things that helps push him into that permaban status. With his W losing ALL of its actual scaling, he has no reason to put skill points into it. This means he is putting skill points into Apprehend, which is giving him % Ar Pen. Its an old LATE game power spike of his that he had, but he is now getting early-mid game. Bruisers top against him need obscene amounts of armor to start mitigating his damage, as well as health. If they build those defenses on the other hand, most Fighters and Bruisers just dont have the offense to match him in trades. This creates a laning situation where his opponent has no right item build choice. When he comes out of laning phase with 25% Ar pen on top of his high base damage, he can become that walking murder train people fear easily. Put the % Ar Pen passive on his ult and put something else on his W or E, then see how it goes.
