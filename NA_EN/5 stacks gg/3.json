Because right now I'm happy with the true damage he has. So long as you don't remove the true damage, then it'll be fine. Don't change the way the true damage stack increase works either, 160 - 320min/max with basic stats should always be the same at 5 stacks. If you spread it out to ten stacks needed to get 320 damage, you'll fucking gut him. Don't change how the bleed works either. We all know that destroyed Draven for a while.\n\nMaybe the more stacks he has, the more the cool down is reduced? 1/2/3/4/5 stacks is the standard 20 second recast, 6/22, 7/24, 8/26, 9/28 10 is full reset which is rewarding prolonged fights in top lane, which should also give enough time for an enemy jungler to intervene if they're near by.\n\n> That's not one of the projects we're currently working on though (not lack of desire, but other things we feel are higher value). \n\nGood, he's not in need of a full rework yet.\n\n>What we are going to try in the short term as a result, potentially in the next couple of patches, are some experimental changes to his ult at higher ranks. \n\nI would love to see what these are. \n\n>We removed the full reset because of how heavily it shut opponents out of lane if they died to it once. That change was needed, but came at a cost to Darius' post laning play that we think might have been unnecessary. \n\nThe same could be said for champions like Riven, Yasuo, yadda yadda, champions that have low cool downs on their ultimates. Get back to lane, their ult is back up and you get pounded on again. Darius' was different, he used to and still does punish sloppy/careless players which is a good thing.\n\n>We're going to test out ways of giving Darius more access to his ult mid to late game as a result, with potential options at higher ranks including lower mana costs, lower CD, longer recast window, possibly (note: this one's pretty experimental) a full reset at max rank etc.\n\nThat would be nice. Not really an experimental change if his ult used to have that before, though.\n\nTL;DR: Veteran Darius player. Darius is fine if you wanna say that. He needs something to spice him up a bit.

On the one hand I can see it, but on the other? Darius does the most damage he can if he's getting every kill in the fight, but there are plenty of reasons that you don't want him to be doing that. I wonder if they could make it more like Kat's current reset, even if they had to nerf the damage a bit to compensate.","replies":[{"poster":"DemothHymside","date":"2015-03-05T07:16:07.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My issue with Darius is that he feels like a super niche pick; He's a good pic against other champs who aren't all that good.\n\nIf anyone top lane has range, mobility, or sustain, they're going to beat Darius unless they are incredibly bad with their champ.\n\nThis means that Darius is good again....

Yeah, it's oppressive and obnoxious to deal with, but far from impossible. The most aggravating thing he has to offer is his easy waveclear, which is also his harass skill, which will demolish you if you let it. Trouble is, this is as much his weakness as his strength. Try aggressively harassing a smart enemy without pushing your lane as darius. As with most lane bullies, the counterplay is typically having a jungler. That, or playing around the overconfidence they are sure to act on based upon their character choice. I frequently stomp this guy with Garen, and I think Darius is a MUCH better bruiser overall than Garen. That is, he does way more for his team, having a pull and a slow, and not needing to itemize as much into damage or penetration.","replies":[]}]}
