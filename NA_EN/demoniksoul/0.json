WHY RIOT","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"I got chat restriction 4 mounths ago and played my games to get away from it and thought everything is ok now. But NO riot has hidden punishment for me too. I cant recieve chests or keys for indefinite period of time. This thing can be lifted if you play games and behive by riot standards. But why does this thing need to be invisable?\r\n\r\nCant you make this punishment visable for players in the client!!!! Why did u have to make it invisable? A message, sticking where u put your news ( ! ) in the top right corner that usually say u have disabled a champ or smth else, saying you have active loot restriction would suffice. Is that really so hard to do? Why do you have to make this so frustrating? Invisable punishments and noone knows about them. A simple message would have done the trick. And the moment you show you are a good boy by riot standards the massage changes to smth like\" good job little rager you are a good actor and for not flaming your teams recently we lift your loot punishment. Njoy the free champion shards we are gonna give you couse thats all you are goona get from chests from now on :P . Doodles :) \"\r\n\r\nP.S. It took me 2 weeks to find all this out through tickets to riot. And all this could have been avoided if riot actually tells you about the restrictions they implement to your account and keeps you up to date with how far you are / solving/ sinking into, your restrictions.","replies":[{"poster":"DemonikSoul","date":"2017-02-18T13:38:19.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no it doesnt!!!!

Not sure how clear is your memory couse there is nothing telling people they have a loot penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2017-02-18T23:16:40.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, like I said, the posts I saw were people complaining that the message showed up every single game and it was discouraging. Maybe they listened to those players and only show it the first time, maybe they didn't put it in the new client, but either way it use to be there. \n\nSearch for the phrase \"You are ineligible to earn loot due to previous behavioral restrictions\". Looks like that was the message that kept coming up over and over again.","replies":[{"poster":"DemonikSoul","date":"2017-05-02T22:33:31.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ummm no such posts found no idea what people u listened to but 3rd party stories are not really helpfull info especially when i tell you there is nothing popping up saying anything or i would have seen it and woudnt bother asking people here","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-18T09:42:12.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"How's it invisible, it tells you post game that you cant( if you cant).","replies":[{"poster":"DemonikSoul","date":"2017-02-18T21:41:23.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nop it doesnt.
