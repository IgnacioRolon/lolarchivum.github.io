This inhibits opening them or seeing anything there. \n\nPlease reset or see? No one reporting any large Loot problems presently so it's probably me. I have opened and closed the game several times.\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-09T23:12:31.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into your hextech inventory, and I think I see where you were able to open those chests finally!
