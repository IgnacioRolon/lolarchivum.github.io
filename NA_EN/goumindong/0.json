I feel like I have enough experience background and theory background to discuss the champion and where he should be taken.\n\nFundamentally i believe that Viktor is a very powerful champion who's weaknesses are not related to core champion design. He works slightly different than other mages because he has only two non-ultimate damage abilities (like Lux) which gives him a level 11-13 peak powerspike rather than a level 18 peak power. This early powerspike allows him to control the mid game and snowball important dragon fights into wins, and turn fights even if it looks like he is behind the other mid laner.\n\nViktor is an AoE Burst mage. His Laser and Ultimate combine for a total ratio of 3.38 and 1350 base damage. This is an absolutely amazing amount of damage. Its more damage than standing in Karthus defile for 7 seconds and then eating his requiem. Its more damage than chilling out in Anivia's Glacial Storm for 7 seconds and then eating a Flash Frost to the face. Its as more damage as facetanking Tibbers for 7 seconds while getting incinerated. Its more damage than a full brand combo on your entire team(I.E. no multiple bounces to the same person). Its more damage than just chilling in a Morgana pool while she ults you. Its more damage than a full ziggs combo unless you take the time to walk over every single bomblet in his slow field(but that would be single target, so it doesn't even count!)\n\nNow these other mages get a good amount of other utility in exchange for not doing as much damage as Viktor(cooldowns, some utility, mobility etc) and certainly for not doing as much damage as Viktor does early. But when Viktor gets that fight in a chokepoint just right there isn't much the other team can do but melt.\n\nNo, Viktor's problems almost all stem from three main issues\n\n-------\n\n1) His laser's smartcast behavior is terrible: Some spells, when you click outside of their range will cast as if you had clicked at the end of the range. Many times this is done for spells which have long ranges or spells which don't have animations because its the direction of the spell and not necessarily the range of the spell that matters most, players more often want the spell going in that direction than they want to reposition to cast. Viktor's laser should be one of those spells. If you're running away from a fight and you start the laser just outside of the laser start range the last thing you want to have happen is for Viktor to turn around and run back into the fight. But that is what happens. \n\nWhen this happens it essentially negates the fact that Viktor's laser doesn't interrupt his movement because *in practice* it does interrupt his movement. Casting around max range will cause Viktor to reposition when the player might not want it. \n\nI describe this as a problem with the smartcast behavior, but its also an issue with the normal cast behavior. Since Viktor will be moving while he is casting its very easy to start the drag inside the circle (or just outside) and have it end up outside of the circle as you move. \n\nBut this can be fixed. If, when you start Viktor's laser outside of the circle, the game interprets that as starting Viktor's laser at the closest point in the circle you no longer have any issues about Viktor turning around and running into a fight he is trying to run from. Alternately the game can extend the line you drew in two directions and start the laser where it intersects the edge of the cast range.  The intent of the players actions comes through rather than the reality of their clicks. Granted this isn't perfect, since it will remove some of the mechanical difficulty of Viktor. But i do not believe that that aspect of mechanical complexity is core to Viktor's kit. Its how you place lasers not the fact that you clicked 2 pixels on the wrong side of his range that should make a good Viktor player.\n\n-------\n2) Two of his hex cores are bad: Hex cores don't need to be moved to the trinket slot. Its one possibility but its not necessary. The main problem with his Hex Cores is that only Death is any good. Specifically, Death is a, roughly, slot efficient damage item. Its also a gold efficient damage item. Death gives you 45 AP and its passive for 1000 gold. By the gold value of Amp Tomes this is 978 gold worth of raw stats. And the passive is better than Deathcap's Passive for his E. Given that he tends to level up E first and given that he has only two non-ultimate damaging abilities the Death augments passive is about as strong as Deathcap until a good deal into the game. Deathcap's passive is worth at least 650 gold, and functionally more if we compare it to building Zhonya/DFG which have more raw stats and different passives for less money. Death is a really good item. Its cheap, powerful, gives you a huge mid game power spike, and lategame its still pretty slot efficient. Simply it works with Viktor's core power spike and it can replace a lategame slot efficient item.\n\nSo what about Power? Technically, power has 803 gold worth of stats on it based on the cost of rejuv beads and ruby crystals. Except that that is bull, it has 587 gold worth of stats on it, the HP 5 is useless. Is its passive as good as Deathcaps passive? Probably not. Its passive is barely better than Rylai's (better for running away, worse for allowing team to catch a target). Can it replace an item like Rylai's in the lategame? Death has 100 AP and almost a Deathcap passive. So its pretty close to a Deathcap, a 3600 gold item. Rylai's has 100 AP and 400 HP. Power has *54 AP and 220 HP*. Man the problem with power isn't that its not a trinket the problem with power is that it *sucks*. If it had 600 HP on it it would be comparable to Rylai's.\n\nSimilarly we can look at Gravity. Arguably Gravity as the best passive. One of the things that makes Viktor players good is landing the best Gravity Field. And increasing the range on Gravity Field means hitting the right space easier. Its hard to put a price on something that can change the game like a good 3 total seconds of combined hard/soft CC and strong zoning potential. But we're going to because Gravity has mana and MP5 on it. Two stats which have roughly zero \"now\" power. The only thing it has decently is 10% CDR. \"Technically\" this is 1017 worth of stats. But raw mana isn't that powerful on Viktor and 5 MP/5 is nothing. This item has 317 worth of stats... 317 worth of stats that aren't even that good on Viktor because he is a burst mage and is more concerned about now damage than about sticking around to get that second laser off. \n\nWhat about a comparable item for slot efficiency? Can Gravity compare to Morellonomicon? 10 MP5, 80 AP, 20% CDR. Ahh ha ha hah ah ha no. Morellonomicon is 2200 gold item and Gravity can't compare in total stats to it. Death almost compares in total stats to a *3600 gold item*. If gravity entirely replaced a Sustain/CDR item then it would be something to consider getting, 20% CDR, chalice passive, 10 mp/5, 54 AP and the range passive would be the minimum you could consider. Almost as strong as a pimp cup (which isn't even that good an item anymore)\n\nBasically, in order for Power and Gravity to be transformative in the way that Viktor plays, power and gravity have to not just plain suck. They need to be able to replace, at at least 80% of the power, a similarly slot efficient lategame item. This can be transformative because it will allow Viktor to pick between whether or not he is a sustained damage/poke mage who has lots of mana and 20% CDR or whether or not he is a burst mage who just nukes things with some of the highest AoE damage. Or if he is a tanky AP/kite master who is build like a brick. Most importantly they need to be designed around Viktor's mid game power spike just like the Death Augment, such that the choice of Augment determines how you go about abusing your mid game spike.\n\n-----------\n\n3) His auto attack is terrible: Viktor was designed in the age where mids couldn't have good auto attacks. He was, more or less, the last of his kind. This is strange since he was designed as a mid champion who would abuse his shield to auto attack enemy champions in lane and win the trades. But Viktor's forward swing is so long that its hard to make many of those trades(or CS effectively). His auto attack numbers aren't terrible, but they're lower than other champions who tend to bully a lot with auto attacks (Ziggs especially). Most importantly however is the auto attack sound. Remember ryze's old auto attack before it got changed? Where it played the \"you have auto attacked\" cue before he actually auto attacked? Viktor does almost the same thing. Shore up his auto attack animation and pay close attention to the audio queue and you will do a lot to return Viktor to the type of lane bully he was meant to be.\n\n-------\nAnyway, these are the things that i feel are the core issues with Viktor. There are some other little things. His ult might do too little of its damage in the burst or be too hard to move around in the fight.(it could also silence/interrupt on first damage so that Viktor could use it to \"tag\" enemies who missed the initial burst for a bit of mini-game CC/disruption). His Q shield could be instant rather than delayed(maybe on the Q augment passive it works like lux shield. He gets one immediately and then stacks it when it comes back). The passives on his Q and W augments could change to be more transformative to his playstyle. And yes, you could move the hex cores to the trinket slot. \n\nBut the biggest issue is the behavior of his laser with regards to casting it on the move. Second to this is his terrible attack animation and the lack of actual strength in his Q and W augments. He doesn't need a lot of changes to be brought into the fold of powerful champions, he just needs the right tweaks.","replies":[{"poster":"Solcrushed","date":"2014-08-07T00:53:53.137+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Awesome post, I'm actually looking into 1) right now and testing how the new paradigm feels vs. the old. \n\nThese kinds of posts are very informative and really show that you have played the character extensively, if you have any other points that you feel cause the character to feel clunky please point them out so I can be sure to address them.","replies":[{"poster":"InsaneSamurai","date":"2014-08-07T16:01:21.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really glad you read all that, being a Viktor fan and also a information filled intelligent post fan :D  I'm curious though how you choose what to read?

While obviously making a character as imposing as Doom doesn't work Viktor's Q has part of that effect early on in the lane phase (especially if you put two points into it before maxing your laser). \n\nBasically, because of Viktor's Q, his early lane play has him zone the enemy and any time they get in range he Q's them and then runs at them for more auto attacks (due to the Q shield protecting him from minion damage/counter harass and allowing him to win trades). This is the imposing feeling that you should get playing as and against Viktor. It falls off later when he power becomes more of his laser rather than his Q and that is OK. But it has the feeling early, which is important. \n\nSo if you are going to change Q(and again, totally fine), you should try to keep the imposing \"bully\" nature of the ability. Otherwise he might lose that early laning feel, or be unable to have his augments transform him into the more bully mage which was, i think, intended by the current Q augment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orothrim","date":"2014-08-09T11:40:34.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am irrationally pumped for the Viktor rework!

Karthus, Morgana, and Anivia all have bad autoattacks. Sometimes that is just an issue a champ has. Just giving him a better autoattack animation isn't exactly something I'd feel good about, even if it did make him objectively stronger.\nI'd rather either see some effect added to his autos if you want to make them better, or just put the power somewhere else in his kit. I'd like to see his shield be any good for actually trading, but that could be seen as tied to his autoattacks.\n\nReally making his other two augments not suck would solve the main issues with Viktor in my opinion.\n\nI feel like Viktor has the weaknesses of EVERY KIND of mage, while only having the strengths of a burst mage.\n\nViktor has short range (on 3 spells), harsh resource restriction, long cooldowns, no inbuilt durability, and poor maneuverability.\nMost mages have at least a few of these issues. Tank mages like Swain and Vlad have short range. Burst mages like Veigar and Brand have mana problems and low durability, utility mages like Morgana and Lux have long cooldowns, many mages have poor manuvering.\nViktor has all the problems of each, because in theory his Hex Cores allow him to become any of those types. A tanky bruiser mage with high chasing and dueling power, a powerful utility mage with massive AOE CC, or a nasty burst mage who melts down VIPs 3 at a time.\n\nSince Death is the only augment to not suck, he can only be a decent burst mage. He still has the weaknesses of other kinds though. Did that make any sense? I'm pretty sleepy, but I mained Viktor in season 3 and loved him till I got sick of his untapped potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Whirlwind º","date":"2014-08-07T10:29:59.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His two other sides needs to rework for sure, but his burst mage, is unmatched.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goumindong","date":"2014-08-07T18:00:40.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana got her auto attack updated about a year ago, its pretty snappy now. Snappy enough that she can trade auto attacks decently with everyone bottom lane except Sona and Zyra (who have really good auto attack animations)\n\nThe reason that Viktor needs his auto attack looked at has to do two things\n\n1) How his lane behavior interacts with his ability set: Viktor's Q is a really strong laning tool. Outside of lane its not to strong, but in creeps it lets you get a small enough shield that taking creep aggro or eating a retaliatory auto attack has Viktor winning the trade. Ideally Viktor should be Q - Auto'ing every Q CD and using the shield to aggressively zone enemies. Sure the shield is small, but winning one trade by a small margin means winning a second by a large. The thing is that Viktor's auto attack makes it really hard for him to do that. He might get one off, if he gets two off then the enemy mid is really remiss in their understanding. \n\n\n2) How his lane success interacts with his mid game power spike. A snappier auto attack allows you to farm easier. This is partly because faster auto attacks are easier to judge minion HP but also because a snappier auto attack reduces the amount of time you're vulnerable when last hitting. Poking when the enemy is CS'ing is a big deal and Viktor is really easy to poke when doing so because his animation is so long. You can even zone him off a lot of CS and cause him to lose a lot of CS by reacting to his animation and forcing him to take damage for the CS or back off. \n\nLook at the more popular mids today. Xerath, Lux, Ziggs, Orianna. They all have hard wave clear with abilities early. They can more freely throw spells out there to CS than the competition. And many of them have auto attack modifiers (Zigg's and Ori have high range and bonus damage, Xerath gets mana, Lux gets damage after an ability) which allow them to farm even easier. Viktor can't do that. He has an OK way to power farm once he has Augment Death but its still very mana intensive and on a high CD. He has to be able to fight and farm early, and that requires a snappy auto attack","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2014-08-07T20:13:45.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point.

Here's my input:\n\nAs stated in the OP, smart cast is exceptionally bad for E, it does interrupt movement while running away if you aren't anticipating exactly where you'll be at cast animation and speaking personally, he is the only champion in the entire game that I have to go into settings and specifically adjust my settings for each time I switch to/from him.  The nature of laser is unforgiving enough that if you miss one early on in lane, you'll likely end up having to back early due to mana or hp issues.  Also, if you use smart cast, you'll occasionally have lasers that go in a direct outward line for no reason, it's seriously no bueno in a team fight. (aiming outside of hitbox while on smart cast while in motion does it sometimes and it can easily ruin your teamfight damage)\n\nShield: Q shield needs to be an iota quicker, as it is currently, it's fairly useless early game.  Shield is as it stands a 1-2 aa blocker for most of the game, the issue is, you have to know when they're AA'ing significantly before they actually do so as casting it in response will not get you a shield quick enough.  Damage is good, mana cost is more than fair, and shield is nice, it's just very, very slow.\n\n{{item:3196}} : I like the idea, but there is literally zero reason for anyone to ever get it.  {{item:3257}}  do everything this augment does and does it better due to the fact AA's now proc the ms as well allowing you to better catch up, and dodge skill shots by weaving in AA's (which people should be doing anyways).

These augmentations cost metal, a resource that is dropped much like Thresh's souls (albeit perhaps a bit more frequently). These augmentations wouldn't fill item slots, but they would take time to acquire. A really heavy farming Viktor might gain all the augmentations in a 2 hour game (because a fully augmented Viktor would actually compete with a super stacked Nasus). This would make Viktor feel very different from other mages while keeping his kit intact. To elaborate on the possibilities of such a kit:\nI might prefer building Viktor with extra range on his Q, while someone else might prefer adding a burn damage (with a fixed base damage and scaling) to his W. You could play him in so many different ways, and he would make for a pretty good support (because of the metal drop).\nTo balance the metal passive you could perhaps make it so that the metal doesn't gravitate towards Viktor (which is what Thresh's souls do), so he'd have to risk exposing himself to get the material.\nAnother idea I had was that you could have augments that took time to develop, like 5 mins per augment.

I'd say the biggest *why* do they suck isn't just their gold efficiency, but that they provide stats that Viktor doesn't need. Viktor is a mage who's only goal is to deal damage. Even while supporting(where gravity was probably imagined for) he just wants to deal damage, so grabbing Death is always the best choice.\n I propose that they add flat AP to all of the cores, and then separate each hex core by it's play style of dealing damage: Death for Burst, Gravity for frequent spellcasts, and Power for autoattacks and MR shred.\n\nI remember reading a one point that they were thinking of adding a passive from a key AP item to each hex core, and I thought that was gold and would like to elaborate. Obviously each core would still have a passive that enhances one of Viktor's abilities, but I think that any of them could change, as long as they keep to the playstyle. KEEP IN MIND that I'm overpowering these with the thought of possibly having them be tier 3 items\n\nHex Core: Death{{item:3198}} \n+AP per level\n+large amount of AP\n+Lich Bane passive\n\nHex Core: Gravity{{item:3197}} \n+AP per level\n+small amount of AP\n+Cooldown reduction\n+Liandry's passive\n\nHex Core: Power{{item:3196}} \n+AP per level\n+small amount of AP\n+ life steal\n+spell vamp\n+ Malady passives (MR shred & magic damage on AAs)\n\nNow you have three distinct items that all contribute to Viktor's goal of dealing damage, each in their own way, and, at least to me, that is the key to satisfying choices in hex cores.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-08-07T12:30:54.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Augment power needs work...

I do feel like using the lazer in proximity to the enemy can be catastrophic. If you cast past the range accidentally while running and your champ hesitates, you will end up dying sometimes. Das bad. I think this kind of QOL change could be similar to the one for ziggs Q.\n\n2)I disagree with the other cores being bad. The raw stats that they grant HOWEVER are bad, no doubt about it. \nHere's my two cents: {{item:3198}} Augment death is the obvious pick, no wasted stats (like hp regen) and an effect that bolsters your damage capabilities. The effect is satisfying and it will make the enemy fear you if you get ahead. This item is  a foil for one of the reasons we play viktor. His lazer is the bee's knees, and it sets apart a good vik from a bad one. Landing a max range lazer on a fleeing enemy and dropping them with the burn effect is an amazing feeling.\n\nAugment Gravity needs work. **An idea**- gravity should in all forms replace the spellthief's edge. {{item:3197}} ->{{item:3303}} \nGive it the SAME stats, but make the last upgrade increase the range of his gravity field. Of course, he should not be able to buy both of these items. In effect, this augment should be used from the supportive position, and will make it easier to do so. I enjoy viktor support, but if I buy sightstone and upgrade a supportive item to lvl 2 then i'm spending about **1600 gold BEFORE** i can even think of purchasing the Augment gravity for 1000, or dedicate any gold towards extra damage.\nAnyway, to clarify-\nLVL 1 {{item:3197}} ->{{item:3303}} Augment Presence \nLVL 2 {{item:3197}} ->{{item:3098}} Augment Pressure\nLVL 3 {{item:3197}} ->{{item:3092}} Augment Gravity\n\n{{item:3196}} Augment Power is great. I love this core. If you haven't experienced it firsthand, try this-\n{{item:1056}} Doran's Ring->{{item:3196}} Augment power->{{item:3277}} Boots of Lucidity(with furor enchant)->{{item:3116}} Rylais Crystal Scepter->{{item:3001}} Abyssal Scepter->{{item:3151}} Liandry's->{{item:3157}} **Zhonya's/{{item:3089}} Deathcap/{{item:3128}} DFG**   **Not always in this order.** Very fun. Makes viktor a repeated poke champ. Very hard to catch, low cooldown on Q and a safe laning phase vs certain champs.\nThe downside of this core is the STATS. Oof they suck. The health is okay but it doesn't make him tanky. The hp regen is just pure bad. It's not enough to help him stick around and it's just a lot of cash wasted. Change the hp regen to **bonus movement speed.**\n\nAll in all the cores are there to make viktor feel more able to take on different champions by changing the way he plays. He's all about adapting and evolving, but THREE choices is pretty pitiful to meet that end and Gravity just doesn't seem balanced around midlane. Gravity also isn't fun for the other player to fight against unless they are Fizz.\n\n3)An update on the sound effect for the AA animation? sure. Not a huge change, just please keep the old sound. Very satisfying. <3\nI feel that his AA animation is fine though. Possible very slight buffs to his early game attack speed or base AD wouldn't be unappreciated either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ElJanitorFrank","date":"2014-08-07T02:04:14.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I like the laser smart cast {{champion:32}}  .
