I really like Brand his kit, the theme of the character, just the overall flaming dude burning every thing in his path leaving only ashes concept is something I find pretty awesome. But when I play Brand it feels like a repetitive cycle of mediocre kit of abilities, but there&#039;s definitely a feel of potential on there but as of now he feels very lackluster going against other mid laners. His lane presence is alright, it not bad but it also not good, farming with him is kinda weird his waveclear looks like as if its good but it actually meh.","replies":[{"poster":"ApplePie06","date":"2018-02-23T20:15:04.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play brand support and mid.

First couple of waves suck for you then you have lost chapter so you can waveclear like a boss.\n\nEDIT: Also, go down the cunning tree so you can get the mana regeneration one, it is amazing on mana hungry champs. Thunderlord's decree is meh on brand in some cases, but it is worth for the mana regen. When you have enough skill points you can switch back to ferocity and still get the mana regeneration mastery.","replies":[{"poster":"Blurredface","date":"2016-11-23T00:08:54.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know farming with Viktor and Cass is really easy for me.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaZombie","date":"2016-11-23T00:15:15.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor has an easier time farming after lv 7 and upgraded E. But Brand can pretty much clear a whole wave with WE combo if timed right while also putting some damage on the enemy laner.\n\nLate game, he's much more scarier in team fights. You can just stay away from Vik's ult, but you can't run from Brand's that easily.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MLDzXnRRR","date":"2016-11-22T11:42:22.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand support every game with the highest dealt damage to champions even with almost no AP items = balanced...\nIf you are failing with him, it's probably your fault.

He's got good harass and death combos.  He's good in mid and as supp.  His success will largely depend on your ability to land Q stuns and E.  He can delete just about anyone given the right build.  But he can also be easily deleted if he isn't judicious in what he does and when.  Out-harass your midlane and roam bot/top to snowball your team.  An unexpected Brand encounter rarely goes well for the unlucky players facing him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemoGuide","date":"2016-11-22T12:00:22.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Brand is best at the support position.\nFor midlane, he is too weak at trades, as he has to hit all 3 spells to win them, and q is almost always blocked by minions.","replies":[{"poster":"CppL","date":"2016-11-22T13:26:39.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DemoGuide,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OlY0yWbN,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-11-22T12:00:22.185+0000)\n>\n> Brand is best at the support position.\n> For midlane, he is too weak at trades, as he has to hit all 3 spells to win them, and q is almost always blocked by minions.\n\nAnd what champs can win trades without landing spells? :DD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaver KÃ¬ng","date":"2016-11-22T11:45:40.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"everywhere","replies":[]}]}
