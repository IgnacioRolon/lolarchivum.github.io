Since this isn't actually listed in the tooltip I figure it must be a bug.\n\nHonestly I'd consider keeping it since its actually quite neat.\n\nYou get the Attack Speed buff as soon as you activate the ability and it will stay on you for 2 basic attacks (the first enhanced basic attack plus one normal attack).  This does mean that the Attack Speed boost will be gained even on Structures.\n\nI should also note that this Steroid will stack with the Attack Speed Steroid from his Enhanced Q.\n\n\nReporduction steps:\n\n*  Pick Rengar\n*  Use Q\n*  Observe Attack Speed\n\nEdit (20-06-14):\nTo clarify I'm not referring to the attack reset that occurs. Its a literal hidden +x% attack speed buff.","replies":[{"poster":"FF1224","date":"2014-06-20T04:40:26.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its supposed to reset auto attack.","replies":[{"poster":"lm  Krueger  ml","date":"2014-06-20T13:10:45.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand that, but I'm talking about something different.\n\nThere is a hidden literal +x% Attack Speed buff that is gained for 2 basic attacs when activating Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-06-23T06:27:39.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, apologies, misunderstood you the first time.

However, the bonus sticks around for one extra basic attack.  This means you're actually getting a fairly significant (40% bonus AS) steroid for not just the Q attack but one extra attack after.\n\nAlso because the Q doesn't activate on Structures you get this AS bonus for about 2 seconds before it fades off you during which time you can happily strike a Tower repeatedly.\n\nThis also stacks alongside the Enhanced Q to give at **level 1**:  50% + 40% + 40% (not sure additive or multiplicative) bonus Attack Speed for a couple seconds on Structures.  Granted this is hard to make use of (you have to activate the Q2 on a minion), but its definitely possible to exploit this for a fairly significant boost.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I neeeeeeeeed it","date":"2014-06-20T23:12:16.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You mean this, right?","replies":[{"poster":"lm  Krueger  ml","date":"2014-06-21T00:44:36.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes that's it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptainWednesday","date":"2014-06-20T18:59:25.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the % AS show up in the stats area?
