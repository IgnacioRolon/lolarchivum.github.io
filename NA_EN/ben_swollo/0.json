My whole team was telling me how bad I am and telling me to kill myself. See that sort of stuff really doesn't go to my head. However, after that they started telling me that I WAS flaming them. Anyways In the end of the game I'm pretty sure that I was the only one to actually get a restriction since the game doesn't actually care about people telling you to kill yourself. ''The vast majority of players agree that while League's an intense, competitive game, everyone deserves respect on the rift''. Honestly I don't believe that people in lower Elos ACTUALLY care about that. Toxic people try to blame others for the negative things in their life. If they die: its either their jungler's fault, or the support, or the mid or toplaner not saying 'ss'. But telling people to kill themselves? That's just not ok. Not with me at least. If you think that I'm wrong, so be it. But please take another look at the chat logs and reconsider my restriction. I'm not the one who deserves it.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: cuz they didnt lol\r\nSkullTruck: yeah no shit\r\nSkullTruck: braum isnt a support too right?\r\nSkullTruck: try your best im sure itll be worth it!\r\nSkullTruck: thanks\r\nSkullTruck: nice\r\nSkullTruck: WHAT\r\nSkullTruck: oh\r\nSkullTruck: makes sense\r\nSkullTruck: gj\r\nSkullTruck: ss\r\nSkullTruck: ss\r\nSkullTruck: how come i didnt get an assist\r\nSkullTruck: i like how a full combo of mine doesnt even get you to 20% but you can kill me without even using ur ult\r\nSkullTruck: english please?\r\nSkullTruck: and really?\r\nSkullTruck: he is mobile\r\nSkullTruck: im not\r\nSkullTruck: thats how\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: whats funny\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: wow ur real funny\r\nSkullTruck: im not trying to be...?\r\nSkullTruck: wtf\r\nSkullTruck: xD\r\nSkullTruck: warded?\r\nSkullTruck: ''mega bronze''?\r\nSkullTruck: why are you toxic?\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: how am i braindead\r\nSkullTruck: for having a bad score\r\nSkullTruck: ''just stfu''?\r\nSkullTruck: really?\r\nSkullTruck: youve been toxic the whole game\r\nSkullTruck: and youre telling me to shut up?\r\nSkullTruck: whats wrong with you\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: i am?\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: FIRST OFF\r\nSkullTruck: i didnt flame you\r\nSkullTruck: saying that youre toxic isnt flaming you\r\nSkullTruck: xD\r\nSkullTruck: sure i am\r\nSkullTruck: i bet you didnt even mute me\r\nSkullTruck: pussy\r\nSkullTruck: gj\r\nSkullTruck: yes\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: whats your fuckin problem\r\nSkullTruck: so what if i died\r\nSkullTruck: hmm?\r\nSkullTruck: oh i did?\r\nSkullTruck: how?\r\nSkullTruck: by playing an actual champion\r\nSkullTruck: and not ahri jungle?\r\nSkullTruck: so?\r\nSkullTruck: is it my fault\r\nSkullTruck: so ur calling me an idiot\r\nSkullTruck: and that im bad\r\nSkullTruck: toxicity at its finest bois\r\nSkullTruck: can you stand in front of me i dont want to tank the damage\r\nSkullTruck: no shit\r\nSkullTruck: stop spamming\r\nSkullTruck: ping like that\r\nSkullTruck: ur trying to be annoying or...?\r\nSkullTruck: ?\r\nSkullTruck: u ping me when i miss my ulti\r\nSkullTruck: u missed ur ulti too\r\nSkullTruck: several times\r\nSkullTruck: ''fakin bronzes''?\r\nSkullTruck: jesus\r\nSkullTruck: how is it our fault\r\nSkullTruck: you died as well\r\nSkullTruck: rly\r\nSkullTruck: shut up\r\nSkullTruck: if the only words that can come out of your mouth are bronze and idiot then you should keep it closed\r\nSkullTruck: wow ur so good\r\nSkullTruck: english please\r\nSkullTruck: ''gj''?\r\nSkullTruck: whats ur problem?\r\nSkullTruck: ''bronz dont speak''?\r\nSkullTruck: dude\r\nSkullTruck: yeah and rolling your face on it is really hard","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-16T20:46:28.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see that you weren't being rude or anything to begin with, and you only started trying to defend yourself from what the others were saying, but in the long run fighting back with your own teammates isn't the most positive attitude to have. It's never good to fight fire with fire, as that can give them ammo to report you. Remember to try and take the higher road, and report _them _ after the match to help the rest of the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Swollo","date":"2017-07-18T16:16:14.302+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I guess I really wasn't at my best behavior.
