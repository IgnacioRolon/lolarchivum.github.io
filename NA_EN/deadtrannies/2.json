First thing I notice on startup is a strange program that wasn't on my desktop before Unigine Valley benchmark 1.0. Now my computer is acting really slow etc, so I start updating drivers; scanning my computer etc; after that was finished I went to uninstall Unigine Valley benchmark 1.0, That's when My computer crashed. The first time I tried to turn it back on I got the blue screen with the error message Critical Process has died.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've not got that message again yet, but when I finally got back on it's still listed in program list, but when I go to uninstall it says does not exist; So I tried playing a game of league, Because all my stuff was up to date now, no risks found etc. I get into the game where I used to get 100+ fps on ultra now I'm un able to play sitting at 0 fps on very low. I need help as MSI hasn't wrote me back yet, I honestly don't expect much help from them as the whole process up to this point has been very frustrating. Below are my specs ANY HELP IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. It'd make my day if  someone could help me get my laptop back, as right now it's virtually unusable, and my team mates suffered, as I was un able to play at 0 fps.\r\n\r\nCOMPUTER SPECS:\r\n\r\nI7 5700 HQ CPU @ 2.70 GHZ\r\nGTX 960M\r\n12.0 GB RAM\r\n64-BIT OS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL KEEP CLOSE EYE ON THREAD THANK YOU TO ANYONE WHO HELPS ME ESPECIALLY ANY RIOTERS WITH A FEW MINUTES TO LOOK INTO THIS FOR ME THANKS!","replies":[{"poster":"DeadTrannies","date":"2016-08-25T19:03:23.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there's not much I can do by myself?

Bloatware or any other third party apps could certainly interact poorly with your rig or even League.  it also sounds like you might be having some pretty serious hardware issues if your computer is getting a blue screen of death, and you'll want to get that looking into by your repairman asap!  Until those issues are resolved, you may continue to have more issues than simply playing League!","replies":[]}]}
