Actually, I don&#039;t understand people who rage either. \n\nI can&#039;t tell if It&#039;s a complete lack of giving a fuck, a mental disorder, or if it actually just doesn&#039;t bother me to get flamed from time to time. I usually deserve it anyways. Does it really have that big an effect on people that muting is necessary, or is it protection so you don&#039;t lash back? \n\nI certainly get mad playing this game sometimes, but I&#039;d rather focus on playing and trying to win than typing in my chatbox, and it actually disturbs me that some people pretend to play this game competitively and don&#039;t think this way\n\nThe only game I remember actually raging at people was a customs with friends :^)","replies":[]}
