Quick question, you designed the Tyrant Swain skin, and I always thought of it as Swain's current 'canon' look because that's how he looks in the last Journal of Justice.\n\nNow with the VGU and everything, does that mean you can't really import features from the Tyrant skin, even though they might be relevant?

Its like how wards works like this,\n\nswain passive;\n\nHe commands beatrice to go into a certain location by making beatrice voluntarily goes to a bush nearest to swains range of sight. it has a cool down of 1 min before beatrice can go to a certain bush again and while this is active beatrice is invulnerable. while this is active you can know a certain ganks/champs in that location(ps: it has a greater range to wards) and if beatrice sees a champ she will scream alerting swain. but when swain goes to base she will go to the base too to balance the passive of course lol. and and if swain leaves from the place where beatrice is active even without finishing 1 min she will just flies back to swain and finds a target bush again close to swain like that.\n\ndefending this passive:\n\nwe all know that swain is a tactician and commanding beatrice like this is the best way and not like the \"send x pet to do x dmg to x person\" because its overrated in the game and i want his kit(the activating ones) will only relay on his own power. another advantage of this skill is that it will make room for swain to place wards and help him in his tactics and another is that it will be a great passive in the top lane placing it in the bush besides the river alerting him in ganks. the flaws of this passive is that enemy champs can see beatrice but beatrice is invulnerable and they will know that it is warded whist they can also hear beatrice alerting swain so the possibilities is .. it will make them leave the area and make swain more concentrated on killing his laner. lastly, it would be nice to predict what the enemy will do (atleast for seconds) whilst the player can think what the next thing he will do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
