There is said it, now downvote me because i dont circlejerk against Riot.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact same situation as it was with singed &quot;support&quot;.The problem is not their picks, i play offmeta supports all the time, hell i started playing and maining Galio support due to the increase of ap offensive supports on bot lane. THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the guy picks Nunu &quot;Support&quot; NO MATTER WHAT, and then does not support at all. He leaves the adc to play a 1 vs 2 battle, which is next to impposible and causes the adc to be smashed unless the enemy sucks. In the end this creates a massively negative experience for the adc, because he has no support. \r\n\r\nOh and dont bring in the &quot;Suport is not the adc&#039;s slave&quot; bullshit, that is an excuse and you know it. I advocate for this all the time, and if my adc is really bad or is flaming me, i go support the top lane. You are not a slave, but it is YOUR JOB to support your adc at least on the early levels before roaming, to help your adc to reach lategame ad their powerspikes.\r\n\r\nI will post something i found on reddit: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dotamasterrace/comments/5w9ewc/yet_again_rito_bans_user_for_not_playing_their/de9bs48/?st=izpeel0e&amp;sh=8c97ce34\r\n\r\n&gt; Yeah, this is the second time this thread got posted\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The thread got canned the first time because he was claiming something random without the screenshot, and the second time because the title was literally wrong (He&#039;s not banned for &quot;winning&quot;, he&#039;s not fucking Donald Trump)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I dunno, this is just like the singed support case, it&#039;s some dude picking support and doing something other than supporting, and people reporting him for it. Yeah, he&#039;s a good player, but the people commenting about it are all hypocrites too.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The second they would get someone playing off-meta in their game, they would report the shit out of him the second they lost, but they&#039;re somehow defending this dude&#039;s virtue in this thread as if he&#039;s some great innovator.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Here&#039;s a comment from the guy on his stream\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Just to be clear, his strategy is: &quot;I&#039;m going to do this, and you&#039;re going to like it&quot; He won&#039;t pick another hero that would fit the teamcomp better, he won&#039;t alter his strategy. You&#039;re going to do what he wants and you&#039;re going to like it.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Unsurprisingly, teammates don&#039;t like that, even if they win sometimes with it - It&#039;s like some dude in Dota telling you he&#039;s going to duo lane middle with IO whether you fucking like it or not, every single game, he&#039;ll pick IO and just sit in your midlane.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Even if you win with the IO sometimes, you still have a shitty experience, because all your other lanes suffer.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I don&#039;t give a shit if people play off-meta things as long as they let the team know they&#039;re doing it and make sure everyone actually wants it, or at least the person who they&#039;re supposed to be laning with is ok with it. When I start to get pissed off is when someone declares they&#039;re doing something stupid, the team says &quot;Please don&#039;t&quot; and then they do it anyways.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I grabbed one of his vods - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/118596913\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; He tells his AD he&#039;s going to ditch him and do his own thing. His AD says &quot;Uh.. can you help me get tear at least?&quot; - His response is &quot;Don&#039;t worry, if its like last game, there&#039;ll be plenty of tears&quot;.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Unsurprisingly, he goes about his strategy, which is to &quot;annoy the enemy team&quot;, which gets him killed multiple times. His team constantly complains it is a 4v5 game (Which it basically is) and is trying to surrender the entire time, since he&#039;s feeding his ass off, and the opponent ADC is huge.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; At 20 minutes he is 1/11/8.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; He ends the game 1/16/20. He locks his team into a 40 minute game that they don&#039;t want to play and tells them they should suck it up and play by his rules.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Ok, so lets see his second game.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; He does the same thing, and goes into the enemy jungle to invade, gets caught and gives first blood to Master Yi, a snowbally hero. He then dies again.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; All the while, he&#039;s complaining his teammates are &quot;less proactive&quot; than the enemy team (While he continues to abandon his AD, who is being denied farm and experience).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; His team complains that the game is a joke, saying to report him (As he fails to invade over and over. They get stomped and it&#039;s not even close - Again, the enemy AD is a god, and his is weak.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; He gets into another champion select, he tells his team what he&#039;s doing, they tell him no, he does it anyways. People dodge the champion selection (Probably a good move).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Gets into his next game - This causes his team to automatically not want to play, which gets him a smite Blitzcrank support, as his team assumes he&#039;s trolling.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Again, he tries his stupid invade and gets first blooded. His team is complaining. He&#039;s jungling now because Blitzcrank assumed he was trolling. This game is closer, but still terrible because of the Nunu. Another loss.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; I&#039;ve taken a lot of time typing this up, but from the VODS it looks pretty clear to me.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     Plays something people hate in a way people don&#039;t want, despite being asked not to\r\n&gt;     Plays it in a highly risky manner, causing people to tilt off the face of the earth\r\n&gt;     Plays it in a way that forces another member of his team to lane alone, ensuring a fed carry on the other team every game\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nSO just stop with your Riot Hate Boners and look at the fucking situation, because just like with singed this was JUSTIFIED. And dont pretend you would like this happening to you, especially if you were an adc player.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-02-28T18:25:30.851+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you needed to quote was\n\nin his champ select lobby\n\nI will die plenty for both of us\nYeah, thats real encouraging to hear, my teammate plans on dying alot","replies":[{"poster":"Kukan Seishin","date":"2017-03-04T04:36:43.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1/16/20","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2017-02-28T14:59:20.676+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"\"People aren't playing the way I want them to, waaahhhhhhhhhh\" - League of Legends Playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2017-02-28T15:01:53.682+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ok, then please, by all means, play with me and i will play offmeta ap garen, or better yet, please play adc while i will leave you for the entire game as a \"support\".

If I have found I don't mesh well with a particular support-regardless if it fits with the general strategy, based on what you've said previously-it doesn't matter if it works or not, it's based on if it frustrates the players he's with. If I don't like a particular support and they pick it anyways, by your own statement,  I can now report him. I can communicate all I want, but he can still decide to stay Malzahar.\n\nLook, I get that it has a much different feeling to be left alone; but the same principles still apply. If we're allowed to report Nunu for playing a counter jungle style team support (vice ADC support), there's no different in my reporting Malzahar because I wanted a Soraka/lulu/Nami support.\n\nYou say it's ok to deviate so long as it's not at the expense of your team. At the expense of what, winrate? Their level of fun?\n\nIf it's the former, he's already proven through statistics that A)It doesn't cause the ADC to fall behind by much gold to warrant complaining about B)He has a higher win rate with his Nunu style than anything else; to the point where taking a standard support would be him WILLINGLY picking worse for the team as a whole.\n\nIf it's the latter, the same can be said of the team forcing him to play something he doesn't want to play. Most people hate playing support, yet the game tends to force you to play there anyways. Why is one players fun any more important than anothers?\n\nAs for your last paragraph...how is this supposed to work exactly? It's an odd case we're talking about. A player who literally is a one trick pony. He CANNOT play anyone else at the same level he plays Nunu. If his team accomodates him, they kind of have to go all the way, it doesn't work to half ass it. I understand what you're saying; teams should be working together and communicate, which I agree with-but in such an off the wall case with proven numbers, I find it hard to really say no to the guy.\n\nAnd don't take this the wrong way, I've definitely had odd picks that pissed me off. However, those were guys who got put into support and effectively trolled, taking a complete off the wall pick that they've never tried before and truly screwing the game over.

I can report someone all I want, but if it isn't valid, it shouldn't mean anything.\n\nSecond, Nunu is arguably also playing the role he is assigned-just in a different manner. He's still supporting the team as a whole. He isn't trying to duo top or mid or something like that, he isn't hindering the team; he's supporting the team by roaming into the enemy jungle and getting them behind. Kinda like how a \"normal\" support would poke the enemy support and adc to keep them off his own adc, Nunu is poking the enemy jungle and ganking other lanes to get the enemy team as a whole behind. It's a different mindset, but has a rather similar result when you think about it....just most people don't think about it.\n\nThe fact that you say it like that tells me you think Meta should be enforced. If not, then what's wrong with a team-wide support? After all, the role he's taking is \"support\". Not ADC's bitch, not bottom support, support.\n\nAs for your next point, well, I already covered that. He isn't outright stealing his OWN jungle; he is invading the enemy and hitting other lanes.\n\nI'd also like to point out the irony that Riot says they don't enforce the meta, yet before I even get to champ select I have to select a meta role. Doesn't have much relevance to this conversation, just something that struck me just now.\n\nNow perhaps my understanding is wrong here, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. But I believe it's generally the ADC that is upset-understandably so since they're the one most negatively affected. In which case, it's 1 players fun vs 1 other players fun and cancels itself out.\n\nIf I'm wrong on this, then I think the community really needs to look at itself and realize it needs to stop being a meta sheep-but I'll concede if this is the case, yes 4 players fun>1 players fun.\n\nFor your next question; if its turns out it's a legit case like this guy, where they will undeniably do FAR worse if they pick anyone else-yes, you SHOULD let them do it, or else you are actually harming your own chance of winning.\n\nHowever I have a feeling who most people who might try to claim this aren't actually 1 tricks. I don't think this would be too difficult to decipher pre champ select; a simple lolking search can reveal his match history. He claims he only plays Riven support, but only has her as 4 of her last 20 games? Sorry, you did fine with others, don't try to pull that. Your entire history is Riven with a substantially high winrate?

I've never seen it played in a serious match, and I don't see why it'd be considered a good idea in the slightest.\n\nI don't think you know what \"effective\" actually means.\n\nYour AP Garen and Tank Ahri is like trying to dig a hole with your hands. Can you do it? Sure. Is it effective? No, it takes a while. You'd rather have a tool to do it.\n\nBruiser Garen/AP Ahri is digging a hole with a shovel. It's actually effective.\n\nThis is really the idea I've been trying to get you to understand from the get go. You *can* do a lot of things, that will have some sort of effect, yes...but it isn't actually EFFECTIVE to do those things. I mean, going back to my digging analogy, you show up to help dig holes for some plants, but don't bring a shovel. You might technically be \"contributing\", but the fact that you came without a shovel when you knew exactly what you would be doing that day is going to annoy the hell out of everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-04T06:07:04.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstanding\nwhat effective and efficient mean\neffective-successful in producing a desired or intended result.\nefficient-Performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort. \nI never said ap garen I said{{item:3116}} \ntank ahri is a cc machine with aoe","replies":[{"poster":"Vectros","date":"2017-03-06T08:00:32.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Magical Player,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2rUYfrOV,comment-id=00000001000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-04T06:07:04.388+0000)\n>\n> I think you misunderstanding\n> what effective and efficient mean\n> effective-successful in producing a desired or intended result.\n> efficient-Performing or functioning in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort. \n> I never said ap garen I said{{item:3116}} \n> tank ahri is a cc machine with aoe\n\nOk, let's roll with the definition then.\n\nSuccessful in producing a desired or intended result.\n\nWhat is your desired result? To provide an absolutely minimal amount of CC? Then ok, you're effective.\n\nAre you trying to be successful by actually winning the game? Then you aren't effective, because the ONLY thing you contribute is a slow...and again, arguably ineffective. Since you're trying to peel with said slow (or prevent an escape), you're applying a 20% slow in an area.\n\nHell, even if we say your goal is to just peel-not even win the game, I still wouldn't call it effecive. The chance that this will actually work and stop an enemy from reaching your ADC/team or getting away is fairly minimal, IE not successful, IE not effective, particularly when stacked against any sort of tanks CC. Even other bruisers have innate CC better than this.\n\nSo I originally said AP garen, you mention an AP item. The typical assumption then is we're talking about AP garen. I don't even know what you're trying to say now. Garen builds a Rylais, then goes full AD? Full tank? What?\n\nIn any case, if you're not talking AP garen, it's irrelevant anyways, since my post originally said AP garen.\n\nBut I'll humor you and say this; instead of building Rylais, build Randuins. It has everything you mentioned, and more. Nothing is wasted on it; you get a nice AoE slow, which is MUCH stronger that I might add; armor, and attack speed slow. You're far more resilient, and a 35% slow is enough I'd call it effective.\n\nI'd just like to let you know though-the fact that you weren't actually talking AP garen when that's what the original post was talking about means this was a very pointless chain of posts.","replies":[{"poster":"Magical Player","date":"2017-03-06T19:30:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an effective item\nit performs a result \nit is not efficient\nas you say Omens outclasses Ryalis","replies":[{"poster":"Vectros","date":"2017-03-06T23:17:40.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Magical Player,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=2rUYfrOV,comment-id=0000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-06T19:30:54.314+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s an effective item\n> it performs a result \n> it is not efficient\n> as you say Omens outclasses Ryalis\n\nGlad to see you ignored most my post.
