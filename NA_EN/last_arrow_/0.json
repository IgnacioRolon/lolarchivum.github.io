Every time I play league and have a site up to listen to music while playing the screen does not minimize. So I Tab out and minimize and the shaky lag stops, after a few seconds the shaky lag seems to happen again. So that is my problem while playing league and this has never happened. Even if I don't have anything up the LEAGUE CLIENT unminimizes  itself and then I continue to get the shaky lag. Can someone please explain why this is happening? I even restarted my computer as well. SOS","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-11T21:40:56.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you mean by shaky lag.

So basically its telling me everything is okay. Alright so I thought it was me.\n\nSo I went through my pc and did another clean up and deleted games as well. After that played a game, still studder shaky lag.\n\nAfter that, I even uninstalled chrome and league of legends. Played a game, and still studder shaky lag.\n\nAnd my pc is at least 2-3 years old updated, it's a lenovo desktop specifically for gaming. \n\nI mean the shaky studder lag is playable because fortunately there is no delay, although it does make me miss the minions.\n\nSo yea I tried everything possible except a system restore but i dont think there is a need to. \n\n\nIt's really bumming out my league experience. playable! but to an extent. I never had this problem. I played more games throughout this convo to see if the lag passes by but still nothing either.\n\nI played other games and I dont get the same problem. But who doesnt wana play league? <3 help","replies":[{"poster":"Last Arrow ","date":"2017-02-16T04:04:01.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried this \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update\n\nand it seems to be okay","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-16T22:06:19.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really sorry to hear about that, and wishing you all the best.
