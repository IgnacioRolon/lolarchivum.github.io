You will be shielded from demotion for the next 3 games after you advance a division. If you advance a tier, you will be shielded for 10 games (3 games for Master Tier). If you are currently being shield and you're in danger of being demoted once the shield wears off, you will receive a warning in your Summoner profile.\"\r\nIs this still a thing anymore?\"\r\nThanks in advance for an answer","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-23T23:59:04.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, [shields are still at maximum](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ), Captian. \n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/2t9sDPrlvFpdK/giphy.gif\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2016-10-24T23:42:35.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got promoted into S5.

I have had the shield on my d5 account for a long time now; can you clarify what it means? Does it mean that every time I hit 0 lp, the 10 games start again, or does it mean there is a hidden number of safe games that I can lose, depending on how my hidden mmr is? I ask because I tend to go back and forth between 0 - 60 lp a lot, and it always says the same thing, that I am in danger of demotion. But I certainly am losing a lot ( :( ). I guess the best way to phrase it- is it refreshing every time at 0 lp?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-10-24T16:12:38.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=2wsJgZ0M,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-23T23:59:04.409+0000)\n>\n>Captian.","replies":[]}]}]}
