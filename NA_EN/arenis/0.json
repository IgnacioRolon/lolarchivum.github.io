This is more than likely caused by you earning a bunch of keys while you were using the Beta Client just before your change to the Legacy Client. The droprate for key fragments is a curve, rather than a line. This means that each key fragment that drops will reduce the chances of the next drop, and this continues exponentially. This rate will reset approximately 30 days after the first fragment dropped, so you should start seeing these drop again soon.\n\nLet me know if you don't see any more key fragments after this droprate has had time to reset.","replies":[{"poster":"Arenis","date":"2016-12-28T12:07:20.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've still yet to get a key frag. even winning victories a lot across every diff mode. and even playing in groups of people (which i think raises rate, but not certain so dont quote me on it) but yea i've gotten 1 or 2 chests since then, and some mastery 6 tokens. just haven't got another key frag. still stuck at 2. is it cause for concern yet? the last one i got was quite a while ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T21:39:58.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't say this is cause for concern yet. You're correct that playing with friends in a premade does *slightly* raise your drop rate chances for a key fragment. I'd say we should hold out until it has been at least 30 days since your last key fragment so we can be sure that your drop rate has reset before we start looking into this further.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken NuGGiess","date":"2016-12-23T18:23:12.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have been on the legacy client and i play almost every day and win 2-3 each day and its been about 6 weeks or so since the last one i got and my friend who i play with got 9 in this time frame from games we are both in he just got 3 today and ive yet to get 1","replies":[{"poster":"Arenis","date":"2016-12-28T12:08:48.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty. yea i dont think it is the client, i tried the new one again for a few days. still nada. thanks for taking the time to clear it up","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShacObama","date":"2016-12-21T08:18:41.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't gotten a key fragment since Snowdown started I'm not sure why but it's kind of annoying.
