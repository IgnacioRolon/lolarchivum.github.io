She does have solid poke and decent zoning, but her cc can be hard to land. Support syndra is harder to play because YOU make the picks and (some) engages and peel well for your adc, whereas mid syndra just nukes the fuck out of people. AP Syndra support CAN do that, but a little bit later on than mid syndra. All of the supports that I mentioned in my post work well as supports, whether it's through zoning, nuking, or just trolling. People think that supports have to have cc to do well, but they completely disregard the laning phase when they say that.

While they might not know it in champ select, I do much better when I support on these champions than on most others, and I main support. \nI will say that once laning phase is over shaco as a support is weaker than say, AP lux, but shaco can assassinate an adc far better than lux can, as well as make some incredibly trolly picks and plays using his ultimate. Even though he only has one meaningful form of cc he can still be played well as a support. I got reported once on ap shaco when I went 4/0 with an afk adc by my 0/6 toplaner. What's up with that?  If I can play well in the position that I choose with the champion I choose, why tell me I shouldn't do it?\nI respect your support preferences and how you wouldn't like to lane with me, but don't you ever tell someone they can't play something.
