The charge bar that comes up when they being charging their Q fills when it reaches its maximum power, but in Xerath's case when the bar fills up that is when his Q cancels from charging too long. Maybe make his Q charge indicator like theirs?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fomorian27","date":"2014-05-07T12:19:24.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you also look at a bug that causes varus' q to sometimes not fire? If smartcasted, the usual way it's supposed to fire is you hold it down until you want to fire, and then you release the key. What sometimes happens is you release the q, but the arrow doesn't fire. Instead, you have to tap the q key again to get it to fire. I first noticed this bug a long time ago, but stopped playing varus so I couldn't tell if it was fixed. Then, I played him in URF mode and it was still present. Maybe you guys have done some work on it since then, but if not, please have a look.","replies":[{"poster":"NoxiousIce","date":"2014-05-08T01:17:26.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is possibly intentional. Smart-Cast normally allows you to hold down your skill button so that you can check range indicators without actually firing off the skill if you're not ready yet, but if you click to move while it is happening, you can safely let go of your skill without firing it off. Varus' \"bug\" is likely just the natural result of the way his skill works with the way that smartcasting works.","replies":[{"poster":"Fomorian27","date":"2014-05-08T12:11:24.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ability shouldn't function two different ways at random. That doesn't feel good.
