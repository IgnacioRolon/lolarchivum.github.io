Still hope you guys like it and check it out! I swear I posted this before the TU was released on Surrender @ 20\n\nHey guys!! Took a listen to Cass's updated VO last night and I'm really loving it, and what with the Texture and Model updates some of the older champs had been getting I thought it would be fun to try and come up with a new design for Cassiopeia's classic skin today! I took a lot of inspiration from both renaissance European aristocratic fashion and Ancient Egyptian clothing (as well as a few other desert centric societies) to try and create her as a sort of Noxian/Shurima hybrid, and sort of fit her stylistically with the recent Nasus and Sivir updates as well as Azir's new aesthetic. I wanted to make her beautiful, seductive and a little bit regal without being terribly oversexualized. It's a work in progress! A lot of the details of the design (embroidery, details on the medallions lining her waist, etc) will be hammered out once I start rendering it. Let me know what you think! Hope you guys like it so far C: Listened to [her new VO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPeiyyV1Tg8) while I was drawing it to try to make the design congruous with the audio.\n\nhttps://31.media.tumblr.com/80e3a3c97a8ecad8cb1f16949a2a4e67/tumblr_nazc20yDj21qk32lpo1_1280.png\n\nyou can find some WIP shots on my personal blog [here](http://faeriefountain.tumblr.com/tagged/art)","replies":[{"poster":"SkylarSans","date":"2014-08-27T20:38:32.107+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your version honestly feels more Asian that Egyptian to me. I also really like the headpiece on original, it's unique, looks regal and fits Shurima theme. \nI wouldn't mind if they gave her some actual clothing instead of the bra though.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2014-08-27T20:46:13.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your feedback! I agree that along the line it definitely crossed the cultural boundary. The Egyptian imagery I tried to use had to do with mimicking the way multiple fabrics and ornaments were draped and wrapped around the waist. The head ornamentation was inspired by renaissance headgear (those soft horned looking hats noble women would wear) but sharpened to the point of looking aggressive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Power Nerf","date":"2014-08-27T19:32:50.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait to see it finished.

I tried blonde at first but I wanted her to look sort of sickly to fit with her kit and the poison it's centered around.

I think it might be the head dress? you might want to look at the headdress of Aaliyah as [Queen of the Damned](https://www.google.com/search?q=queen+of+the+damned&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=bt__U-nyFIjIgwT06oLYBg&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1920&bih=1075#q=queen+of+the+damned+aaliyah&tbm=isch&imgdii=_).
