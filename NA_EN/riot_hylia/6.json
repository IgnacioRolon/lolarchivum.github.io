Diana's lore is undoubtedly my favorite in the game, and everything about her as a champion and her tragic dynamic with Leona is one of my favorite themes within League. This is a little illustration I made a while back to vent my feelings, figured I'd share! Hope you guys like it! Thinking about revisiting it now that it's a bit older and touching things up.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-28T18:13:51.055+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my gosh, this is gorgeous! <3 \n\nBeautifully done!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2014-08-29T00:46:04.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh thank you very much!!!
