Get rekt. Figured I'd toss my fanart contest submission up here! I decided to draw from personal experience and paint the terrifying experience of going to ward a camped bush all by yourself. Ahri and Wukong are probably rushing a poor defenseless Sona :C\r\n\r\nHope you guys like it!","replies":[{"poster":"I Main Swain","date":"2014-09-18T22:03:15.110+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it and all, but it seems as if you spent more time on ahri's...ahem...*bonus features* than you did on wukongs face.  its still great, just sayin in case you wanna touch him up some more.","replies":[{"poster":"GaleWinUnleashed","date":"2014-09-19T05:12:38.412+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those are some stunning bonus features, though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2014-09-18T22:14:30.954+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I spent more time on ahri, period. I agree Wukong isn't as polished, this started out as just a painting of Ahri for a friend, and I found out about the contest a day and a half or so before the deadline so I didn't have much free time to put into him :C plan was to have him riding his nimbus cloud as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2014-09-18T23:00:47.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually like Wukong's face in this.

I don't know how to do this type of coloring. I don't even have the software. Don't get me wrong, I'm getting there but my low self-esteem sees your picture and I lose a little hope. \n\nI like your picture. And Wukong looks so much more serious and laid back. And Ahri looks so perfect. I'm rooting for you.","replies":[{"poster":"XcomegaX","date":"2014-09-19T05:39:13.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try using blender 3d, and rendering images, much easier than making a fan art from scratch.","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-09-19T15:56:30.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That does sound easy but that sounds like it wouldn't be as cool or as hard as you'd worked on yours.
