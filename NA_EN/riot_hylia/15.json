If I have time maybe over the next few days I'll really dig into the details and make this a proper concept instead of a speedpainting and hammer out some cool design features to make her read well individually instead of just as a one off concept.)\n\nhttps://33.media.tumblr.com/1168ebe563f1800fd660bf3016d94df2/tumblr_nba15xWL311qk32lpo2_r1_1280.png\nHey guys! So lately I've been trying to pump out a Character speedpaint a day. Today I made a quick concept inspired by Liandry's Torment! It was originally going to be a black and white study but a bit of color worked its way in there. I've got this idea in my head that she's the fallen Queen of what would become the Shadow Isles. This was just a painting exercise, I have no idea as to how she'd function as a champion.\n\nMade this in a few hours today in Adobe Photoshop CS6.  It's a little rough but I'm mostly trying to improve my speed, so I was a little sloppy putting it together. Just figured I'd throw it up here since it's relatively League related!! <3\n\nProgress shots and other stuff can be found at my personal blog [here](http://www.faeriefountain.tumblr.com), my art blog [here](http://www.tomrandbyart.tumblr.com), or my website [here](http://www.thomasrandby.com)!

It would probably be easy to drown her in a vampire schema, but I could see this champion taking off, despite the similarity to Lissandra {{champion:127}}.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Razgriz","date":"2014-09-03T06:23:09.723+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see her as a painbringer-type rather than a vampire.

Very heavy us of DOT based abilities. A passive that increases damage to opponents under CC effects. very strong late game damage, with some powerful early tools, but give her a weak midgame (kind of like how haunting guise provides great early game stats whereas liandry's torment is only really effective in the late game). People who build liandries tend to also build a lot of  health items, so I would have her as one of the higher health AP mages. would love to do a champion concept if you wouldnt mind :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"MAZZ1M0","date":"2014-09-02T22:08:44.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reminds me of Eve from the PS game Parasite Eve.\n\nIt looks fantastic.
