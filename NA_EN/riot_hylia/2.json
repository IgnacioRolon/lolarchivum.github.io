I post static character and skin concepts here pretty often but I&#039;ve never really tried to make a Splash art sort of illustration, and wanted to try it out and step out of my comfort zone! I learned a lot in the process, and had a lot of fun working on this! Zyra is one of my favorite champions to play as support, mostly because she breaks the \"peaceful protector\" support trope in favor of something more along the lines of \"I&#039;m going to choke the life out of you with plants.\" It was more of an exercise than anything, but I&#039;m pretty happy with the end result and wanted to share it!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2015-08-14T20:53:19.947+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"wow this is really nice.
