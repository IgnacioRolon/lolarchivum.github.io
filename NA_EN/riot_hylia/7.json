I've been playing a lot of Zyra lately and it's gotten me in the skin designing mood C: Some of you guys might remember the Mythic Zyra concept I designed a few weeks ago that picked up some traction! This time I'm sharing a Blood Moon / Lunar Revel skin idea for her.\n\nThe skin is inspired by Futakuchi-Onna, a form of Japanese demoness with two faces on the front and backs of their heads who would use their serpentlike hair to feed. In this skin, in lieu of plants, Zyra summons monstrous creatures made of her own living hair to do her bidding. In place of seeds, cursed combs erupt from the ground and sprout long tendrils of hair. Her Blood Moon mask is situated on the back of her head, like the Futakuchi-Onna's second face. I like the idea of the mask sort of possessing her body, and when she dies it rises alone in a mass of living hair, leaving its mortal shell behind. \n\nI thought it'd be a cool opportunity to explore a different direction for Zyra's player fantasy! Still a summoner of sorts but straying away from the plant thematic present in her other skins. I figure if Lissandra can throw knives and still talk like she's throwing ice then it's probably no big deal ;)\n\nHere's the lineup of the concept sketches! \nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/8c6ab9c406428c1fe9ff31d454b671ae/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo6_r1_1280.png\nAnd I'll post them by themselves too in case the resolution turns out better\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/fba1d567efb8d9657c799e7be839dd23/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo5_540.png\nhttps://36.media.tumblr.com/84b376ce9191bab53f0f1a783d8ec7f4/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo2_1280.png\nhttps://36.media.tumblr.com/f7ac8828d175c3cb15a1591132c95e67/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo3_1280.png\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/a4032d5932a441824191a918f584fc33/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo4_1280.png\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/49413e8bacce51f976c6b0848c083fc5/tumblr_o3qufgMNoV1qk32lpo1_500.png\n\nLet me know what you guys think!

For example QA testing on a new skin involves sweeps on each existing skin, which compounds multiplicatively for the number of models a champion uses. Anything that needs to be localised like VO must be written, cast, recorded and processed for every region.\n\nWithout getting too bogged down, a skin for Mundo uses one model. Zyra has a model for herself, her passive, the seed, grasping plant, and thorn plant. Even on 750s animators often do Quality of Life sweeps, adjusting and improving the back catalogue so there's a lot of work that happens behind the scenes.","replies":[{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2016-03-16T04:59:29.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=V8qMmuvY,comment-id=0022000000000001000000030000,timestamp=2016-03-15T18:09:13.736+0000)\n> Even on 750s animators often do Quality of Life sweeps, adjusting and improving the back catalogue so there's a lot of work that happens behind the scenes.\n\nOh ok, thanks for clearing that up for me!

If you have any specific questions about what goes in to making a skin ask away >:)\n\nMy role as a concept artist is to take an idea the Product Owners choose from words on a spreadsheet to a fully finished design with a strong thematic to support future skins. It's super challenging and can take a while because we get feedback from so many different sources and work collaboratively to ensure the best possible results. More recently we've been trying to work more flexibly alongside the other artists such as animators and character artists to test out ideas in-game faster which has been really great but really opened my eyes to the various limitations and challenges each discipline faces every time we do a skin.","replies":[{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2016-03-19T08:35:31.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, that's super cool. So let me make sure I have this right; you have a list of ideas for skins that you are tasked with creating concept art for, and depending on the concepts, the upper ups choose which skins to go all the way? \n\nIf that's the case, i'm sure that can be a hard job, but i'm also sure it is super rewarding if your's get picked. >:D","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-20T03:00:36.207+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We often have open meetings where anyone can pitch ideas for skins, and often fan skins come up during these meetings. The objective is sometimes '____ needs a new skin', 'we need 3 champions to fit thematic ___' or 'we are looking for a new thematic to fit patch ____' so what actually gets discussed is often very different but always tactical.\n\nAfter that most of what we do is working on a product that, unless there are good reasons, will actually ship in some form or another. Then we are tasked with taking a description like 'A LeBlanc skin that is druidic or fairy in theme' and turning it into a finished design which our team can a) get excited about and b) model, texture, rig, animate, vfx, sfx, QA and paint a splash for. The other big part of my job is following that process and having lots of conversations all the way up to promotional materials and splash story to make sure that what we get excited about at the very beginning comes through in every aspect of the product so that players really feel it.\n\nIt can be tough because as you say, we don't get to pick and choose what we draw and you'll be getting feedback from everyone at Riot that mains that champion. Sometimes it'll be a theme you're not too familiar with and you'll have to do a lot of research and play a heap of that champion to ensure you really understand what is exciting about that champion/theme and where you can add a lot of value for players. But it's really wonderful to see players enjoying the team's hard work, and personally I get so excited when I see fan art of a skin I got to work on >xD","replies":[{"poster":"Desiderium","date":"2016-03-21T05:47:58.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Kindlejack. Would you care to discuss the topic of skin-neglected champions that get new skins? Does this mean that all the time they went without getting a skin will never, for lack of a better term, be \"made-up for\" and despite the fact that they finally receive a skin, all the years they went without one will be \"wasted?\" Take Zed and Project Zed for example. Zed hasn't received an ***official*** skin since his release in November of 2012. He received Project late last year. Does this mean that he may potentially have to wait another 3 years for some love because he went so long without a skin?\n\nTo put it in other words: *Does the longer you go without a skin, mean you go even longer without a skin after you get one?*\n\nI think it's a very interesting topic of discussion. Note that I'm not necessarily asking for anything here; I'm more interested in discussing the topic of skin-neglected champions that recently get a skin and what it means for them in the future and what it means for them for all the years they went without one.\n\nAlso please understand that I don't intend any bias. If Zed got 10 skins in one year, I would be complaining about it. Partly because of the obvious \"other champs deserve it first\" thing, and also partly because my wallet definitely wouldn't be able to handle that, lol!","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-22T07:18:32.629+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Previous cadence is no indication of the time between future skins. If you take a look as Zed from a production standpoint:\n\nNovember 2012: Zed released with launch skin, skin cadence ~65 skins per year so no skin expected for 12-16 months.\nOctober 2013: SKT win Worlds S3 and Zed is chosen for an SKT skin (meaning no other Zed skin is being worked on at this time).\nMay 2014: SKT Zed is released.\nNovember 2014: planning begins for PROJECT event and Zed is chosen to get a PROJECT skin.\nSeptember 2015: PROJECT Zed is released.\n\nSo while from the outside it might seem like Zed was 'neglected' it was never really the case. Over the past year, since I joined the team, our goal was to try and increase our cadence dramatically and try to ensure as many champions as possible received a skin. This year might turn out a little different, and we always prioritize champions that resonate well with a thematic over champions that just need a skin to avoid shoehorning, but my hope for the future of skins is to maintain a cadence that ensures champions are served appropriately and regularly. The only ones that get left out are those on the rework list, but after Poppy's awesome rework and the revitalisation of her back catalog I hope Champion Updates are also something players are excited about!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LambGotTheCakes","date":"2016-03-20T16:31:23.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, that was very insightful.

Sometimes it's unavoidable, PROJECT Fiora was in development at the same time as the Fiora update which created a lot of problems for both teams, but we try.
