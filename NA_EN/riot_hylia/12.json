Happy first day of Summer! \n\nI thought it&#039;d be fun to design a pool party skin, and I saw some vintage 50&#039;s beach pinups hanging in an art supply shop and thought the style suited Miss Fortune and the Pool Party lineup perfectly! \n\nhttps://65.media.tumblr.com/4587aec0f1fc664a60f4bd61615ed7fa/tumblr_o93olb3Ydf1vuu3clo2_1280.png\n\nIt was my first time attempting to recreate the art style but I had a blast with it and want to do more in the future. I also made a rough model mockup concept, more than anything to get a feel for what her guns would look like just because they&#039;re so HUGE in game.\n\nhttps://65.media.tumblr.com/2455c5024207c10f05a0d691d48bfeb4/tumblr_o93olb3Ydf1vuu3clo1_1280.png\n\nI&#039;m also using the concept painting to create a full fledged splash art featuring a bunch of other league champs in the background like the other Pool Party skins! It&#039;s super WIP at the moment but here&#039;s a preview!\n\nhttps://67.media.tumblr.com/e34ed96e1e09e1e2ad70d37855cfddee/tumblr_o93olb3Ydf1vuu3clo3_r1_1280.png\n\nI&#039;m hoping to draft up some particle concepts for this soon! Her E would literally be making it rain! Let me know what you guys think, I hope you like it! Design critique is also always appreciated, just keep it friendly please!! &lt;3\n\nIf you like it you can follow me for more at twitter.com/faeriefountain, twitch.tv/faeriefountain and check me out on Patreon at Patreon.com/artist/hyliart!

Maybe if you don't like that try a vintage stamp looking type thing, matching the style of her swimsuit but in a heart shape. Always gotta go for those hearts. I'm tempted to say her ult would be best as bubbles because it risks being too close to pool party ziggs if you use balloons..but who said only yordles could throw water balloons? ooh, busted water balloon for her Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gunpoint","date":"2016-06-21T21:54:54.727+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"+1 for not just putting a character in bikini and calling it poolparty then saying \"and that skill can be like beach balls or something.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Catrian","date":"2016-06-21T22:14:48.784+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're referring to pool party Ahri,those arguments supporting it actually were valid and you oversimplified it.The suggestions were for her foxfire and ultimate effects to be turned into water splashes and for her orb to become a beach ball.Though in my opinion it should be a swirling water orb just to make it less of a hassle on the skin artists since they _have_ to have something that can be readily identified as blue or green to let people know her passive heal is up.\n\nAlso getting a bit fed up with people calling what Ahri is wearing in the original Ziggs splash a bikini.It's a monokini,which is a mix between a one-piece  and a bikini.It basically covers more and lets you have a bit more wiggle room with the swimsuit design.It's also entirely in line with Ahri's character,though I will agree that there has to be something else going on besides just a swimsuit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Freljordi","date":"2016-06-21T02:59:00.777+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Fantastic. I've loved this premise since you first posted it. I love that she has such an ironic outfit with such a 40s-50s era feel while having water guns that almost look like they integrate hextech elements to make the gold aesthetic of her buttons and that general era. You captured her ridiculously huge guns as well. I can tell it's very WIP but my only critique about the pool party potential splash would be making it feel more full? Even with all those champions they're positioned in a way that still makes the background look more or less empty.

What I'll probably end up doing is adding a sort of \"fisheye\" curve to the background and have maybe some yordles cannonballing and put in a high dive or something! I'll play around with it!
