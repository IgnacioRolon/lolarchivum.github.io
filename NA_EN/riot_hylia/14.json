I made a quick Miss Fortune redesign sketch tonight because I&#039;m SO excited for her model updates! I know her design probably isn't going to change much when her update rolls around, but I wanted to see what I could come up with. Figured I&#039;d share it with you guys to see what you think. I can&#039;t wait for the Bilgewater event! If I have time I&#039;m going to try to make this into a completely rendered concept.\n\nhttps://40.media.tumblr.com/c8f2f92275efa2fdeaea060b4da55532/tumblr_inline_nqjbkgmAkX1qiaw9q_540.png\n\nEDIT\n\nStarted a bit of rough rendering! Added a few details to her legs to break up all the brown!\n\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/941a8572570c31b0bcfc559ae8d723ca/tumblr_inline_nqjiy184Tt1qiaw9q_540.png","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-06-26T05:06:33.352+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Love it.** Really clean and elegant, with a much more eye pleasing color palette. If anything, the toning-down of all the oversaturated colors in her outfit really helps her trademark scarlet hair stand out like it should. Good job keeping the stereotypical desirable female form intact, without carrying over those archaic pornstar-level proportions (her current splash art is obnoxious).\n\nThis design looks perfectly at home on the redesigned rift map, much smoother textures and calmer coloring without sacrificing noticeable amounts of detail, and honestly looks about the quality of a piece of a concept art I might find floating around Riot's offices today.\n\nYour {{champion:99}} redesign was amazing and well thought out (still my favorite of your works), and this {{champion:21}} redesign is no exception. I personally find your visual upgrades the most interesting of your art pieces, please keep them coming!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-06-26T17:03:14.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

The fact that her pants and boots are the same color causes a bit of unneeded monotony. The design is wonderful, don't get me wrong. I like the more classy MF look. What if her pants were more of a de-saturated brownish dark red. Since her hair is red already, it wouldn't feel out of place.\n\nSomething like this. http://i.imgur.com/iymrwaZ.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Hylia","date":"2015-06-26T16:16:33.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point! I think making the pants red is a bit dangerous in terms of readability because it might make it difficult to distinguish her legs from her hair when you're looking at her from behind in a top down perspective. I added some gold embellishment and lining on the boots to break up the brown in the post itself, but I was thinking maybe either making her pants the same material as her sleeves to add some variety or darken her boots and gloves to differentiate her limbs from her torso?\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/1a7ea4cc26134897e9240894369adf63/tumblr_inline_nqk7rzNVP81qiaw9q_540.png\nhttps://41.media.tumblr.com/4737cb378016cf4b5fde42db26a02a09/tumblr_inline_nqk7tattt81qiaw9q_540.png","replies":[{"poster":"Junsui Aoi","date":"2015-06-26T21:50:30.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the darkened gloves and boots","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"A Miss Fortune","date":"2015-06-26T13:35:28.032+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}}  main approves","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-06-26T12:50:34.313+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As always, beautiful artwork. \n\nI love the new Corset look instead of the design she currently has (because whether it's supposed to be fan service or not it is just way to unbelievable of an outfit right now) The hat and boot design are also much superior to her current model (I mean really, her current hat is just a pyramid with a hat texture slapped on top). The only thing I feel it lacks is a redesign for her pistols, which are both integral to her design but sorely outdated at the moment.

I was approaching it from the mindset that Miss fortune has several visual components that players are used to seeing when they're playing as her- namely her hat, her hair and her frills- as they're currently the largest part of her model by a wide margin (lol). It's similar because I wanted to keep the core characteristics of Miss Fortune and what people associate with her intact. I don't think Miss Fortune is as outdated as, say, old Sivir was to justify a 100% complete visual overhaul, just some model updates and tweaks to her design! Like I said, though, I wouldn't be surprised if her design wasn't changed when her Model and Texture Update is released.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pyrophilia","date":"2015-06-26T18:56:01.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Very, VERY good.
