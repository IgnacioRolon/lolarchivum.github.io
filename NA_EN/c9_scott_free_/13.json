Most of them wont be as good as a Bronze 3 if it takes half the time to reach 30 and if you put them in silver you will destroy the climb for every player below them effectively. Or everyone will just play dQ to avoid those really bad new 30s if they are vets and so newer players will just feel bad and gold 5 will be a free ride. One or the other","replies":[]}
