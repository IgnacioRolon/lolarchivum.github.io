AT work I listened in to the private conversations of American citizens for like 7 hours total once you factor in down time plus breaks and lunch. Then I went to the gym for two hours where I did upper body lifting and 30 minutes on the elliptical machine netting 3.28 miles run and 340 calories burned. Now I&#039;m at home and waiting for some friends to finish a match so I can play some League with them. What are you guys up to/ how did your day go GD?","replies":[]}
