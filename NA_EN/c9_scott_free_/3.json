Moreover it is simply an attempt to explain why I think that Riot has the wrong approach to this. \n\nUnderserved champions not getting skins\n\nBecause I have personal attatchment I will use Diana and Kha as examples for this. Diana came out in 2012 as did khazix and both came out with one alt skin. Diana had Dark Valkyrie and Kha got Mecha. These are both decent release skins Mecha is better than a lot admittedly and thats cool no problem.  The problem was that it took actual years for them to get second skins. Khazix got the shurima skin in August of 2014 which is actually over 2 years from his release. Diana got Lunar Goddess that same year but during Lunar revel. Neither has gotten a skin since then and the only reason that Diana is even getting a skin is because of the Team Fire vote.\n\n_ESports skins don&#039;t count because they are 750 RP limited time and purely conditional_\n\nLucian dropped just before s3 worlds. (Remember that weird intro? Pepperidge farm does.) He has the dropped skin, a striker skin and project skin. He also has a chroma pack. Ouch fam.\n\nJInx drops the patch after Lucian. She has Zombie slayer, mafia and a Lunar revel skin. 3 skins. Already ahead of them too ouch fam.\n\nYasuo came out towards the end of 2013 and was dropped with high noon. He got Project Yasuo I want to say less than six months ago and is now getting a **Blood Moon** skin. \n\nVelkoz came out on the 27th of February 2014. He now has that battlecast and arclight skin to his name. Tying Diana and Kha in skins in less than 2 years.\n\nBraum came out May 12 2014 He has Dragonslayer El Tigre and that D and D skin in roughly 18 months of being out.\n\nGnar came out on August 13 of 2014 and got his dino Gnar, Gentleman Gnar and Snow Day Gnar skin. He just hit the 18 months mark and is a skin ahead of Diana and Khazix and his skins weren&#039;t based on a vote.\n\nAs you can tell by now this is a bit of a pain point for anyone who likes either of these champions especially since Riot has not announced slating either of them for a rework recently if ever.  Now the skins team doesn&#039;t get this pass on them like they do with Taric, Zyra, Yorick and Eve.  So whats the real hold out becomes the question.\n\n**We like to take theme concepts and see how a champion fits them**\n\nWell now I&#039;m just salty. I&#039;ll admit this is harder for Khazix but you have the blood moon theme. Whats this, the moon. Wait, Diana is the embodiment of the Moon&#039;s wrath. Wouldn&#039;t a blood moon skin on her of all champions not only make sense but also the most sense?  Lunar wraith skins dropped. Oh snap more moon references. I mean again, the moon, Diana embodiment of the moon. Literally your event bleeds skins for her but she somehow only has two? How does that even make sense?\n\nAlso, the void creatures have the whole prehistoric thing going *squints at Kog and Cho* so where&#039;s the prehistoric Khazix? There was just a set of beast hunter skins released, you know who hunts beasts? Rengar and Khazix! Oh snap look at this material you are writing for yourselves with this. I legit don&#039;t understand how these champions don&#039;t have more skins. An arclight Khazix would be a pretty cool concept seeing as purple people being donned in gold is a theme going about Riot games at the moment seeing as Justicar/Arclight are the same thing just a different name. (Yeah, I&#039;m on to you Riot.) This also reminds me that Syndra is at 4 skins and she came out the same year as Kha and Diana. Ouch fam.\n\nI&#039;ve often heard it said that you guys do skins based around themes but that approach is throwing champs in the dust. Not only that it is also not fully adding up with reality as I have pointed out in my post. Before someone says the blood moon festival is an Ionian thing I am just going to point out that I am pretty sure neither Kalista or Thresh care about Cultural celebration. Thresh was also released after Diana and Kha and has more skins than them. Ouch fam.\n\nMaybe we should focus less on themes and more on champion equality. That seems like a more fair option at this point in my eyes. As a dude that owns every Nidalee and Ezreal skin the fact that I could play those 2 champs with a different skin every game in the time it would take to play Zed kha rengar and Diana and maybe another champ or 2 before repeating that system isn&#039;t working out too fairly. I&#039;m not intending this as a personal attack on Riot but more over trying to figure out the real method behind the madness because it just doesn&#039;t seem to add up in my book. I&#039;m sure there are champs you guys feel like are neglected and feel free to contribute. I just think it sucks that that some champs never seem to stop getting skins and others are just stuck with the same 2 and no matter how much you like a skin you still want to switch it up every now and then.","replies":[]}
