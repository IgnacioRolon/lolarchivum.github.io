Also he gets an AS buff globally which means that when I poke someone low he can clear all his camps faster no matter where he is without even showing up in the lane.

How old are you again? For the record I've played less than 400 ranked games between seasons 5 and 6 combined so you should probably factor that in if you're going to bring my rank up. You know, because thats a huge sign I don't play a lot of ranked. Some of us actually have full time jobs and social lives. Also, his damage reduction of 55% is still pretty absurd. I have no problem being wrong but you should have a problem being a poor excuse of a person. And again, like I said the person playing him claimed he was getting the AS buff. So I'm not spouting dumb shit baselessly. I have no problem with that not being a flaw but the ease of getting a sub one minute ult etc is still pretty fucking dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"vOmvbrawfU","date":"2017-01-27T13:38:37.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Let's not pretend you're good and bring rank into when you were boosted into plat.
