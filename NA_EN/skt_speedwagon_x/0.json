But when I do, I expect everything to run smoothly and for me to be able to carry as an 11/3 Jhin {{champion:202}}. I&#039;m responding to an Ahri ulting into mid lane as me and my Gold ELO &quot;teammates&quot; are inevitably sieging down mid lane like we&#039;re playing ARAM instead of Ranked. I use three autos real quick, the 1st one is a StormRazor crit (As I had just bought it), the next two standard, and I position to avoid the Ahri Q and expect to quickly use my executing fourth shot to get a kill and save the rest of my team from feeding her even more. But to my surprise, instead of notoriously spinning around and using my fourth shot&#039;s crit strike, I do some half-effort step back normal crit. This isn&#039;t enough to kill her, so her q comes my way and I&#039;m left gaping at my computer screen, wondering why the heck my champion didn&#039;t just use his arguably MOST IMPORTANT AND SUBLIME feature. I recount the shots I took beforehand... One, Two, and Three, yes I should have been on the fourth... I look everywhere, my runes, abilities, even my MS and FPS to see if I&#039;m lagging, but, no dice. Then I see it. Stormrazor is sitting there inconspicuously as an item can be. I read it&#039;s passive. Yes, a bonus crit if I haven&#039;t auto attacked in a while... So why did I do so little damage with my fourth shot? I respawn and walk to a vacant lane, then I repeat the scenario. I figure it out. Stormrazor&#039;s passive (Storm&#039;s Edge) replaces Jhin&#039;s passive, possibly the most important part of his kit and especially his laning phase. I then begin to think how I could ever make this work, hoping to God that I&#039;m missing to something and Riot hasn&#039;t made this new item terrible on Jhin. But alas, there is no happy end to this story. There&#039;s just no way for me to time my auto attacks perfectly in unison a teamfight to stop the fourth shot from being cancelled. \r\n\r\n&quot;Stormrazor will deal 1.2 more times your my normal autos. This not only applies to your non-4th shot, it also applies to your 4th shot.&quot; Which undoubtedly means suicide for those who build it on Jhin, because you still have to reload. Someone explain why Riot specifically released this item with a special condition for Jhin (the attack speed in relation to the CD for the passive), yet this happens. Jhin still isn&#039;t in a terrible place for the time being, at least relative to Kalista, but I&#039;d still love to use this item which **should** be a perfect item on {{champion:202}} like all the other adc&#039;s. {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-06-02T02:20:55.409+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's gamebreaking as fuck.....you even lose the missing hp damage I bet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-06-02T03:27:36.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, this is a bug I am decently sure.
