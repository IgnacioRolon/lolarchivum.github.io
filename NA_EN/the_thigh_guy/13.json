You just can't handle the fact they actually have counter-picks now instead of being nigh-unstoppable cc bots that run down every other class regardless of what you do.\n\nThere is a reason why people don't like Tanks.\n\nFirst off, they're boring. \n\nYou can't name a single tank that' has remotely interesting or fun mechanics. \n\nOnly ones that do have it are {{champion:57}} and {{champion:154}} \n\nBut that's 2. Only 2. Even then, their combos consist of every other tank combo.\n\nCc chain them into another cc chain which in turns goes into another which disables the enemy's ability fight back. That's incredibly one-sided and boring.\n\nSecondly, the tank meta was one of League's most boring and uninteresting metas. Season 7 was NOT fun in the slightest. Full tank comps are the reason no one ever dealt damage.\n\nNot saying this season is any better. Now there's too much damage, I can agree with you on that. But that doesn't stop tanks from being good. They're not complicated to win with.\n\nYou don't have to be a hashinshin fan to hate tanks. Over half the time I think he's just stupid and biased.","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-03-27T22:10:15.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ApathyAndGrief,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g6%%%kIB,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-27T19:13:47.094+0000)\n>\n> Tanks are viable.

Let’s look and see when we find the first tank that isn’t relegated to support stun bot, in plat + because that’s when players start to become considered “good at the game”. \n\nOh. We got #26 rammus. Who’s is only good during ad meta’s. Go figure. Look what we are in. \n\nAnd oh look. The next one is all the way down at 98. Being maokai. \n\nSo out of 148 champions ever tank besides rammus falls into the bottom 25% of champions. But tanks are fine?\n\nAs for tanks are boring. That is entirely subjective. YOU may not like tanks, but a decent chunk of people actually do. :/ I fucking despise assassins, does that mean all assassins need to be worthless?\n\nAnd yeah. Tanks have counterpicks. Except litteraly EVERYTHING is a counter pick to tanks now. :/ everything has stupid amounts of %pen, %hp damage, true damage or some ungodly mixture of the three.","replies":[{"poster":"ApathyAndGrief","date":"2019-03-27T22:42:08.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except litteraly EVERYTHING is a counter pick to tanks now. :/  \n\n\nIf you live with that mindset, you should probably consider quitting tanks, then. \n\nI don't why you're looking at ranked stats, since you don't even play ranked at all.

But tanks aren’t being countered?\n\nBlack Cleaver had a whopping 6% of it's original Armor pen removed, not to mention, have you actually seen full tank builds actually take damage from Black Cleaver? They really don't. By late game they should have over 300 armor, and they still would have a good 220 armor left after a Black Cleaver proc. You can't convince anyone that item is anywhere near strong.\n\nAlmost no one builds the last whisper items. And when they do, it's hard to even tell a difference against tanks.\n\nIf you think Conqueror is actually good anymore vs tanks, you forgot to build your thornmail, bud.\n\nRageblade is only ever gonna be built on bursty skirmishers, which aren't always around every match {{champion:11}} {{champion:24}} These champs aren't seen that often if you simply ban them. \n\nOnly the ap items you mentioned are really good against tanks. Unless the entire enemy team just builds full on penetration, you REALLY don't need to worry about it. \n\n\n{{item:3075}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3047}} Say \"Fuck you\" to adcs and Assassins\n\n{{item:3065}} {{item:3194}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3111}} Keeps mages from being relevant till late game.
