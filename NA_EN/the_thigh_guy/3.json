Jhin doesn't gain attack speed from other than level increases, but it's converted into other offensive stats, so he's not an example of that. I don't really see an ADC being planned like that, but perhaps something like Galio might have sort of fit into a niche like that if he wasn't hot garbage in every way. A tank that's actually required to build defensively, and all AP/AD gets converted to MR/armor. Jax sort of has that, but only during his ult, and it's bonus armor, so that's not it. I mean a tank that literally cannot pull a Malphite and jam six wizard hats on his head to one-shot people. Such a champion would need some sort of decent offensive stats to actually be a threat. Mundo is another \"close but no cigar\" - he can build AP and AD, but if he wants to build offensively he's better off with mpen.\n\nRiot is doing the best they can to force Pyke into building AD assassin items, going bot lane, and supporting. It's more or less working, but it's showing some signs of strain.\n\nAnyway, the point is that Pyke's grey health is his entire defensive capability on a squishy melee support.

Jhin doesn't gain attack speed from other than level increases, but it's converted into other offensive stats, so he's not an example of that. I don't really see an ADC being planned like that, but perhaps something like Galio might have sort of fit into a niche like that if he wasn't hot garbage in every way. A tank that's actually required to build defensively, and all AP/AD gets converted to MR/armor. Jax sort of has that, but only during his ult, and it's bonus armor, so that's not it. I mean a tank that literally cannot pull a Malphite and jam six wizard hats on his head to one-shot people. Such a champion would need some sort of decent offensive stats to actually be a threat.

The only delusion here is thinking that a melee support should lose the one tool they have to survive against two enemies, at least one of which will probably be ranged. It's about as intelligent as suggesting that Garen's passive should have an \"actual cost\" of slowing him by 90% while he regenerates.
