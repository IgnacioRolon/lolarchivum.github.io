You labled dmg than you labeled double crit which is dmg then you labeled low cooldowns which falls under more dmg and mobility. You left out that morde's ability provides the cc where as yasuo's ability is conditional cc on his 3rd Q so lets adjust that. Now lets take a look at base stats morde has 50 more hp at level 1 than yasuo scaling up to 100 hp at level 18. He has more ad than yasuo by 1 scaling up to 15 at level 18. Yasuo has more attack speed by .05 and scales better by 25%. Morde starts off with 7 more armor than yasuo and yasuo scales to be just shy of morde at level 18. Morde also starts with 2 more magic resist that scales at the same rate as yasuo. \n\nImmunity from ranged anything -Lux lasers velkoz lasers lucian Q. Oh btw this only lasts for 4 seconds on a 26 second cooldown so for 22 seconds hes not immune to ranged attacks but i guess that means he's still immune.

You labled dmg than you labeled double crit which is dmg then you labeled low cooldowns which falls under more dmg and mobility. You left out that morde's ability provides the cc where as yasuo's ability is conditional cc on his 3rd Q so lets adjust that. Now lets take a look at base stats morde has 50 more hp at level 1 than yasuo scaling up to 100 hp at level 18. He has more ad than yasuo by 1 scaling up to 15 at level 18. Yasuo has more attack speed by .05 and scales better by 25%. Morde starts off with 7 more armor than yasuo and yasuo scales to be just shy of morde at level 18. Morde also starts with 2 more magic resist that scales at the same rate as yasuo. \n> \n> Immunity from ranged anything -Lux lasers velkoz lasers lucian Q. Oh btw this only lasts for 4 seconds on a 26 second cooldown so for 22 seconds hes not immune to ranged attacks but i guess that means he's still immune.

Not outside forces. \n\nAnd so what if it requires you to be in melee on a MELEE champion. It’s his fucking kit. \n\nThe only “condition” is that he uses it. \n\nMordes ult is suddenly conditional cc. Because he has to press r. And you know. It’s right under the 5 key and if he gets really confused he might accidentally alt f4 out of the game. \nThat’s the kind of definition of “conditional” you seem to be operating under.","replies":[{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-06-25T21:04:15.990+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you dash too far forward it can be missed (so dashing when your in the face of your target).\n\nAnd when did i say it wasnt hit kit? I said it can be missed meaning its not point and click. If veigar clicks R on you and you flash you're still gonna get hit by it. \n\nYou obviously dont understand what conditional means so lets go back to basics. Ill treat you like a preschooler. Theres abilities that can be cast instantly and abilities that need certain conditions to take effect. Vayne's W for example, no matter what the hell you choose to do you arent gonna proc with it with 1 auto only. She has to auto multiple times, again this is a condition. Unlike all of morde's abilities which are just clicked and used. you can make the claim his E is conditional cc but his R is point and click. Since you dont understand this yasuo's tornado is on his 3rd Q. which means he has to stack it either during the fight or prior to the fight and each Q has to be within 4 seconds of the prior Q. Are you seeing where the condition comes from now? Or are you just gonna bitch and cry that you didnt want to use logic in your post.","replies":[{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-06-25T21:30:10.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Again that doesnt imply that ability knocks up every time on his Q it only knocks up on his 3rd Q. Back to the vayne example shes supposed to auto attack does that mean her W has no condition to it? No she still needs to auto a target 3 times to get the proc in most cases (rageblade and her E change that case), but again condition. If met they get the extra benefit of the ability. Why do you refuse to listen to any reason and just sit on your own one way street?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Light Burner","date":"2019-06-25T21:22:22.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Conditional knockup was meant he had to stack to the 3rd Q before hes able to get a knockup. He doesnt get the knockup on demand. \n\nLook im not gonna sit here and play this game with you. You can nitpick all you want, Morde is overloaded and they need to gut some of that control he has over his entire kit. Im not gonna keep up this petty debate because you cant understand wording.\n\nEDIT: I even stated it in the first post \"You left out that morde's ability provides the cc where as yasuo's ability is conditional cc on his 3rd Q so lets adjust that.\" If you can't read just say it but stop arguing stupid shit, im actually done responding to you.
