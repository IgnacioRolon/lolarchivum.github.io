Sometimes I had to dig around but I'd often find it.  What I would ALSO often find was servers playing \"instagib\".  Personally, I HATE \"instagib\".  It's basically a frenetic \"watch us all blow up as often as possible\" game mode and is a completely unfun, waste of time gamemode... to ME.  But the existence of these servers proved there are people that like and WANT this mode.  Riot should allow for segregating at LEAST these two groups:\n1.

He's as washed up as Tobias Fate and imaqtpie.\n\nlow eq player in op.gg plays Annie for 60%+ of his games and sits at Challenger at 400+ lp. KuvoNA also sits higher than Annie Bot. Both are significantly better Annies. Annie Bot consitently loses to LL Stylish, supposedly the Zed god (he isn't, Laceration is a consistently higher ranked Zed and so is Zaion). Annie Bot loses to Chapanya, loses to KatEvolved, gest stomped by Heisendong's Heimerdinger. He basically loses mid lane more often than not and if he does well at all is because the other lanes do well and he gets to roam with them.\n\nAnd the only games they do well in as Annie is games where they get babysat by the jungler so they can farm and maybe get a kill, otherwise they get shoved under turret and poked out of lane and quickly become irrelevant in the game as they fall way behind in CS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthevv","date":"2019-03-11T11:42:41.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you aren't upgrading to mejais then dark seal isn't really risky.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lazersnaw","date":"2019-03-09T22:24:38.900+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Doesn't look like they are changing anything on the pbe so lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hashimotos","date":"2019-03-09T23:20:28.535+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Luden's is just awful design in general, rewarding players who brainlessly spam for missing.
