And It seemed like I did. But now tonight I experienced it again while playing with my friends. The thing is, my FPS is dropping from 50--60 to anywhere between 7 and 20 but it only happens when I have discord open in the background. This is extremely frustrating since I enjoy being able to talk to my friends while I play, but I can't do it now or else the game becomes literally unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-08T01:50:53.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you said you already hit the points in our fps guide, we can rule out those possibilities. It definitely sounds like discord is sucking up all of your pc's resources though. This might be caused by an overlay discord is using. \n\nMy best suggestion would be to try turning that discord overlay off, which you can find out how to do so [**here**](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217659737-Games-Overlay-101).","replies":[{"poster":"GiveMeUrMilk","date":"2017-04-08T02:18:34.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems to have fixed the problem.
