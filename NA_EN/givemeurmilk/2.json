With the exception of ONE champion I barely, if ever play the champions for the skins it gave me. In fact I think I have played TF, Leblanc, and Kassadin no more than 5 times this season, definitely no more than 10. Is it broken or has it displayed everything exactly as supposed to? Because if so i'm really disappointed with it.\r\n\r\nSo how does it calculate what skins to show me? I was really excited to see it come back, but as it stands now I'm pretty dissapointed and I don't think i'll be purchasing any of the deals it gave me.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-19T04:31:16.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While those sales do still have an element of RNG to them, the \"Your Shop\" sales are decided mostly based on what type of champions you play the most. If that role is a mage, you're going to see more mage archetype sales.","replies":[{"poster":"AngelOfHell90","date":"2017-05-20T16:25:58.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nI had a really bad experience with the support regarding to the \"my Shop\" and they told me that what you said didn't count to me as a player because I am from EUW and not from NA.\nI am unsatisfied with the person who saw my ticket isn't there a way to let someone else check my ticket instead of him?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-20T21:00:44.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh gosh, sorry about that confusion. EUW players are more than welcome to post and look for information here on the NA boards!\n\nWhile that agent de-railed a bit by focusing on the fact that you were posting on NA rather than your own region (which is fine), allow me to clear that up a little bit more. \n\nThose \"Your Shop\" sales attempt to give you skins based on what champions or roles you play. However, there is still an element of randomness involved. Also, if you own most of the skins for your favorite champions again, then there's a *much* lower chance of getting skins for that champion. I hope that clears things up a little more ^_^!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
