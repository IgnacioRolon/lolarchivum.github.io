I hit play select my gamemode and get into queue. I hit accept, and i hear the sound of it going through. Then my client goes dark. It blackens like it does when it transitions you into lobby. Except I never make it into lobby. The client doesn't respond at all, and the only way to fix it is to close league with Task Manager. \r\n\r\nBecause of this bug, I'm currently unable to play because I'm sitting on yet another 30 min wait timer. The worst thing is is that this doesn't happen every time. I have been able to play league,and when I do, the only complaint I have is how long it takes the post game screen to load. But when this does happen, I'm completely unable to play. I love league and want to be able to keep playing with my friends everyday. But this infuriating bug is irritating me to no end. It didn't happen with my old computer. It only started when I played on this one, but the hardware on this one is slightly better than my old one,so I have no clue what the issue us.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T03:26:40.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm do me a favor and try turning on the low-spec mode in the client settings to see if disabling some of those background animations can help stop that weird black freezing that's going on. If that doesn't help, go ahead and run a quick repair to test that as well.","replies":[{"poster":"GiveMeUrMilk","date":"2017-12-01T04:06:16.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Client was already set to low spec mode and to close when in game. I rechecked them. Screen still went black but this time the game actually loaded but I couldnt change my runes. \n\nI just ran a full repair. Got into an aram lobby fine. But then someone dodged and it happened again after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-01T04:13:53.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's a little more strange, it worked fine for one lobby then started right back up after a dodge hmmm.
