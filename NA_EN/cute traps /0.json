Sometimes I love what you do for me (nice jax buff :D), sometimes... you buff Lethality (pls never again).\r\nBut this time, I have to take a stand. i understand that chests are completely random but MY GOD stop with the AD/Supp skins, have mercy on my soul.\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/hpUHv\r\nThus I would like to suggest a bargain (Dormamu) ALL OF THE SKINS HERE for neon strike vi (pls it's only 975rp and it's my favourite skin) this bargain is completely in your favour since you get like a multitude of legacy/legendary skins from me in exchange for a 975rp skin. \r\n(And i get to drop the shades when I gank)\r\nLook i know the chances of this deal actually happening is almost null but it wouldn't hurt to try!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-24T01:16:28.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, yea you've got a nice collection of skin shards there. Sadly I can't really trade skin shards for permanent skins. Since those shards were earned randomly, it doesn't make much sense to trade them for a skin permanent of your choice =\\ .\n\nWith that being said, if you ever find yourself a little bit short of being able to buy that skin, hit me back up and I might be able to boost you a bit for some RP Art ;)!","replies":[{"poster":"Cute Traps ","date":"2017-06-24T01:25:45.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't have to be a skin permanent , it could be a skin shard ^-^. \nahh i'm just kidding (unless a skin shard would work then i'm not).\nyeah sure i'll take you up on that offer if it ever comes to it :D  thanks for the reply!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-24T01:31:21.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries!

If you don't own a lot of champs, you have a decent chance to get Skins for Vi, and at least you're sure to get permanent skins for champs you actually own.\n\nAlternatively, you can just disenchant your shards for orange essence and accumulate essence for when you'll finally get a shard that you're interested in.","replies":[]}]}
