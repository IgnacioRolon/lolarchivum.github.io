Hell even the first prequal which was an abomination had the duel of fates scene. While the force awakens just feels like a retread of old ground. Oh hey look we&#039;re In the desert again, hey look old characters, hey look giant evil lazed that has a very specific weak point, hey look bad guy with a rebreather. Overall it was fun but otherwise if it wasn't Star Wars it would be entirely forgettable.","replies":[]}
