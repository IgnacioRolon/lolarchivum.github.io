As an ADC main i am often stuck with not the most optimal runes such as Resolve. Is anyone else experiencing this bug?\r\nhttps://imgur.com/ryLWlTK","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-16T03:06:07.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHhhhh HACKS! \n\nJk Jk, this is pretty heckin' weird tbh. This might only be some weird visual bug, and I've heard that other players were able to click multiple times on those pages to finally get the double selection to stop. Try double clicking on the one you want, and if that doesn't work click back and forth between the selected pages. Let me know if none of this works so I can try a few more options!","replies":[{"poster":"Carteratops","date":"2017-11-16T22:06:32.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the thing is i can choose the correct rune page by clicking a different one, it will remove the other check mark, but the default one is never the page that i want, like it shows that i have one rune page selected (ex. adc rune with precision) without the drop down menu, but in game i will end up with the other rune page that is also checked shown in the drop down menu (ex. tank rune with resolve), but only when i don't click a rune page. with so it really isn't a huge deal, but i often play the same champions that use the same rune page and don't typically need to change rune pages in between games and i forget that i have the bug resulting in the wrong rune page lol (tl;dr i have to re-select runes every game and if i forget about the bug i end up with wrong runes) please let me know if this doesn't make sense i will try to give a more clear explanation if needed lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Daffmand","date":"2018-03-01T17:47:13.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im having the same bug multiple times a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xiSchizo","date":"2018-02-23T09:30:45.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same bug \nPls fix it","replies":[]},{"poster":"DFO Die Strong","date":"2017-11-21T03:12:32.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had several games where I end up with a seemingly random set of runes and not the one of my presets from champ select.
