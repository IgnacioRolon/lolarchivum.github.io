I always lose where it is in team fights, and it doesn&#039;t help that my mouse keeps freezing so i think the cursor is somewhere else and it takes ages to find the tiny thing. Is there an option to change the size of the cursor, because I looked and couldn&#039;t find one, perhaps I missed it. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-03-19T01:32:54.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly there is not, it pisses off 4K players\n\nThat said, why not just upscale? 1440p is way too big for a laptop, at least for gaming. Kind of silly under a 27 inch monitor is the general opinion. For art/design it makes more sense. Plus you would get more performance, if needed.","replies":[{"poster":"ROFLMAOLOLHAH","date":"2018-03-19T01:44:06.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a shame that there isn't proper scaling for the cursor.

I assume the way some of it is designed resists easy scaling.\n\nThe number of people playing on monitors with really high pixel density is very low, so it is not a priority.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
