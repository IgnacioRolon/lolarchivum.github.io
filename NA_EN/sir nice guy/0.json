I don't want to cultivate an us-vs-them mentality, but **it's us versus them, people!**\n\nWhat I love, is that enemies of Sona may not be able to hear her music, but they'll dance to her tune.  Oh yes, they'll dance...\n\n(Please note I don't actually know if enemies hearing DJ Sona's music is an issue or not.  Hopefully my nonsense posting here will draw the eyes of another Rioter who can actually speak with authority on the subject.

This could inform the enemy that she intends to go in, even if they can't see her yet, and could therefore affect the game in a way normal Sona would not.\n\nIt's extremely minor, and the second example is entirely the Sona player's fault, but the issue is still there.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1HvNiEO.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Nice Guy","date":"2016-08-03T18:20:28.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes a bit of sense.
