We were both very confused and ended up being able to duplicate it again; it seemed that the second part of it (where it comes up like a wall) stopped Xerath's E and made the \"hit\" animation, as opposed to simply just disappearing.\r\n\r\nIs this a known issue?  I was really intrigued when I saw it happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2015-02-05T08:48:42.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good observation! Props for you!
