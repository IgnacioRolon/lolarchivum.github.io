I only Managed to do this with Fire + Fire = Nature And Air + Air = Water.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you first transform you select a form then you get your second transformation and you can see how the previous element isnt blurred out so click it again and watch the Magic.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-06-19T19:52:14.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NOGShadowSpire -\n\nThanks for the report!
