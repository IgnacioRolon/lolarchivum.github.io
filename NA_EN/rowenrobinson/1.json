Over the last few games, about 5 or so, I have played with constant 220 ping(Im from South Africa) so used to it. I am also constantly on Teamspeak so can check my connection stats. I seem to have packet loss ingame, but all my stats on my netgraph and Teamspeak show that my packetloss is at 0%. I also went onto the follow link (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) and uploaded my logs. Over the past 5 games my packetloss has been at average between 15% and 25%. \r\n\r\nI already have everything according to the connection issues guide, so I downloaded and ran the WinMTR using this IP 192.64.170.252 . I uploaded results to this link : http://imgur.com/gallery/B9Vjw .Any assistance would be great.

Seeing anything over 0 in any of those lines means that some very important bits of data are being lost before they get back to your network. Since you're hitting upwards of 24% packet loss, there's definitely an issue somewhere with that connection to our servers. \n\nHit up our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they might be able to help you out, depending on where that packet loss is originating.","replies":[]}]}
