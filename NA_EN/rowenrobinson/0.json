Over the last few games, about 5 or so, I have played with constant 220 ping(Im from South Africa) so used to it.  I am also constantly on Teamspeak so can check my connection stats.  I seem to have packet loss ingame, but all my stats on  my netgraph and Teamspeak show that my packetloss is at 0%.  I also went onto the follow link (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) and uploaded my logs. Over the past 5 games my packetloss has been at average between 15% and 25%.  Any assistance would be great.

Your ISP could have changed how it's routing to the game server, but there could be some more local issues as well causing instability in your network.  My suggestion would be to go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and test it out in a custom game.\n\nIf it persists, run a traceroute to the EUW game server using [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/).  Trace it to 192.64.170.252 and let it run for a few minutes.  This will give us a better overview of where your network is going.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"RowenRobinson","date":"2017-05-07T08:51:19.181+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already had everything according to the connection issues guide, so I downloaded and ran the WinMTR.

It looks like your ISP is having some major issues when you leave your home network and start hopping towards us.  Your ping is worsening each step of the way as you route through your ISP's nodes and finally reach us.  I highly recommend contacting your ISP and showing them these logs.  They'll be able to look into these areas and resolve it, as I'm sure it can impact other folks as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
