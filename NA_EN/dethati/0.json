The timers make it easier for everyone, not just new players. Stagnation is a sign of decline, change on the other hand is the nature of anything that seeks to thrive.

It's not a courtesy, it's the most useful way of spending that particular 10-15 secdons.

Riot themselves specifically said they want to open the game up to off meta picks, and they&#x27;ve been trying to break the meta in bot lane for years.\n\nI can only guess as to their motivations, so don't take this as the absolute truth, but here are my thoughts: The number one factor is that an implementation would get messy. If they state that troll picking is not punished they don't have to worry about giving a hard definition on which champion is ok in which position, they don't have to worry about fringe cases where a given pick might have been off the stated okay list, but still made sense in light of the composition of the two teams, they don't have to worry about people getting punished, appealing and figuring out who did so because they had a legit case and who did so because they just want the punishment reversed. The second reason is that there is a vocal troll picking and troll enabling subcommunity which would be outraged, and they don't intend to deal with that including a potential mass exodus on their part.\n\nAs for Riot's attempts to diversify support, the reason for that is easy enough to guess: most people don't like playing the role. If LoL is a meal they serve, then the support role is the broccoli in it. But if they truly wanted to get rid of the adc-support setup they would have either added an extra lane or made Rift a 4v4 mode. Short of that they don't have many options other than to motivate people to troll by publishing articles saying some champ can be played in a role that it actuality cannot (like when they suggested that Morde might be an ok pick instead of an adc, which luckily didn't catch on or when they published that Brand might be played instead of a support, which sadly did). And simply trying people not to play support is just motivating them to troll, not \"opening the game up to off meta picks\", whatever that means. The reasons behind the valid picks in each role derive from the game intrinsically and without a radical change in the game itself it is impossible to redefine a role.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Davaken","date":"2018-02-27T14:19:47.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda agree in most of what you're saying, especially because even normals feel way too competitive.

That Warwick was trying to take the enemy's blue buff and he wanted me to help him out, but I don't leash as a top laner because then I usually miss the first couple minions and it sets me back for a good portion of the game. At least with bot lane, there's two people leashing so it goes quicker, and usually the ADC will leave earlier so they can get experience or cs that they could potentially miss. And I'm certainly not leashing if he's gonna be in the enemy's jungle because then the top laner would see me coming from the river and know that I was there, and if I try to avoid being seen by the enemy top laner, then I'm going to miss experience anyways.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Great Duck","date":"2018-02-27T08:41:13.467+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lmao, the community?

You have no idea how he communicates in game.\n\nFirst of all, if he consistently picks so badly that he gets negative feedback so much that he decides to quit all together, he wasn't just picking things that were weak on the current patch, he was picking champions whose kits weren't viable in the role he got. That's the difference between okay off-meta and troll picking.\n\nSecondly, you cannot possibly try to defend picking Teemo instead of a support while at the same time saying you _carried_ with it. If you find yourself carrying with a \"support\" you clearly haven't done your job as one.\n\nThirdly, this game is fun when you pick normally, gaining some perverse extra satisfaction from screwing with your teammates just marks you as unfit to be part of a team.\n\nFinally, I don't decide what's okay and what's not, I don't have some set of weird personal ideals about what works and what not that I want other people to conform to. Each position has established duties on the team. Not by me, but by the almost a decade's worth of collective experience of the whole community.

I disagree. First of all, if it's a ranked game you dodge. Either way you will be a hinderence to your team, and it's your responsibility that you don't end up that. If it's a normal game you can still dodge if you want. Or you can play and practice the viable one, so that in further games you don't end up dragging your team down. Because, as I said, if you don't have a viable champion you have practice with then you will hold your team back. Which if fine if you are practicing something new in normals, but if you systemically opt to hinder your team on account of \"might as well\", then if not for that particular game, but over the many games you will play in that role, you are dicking your teams over.\n\n> It&#x27;s normals, if you&#x27;re not doing what&#x27;s fun for you you&#x27;re doing it wrong.

It doesn't matter if your primary motivation is something other than to harm your team. Something can be intentional and incindental at the same time. What matters is: did you do it and were you aware of the consequences ahead of time. The reasons for your action are your own, and are frankly irrelevant beyond these two considerations.\n\n> You do need to consider comp, and sometimes off-meta can fit into a comp just fine.

Case in point, for a while they took MF on one meta as a counterpick to Zyra in the LCS. And some brain dead autofills took that to mean \"Look, MF is now a support.\" LCS teams can form strategies and tactics that best serve them to beat other LCS teams over time. In solo queue there is not much time to change the established strategy if a team wants to do so, and it certainly cannot be done on the unilateral whim of just 1 person.\n\n> I&#x27;ll just reiterate that you need a larger perspective on the workings of the game and the champions within it.

The point of an adc on the team is to output sustained damage in fights and to deal damage to turrets when sieging. If the team decides to offload these responsibilities to another team member, then that's their choice. When a single play decides the would rather play Ziggs and locks it in without considering how this makes the comp lacking, that's trolling.\n\n> B) In solo q it really is about how you want to practice/enjoy the game, other people don&#x27;t get to dictate how you play beyond asking that you try to actually win.

With no cs-ing gold a support doesn't have the money to stay relevant with damaging abilities. A \"kill lane\" support only works with adcs where the player's play style and his champion both allow for that strategy, it's something you can do when playing with somebody that you know and go in with that strategy in mind to begin with, but it's not something you can arbitrarily do when playing with strangers. And even if you have a partner and pull off a magnificent laning phase, the falling off problem still applies, so you have to get your adc so fed that it will counterbalance that. And every champion have been played in every role, so pointing out how it has been done doesn't support the case that it's okay to do it. Genocide has been done, still not okay.\n\n> \n> The reality is that theres a lot more &quot;wiggle room&quot; than youre trying to argue, and unless youre playing in the LCS the pure optimal play is not relevant to the discussion, as that really only adds consistency, which is irrelevant to soloqueue.\n\nI'm not talking \"pure optimal\", never said I was.

In reality, an ADCs only real job is to survive. If you wanted a major teamfighting role, anything other than an assassin would have a better teamfight impact than an ADC. An ADC's only \"job\" is to kill towers and barons. Their job in a teamfight is to stay alive and deal whatever damage they can without dying. An ADCs job is to end the game while enemies are dead. Defense trumps offense in LoL every time, so you put all the damage onto 1 champ who can live and have them kill towers and barons.\n\nYi, Trynd, and Yasuo are all melee ADCs. The idea that \"only ranged\" can do the job of an ADC is a flat out lie.\n\nA junglers job does not include ganking. Ganking is a benefit, not all junglers gank. Nunu and Yi are effective junglers, and neither are known for their top tier ganks.\n\nA kill lane support often doesnt need their ADC to actually kill a target. Supports dictate early game and have the majority of the early game damage, and i guarantee you a brand will 100-0 someone just fine without ADC help.\n\nAs long as you arent playing AP garen, literally everything is viable until D1.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GôdÌy","date":"2018-02-27T02:59:57.353+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bye!","replies":[]}]}
