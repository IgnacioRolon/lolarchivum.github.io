He&#039;s only got the two skins that are &#039;modern&#039; looking (Cursed Revenant and Eternum), and I was just curious if he might get looked at for some small-scope visual work. Sort of like Morgana did last year?","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-10-11T15:26:28.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that while he's not a high priority for a VGU today he likely will be sometime in the future.","replies":[]}]}
