You can even take {{summoner:14}}  too.\r\nThere are a few more champs that i know who have innate healing, but i feel these are the ones i feel are most complained about.\r\nAlso one last thing. Even a Support can build one of these items. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading and i hope you all do well in your games.","replies":[{"poster":"5050BS","date":"2019-10-24T22:01:07.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yasuo out heals all of those without having healing in his Kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Doge2020","date":"2019-10-24T23:03:47.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However that requires an item.

Correct me if I am wrong, but grevious wounds is applied after the life-steal/healing is calculated.\n\nSo if a crit heals a champion for 200 hp (after crit modifiers, life-steal, heal power, etc), then grevious wounds (40%) is applied to reduce that heal to 120 hp.\n\nCrit’s don’t make life-steal a net positive against grevious wounds. If anything it makes grevious wounds even more effective because now that damage increase from the crit makes the percentage reduction take more from the heal than before.\nThe only time crit champs with life-steal are at a significant net positive gain is when the other team stupidly don’t have any grevious wounds items or they don’t deal enough burst damage to kill the champ before he/she can lifesteal.\n\nIf you want to argue more I’m currently doing the math to provide more evidence. I am also willing to calculate the net gain of health from a crit with life-steal onto a tank with thornmail.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2019-10-24T21:33:20.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"PSA: unless you're constantly trading with vlad, in which case straight up damage is often better, buying GW vs him is actually kind of a trap. \n\nFocusing more on damage/core itemization often lets you bully harder.\n\nVlad is not played as he was intended currently.
