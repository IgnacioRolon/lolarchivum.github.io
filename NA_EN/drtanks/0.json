It&#039;s really discouraging me to press &quot;play again&quot; cause it just feels like I&#039;m signing up for another beatdown. \r\n\r\nEven my last game I played ADC for the first time in at least 4 months and it was pretty fun. I was thinking &quot;wow I might finally win a game today&quot;, and then the enemy makes a comeback, takes a few good team fights in a row and we lose. \r\n\r\nI was hoping to practice before playing my ranked placement matches but now I just have zero motivation to play them. Anyone else ever feel like this?","replies":[]}
