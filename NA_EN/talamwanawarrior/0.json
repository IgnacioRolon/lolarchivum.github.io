Lets show the boards how I was wrong in the situations where self-defense is not regarded as a honored trait in today society, but we should just roll over and let Mr.Rito handle these situation, seeing as how well thats worked all these years. I am looking forward to the community&#039;s responses to this chat log I was reported on from the last game I&#039;ve played. Like i said, this should be good.","replies":[]}
