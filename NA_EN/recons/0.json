Regardless, tbh I'm not even sure I know where Ionia sits exactly, how far from the coast I mean. I would need to know how fast a Runeterran boat moves to make maps to scale, since a lot of the measurements are like... 5 days on boat or 1 day on boat. \n\nI also didn't add Bilgewater... very innacurate, but it's a concept.\n\nThank for your response!","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-07-19T20:30:07.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you send a link again like using https://megg.ml/ instead of imgur. imgur is not responding in my country at the moment so please send a link cause i want to see what you've draw :(","replies":[{"poster":"Recons","date":"2017-07-20T00:47:35.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.megg.ml/i/381469ce0daf0f666557ea6ed41d6731.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Killaburn","date":"2017-07-20T03:48:32.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro i cannot really zoom/see it perfectly cause imgur cannot be reach in my browser. please use https://megg.ml/ so i can see it clearly. look when click it\n\nhttps://megg.ml/i/9830f5c21d5e90d53b142424913051c2.PNG","replies":[{"poster":"Recons","date":"2017-07-20T12:49:27.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is on megg.ml...

Now that i double checked the link and see it clearly; I think you did a great job :D I like the names that you've come up with and you've stick true to the lore. I hope that you could do it too with ionia too. Like make 2 plates together that form/make ionia that it is today(as in my map lol) maybe the other plate is the left side and vice versa because they are separated by a big river( or Epool river in my map) and it should create a diversity to the land of runaterra. BTW, i like what you did to the targoninan plate. It is in between two plates and its like colliding with it forming a great mountain like india as to asia which formed the himalaayas :D nice job.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2017-07-19T19:17:38.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Killaburn,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ORoM4cHP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-19T15:59:08.443+0000)\n>\n> https://megg.ml/\n\nOr 0bin.net","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mkyner","date":"2017-07-20T14:36:48.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really cool. I like all the mountains on the Targonian Plate - it gives some rationale for why the middle part, south of the Vestigial Plate, would be a giant desert. \n\nA recommendation: drop the Vestigial Plate. Rather, have a mid-ocean ridge run down the middle of that sea. That ridge would then be the dividing line between the two plates. Long ago, the Targonian and Valoran plates would have been connected, but they split apart, forming that ocean. For comparison, see the Red Sea or Atlantic Ocean on Earth. Now, I imagine the Rune Wars or some other magic-related catastrophe might have accelerated that process, which would have been really traumatic for the people living on that side of Runeterra. \n\nHave you looked at wind patterns or ocean currents yet?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlameHalbrdOkido","date":"2017-07-20T04:16:29.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that map was outdated?","replies":[]}]}
