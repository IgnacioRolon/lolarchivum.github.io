The time it would take it would be equal to \ninfinity, so we will never manage to catch up with (momentSecond).\n\n**BONUS:**\n\nIf the world has an end, why can&#039;t we see it then ?\n\nOur planet taught us a lesson over the years, some people before us thought our planet have an end\nother that you can walk forever and never reach an end.\n\nWell they were both right.\n\nWhat if the cicle continue what if our universe is another version of our planet ? (You get what I mean)[I hope]\n\nIf it&#039;s eventually possible to reach the place you started from with space ship then the size of our univer&#039;s core\nshould be a FIXEDSIZE which is kinda ..... hard to believe.\n\nSo I came up with a idea from one Simpsons episode intro where camera goes through Homer&#039;s nose\nand get smaller and smaller until it reaches sub atom level then all the sudden the sub entities start being shaped\nlike planets camera keeps getting smaller and smaller until eventually reaches it&#039;s very first size.\n\nWould that mean that if I grow like 200% mil second I&#039;ll eventually be smaller than you ?\n\n#underShowerThoughts","replies":[]}
