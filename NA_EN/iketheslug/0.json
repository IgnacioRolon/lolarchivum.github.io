This results in you pretty much getting locked out of league of legends whenever you try to enter a game. \n\nWhile I do want riot to make a 64-bit game client for macOS to solve this, I can understand why they might not, given how costly and time-consuming it is and how messy it&#039;s going to be to cross a 64-bit and 32-bit game client.\n\nIs there still hope that they will fix this problem though? I still want to keep league around {{sticker:cass-cry}}\n\nEDIT: Here's the error logs.\nhttps://imgur.com/xMxE6Ju","replies":[{"poster":"Craktite","date":"2018-12-09T17:57:44.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try avoid that update until a solution is found :/","replies":[{"poster":"IketheSlug","date":"2018-12-09T18:14:26.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess... but I feel like they'll still force the update anways :'(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2018-12-09T17:58:46.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They stopped supporting floppies, Flash, and the microphone jack while those technologies were still in wide use, but that doesn't even compare to how many 32-bit programs are still around.
