While i&#039;m trying to play league of legends. My client will go black causing me to not be able to pick a champ. I know you guys are doing updates right now but it&#039;s caused me to have to wait 30 mins now because i cant help but get the penalty for dodging even though its not my fault! Even after i get kicked because of this i can&#039;t continue to play the game until i close the client. Can you guys do something like maybe even get rid of the penalty for dodging at the moment. I don;t want my game time wasted due to the wait times.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-14T21:52:13.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey notrunescape,\n\nThank you for the report! We're aware of this issue and are investigating!","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-01-14T22:14:26.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi KateyKhaos,\n\nOn the pbe myself and the other testers found a few useful things one can do during select to cope with the bug:\n\n1. One thing you can do is press tab until you get to the chat box in order to tell your team what happened.\n2. If you manage to get into a game that's not blurred yet make sure you pick your champ before clicking ANYTHING else.\n3. Change masteries second (they bug out less).\n4. IMPORTANT: Change a summoner spell last; you only get to change ONE so pick carefully.\n5. It will bug upon pressing the box.\n6. The screen will then blur, but at least you'll get into the game.\n7. You'll need to restart the client to reset it after the game though, end game screen will be blurry too (I think you can tab to chat here too; not sure).\n\nI'm passing you this info in the hopes it can help people avoid the leaver penalties >.<'\n\n-LostFr0st","replies":[]}]}]}
