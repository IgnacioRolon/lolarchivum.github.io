I ended my season in Diamond 4.  I was just curious because when reading ranked changes for 2017 Riot said that this year was going to be a \"soft reset\", now I'm wondering how this is a soft reset? Also is this what I should expect out of Season 7 placements? Go even or break even in a win loss ratio and drop 2 Tiers? \r\n\r\nI don't know, just doesn't seem like a soft reset to me, thoughts anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T04:43:46.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is simply the preseason, so placing in a lower Ranked Tier than in Season 6 is fairly par for the course. Yes, a soft reset will occur in the future, but I don't have a date on when that will occur. The new ranked season is expected to start on December 7th, according to [this page.](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Hock","date":"2016-11-15T10:47:49.262+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's preseason, I was just curious because I'm seeing friends who are Dia 3 who go 5-5 and get place Plat 1 and Masters friends who go 5-5 and get placed Silver 5. Just worried because in the notes it says, these games and placements will affect our placements in season 7.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T22:26:10.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have a *minimal impact* on your placements during the beginning of the season. They will not be a huge defining factor as far as I know,  and I'd imagine your performance in your actual placement matches when the season starts will play a much larger role in where you place.","replies":[{"poster":"tzvi","date":"2016-12-13T03:24:29.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well this seemed like a really hard reset to me. what is riots goal in making plats play with silvers? it just causes a few months of super unbalanced games were the best strategy is to focus the person who was silver 3 last season. why have a reset at all? there is already timed degradation if you don't play, and if you play and are at a position you don't belong then you will eventually get demoted. what is the purpose of this extra chaos?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Matt2423","date":"2016-11-15T15:37:56.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the biggest reasons ppl are upset with resets uis because Riot refuses to share their placement and match formulas.\nIf people knew how the systems worked, it wouldn't feel so arbitrary.","replies":[]}]}
