It was just few sailor moon skins, that&#039;s all&quot;. And now instead of getting the long time waited &quot;pool party - Katarina/Riven/Darius&quot; and &quot;Lifeguard - Ahri/Urgot&quot;, we get a special &quot;Summer&quot; event and a &quot;Summer&quot; skin collection, known as the anime Sailor moon... Oh sorry, I mean Star Guardian skins... And before that we had Kyan or whatever his name, who is some sort of anime fanboy dream. Why is Riot supporting this full anime style? What you make one metal song and you think you&#039;re &quot;oh we&#039;re badarse and we dont do full anime style&quot;... well, sure as a metal/rock fan, the song was fine, but yet it doesn&#039;t defend the fact that the game is going full anime style... It&#039;s mid August... Where are the bloody summer skins? Where&#039;s the summer event? What are you even doing with your lives reading this? Why am I even bothering writing if I know that I&#039;ll either get ignored or get tons of hate comments and downvotes? \r\n\r\nYou know i&#039;m right. Quit denying it, it&#039;s becoming sad to do it all the time.","replies":[]}
