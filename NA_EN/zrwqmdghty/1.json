It&#039;s actually Katarina. It fits her 100%\r\n\r\nArmor.\r\n\r\nImagine Rivens armor, without the helmet/mask part. Add crimson symbols on the armor itself. Put the updated face on Katarina (Slay bella, Kitty Kat ect, cause clearly the default skin will never get the HD face). Add a silver circlet, on the middle put crimson elite crest. Her hair similar to Triss&#039;s alternative outfit hair style (witcher 3), trust me it&#039;s perfect for combat, I got long hair and I&#039;ve tested (rofl) and with her hair it will look just a bit bigger than Triss&#039;s hair.\r\nAdd a crimson cloak with Noxus and the crimson elite symbols on the back. Silver and Crimson. \r\n\r\nHer blades could be the same as the High command skin. (cause they are awesome as fk anyway)\r\n\r\nThen hire her voice actress and add new voice lines.\r\n\r\nTowards Talon : &quot;Been out killing? Good.&quot;\r\n&quot;Report! Nevermind, just go kill some Demacians.&quot;\r\n&quot;Is that blood on your blade? It&#039;s not enough!&quot;\r\n\r\nTowards Riven: &quot;Out crushing enemies? Good.&quot;\r\n&quot;Report! HEY! Careful with that blade!&quot; \r\n&quot;Riven... Your armor is too clean. Get it bloodied! NOW!&quot;\r\n\r\nDefault Taunt: &quot;The crimson elite, is coming for you.&quot;\r\n&quot;A crimson death awaits.&quot;\r\n\r\nDeath lotus kill:\r\n&quot;The crimson lotus has blossomed.&quot;\r\n&quot;The flower of death.&quot;\r\n&quot;Here, have a crimson lotus. Oh you&#039;re dead.&quot;\r\n\r\nShunpo kill:\r\n&quot;You covered me with blood! Eh...&quot; \r\n&quot;Bye! *laugh*&quot;\r\n&quot;One crimson death, coming up.&quot;\r\n\r\nJoke:\r\n&quot;Blood? Where? That&#039;s my hair you fool!&quot;\r\n&quot;Joke? I got a few, with an edge on them.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards Demacians:\r\n&quot;So weak, so dead.&quot;\r\n&quot;Demabla bla bla bla, shut up and die.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards Garen:\r\n&quot; I heard you can count only from 100 to 101, demacian education...&quot;\r\n&quot;Doing naughty things in your bed and blaming your sister, no wonder Demacians gave me the contract.&quot;\r\n &quot;Guess you are holding the world! Before you drop on your head.&quot;\r\n\r\nJokes towards  TEAMMATE Lux:\r\n&quot;I&#039;m sorry to hear what your brother did, Talon does it some times too.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards Lux:\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you ever shut up...&quot;\r\n&quot;Demawhat? Oh, you missed. Oh, you&#039;re dead.&quot;\r\n&quot;Too bright for my tastes... need to shut you down.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt  towards teammate Cassiopea:\r\n&quot;Curse or not, you&#039;re still my sister.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards enemy Cassiopea:\r\n&quot;That power you hold is not worth it Cassio, let me help you.&quot;\r\n&quot;Dammit Cass! We&#039;re sisters, don&#039;t make me do this!&quot;\r\n&quot;Father would be sad to see you like this.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards enemy Noxians: \r\n&quot;No, no, no... Is there at least one Noxian with skill around here?!&quot;\r\n&quot;You call yourself Noxian? Pathetic.&quot;\r\n&quot;Noxus is power. You are weak!&quot;\r\n&quot;Your loyalty is false! DIE!&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards friendly Noxians:\r\n&quot;What are you looking at? Go kill!&quot;\r\n&quot;What just because I&#039;m small you think I&#039;m not strong?&quot;\r\n&quot;You bait, I kill.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards enemy Swain:\r\n&quot;Grand General or not, you&#039;re a traitor.&quot;\r\n&quot;Death is coming for you Swain.&quot;\r\n\r\nKilling Swain.\r\n&quot;The taste of revenge is sweet.&quot;\r\n&quot;Weak traitor.&quot;\r\n&quot;Blood for Noxus!&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards allied Swain:\r\n&quot;I despise you Swain.&quot;\r\n&quot;This doesn&#039;t make us friends.&quot;\r\n&quot;Soon, Swain. Soon.&quot;\r\n\r\nTaunt towards LeBlanc:\r\n&quot;I&#039;m shocked. You&#039;re so far from your new best friend.&quot;\r\n&quot;Go back to your raven, witch.&quot;\r\n&quot;My father would of ended this tyranny, not anymore. You traitor witch.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you say that it&#039;s &quot;too expensive&quot;.\r\nThey spent tons of money to make way more voice lines for Ahri&#039;s skin... There&#039;s literally no issue for this to be achieved too. A majority of the actual Kat fanbase, are asking for a Crimson elite skin from years. Instead they get worthless anime rip offs. \r\nFor the record, the skin should contain new visual effects and finally added blood effects per hit on Katarina&#039;s abilities (just as Yasuo haves on his)","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-11T10:04:38.897+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be a legendary skin if it had new voice lines, so 1850.\n\nOther than that, I don't like the concept and would like a different skin to get the legendary treatment for her.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-10-11T10:28:55.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You don't like the concept which is her original lore concept and all that ? Well nice, lets make more anime skins so you can enjoy the concept then! Right? How about sailor moon ahri! Oh wait, we already got it...

Now take that not Katarina skin which is going to get released and enjoy NOT Playing Katarina, just some rip off with her kit.

I don't like crimson elite skins, they are ugly.\n\nYes, I would like an anime Katarina skin. Skins should either be lore based (like your suggestion), place them in a different story, or just be a truly novel idea.\n\nI don't dislike lore based skins, but I would rather have one from the other two categories.\n\nAnd there are only like 2 or 3 skins cheaper than legendary with additional voice lines and either it is just a couple of lines or it sucks.\n\nJust having the lines added to base Kat would be ok, but I would not buy the skin as you proposed it.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-10-11T13:37:52.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ugly people make clothes ugly.

Yes, Katarina would be hot in just about anything, but I would prefer a better looking skin than crimson elite has proven to be in the past.\n\nAlso, they updated base Lux's lines. I am hoping to see that made more common. What happened with Lux is that they had the VA in for the ultimate skin so they just recorded some additional lines for base Lux while she was there. If they made Kat a legendary or ultimate skin then they could potentially do the same.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-10-11T14:54:47.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont want any more Kat skins cause they just ruin her... The last 2 \"Skins\" are not even Katarina anymore and look disgusting. \nYes Riven is ugly for me and a lot of her skins prove me right, as they are plain ugly... Her buddy is \"sexy\" and \"good\" only cause the bunny outfit itself looks good on nearly any female... Even Rek Sai would look hot in it... Or Gragas... While Talon just looks like a base male, same as Garen. Both got no attractive lines, except the hunky basic lines which you can see in nearly every male... \n\nAnd yet, Crimson Elite is an actual Noxian squad. Which belonged to Katarina's father, so it's logical for her to have a skin where you got the lead after her father's death. There's literally no skin anymore to be made which will make Kat be Kat, except Kat in a bunny suit... but Riot will find a way to make it NOT Kat again. Oh wait... Forgot. Pool Party Skin... Which did not happen, cause clearly Pool Party skins are considered too sexual so they decided to skip them this year. \n\nSo what Katarina skin you suggest, that will make her still be Katarina and not a random ghost or robot borrowing her kit? ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-10-11T15:07:38.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of a skin is to make the character different.

Every skin has every champ in a different outfit (unless you don't count colors on a few of them). Outfits make the character different visually.\n\nI don't understand what you want.

I don't think that changing her hair a bit kills her.\n\nI mean, I can instantly tell it is her by seeing the picture. The parts of the face you can see on project look almost exactly the same imo (on the splash art). The hair on her new skin looks fine imo.\n\nBesides, even if that is your issue you still have Warring Kingdoms, Sandstorm, High Command, Kitty Cat, Bilgewater (although that one makes her hair black, so it might kill her for you), and Red Card.\n\nThe only issue I have with the new skin is the shape of her blades. I think they should have stuck with a curved dagger shape instead of a two edged arming sword shape. Actually, on second look, I might be fine with it with a smaller/nonexistent cross guard.","replies":[{"poster":"zrWQMdGHtY","date":"2017-10-11T17:35:55.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who even spoke about the hair? project is a robot based on the original with small pieces of the orignal aka dead. this new one needs you to be dead and your soul to be enslaved by the reaper.
