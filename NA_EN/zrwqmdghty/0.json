Ugly Project ANime skin now another ugly disgusting anime skin... Was it really that hard to simply make a bloody Pool party skin instead of making ugly anime skins and ruin the mood of people who love/enjoy playing her and all that stuff for years... I am like saving money to buy an awesome Kat skin... instead I get a disgusting &quot;Death Sworn&quot; skin... thanks Rito! Guess i&#039;m saving my money again...\n\nP.S KAtarina has never used high heels, until the death sworn skin line appeared... GJ. We should keep killing her personality more and more every single day! The new team that's working over her kits and skins is amazing! ^_^\n\nEdit: Before thew few randoms who had actually seen my fiction decided to say that I did the same to her in it... No I didnt. Sure it was a \"Spooky\" idea, but it wasnt with such a bad design...\n\nEdit2: Notice the HP Growth buff Katarina gets? Get ready for AP Items nerf next patch. Enjoy it AP mains, that's literally what happens every time. Kat skin + small buff = Nerf on AP items. (points at rylai's major slow nerf) ","replies":[]}
