When you reach two, you can use them to level to the next level mastery.  There are no benefits for receiving more than 2 tokens, so an account won't exceed that limit.  Our [Champion Mastery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204211284-Champion-Mastery-Guide#h1q5) guide can provide some more information, but you're just about ready to level up!
