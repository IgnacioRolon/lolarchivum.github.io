I've passed this feedback to the team that pushes out the patch notes. I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention. ^.^\n\nI saw that you had a few other concerns about other elements in the game being potentially problematic. For consistencies' sake, can you write up a tidy post of all the elements you were concerned about and post it to [*Miscellaneous*](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) where general feedback goes? Once you've done that, can you toss me a link to it in a reply?
