This is about the players and queues.**\r\n\r\nTo start, I&#039;ve had PBE access since kindred&#039;s release on PBE. I never gained honor three+ to get in. Kind of how ironic because the people who recently came into PBE are extremely toxic and completely ruin any experience there is to have.\r\n\r\nI have played a large pool of games (20~) since 8.10 (Marksmen patch) and throughout every game there has been a troll, intentional feeder, or an afk. I try to queue up with as many people as I can now, but it really sucks to watch someone gank your lane, fail, then leave the game. I had a graves and me get doubled then he started inting and said &quot;ff at 15 or I will keep going&quot;. My last game was a hec afk after arguing with darius the entire game. If my team doesn&#039;t troll, the other team gets trolled.\r\n\r\nPeople can put hate speech into their name and not get (someone I saw a few games this week had **_kys_** in it. I&#039;ve seen the hard er in names as well. People can say what they want in all chat, as every game is just arguing or hate speech (I&#039;ve ended up talking back in a few games too, but not to the point of using slurs or bad messages). \r\n\r\nAnd the best part is how no one gets punished. I reported the graves, haven&#039;t seen any feedback message so it looks like he&#039;s going to keep playing, dying once and inting. No player with &quot;kys&quot; or N*gg*r in their name is getting punished. Please bump up your system to actually punish players.\r\n\r\nI love the privilege to play PBE so much, I always have, but I can&#039;t help but question what the honor system actually does. Is it most region&#039;s honor players still being toxic or is honor a complete waste to show display of character in league?","replies":[{"poster":"WawerRewold","date":"2018-05-05T13:56:30.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just PBE its basiacaly sand with kids playing around what did you expect? Its for testing so go and test do some crazy things and mute your teammates. Honestly i have never had a game where no one went afk so far.","replies":[{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2018-05-07T16:40:35.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It didn't used to be, that's the problem; sure it wasn't a big player base to begin with but those there took it seriously. Ever since they 'opened the floodgates' for beta applications, it's degraded drastically; we wanted the pbe to be taken seriously, not gain less serious players. This self-defeatist handling (ask anyone who mained dominion) has contributed to the game falling; 'we don't get good data from pbe, lets add a bunch of dishonorable people, that'll fix it'.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-05-05T13:59:34.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because this honor system is pure bullshit. You get reported for having a bad game, but get honored for hard-carrying while calling your team trash.
