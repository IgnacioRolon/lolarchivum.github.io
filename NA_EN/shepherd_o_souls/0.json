Urgency on that feels high enough at this point we don&#039;t think we should wait another patch. Most likely changes (still being discussed) are increasing the CD again and lowering the AD on it. Possible whatever changes are made will be temporary as well if the conclusion during 7.5 development is a different nerf is better long term.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-21T12:21:41.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most people that complain on the forums don't look at patch notes or realize anything bout the game until they experience it.\n\nHence most people the complain about teemo, only complain because they lost to one. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-02-21T13:19:07.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That comment of riot makes me want to make another comment about actually nerfing the item and not just a minor hotfix to it.

Replacing CD with AD is balancing if lets say 20 AD was reduced fro 10% CD. That will hardly make any difference to the item whilst CD is not bad in itself.

I think it's common sense to know they wouldn't give it 10% cdr because that would involve giving the item a CDR component with no testing done to and sending it live.","replies":[]}]}]}
