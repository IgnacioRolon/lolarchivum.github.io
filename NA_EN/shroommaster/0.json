Mages should not double over as supports.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nOnce champions have a defined archetype, you can begin balancing those archetypes around items that have archetype-specific stats so that other archetypes cannot find ways to exploit them for their unintended purposes, I.E. when ADC's kept building Frost Mallets back when it was introduced even though it was supposed to help bruisers stick to people that were kiting them out and it ended up making it worse.\n\nArchetypes should also have an identity that they fill on the team.\n\nTanks should be meatballs with tons of CC that force members on the other team to pay attention to them.\nMages should be AoE burst bots.\nAssassins should be single target burst bots.\nADC's should be sustained damage bots.\nSupports should be healers/shields/buffers/debuffers.   I honestly don't think it's very good design that a lot of supports have more CC than tanks.\nEtc...\n\nProblems like tanks building damage items usually end up fucking up balance again.   Tanks should never be easy to kill quickly.  The upside to that is that tanks should never be able to kill anyone else quickly.  Their power SHOULD come from their ability to force you to engage them while their team mates kill you.  But with itemization and open-ended customization for builds the way it is, you get Cho's that just one-shot carries or you have % HP true damage on carries so none of the core identities are pushed through in practical gameplay.\n\nJust my opinion, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Power Cosmic","date":"2018-11-11T22:53:25.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, sort of.

Another good example of a balanced champ with a lot of tools is {{champion:497}} bc he has little damage, while {{champion:266}} has every trait covered while also being able to carry is woefully overloaded and unbalanced.  The champs that pretty much just do just damage and are riskier should be the definitive late game damage champs along with a handful of marksmen.

When you look at Irelia you either make her useless by nerfing her numbers or she's just going to own everyone because she can do too much.\n\nThis is easily balanced if you pick a design for a champion and balance it around it.

And has they naturally don't really have ways to lower damage, just buying punny defensive items won't help them one bit. Otherwise, you could buy those punny defensive items and survive as well.\n\nDo you see the huge black box in your argument around which you need to do mental gymnastics to avoid and get to your conclusion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Biggest MO3 Fan","date":"2018-11-11T19:49:21.616+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I agree , but people do forget and tend to ignore this.

I mean every champ has at least one or 2 but Riot thinks if you have only one you should get mega burst dmg with multiple passives {{champion:142}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:90}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MultiLunchBox","date":"2018-11-11T11:46:24.314+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"thats why games end in 20min. its easy to feed with that high damage one shot gameplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lovelle","date":"2019-02-17T18:18:56.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think the lack of variety when it comes to game modes is worse.","replies":[]}]}
