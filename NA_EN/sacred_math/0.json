Like provide AD and AP scalings for all champs or do it for none. Thats why gunblade \n and rageblade are good on like less than 10 champs. If trydamere can have AP scalings why cant Ekko have AD scalings. it drives me nuts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BLIGHTBRINGER","date":"2018-10-10T18:33:06.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish there was better hybrid items too, it's very lacking.\n\n{{item:3148}} {{item:3124}} \nSomething that came to mind, it would be awesome if {{item:3085}} bolt damage was adaptive, instead of physical by default.
