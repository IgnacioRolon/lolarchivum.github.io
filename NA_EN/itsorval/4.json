A Singed player will usually farm and try to dive whenever you are low and try to trade kills. If he ends up proxy farming just ignore it and farm under your tower. Choose champions that can clear waves easily or farm quickly like graves, irelia, or even vayne top would be good against singed actually. Any ranged champions will give him a hard time","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-11-22T16:13:24.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing Kayle last game, and I was farming under tower. About 10 minutes in game hed just tower dive me, throw me over, and Vi would kill me with her ult.

Always ward your top jungle because he will most likely farm behind your own tower and also champions like vi will usually come from behind and just press r. Since singed players will usually just try to get the tower focus on getting objectives on other parts of the map since kayle ult is good for teamfights. The thing I have learned from good and bad kayle players is that usually the bad ones will stay top the entire game and use their ult for only themselves and good ones will move around the map with the team and ult to save team members from trading kills.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-11-22T16:45:56.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, is i will save ult for team mates, but they dont do anything with it.

You're playing checkers, he's playing chess; he's not really here to win the lane, he's here to tick you off, tick your friends off, reach through the screen and tick your pets and parents off, and just generally take the fact that you want to beat him and make it hellish. If he \"loses\" lane, he'll split-push anyway and take far too long to kill once you catch him; if he doesn't, he just set you back so that you're even more useless in a fight than he is. He's the Nunu of top lane, and he likes your hopes and dreams shaken, not stirred.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-11-22T16:11:57.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then what am I supposed to do?

Your jungler can counter-gank, as long as he/she doesn't chase Singed, but would be just as well off or better trying to get someone else fed. Again, Singed is annoying and hard to kill, but he's going to have a hard time in team fights even if he's fed. He's a pest, not a game-winner.\n\nThe ultimate counter to Singed is just **winning the game at hand**, because if you're not playing his game of cat-and-mouse and he's forced to dive with a jungler for kills, he's a burden for his team.\n\nYes, he's painful to play against and probably the most anti-fun thing since lag. You just have to rely on your team doing their jobs, and then treat Singed like a whiny kid: don't appease him, just go about and do the grown-up stuff that lets you win the game.\n\n**Edit:** And for the people down-voting the OP, it's an honest, if frustrated, question that a lot of people have had in the past. Stop it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jon1174","date":"2016-11-22T16:04:12.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a match history to link?","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2016-11-22T16:04:08.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not a kill game","replies":[]}]}
