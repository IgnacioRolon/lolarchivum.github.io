If you think about resource management, auto-attacks on mages won't always net the best results, so blowing a spell like you sometimes do on a mage can be more punishing in terms of mana if you don't maintain carefully. Also, I still believe there's a distinct lack of defense options for mages, which definitely leads to them being prime choices for being picked off. It's partly intended, but in the longer run, sustained combat mages definitely feel the brunt of less defensive options. Otherwise it's all glass cannon really, which was always partly discouraged in the past since there was always little to no counterplay to an enemy that could 1-shot you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BIackfox","date":"2016-11-11T12:48:03.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see only ap mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pill Slinger","date":"2016-11-11T10:35:36.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my experience, mid is not strictly AD at all.
