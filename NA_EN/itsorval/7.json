There's a follow up to this. \n\nMost people will answer, \n\n\"I get muh keys and rev it up and then I back out of the park'n lot and go!\"\n\nbut you've forgotten to turn your keys and you didn't even put the hand break back down. Can you even turn the key without your foot on the break anymore.. or was that the break, I forget sometimes. I never think about it. Anyways, the thing you want to do is reduce the amount of thought that goes into your actions. \n\nSomething to think about, not thinking at all is how you get fast reflexes. A reflex is where the body reacts without the smarter part of the brain helping, your body basically sends a stimuli to your spine and then gets an instant response before your brain even gets a chance to process.\n\nSo you want to consolidate your thoughts and act without thinking or rather without needing to think.\n\nto do this you need two things one for each. \n\n1. a well tuned output fit for you - output here defined as everything you do or put out\n2. a shorter version of the thoughts you still have.\n\nexamine yourself and see what you can shorten then practice the shortcut","replies":[]},{"poster":"BzRazor","date":"2016-11-11T11:42:54.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing OSU is the better way to improve mousing along with buying a gaming mouse.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2016-11-11T12:36:19.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vayne Doom Bot,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=twkIpqX2,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-11-11T11:42:54.484+0000)\n>\n> Playing OSU is the better way to improve mousing along with buying a gaming mouse.\n\nVery much this. If you can git gud and play 4*+ beatmaps with relative ease then you have no excuse to ever misclick again.\n\nDunno about gaming mice though. So long as it has a half decent DPI and it's comfortable then the average joe shouldn't be too bad off. Granted I exclusively use gaming mice myself so... I just like the shiny lights I swear.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pill Slinger","date":"2016-11-11T10:38:52.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya either got it or ya don't.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2016-11-11T10:57:02.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I shouldve been born a Korean","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeterenMantis","date":"2016-11-11T10:37:41.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is several things you can do to improve it. Professional MMA fighters Train their reaction time with Lucid dreaming, However I advise fast paced games that force you to make split second choices. Dark souls PvP though, I'm not sure How the dark souls franchise is doing. Other then that CSGO and other shooters like Halo and Call of duty Will increase reaction time. Outside of that you can learn to spot champion movement which will give away what move they are about to use but, Mostly sound bits will tip you off first. as long as you recognize the sound dodging will be increased.\n\nI played call of duty black ops 3 for a week strait and I am bobbing and weaving skill shots left and right. If you use call of duty, turn the sensitivity up slowly, As you play, your reflex's will adjust to the new speed increasing hand to eye coordination. Best of times you will Spell shield and not even have to worry about dodging worst of times you predict and juke the other way. Its quite handy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-11T10:33:43.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.aimbooster.com/","replies":[]}]}
