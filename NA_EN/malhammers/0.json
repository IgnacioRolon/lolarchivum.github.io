Actual good players would be winning their lanes regardless of matchup until they're at an elo where they belong. I played mostly Aatrox while smurfing through gold. Riven has historically been considered an extremely strong Aatrox counter.

OP is merely trying to find another excuse for being Bronze that doesn't involve himself. \"I can't climb because Rito's balancing sucks; too many OP champs!\" No, you can't climb because you're bad at this game. Your champion choice and the enemies champion choice has nothing to do with it. Hell, I just got Diamond on my smurf a couple days ago playing Leona Top. If I can reach the same elo as my main playing Leona Top, then you can beat a bronze Fiora with whatever champ you choose to play.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Loveless","date":"2016-02-14T10:48:22.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jack don't hurt em xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-02-14T17:27:03.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought this was referring to how, in the lore, not all champions are really that much of a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sanjiluv","date":"2016-02-14T17:57:11.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"why do people care about this game?

If you have any issue with that then you must have no idea how the planet works. Sooooo, you can only care about things you are going to go 'pro' in? Seems like an EXTREMELY illogical argument to me, coming from someone who, I hope, does't care about anything other than his professional career...because that is what your argument suggests.","replies":[]}]}]}
