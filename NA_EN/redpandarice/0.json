And since league wasnt the only thing it crashed during I never thought to play and test it out. I decided to play a bit ago, and noticed I couldnt load in the game after champ select, i closed and repaired.** I didnt get to load in but once that game because as soon as i did, 10 seconds later it caused my whole laptop to crash for the first time in hours. \n**\nI don't know if anyone can offer help, or advice, or just mourn with me about my laptop seeming like its giving up on life, but if you can thank you so much and I'm sorry for the overlylong post, it is 1:30 am and I am a bit tired!** _ If you need any more information I will provide everything I can! I mainly want to know is it really league causing this?!_**","replies":[{"poster":"Glitch please","date":"2016-09-20T09:31:06.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you updated Windows 10 with the aniversary update that was rolled down a few days ago, you should disable the xbox game bar since it has a bug in its game dvr recording","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-19T18:19:20.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you provide the error that the bluescreens give when they happen?
