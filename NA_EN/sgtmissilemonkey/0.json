To my dismay, I noticed that my super teemo skin is no longer usable.  Not sure why this has happened or if this has been addressed yet.  I am also worried i may have lost money on other skins.  Went to look at my purchase history and it does not go back that far, it only shows my recent purchases.  What can i do? Do i get a refund, the skin, or toon?  Please help me.  I can&#039;t remember all the skins i have bought.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-04-19T17:34:24.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SgtMissileMonkey,\n\nI'd suggest taking a look at [this page](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/gfX587IW-champsskins-i-was-gifted-are-gone-where-did-they-go) and seeing if any of the scenarios described may be why you're missing content.\n\nIf not, please feel free to [submit a ticket to player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and they could take a look into your account.","replies":[]}]}
