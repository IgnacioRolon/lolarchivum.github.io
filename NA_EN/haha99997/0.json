Then I deleted the whole League of Legends file, and download from website again. After I reinstalled, I clicked the App Icon, it started to download something about 1.5G, after it's done, it disappeared. I clicked the App Icon again, I pop up for 2 sec, and then disappeared. I tried so many times. Same thing happened over and over again. Plz Help Me!!!!!\r\nI tried download from elsewhere as well, none of them worked.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-07T18:52:26.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I asked our team about this to try and get more info.  To help us rule out some possibilities, see if updating your OS to the latest version helps.  \n\nSoftware Update steps:\n- Click the Apple icon on the top left of the screen, click on \"About This Mac\", and choose \"Software Update...\"\n- The App store will open and display any software updates available for OS X and the App Store. OS X updates will be at the top of the list.\n- Click \"Update All\" to install all available software updates. If prompted, enter an admin name and password, then your Apple ID and password\nIf required, restart your system.\n\n**Update **@ 1:40pm PT - Hey all.  **Updating your OS** seems to resolve the issue for most of these cases.  We'd also like to investigate the issue further as a whole.  It would help a lot to grab some logs from our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and attach them to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
