{"poster":"Kitt Kat","date":"2018-07-12T21:00:52.916+0000","title":"Why did I get banned?","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I certainly don&#039;t understand what I&#039;ve done to get banned. I might not be the most friendly person in the world but I&#039;m clearly not the most toxic one. I used to be toxic but after I got my 2 week ban I did eventually reform and unlocked my locked &quot;Dishonorable&quot; honor level so I must have been doing something right. I try to be uplifting most games but some I just can&#039;t get through and we eventually lose. The system is pretty bad at punishing because they usually take everything out of context and I feel like bantering with enemies about how salty they are isn&#039;t bannable. Riot should implement a WARNING system so we can all be more positive since we&#039;re scared to lose our accounts instead of straight up getting &quot;INSTA BANNED&quot;. I read some things on this forum which one of them was &quot;telling someone that they&#039;re toxic is toxic&quot; or something like that. And what??? Many people are given green cards and I think tribunals should be back. I feel like this has been undeserved because I quoted my teammate, and I should&#039;ve gotten a simple warning before the ban, not just &quot;Hey! Here&#039;s a 2 week ban now go ahead and be positive with your toxic team, tiger!&quot;. Before bans they should simply give a warning in-client like &quot;If you behave like this in your next games you are getting punished as soon as we detect that kind of behaviour.&quot;. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} Anyway here are my chat logs:\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nKitt Kat: camp top pls..\nKitt Kat: he&#039;s a onetrick\nKitt Kat: he is a hard carry one trick\nKitt Kat: can u top early?

Though I will say, if it's been a long time (and I mean ~5+ months) since your punishment, you might be able to talk to Riot Support and POSSIBLY get it reduced, assuming you've made a strong, consistent effort to reform. At worst, it can't hurt to try. \n\n\n[Riot Games Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)\n[Support Twitter](https://twitter.com/riotsupport)","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2018-07-12T21:04:59.645+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat restrictions are the warning system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Modi","date":"2018-07-13T00:26:29.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor and punishment level only have one thing in common: when you get punished, your honor level drops.
