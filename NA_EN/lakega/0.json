You know what seasons were the most fun to watch? When ANYTHING could happen.. When snowballing didn&#039;t exist. Anything could happen.

Those were interesting, and those made the world championships fun to watch. \r\n\r\nNow its juts 1 team slowly snowballing then winning. By 10 minutes in I could tell which team was gonna win with a 90% accuracy.. Not fun.

The Maple Story 2 is a ton of fun, come back in a year or 2 maybe riot will have learned that runes reforged was a mistake and the game will actually be fixed.  BTW I agree with everything you said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-05T03:50:25.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All of these issues are being fixed in S9, riot knows snowballing stompfests suck.\n\nTake a break, see what has changed in a few months.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2018-11-05T04:02:49.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, these are issues that riot said they want to address in S9. \n\nJust like many other things were issues that riot said they wanted to address in past seasons and almost never are accomplished.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-11-05T21:33:02.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are already being addressed, stuff is in testing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SithesisLord","date":"2018-11-05T08:23:44.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they keep up with this huge changes in preseason, residentsleeper changes on all the other patches, I don't think much will change, if anything will change at all.\n\nRiot needs to return the big patch, small patch format and stick with it for the entirety of the season.
