I haven&#039;t done anything wrong. They also banned my main account for intent when I wasn&#039;t even doing intent I just had a bad game. Then I make this account buy some xp boosts and get it to level 13 and it gets banned. Can I get any support from player base? Because riot truly gives no shi* about the tickets I keep sending.","replies":[{"poster":"Humid Hymen","date":"2016-10-25T02:07:34.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I checked every possible folder. I haven't received any email concerning the ban, therefore, I can't know what is the reason. Could be a charge back, I spent money on RP. But I can't know since they don't communicate with me. If any riot employee reeds this message and can check/know why I'm banned, I allow you to write it here I don't mind a this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-10-25T02:14:32.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can log on to the forums correct?  At the top and bottom of this page or any other page of the league site should be a support tab.  If you follow that and submit a ticket you will have a much, much higher chance of a Red looking into things for you.  While some Reds do look around the boards from time to time its not really a reliable way of finding one.\n\nFilling out a ticket should get you into things, just fill it out as best you can and check back every now and then to see if its been updated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-25T15:13:04.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dammit, tell us what year  it says you are banned till when you log in!\n\nThat ban year is a code for what you were banned for.\n\nhow can we help when you don't provide us with information. \n\nThough in truth, we can't help, we can just tell you what is going on.

It might take a day or so if things are particularly tangled but its more than worth the wait to figure this sort of thing out.
