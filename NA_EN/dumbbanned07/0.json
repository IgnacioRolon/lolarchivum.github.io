But, when it is some sort emergency. There should be a button where you click and you just leave and let AI takeover. This will also tell players you have an emergency. Instead of getting first offence.\n\nWe can also have some sort of vote leave created by the player who is trying to leave for those who are actually playing against people they know or on tournament like style like clan wars. If you got to leave, you got to leave.\n\nThis system can only be used one time a day reset 24hr.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2017-03-14T22:16:20.433+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"By definition, an emergency is not something that should be occurring to you once a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astrovert","date":"2017-03-14T21:34:12.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 time a day?\n\nHoly cow if you have emergencys come up so often, stay out of my games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2017-03-14T20:10:44.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"emergency button.... i can see this being a good feature but as DEEP TERROR NAMI said \n>this wouldn't be used for emergencies 99.9% of the time\n\n\ni agree but the pro and cons are really easy to see\npros: help ppl with possible emergencies and not get banned\nThe new AI system for intermediate is somewhat updated, i suggest is implemented, riot should spend some time developing something like dota (where the bots are stronger then the players) or something close to that\n24hr every use, how bout every time it hits 0:00 your chances refresh\n\ncons:could be abused by people having a bad game\nthere is trolls out there, if they get into a game and feed 10 kills, they can just \"press the emergency button\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-14T20:08:07.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It may look lke a good idea for a lv12, but it would basically spell the end of the game for lv30 or ranked play.
