They have mute, you get chat restrictions three times. Then a 14 day ban. Why dont they do a 14 day mute. Then a perm mute if it continues. I dont understand why hate needs to be spread even further, if you want to stop the hate. Silence it, dont ban it so they can make another one on a different proxy just to spite you and continue the toxic behavior. Like honestly Rito muting is the best solution to the toxic problem. You cant control your emotions ban permute. Problem solved. People stay on the account with all there stuff and a useless ban isnt in action. Make banning for the cheaters. Make the game better dont just push it away so it can come back stronger. Thats just my thoughts on this topic. Two accounts banned for just talking. Like honestly. Don&#039;t give the players such a huge aspect of player reporting. It ruins things so quickly. People report in the heat of the moment. They wont remember them 15 minutes later they will move on and enjoy the game. The game is toxic because of how compettitive it is. Having a anger problem isnt the matter, its just the instinct of who will win. Who cares how the act, you dont like it dont ban it. This isnt anarchy! \r\n\r\n           ~Acah","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-12-21T08:59:15.969+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already tried long term chat restrictions, most of the affected people turned to gameplay trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Has No Team","date":"2017-12-21T10:23:55.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zezockary,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=zFfmj0ZM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-21T08:59:15.969+0000)\n>\n> Riot already tried long term chat restrictions, most of the affected people turned to gameplay trolling.\n\nActually to further prove your point i have a friend who had 15 consecutive chat restrictions in seasons 4 and 5 that resulting in no change of their behavior.

Ill play as a team and forget about them after. I only used reporting for cheaters. Never for toxic behavior. Cause it was flame, thats why its called flame. They are angry at the moment not permanently. Open your mind to other sides and you will understand. I have tried saying this so much. I get why you guys feel it shouldnt be exusable.

Kicking them away from it will just let them go to a different place and be toxic there. Stopping it at the source is what will happen. And to the comment about the restaurant, they dont kick you out buddy. They warn you first. And in your case kicking out a consumer is the best option for this state of the game? A player who just talks. And it helps me if I feed, I had friends tell me to stop and I tried harder to fix the problem. And saying \"hey dude you suck\" is constuctive criticism.

Their best and most reliable system is the Instant Feedback System (aka the chatlog scanner), so they use it to its fullest potential.

Nowhere near it.\n\nAlso, I certainly agree that people can change over time. (That's why I just wanted to phrase it as Riot did, and not as an opinion of mine)\nThat being said, I believe that's why Riot's policy is to \"ban accounts\" and not \"ban players\". This, in addition to the fact that (in my opinion) a 14-day suspension is not nearly enough time for a person to \"change\", as nor is a 2 or 3 month suspension, makes a permaban (again, to the account) the best solution.\nYes, a one or two year ban being the maximum threshold may be better than a permanent ban. Actually, I'd prefer it. But being realistic here, for a player that gets this punishment a permanent ban or a two years ban is all the same.\n\n######(Also, I may be too stupid, but why exactly is the community's toxicity Riot's fault again?
