The reason this suspension was issued was due to clear intentional feeding. Evidence from the match history confirmed this to be true.

A 14 day ban is the official punishment for a single inting death in a single game.\n\nThat would be great if that was enforceable. However, considering that no one is ever banned for this (except apparently this guy), I don't think that's fair. I mean, if you want to get technical, look at speed limits. In some places there is no law that factors in \"being human\" when they write their traffic laws. Some places, a cop can legitimately pull you over for going 1 km/h over the speed limit. The \"punishment\" for speeding even just a little bit is technically a ticket. But if a cop ever pulled you over for that, that ticket would get thrown out in court (a judge **_COULD_** uphold it, but they wouldn't - and they'd probably be mad at the cop for wasting the court's time).\n\nIs one inting death punishable? Sure. Is Riot's system robust enough to enforce this? Not at all. There are people out there doing **_way worse_** and not getting punished. So no one would ever expect to get punished for what this guy did. I think the \"we're all human and people have bad games\" rule applies, just like it does when you look down at your speedometer and notice you're going 12 km/h over the limit and slow down. If they punish for this, then they should punish one instance of flaming/harassment too. But they don't. Because we're human. Getting mad an inting an entire game and securing a loss is entirely different than getting mad, inting once, and then realizing you're an awful human being and correcting your behavior and trying to win the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ProjectDawn","date":"2019-01-08T01:39:13.765+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":8,"body":"Lol at the 1st game.
