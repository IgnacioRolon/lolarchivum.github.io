I then went to see which ones i got and saw the alpha tester icon and a TSM one. I have never bought one before. So, i&#039;m just wondering how i got it.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T02:37:37.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Alpha Tester Icon was for anyone who helped test the Alpha Client before it moved to the Beta Phase. You simply needed to log into the Alpha prior to it hitting beta and you were granted the Icon. The TSM one was a mistake on our part, we accidentally gave it out to some players who were meant to receive the Alpha Tester Icon.\n\nI hope that clears up the confusion. Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
