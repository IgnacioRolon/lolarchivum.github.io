Of course I know that my password is super simple and easy but this account is super old. I started playing league in 2012 and I've only changed the password twice. Now the problem is there, I can't change it anymore because the email is so ancient I've lost it due to security rights. Lately I've seen activity in my account that someone has been coming onto my account and basically giving away my RP to low leveled players, as I have already checked the gifting history. (F2P Shaco and Friendly Ghouls) are the people that have been gifted with my RP that I did not do at all. It's starting to really agitate me and I would like it resolved soon....","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-03T21:18:55.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account sharing is super risky, because you can't be sure that the others who have your own info are keeping their information secure.
