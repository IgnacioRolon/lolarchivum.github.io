I first saw this in an ARAM, when I went to heal a low health Mundo with a Spectre&#039;s Cowl. I didn&#039;t get the number down, so I tested this out in a bot game with a Malphite.  Instead of healing him for the Rank 1 base heal of 65, he only received 42 health. Now, I understand her bounce is 15% less effective every bounce, but this is the initial cast.  After some math, (0.85*65 = 55.25) (55.25*.76 = 41.99) (Malphite had 32 base mr, 24% damage reduction) I noticed her heals seem to be treated like a damaging spell AND a bounce. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the proper format, if it helps. I don&#039;t want my fav pun maker washed up by some silly coding. :D\r\n\r\nIf Nami heals a unit, her heal is reduced by MR and by 15% (her base bounce reduction)\r\n1. Pick Nami and play a bot game with a Malphite.\r\n2. When Malphite has taken damage, heal him with W.\r\n3. Notice that instead of 65, you Nami heals for 42.\r\n4. Be sad. \r\n\r\nShorely I&#039;m not the only one with this problem, but we&#039;ll sea.\r\n\r\n~OPichu.","replies":[{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2016-03-13T05:10:53.518+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healing from external sources is reduced in ARAM, if it's also reduced in summoners rift then that is a problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-03-14T17:14:47.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Raith alghul  is correct - in ARAM, healing is reduced by 50%, which may be what you're seeing here.
