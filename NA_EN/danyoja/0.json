Every now and then when I play ranked my league client will freeze so I can't select a champion or I pick a champion and my client freezes and crashes. It's really annoying I've read a bunch of tread and forums to try and combat this to no avail. I don't want to be a salty sam, but while I don't mind the time penalty I really hate that I'm losing LP on disconnects that are not my fault. So what do you I do to stop this. I turned of the IP helper thing in device manager, uninstalled pando media booster, reinstalled league and it keeps happening.","replies":[{"poster":"FMA BIg Gay","date":"2016-10-15T03:05:38.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happens constantly to me. About 1 in 5 games. Only run curse in the background which I thought riot supported. My internet is not the issue hands down. My friends experience the same thing at about 1 in 5 games being a crash at champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Danyoja","date":"2016-10-17T01:25:51.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a theory that it could be when someone is using the wifi (namely Netflix in my experience) with heavy bandwidth implications, but I haven't done or want to run tests to see if it's true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-30T18:00:52.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crashing and freezing during champion select may commonly be caused by two factors.  The first is the use of third party programs that don't interact well.  Meaning, remove any apps you might have running like play.tv or overlays for the quick fix.  This could also be caused by network issues failing to hold a connection to the group server, causing you to lose sync and crash out.  For this, I suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for a resolution.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"Danyoja","date":"2016-10-03T23:20:08.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply I wanted to see if running the Hextech repair tool. I don't run any 3rd party applications besides skype and even without skype I still get the freeze. I've lost at least 18 lp due to this bug now. I checked most of the connection issues on guide and I don't see any conflict my connection is good after doing a speed check.","replies":[]}]}]}
