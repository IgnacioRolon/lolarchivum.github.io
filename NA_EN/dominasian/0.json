Granted, I am a Mid main and I understand that it is one of the most popular roles, at the moment. Still, it seems to me that the whole point of creating a system in which you manually select your favored role(s) before every match is to allow you to actually play what you want. Instead, I am getting assigned to my Secondary choice at least 2/3 of the time.\r\n\r\nAgain, I get that Mid is highly contested, but why can't I just wait in queue longer like you do in MMORPGs for dungeons? I really don't mind waiting longer if it means I can play the role I am most successful with. Perhaps I'm off-base with this or just don't understand the deeper nuances of the Dynamic Queue, but this has been really frustrating. Anyone else experiencing the same?
