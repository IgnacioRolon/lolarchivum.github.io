A hypercarry tends to be in the adc class, like Vayne or Kog'Maw, and they explicitly scale into the late game. Katarina is strong mid-game, like plenty of midlaners (heh).\n\nBut if you have a difference of opinion, that's fine. Hypercarry tends to be a heavily debated topic, especially with aoe and snowballing champions. So let's just agree to disagree.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FHMarshy","date":"2015-04-16T14:56:05.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1796196002/201093429?tab=overview\n\nI think 10 kills on Kat is definitely enough to try to even out the game. \n\n_**However**_  You guys are down 8k gold, 5 towers at 22:30. \n\nI mean, you have 95 CS when almost everyone on the other team had 100+","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-04-16T05:39:27.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many towers were you down, and/or dragons?\n\nCarrying isn't about your KDA, it's about what you can get out of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krigjer","date":"2015-04-16T04:55:03.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bad attitude â‰  defeatist attitude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"powerbats","date":"2015-04-16T04:54:36.652+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realize that while you blacked out the names in 2 places you didn't block them out in the Bold yellow has joined the channel part right?","replies":[{"poster":"Simplicate","date":"2015-04-16T18:24:17.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kapppaccino","date":"2015-04-16T21:13:17.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These comments though.....
