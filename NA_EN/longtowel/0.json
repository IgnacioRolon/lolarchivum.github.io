Your teammates always seem a lot worse than usual. The enemy team too strong. \r\n\r\nAfter some observation, I found a few things Riot Matchmaking does. \r\n\r\n1. You get lower Elo players on average, by about two ranks. Gold 2 vs Plat 4 etc. This is fair I think, the gap isn't too large, you're supposed to be a bit better. Thing is, the average doesn't mean an even team. You often get someone who is much lower. Silver 1s in a Gold 2 game, etc. This means he will likely get stomped and the enemy snowball off of that. \r\n\r\n2. Tilted/Loss streak players. You may think, hang on, the tiers aren't that different, why are we losing this bad? Look at the op gg profiles. That feeding jungler? 9 game loss streak. You can tell that he is tilted beyond belief when he plays. \r\n\r\n3. Autofills. You can't get autofilled when you're in your promos. Fair. But guess what? Your team is autofilled! A good amount of your team will be playing their second preferred role, or simply autofilled support.\r\n\r\nGiven how volatile this game is right now, just a couple of deaths early game is more than enough to decide the entire game. Especially if you have tilted people on your team, they will most likely start to flame and int instead of staying calm. Can't even blame them for that. As a result, if in a game you get teamed up with not one but multiple of autofills or tilted people, someone on your team is most likely on a promo series. \r\n\r\nI personally think this is a cheap and dishonest way of balancing games. As people climbing in their respective elos, we do not have the mad skills to bypass the unfair conditions Riot sticks us with. This system makes so many of our games feel unwinnable, which is more tilting than anything else. Why use a system that increases tilt? Especially when we're in promos and its quite an important game?\r\n\r\nI don't think a lot of players would mind having a little more randomness or longer queue times, and I understand there are a lot of variables and you can't have perfect games. But currently, the algorithms specifically use our human weaknesses against us, that is absolutely unfair.\r\n\r\nAlso, way too many autofills. IDM waiting 5 minutes for a game, but if we're getting autofills every other game, its just never gonna be a good time.\r\n\r\nTl:Dr\r\nRiot stacks players on promos with tilted/autofilled/lower elo players.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-28T03:07:20.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, this isn't actually true.

The other team would feel like crap because you're supposed to win this series. When I say Riot stacks the odds against the player, I don't mean just the player in promos, but just in general. Promo games are just more frustrating, more stacked, and more unpleasant than normal games. And not just by a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDanceGavinDance","date":"2019-08-28T03:00:01.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"When i am in Promos, I tend to face either a Better Team, Have Toxic Players, Have 1 Bad game, Have someone Doing Placements.
