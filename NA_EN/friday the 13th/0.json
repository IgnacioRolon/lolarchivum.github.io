Telus internet.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since a few months ago, I get crazy high steady 500ms. This never used to happen. I have pinged the riot servers and it shows me 59-60ms but when I get into game, it goes up to 500ms atleast. Makes the game almost unplayable. Even doing a speedtest and pinging a Chicago server my ping shows 61ms... what can I do to fix this? I never had high ping before when they did the server switch. I'm in Canada on Telus internet. Where can I report this? what can I even do?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-27T21:17:26.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sudden lag spikes can be caused by local network issues, but it could be due to how your ISP is routing to our game servers as well.  To really know for sure, I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) for an overview of what's going wrong.
