But under my profile tab, when you can view your ranked elo, you can also check your kills, CS, and wins, im curious to know why the icons above each change, such as my CS emblem is gold, my wins emblem is plat, and my kills emblem is diamond. \r\nBut they keep changing, I think this is kinda cool, but ide like to have them all as gold icons. Not sure if they are to compare your stats between elos or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-22T21:32:54.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those stats and their icons get better as you play more and play stronger. Unfortunately, there's no way to guarantee they'll all get to gold, but they're just a visual indicator, so they don't affect your rank standing.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Rogu3Yoshy112","date":"2016-09-26T15:18:52.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, thanks for letting me know, i was just wondering if they were some sort of marker as to how good you had become compared to your match history. Itd be cool if it was used to compare your skill level to those in challenger and such.","replies":[]}]}]}
