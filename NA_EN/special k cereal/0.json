Now as a long time League player, I got very used to the way it ran on Windows 7, and it kind of feels more laggy and janky on Windows 10. So, is there any way to make it look, and play like it does on Windows 7 without downgrading?","replies":[{"poster":"Special K Cereal","date":"2016-05-04T20:45:56.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok i went and tried compatibility mode, which didnt change much and i have yet to try ddu, but will prob try it later today","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2016-05-03T22:55:04.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're having FPS issues, use DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) to completely uninstall your video driver, then reinstall it after restarting your computer.

To do this, find your League of Legends executable, right click and select \"properties\".  Once a new window opens up, find the \"compatibility\" tab, and checkmark \"Run this program in compatibility mode for:\".  Once done, select Windows 7.\n\nYou should be good to go then!
