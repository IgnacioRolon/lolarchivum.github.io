I don't get how Riot can withdraw Sewn Chaos Amumu and Blitz which were very cool skins for the price given but release an odd textured skin that looks nothing like the champion and really breaks the visual equality the game has. Not saying it's not cute, but it looks like a custom fanmade skin and i would really have issues with it ingame. Add to that the current Kog void V.O to an actual IRL DOG and you get yourself a wtf moment. Things just don't make sense...i guess Riot just do what they want when they feel like it.\nI'm not fully hating on it, in fact i find it cute because it's a dog, but i just don't understand Riot's logic after the Sewn Chaos stuff and now this. I don't know if it's because of the Galio rework (and i highly doubt it) but...those skins are really poor quality. And deep inside i feel bad because Galio gets so much love with amazing reworked skins but themed skins like April Fools get completely crushed. Note that the same thing exactly happened with the Warwick rework where his skins were golden good but Sewn Chaos skins got...well, removed.\n-LastDreamy.\n\n-I feel like the only way Riot could possibly get this skin out is by making it more like a disguise Kog'Maw wears (kinda like Dino Gnar). Otherwise, this really doesn't fit into the general LoL theme. Even the skin itself (which is well designed, don't get me wrong) looks odd/wrong compared to the abilities and the voice-over used.\n-QualitySupport.","replies":[{"poster":"Jikker","date":"2019-02-26T17:23:36.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter how much we may dislike a skin, bumping 2 year old threads is worse and a violation of the rules.

Some players enjoy fun/silly/creepy skins. April Fools has, for the last few years, been the time of year that Riot releases skins that cater to these players' aesthetic preferences. \n\nPug'Maw should be released because the League of Legends community is comprised of a wide variety of people with a wide variety of preferences. Riot has serious and \"cool\" skin series, from the Warren/Marauder skin line to the PROJECT and Battlecast series. You have the complete freedom to play as an alien invader, demon lord, cupcake zombie, cyborg ninja, Christmas tree, rainbow pony, etc. You do not have to like or play Pug'Maw.\n\nA comical, creepy pug skin will not negatively impact your League experience, especially if you have no interest in purchasing it. Other players will buy this skin and enjoy using it. Not every player will appreciate every skin, champion, or icon. That is why there are hundreds of them.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-03-08T01:59:12.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I don't really care for the skin personally, but if they want to release it, it doesn't affect me at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldaSniper","date":"2017-03-09T23:23:31.988+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot.
