I am trying to get League of Legends to run on a machine that should only access a filtered access point (or filtered dns point, however you call it), and i want to white-list it. I have the game downloaded and fully updated to the latest client (The Beta Client at the time of this writing) using another wifi connection just to get the downloading out of the way. I have also properly setup the firewall using inbound and outbound rules as well as setup the google dns (8.8.8.8 &amp; 8.8.4.4) for the connection after the filter.\r\n\r\nAll that remains is a problem I cant get around, the netgear filter itself. In the site, I have already white-listed the \"PvP.net\" and \"leagueoflegends.com\" names on the site, but as I run the client it puts me in an infinite loop of messages saying \"There was a problem patching League of Legends. We'll restore a backup version and try again after you restart the patcher\" (I then click the restart button). Then upon restart I get this message \"We have restored this installation to an older version of League of Legends. Now we'll try to patch it up to the latest version.\" (I then click the okay button). Then I get greeted with the previous message prompting me to restart again.\r\n\r\nI then tried to start the old legacy client but I get the classic dialog box (titled \"RADS Error\") saying: \"Could not connect to the HTTP server. Please check that your Internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access\".\r\n\r\nSo then my questions are:\r\n1.) Is there another site name I can add to the white-list that would allow this game's patcher to go through? (Maybe another HTTP server i do not know?)\r\n2.) Is there something else that could be stopping the patcher in the new client that I do not know of?\r\n\r\nAnd sorry for the long message, this is my first post to the boards and I want to provide as much information as possible that could be useful in this situation. Any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T22:15:45.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This rads error you're getting is usually a security setting blocking the patcher from grabbing game files.  You can use the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to help add league as an exception, but I can't guarantee anything with a third party like Netgear and would suggest checking their support site.
