I'm saying having 3 dashes on *relatively* high cooldown puts her slightly above par with other mobile champions who can dash once but more often. You're saying it takes her significantly out of line.\n\nSo where should we set the bar for mobility? Finding common ground here would probably be more effective than this constant back-and-forth that we have going.\n\n>It's always a factor,you can't just separate things like that,the issue with mobile champions is they're unpunishable/untouchable nonsense,and range is a big factor here,as melee champions will generally use at least one dash to get in range.\n\nIt seems like a straw-man(?) to me. You're saying that being ranged makes her more mobile. That would mean range=mobility. By that logic, Varus, Ashe, Koggles, and Xerath are also mobile because they have high range.\n\nFurther, mobility isn't simply \"the ability to avoid punishment\". Mobility is the ability to move around with speed and efficiency.\n\nRange and mobility are 2 separate things.\n\n>The thing is the cooldown on it isn't high at all,especially since she gets cdr as core,you know I'm right,she uses it in a fight,recalls,goes back to lane,then needs to play safe for 20 seconds until it's up,it will be up for every major engagement,it's true that it can be blown if she misplays hard in lane,but other mages would just die instead.\n\nAs opposed to other mid-laners who just wait 5-20 seconds (without returning) to get their mobility skill back? She can dash farther, which can make her more forgiving, but she can do it *less often*.\nAnd your comment implies that she will always be ahead. Out-play her, bait her, ask jungler for a soft gank. Playing around her ult is no different than playing around any other mid laner's mobility skill.\n\n>That is in fact a very small cooldown on such a ridiculous ability,I agree.\n\nSarcasm OP.\n\n>Aside from leblanc/fizz,ahri is the most idiotic of this bunch.\n\nFunny, because I consider all of them (except Ekko) to be *more* mobile than Ahri.\nEkko is hard to gank because he has strong zoning/turn around pressure (largely from that stun). In addition to his ult, he becomes very hard to gank.\n\n>Nah,unlike you I'm mostly unbiased,so you have a lot of people agreeing with me that ahri's mobility is absolute BS,and I'm talking about prior to the q ms boost,which made her go even more completely retarded than before.\n\nWhere am I being biased? I'm comparing her high power *relatively* high cooldown ult with comparatively low power low cooldown basic skills and saying she comes out slightly ahead.\n\nAs for support:\nA) I don't see a notable outpouring of support in this chain for either of us.\nB) Even if there was, you still have to remember that the boards contain a *minority* of the player base. Often (though not always), the *vocal minority*. That's why you often see a lot more complaints on the forums and compliments. Happy people have no reason to chime in.\n\nLike I said. The Q buff is just baffling. And it *does* serve to push her further over the edge. Honestly, she was strong without it. They could remove it without too much impact in my *opinion*.\n\n>You were talking about 3 dashes per minute,20 sec cd is 3 dashes per minute.\n\nIt is. But the cooldown is also inflated because of her ability to use them back-to-back. If they become a 1-off thing, the cooldown goes down and it becomes more along the lines of a basic skill. Or, *because* it's an ult,  they give it something else (reference: Kassadin's Void limping).\nConversely, an ammo system would give her the choice of how many to use each time. Thus the cooldown would go up to account for the added power. Or she loses something extra to pay for it (reference: Kassadin's void limping).\n\n>Except that with her being ranged and incredibly safe on top of it having a short cooldown,those windows are nearly impossible to punish unless she is doing insanely bad.\n\nA good Ahri will protect her windows of vulnerability. This is true of *any* champion. But there's are huge difference between Ahri who has to play safe while her ult is on CD, and... Say... Kalista who just has to make sure there's nobody behind her. Or Zed who has to manage a 14 second cooldown.\nAnd it's also possible for her opponent to do *well*, which you again seem to imply isn't an option here (Am I misinterpreting something with this sentiment?).\n\n>Fine,answer me this then:how many ahris have you faced in the past 3 months(as in,a couple/a decent amount/a whole fucking lot)?\n\nI *really* need to preface this answer real quick: I'm a support main. I play support in probably about 60-70% of my games. Before the S4 support role changes, I played it closer to 95% of my games. I play jungle the least and play the other 3 positions roughly equally.\n\nThat out of the way, I run into her about as often as other tier 2(3?) meta champs. Probably about.... 1/20 games ballpark? So... a decent amount? I'm not bothering to reference pickrates for this response, so I really couldn't tell you if that qualifies as a \"couple\", \"decent amount\", or \"whole fucking lot\".\n\nRecency aside, I've played in games with her, and in lane against her. The most miserable was as Shyvana. Shyvana doesn't have a lot of kill potential 1v1 due to the lack of CC; this plays into Ahri's strengths. But even then, I was capable of holding lane.\n\n>They are,but very few abilities can break them,lux can't,brand can't,cassiopeia can't,but ahri with all of her already ridiculous safety can.\n\nWhich dashes is she breaking? Because not all dashes work the same. Most dashes follow a pathing route (such as Leona's Zenith blade and Thresh's lantern) which I could see charm disrupting (same with taunt and fear). Others have a set end point and use a cast time that can't be interrupted (see Rek'Sai's tunneling). And then there are blinks which are something else entirely.\n\nMost forms of hard CC will break the pathing dashes, while being delayed on the cast time dashes. If she's breaking the latter, then it's a bug.\n\n>Mobility isn't bullshit in it's own right,janna is very mobile,the issue is ahri is just untouchable/unpunishable crap over her mobility,that's the problem,same with fizz,same with kalista,same with leblanc.\n\nSo you're core argument is that she's \"too safe\" and not \"too mobile\"?\nBecause I was under the impression we were debating the latter.\n\n>Like her sustain,her true damage,and her charm breaking dashes,and of course now the speedboost on q.\n\nHer sustain passive is supposed to be thematic. I remember that being mentioned around the time of her release actually (old forums). It also used to give spell vamp. They changed it when spell vamp got nerfed.\n\nHer Q damage follows the same logic as Ekko's. It does less damage going out, but more when coming back to reward landing the second part which is much easier to dodge.\n\n------------------------------\n\nAnd I'm just going to repeat the top of this response:\n\nSo where should we set the bar for mobility? Finding common ground here would probably be more effective than this constant back-and-forth that we have going.","replies":[{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-08-26T15:31:40.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ariel the Cruel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=T08doNq0,comment-id=000100010000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-26T14:10:10.042+0000)\n>\n> Ok, we really need to come to a consensus here. I'm saying having 3 dashes on *relatively* high cooldown puts her slightly above par with other mobile champions who can dash once but more often. You're saying it takes her significantly out of line.\n> \n> So where should we set the bar for mobility? Finding common ground here would probably be more effective than this constant back-and-forth that we have going.\n\nAlright,cooldown,unless massive(think 150 seconds at max level),is mostly irrelevant,range is also to a large extent not important,it's basically number of dashes per fight,rule of thumb is:\nmelee: more than 2 medium cd dashes per fight is retarded.\nranged: more than 1 medium cd dash is retarded.\n\nAs to medium cd,if the champion doesn't build cdr it's 11 seconds,if he does it's 14.\n\nthese are basically rules of thumb,obviously targeted dashes can be seen as less,and a bunch of other nonsense,but that's mostly extremes.\n\nexplanation to this,melee generally need one dash to get to their opponent,so that one is subtracted,range doesn't matter(it does matter,but this is a rule of thumb) because a big issue with mobility is that is allows easy avoidance of skillshots,and since fights are generally decided by short rotations the question is how many skillshots can you easily avoid while re-positioning,whereas very short cd dashes are seen as different,as they will be up for the next rotations of spells,cooldowns are 14 as cc abilities generally are on a ~12 sec cooldown,so if it's lower than that you will be able to avoid rotations constantly,this is as far a rules of thumb go.\n\n> It seems like a straw-man(?) to me. You're saying that being ranged makes her more mobile. That would mean range=mobility. By that logic, Varus, Ashe, Koggles, and Xerath are also mobile because they have high range.\n\nNo it makes her mobility more bullshit,and yeah,varus/kog/xerath with mobility would be pretty fucking bullshit.\n \n> Further, mobility isn't simply \"the ability to avoid punishment\". Mobility is the ability to move around with speed and efficiency.\n\nThat is more easily balanced than the ability to avoid punishment,and is more feasible to trade off power for.\n\nThe issue is(and this is apparent right now) is that the game is evolving(devolving?) towards reflexes and instant-cast/reliability,good chase is much more easily balanced than the ability to easy avoid skillshots,as that just ends up with champions who rely on skillshots being nearly impossible to balance\n\n> Range and mobility are 2 separate things.\n\nNothing in this game is truly separate.\n \n> As opposed to other mid-laners who just wait 5-20 seconds (without returning) to get their mobility skill back? She can dash farther, which can make her more forgiving, but she can do it *less often*.\n\nThe issue is that one dash is very likely not to be enough to save you,ahri's 3 is nearly guaranteed to get you out of everything but the most major of screw-ups,or stunlock/instaburst to death,which would kill other mages as well,but for them it's also more likely to find themselves in that position.\n\n\n> And your comment implies that she will always be ahead.\n\nNo,when even it's very hard to force out her ult,the issue is if you manage to force out a purely defensive ult out of ahri,most other mages would be already dead in that scenario,so that's not really a weakness,especially since it will be up very soon.\n\n>Out-play her, bait her, ask jungler for a soft gank. Playing around her ult is no different than playing around any other mid laner's mobility skill.\n\nThe problem stands that any other mages would be dead at this form of outplay,and if you try to force something too hard she can easily turn it on you with her ult,you need to understand that ahri without her ult is safer than lux with her ult,this is no weakness.\n \n> Sarcasm OP.\n\nI'm aware,but her ult is still BS.\n \n> Funny, because I consider all of them (except Ekko) to be *more* mobile than Ahri.\n\nThey really aren't,all of them(aside from the previously mentioned leblanc and fizz) are way easier to gank,or make a pick on.\n\n> Ekko is hard to gank because he has strong zoning/turn around pressure (largely from that stun). In addition to his ult, he becomes very hard to gank.\n\nIt depends on who is ganking him,a carry jungler should make him die before his stun lands.\n\n> Where am I being biased? I'm comparing her high power *relatively* high cooldown ult with comparatively low power low cooldown basic skills and saying she comes out slightly ahead.\n\nBecause her pattern works in such a way that due to her high cooldown on ult,she will always keep it,either to run away or to get a kill,baiting her to use it aggressively is basically pointless,the mobility it gives is so massive that she will just turn back like nothing happened,for guys like ekko or azir you can actually try to bait it,but even if you don't,it's one dash,meta junglers have the mobility to catch up to one dash,but not to three.\n\n \n> As for support:\n> A) I don't see a notable outpouring of support in this chain for either of us.\n> B) Even if there was, you still have to remember that the boards contain a *minority* of the player base. Often (though not always), the *vocal minority*. That's why you often see a lot more complaints on the forums and compliments. Happy people have no reason to chime in.\n\nThis isn't about the forums,I once went into a normal draft game(patch 5.14,before all this broken bs started pouring out),I ban ahri,some guy who apparently plays her(checked on lolking) a lot asks why,I answer that she is faceroll unpunishable garbage,then the rest of the team agrees that \"yeah,she's completely retarded\",everyone I talk to thinks her mobility is idiotic(except people who play even dumber shit),this isn't about the forums.\n \n> Like I said. The Q buff is just baffling. And it *does* serve to push her further over the edge. Honestly, she was strong without it. They could remove it without too much impact in my *opinion*.\n\nRiot has a thing for ahri,same as lee/thresh/zed,they want her to be always strong,they panicked with the dfg removal.\n \n> It is. But the cooldown is also inflated because of her ability to use them back-to-back. If they become a 1-off thing, the cooldown goes down and it becomes more along the lines of a basic skill. Or, *because* it's an ult,  they give it something else (reference: Kassadin's Void limping).\n> Conversely, an ammo system would give her the choice of how many to use each time. Thus the cooldown would go up to account for the added power. Or she loses something extra to pay for it (reference: Kassadin's void limping).\n\nNah,ammo would just make things worse.\nRiot has a big issue(arguably at least) with mobility currently,ahri might not be spearheading the problem anymore,but she is still a part of it.\n\n> A good Ahri will protect her windows of vulnerability. This is true of *any* champion. But there's are huge difference between Ahri who has to play safe while her ult is on CD, and... Say... Kalista who just has to make sure there's nobody behind her. Or Zed who has to manage a 14 second cooldown.\n\nYou don't get it,a meaningful window of weakness is one which is either big enough to look for a good opportunity(large cd),or is big enough that you can force something hard(sona's ult is a good example of that),ahri falls under neither of these.\n\n> And it's also possible for her opponent to do *well*, which you again seem to imply isn't an option here (Am I misinterpreting something with this sentiment?).\n\nI'm saying that unless she messes up hard she is impossible to punish,again its not only that she can either be ahead or behind,she can also go rather even,at which point she can't be punished.\n\n> I'm a support main. I play support in probably about 60-70% of my games.\n\nWell rarely playing jungle is a bit of an issue,though you still should see how untouchable she is out of laning.\n\n> That out of the way, I run into her about as often as other tier 2(3?) meta champs. Probably about.... 1/20 games ballpark? So... a decent amount? I'm not bothering to reference pickrates for this response, so I really couldn't tell you if that qualifies as a \"couple\", \"decent amount\", or \"whole fucking lot\".\n\nIt's actually more of a question of how many games you play,you need to see her on a semi-regular basis to keep up with how consistently stupid she is.\n \n> Recency aside, I've played in games with her, and in lane against her. The most miserable was as Shyvana. \n\nShyvanna mid?\n\n> Which dashes is she breaking? Because not all dashes work the same.

If she's breaking the latter, then it's a bug.\n\nI'm not sure what you are saying here,ANYWAY,she breaks dashes same as a knockup would(possibly better?),but stuns and snares don't break dashes,neither do taunts,ahri is a special snowflake.\n\n> So you're core argument is that she's \"too safe\" and not \"too mobile\"?\n\nShe is nearly impossible to punish due to how her mobility and kit work together.\n\n> Because I was under the impression we were debating the latter.\n\nShe's both.\n\n> Her sustain passive is supposed to be thematic.\n\nIt's such shitty reasoning,if they wanted to give her spellvamp for thematic reasons,maybe don't give her such a bloated kit with it?\n\n> Her Q damage follows the same logic as Ekko's.
