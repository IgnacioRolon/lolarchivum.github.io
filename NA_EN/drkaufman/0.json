I have been playing regularly since the day they were added. I opened my first box and key that were given to me on release day. Shortly after I have received 3 boxes and 3 Key Fragments to make one key.  Since then I haven&#039;t received any new Key Fragments while I play ranked and normal modes.  While friends I&#039;m playing with have been getting a ton of Key Fragments for playing the same game I was in.\r\n\r\nFrom what I remember reading the Key Fragments are a random drop from games. I seem to be either extremely unlucky or there is something missing\r\n\r\nIf anyone else is having this problem please comment here so riot is aware of the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"CowMeat","date":"2016-03-26T22:48:03.082+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":1,"body":"The drop rate decreases to the point where you can easily win 15 or so games and not get a key.

You can only earn a box with each champion per season. You can still earn it for your friends though.\n\nAs an example, if you're Yorick and get a D-, but your Elise friend you queued with gets an S, you get a chest and can't earn it again on Yorick, even those it was an Elise that scored the S.
