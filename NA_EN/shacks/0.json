Simply i click on league (i have tried running as administrator) and the logo apears, then disapears, the apears with the loading bar, then disapears. I have just un installed and reinstalled and i still can't get in to anything. EXTRA INFORMATION THAT MAY MAKE MY PROBLEM DIFFERENT FROM THE REST. About a week a half a go, my friends wanted me to download a game called \"paragon\" which needed some other programs to run, they didnt end up working on my computer and turned out to be quite dodgy stating that my computer need to be cleaned and what not, i believe i have uninstalled then but since then my computer has been very slow. P.S also this problem would you usually be fixed once i have restarted my computer serveral times.\n\n-Shacks","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-21T15:11:52.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you have some security and OS settings that's preventing your games from launching, so it makes sense that the HRT gave a similar error.
