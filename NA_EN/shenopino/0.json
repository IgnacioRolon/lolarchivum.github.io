Combine this with blade of the ruined king and he will also deal physical damage base on his enemies max health.\r\nAatrox&#039;s bloodprice deals alot of damage in the earlier stages of the game, heck some people dont get this until he gets them with his q-w-e-ignite cheese and kills them for first blood.\r\nHowever this damage falls of so quick that as soon as someone starts to build armor it immedietly gets to a state where Aatrox will lose more health than the the damage he will deal.\r\nI&#039;m not  talking about late game where almost eveyone on the other team has at least 1 complete armor item.\r\nI&#039;m talking about as soon as someone comes back to lane with even a cloth armor.\r\nIf that someone and Aatrox are even in gold come back to their lane after their first back, Aatrox&#039;s blood price will immediatly become ineffective.\r\nOf course Aatrox can just build up his passive on minions until full and then trade with his bloodthirst, but doesnt this mean that in some way that ability is &quot;broken&quot;?\r\nI mean think about it:\r\nAfter Aatrox enemy laner comes back with armor, he would most likely wont be using it against him anymore but rather use it on minions.\r\nAt mid game when the roaming starts you will probably use your bloodprice once to do some damage while ganking but since you lost quite a bit of health from your q-w-e combo you will want to start using bloodthirst or else the enemy champion youre trying to kill will proc your passive easly and just keep runing to safety. (not to mention that if your passive is on cd he will kill you)\r\nNow lets talk about the time where bloodprice becomes really ineffective. Late game.\r\nMost of the time in late game is spent on sieging, objecives such as dragon, baron, buildings and of course team fights.\r\nIf you use bloodprice while attacking dragon or baron you take a risk of being with low health and end up dead for quite the low reward for dealing just a bit of more damage.\r\nSo lets take that out of the list of when you should use bloodprice.\r\nFor towers and other buildings the reason is quite similar, you wont want to push minion waves to keep your wave pushing so you can keep attacking the tower with bloodprice because it will just get you to low health near a tower just for lets say 2-3 seconds of attacking. \r\nWould you rather die/die+ losing passive just for a few basic attacks on a turret which you probably didnt end up destroying? didnt think so.\r\nTeam fights is where bloodprice becomes completely ineffective.\r\nAs tanky as you build and as much sustain you have with bloodthirst, using your 3rd auto attack proc to help the enemy team kill you while barely doing damage will burst you down faster than you would use your second proc to active bloodthirst.\r\nMaking bloodprice a proc that deals damage based on some reasonable % of the enemies max health as magic damage will cut through tanks and carries making you pick the right target for you and your team.\r\nan enemy carry does alot of damage yet doesnt have a reliable escape? hop on that guy and kill him!\r\nan enemy carry does alot of damage but has alot of kiting potential? just keep auto attacking his front line to help your carries kill those who focus them!\r\nRight now you cant just auto attack an enemy bruiser who targets your carries because you wont kill him as quick as the enemy carries will kill you.\r\nRight now if you dont focus your enemy carries you cant use your bloodprice to its full potential or even half of it. \r\nOn the other hand even if you do want to use its full potention but the enemy carries have too much mobility youll end up being just nothing.\r\nYou dont have enough damage or utility to peel for your carries or enough mobility to kill your enemy carries.\r\nSo yeah thats it. I know the chances riot will actually think about this are very low but I just had to put it here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian","date":"2015-09-06T17:19:01.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"% health\"\n\nstopped reading there","replies":[{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2015-09-06T17:26:23.572+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=If Ahri Was Real,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=89ojxpEe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-06T17:19:01.185+0000)\n>\n> \"% health\n\n{{champion:63}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:67}}","replies":[{"poster":"TacoTheKitten","date":"2015-09-06T19:18:16.053+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot {{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}{{champion:67}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ionian","date":"2015-09-06T17:33:31.536+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I tend to stay away from those.\n\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:76}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saminus Maximus","date":"2015-09-06T21:07:48.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora with the 100% max hp true damage doe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DemaciaClown","date":"2015-09-06T18:39:33.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnknownToPublic,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=89ojxpEe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-09-06T17:26:23.572+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:92}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2015-09-06T17:19:44.173+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"as an {{champion:266}}  main i think he deserve base stats buffs,Q cooldown reduced,something that will help him stick to targets late game or do something late game.\nRiot says Aatrox is a fighter who heavily focused on initiation and in fight sustain.\nRule #1-Never initiate fights with aatrox,not unless you can jump on the enemy backline which is impossible.\nin fight sustain drops hard late game.","replies":[{"poster":"HAIL WHYDRA","date":"2015-09-06T18:32:39.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo, he needs all his base stats /slightly/ buffed, his q so that if he is up in the air he cant be interupted (in annoying that your q is basicly a dash that if you remove the animation, its just you pausing then moving) and thats about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"THEJJSLAY","date":"2015-09-06T17:27:39.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I honestly don't know what you are doing when you play him but he is perfectly fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spizzle9000","date":"2015-09-07T13:29:22.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think thematically it might actually make a bit of sense.

And the only reason why his w wont do damage when some one get a pit or armor is because you probably only have one level in w and you max out e witch makes so that you need to poke the enemy down and aren't as effective is dueling if you would max w instead. His w has higher scaling than his e 100% vs 60%. You are underestimating his w dmg out put. And 42 games aren't enough to have realized all the strengths and weakness a champ has. If you are building 1 dmg item and full tank you are playing him wrong in my opinion if you wanna play a tank don't play Aatrox. From what i have looked up you seem to maining him in the jungle devouerer isn't a good pick for him and hear me out before you get on your high horse's his has so little damage in the early game the only good thing about it early is the 50% attacks speed boost witch isn't that useful in the early it takes a long time to get stated and you lose to basically every other jungler will win in a 1v1 fight against you for you have no combat stats. And a devouerer is a late game item witch Aatrox isn't he is a early game champ. Getting a worrior is rely good on him for the AD the armor pen witch rely synergises with his W blood price and getting a ranger's is a must on him for he has low clear speed. With worrior you can get rely ahead with it for your dmg output is way higher when compered to a Aatrox who builds a devouerer. But those are my findings by playing him in the jungle. his real problems don't lie with his W but his Q and GA passive. The passive is bad on him for he isn't a burst champion. He loses all attack speed on revive witch limites his damage out but by quite a lot ant max level he loses 55% attack speed. His GA part of the passive is more of a weakness than a strength. Because of it he loses base stats and gain way less than he loses form having the revive. His Q has short range, long CD, high cost, small AoE for the knock up. I have some chances in my previous posts you care to have a look. And i rely hope you all who read this will go and visit my posts and comment on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-09-06T19:16:32.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I think his ultimate needs a rework and he needs a better identity. He's typically a mixture of a fighter and tank, focusing on sustaining throughout a fight. However, if he focuses on damage he dies too quickly in fights, and if he focuses on survivability he does no damage. His kit is made to be weaker because of his passive.\n\nI think maybe his passive could be reworked into something like the \"Second Wind\" mastery, where he gains increased self-healing as he loses health, and a shield if brought below a certain % of his health. That way his kit can be adjusted due to him not having a revive passive.\n\nAs for his ultimate, it should be more thematically fitting. Allies in the area of effect should gain attack speed/CDR and lifesteal+spellvamp, or something like that. It should actually be used to \"turn the tide\" of battle not just a small burst damage with a stat increase that he already has in his kit","replies":[]}]}
