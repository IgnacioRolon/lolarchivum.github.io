When the W skill is released in the big dragon pit, it will run out to the exit anyway, so if I want to hide, leave the split inside and run. Going out can't do it. And often there is a situation where the card is stuck on the wall. I feel that at least in the dragon pit, you should not run out or you can control the distance that you run out.","replies":[{"poster":"Meezus","date":"2018-12-12T06:19:55.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(so if I want to hide, leave the split inside and run.
