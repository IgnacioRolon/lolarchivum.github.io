It&#039;s great, but it lacks a very important tool that Fiora absolutely needs to accomplish the fencer/duelist fantasy. She&#039;s supposed to be nimble, swift, and deadly right? So, why does she feel absolutely immobile? Your Q is short ranged, and if you use it to go in - You have nothing to get out. So, a minor suggestion that might help her &#039;duel&#039; more, and be more useful in a fight.\r\n\r\nSimply, if Lunge hits a vital, it resets completely. This will enable her a bit better trading in lane, darting in and out for quick procs of her passive, and will give her the necessary mobility to actually use her ultimate for more than the heal. Let&#039;s face it getting more than 2 of those marks off is nearly impossible as is. If it proves overbearing, numbers could be adjusted, but as is, her kit just does not have the mobility demanded of her.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-08-08T05:42:01.750+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":6,"body":"We're with you that Fiora seems to be pretty underpowered and are working on a set of buffs for her at the moment.

Right now, the most practical way of playing Fiora in team fights is to use your ultimate on a focused or low target, get a single Vital off of them, and proc the extremely potent AoE heal for your team ASAP.  To me, this doesn't fulfill nor align with her playstyle fantasy, is not fun, and is not very interactive or dynamic.  Also, there's the clash where Fiora's ultimate gives a lot of true damage on a tank or burst on a squishy, both which Fiora wants to do, but it's more effective to use it on an already almost-dead target to guarantee the heal quickly; using it on a low target feels like a waste of potential damage, particularly when Fiora's damage and passive refreshes cannot keep pace in a team fight without it.  I don't mind that the ult gives an AoE heal, but I don't think it's executed well.  What are your thoughts on these views of the ultimate?\n\nI was also worried about her identity and focus, as both her sustained and burst damage are not notable for her squishiness, her team fighting outside of her ultimate is not ideal, and her 1v1 ability mid to late game is very bad compared to upper tier split pushers.  But with a lower Q cooldown, she could fit better into doing sustained damage, which would help her split pushing.  I just wanted to bring up the issue of her role in the game, ask what you guys envision it as, and hope it's kept in mind when making her stronger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knight Auditor","date":"2015-08-08T09:40:10.260+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if it'll actually be enough to do anything.  \n\nIt's not like her W, E, or R are pulling their weight.

Once she is stronger than you, she can chase you down with the perma Q and if you want to CC her or deal dmg back, the W will block all of it and even slow or stun you.\n\nI played against good and bad Fioras around plat and the good ones rape you after some lvls.\n\nYou want an item builds? Phage -> Hydra -> T2 Boots (mercs most of the time) -> BotRK -> BC. \nFiora wants AD most.\nAfter that there are 3 options: BT, IE or GA (or Randuins or Banshees if you play against mostly one dmg source). BT is the natural choice because it agian gives you more HP and the LS on all these items is insane. IE does more dmg but is not needed.\nLast item is probably LW. Can be built earlier\n\nPhage -> Hydra -> mercs -> BotRK -> BC -> BT/IE/GA -> LW/GA\n\nFioras offensive stats: AD > AS > Crit. \nCrit is not really good on her or needed. It never was. \nAS is ok, but BotRK is more than a simple AS item. It gives AD, LS, the passive and active. She doesn't like pure AS items.\n\nQuints can be AD or AS, both is good. reds are AD.\nCDR in the mastery tree. Definitely spell weaving and blade weaving.\n\n\nAnd to Riot: If these buffs are going throug, I can see a lot of good Fiora players stomping lanes everywhere.\nI see a lot of people getting Triforce before BotRK which is crap. No BC (phage) for the follow up MS after you hit a vital spot and they never get enough CDR to spam the Q. The bad ones nearly always use the W active instead of reactive (sometimes it is oks to use it actively). And the E is an AA reset, use it right.\n\nThe HP per lvl buff combined with the W CD buff is nice and OK. But the AD per lvl buff is probably too much and Q doesn't need an even lower CD late game. Early 2 sec less is ok, even 4 sec would be still fine I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Auditor","date":"2015-08-08T15:22:05.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really don't think using a build identical to her pre-rework one is a good idea, as that is the build you're suggesting, but if it works for you then it works for you.

Pre rework she didn't use BC or at least not as early and as often. Also putting a phage in front of hte hydra if possible is not an option she used pre rework.\n\nAnd the build was taken from some pretty good Fiora players I met or pros that played her the last days. And the build works, if you know how can get through the laning phase. Fiora is not a normal top laner in these days and so a lot of people are also not used to having a smaller front line or that maybe another person has to engage and she waits for the right time to get to the target.\n\nA lot of her problems come from team compositions and the meta. You can try her in the mid lane if you get some magic dmg elsewhere and you can see that she works there pretty well and probably fits most meta comps better (like Irelia mid).","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Auditor","date":"2015-08-08T15:35:13.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're going to have to agree to disagree.

She REALLY needs it.\" Everyone and their dog lost as Yasuo when he was released too, and he turned out to be one of the most infuriating champs to ever face. You guys like to say the PBE is a very small set of people, so not all data can be brought from it, but what about the countless threads of people SAYING they played it. The ones recommending buffs and nerfs to the champions? The ones that MAIN the champion you're looking into? The only one I've seen get noticed on any of the recent things is MarineRevenge. People like myself that make threads about the new Skarner and such that have played him forever get neglected 90% of the time. The PBE seems like it's just a way of saying \"This is who is being buffed/nerfed, these are the new skins. No we're not going to change it if you don't like it (Maybe in a patch of 2 after it's live).\"\n\nI really don't like how the the buffs and nerfs to champions have been getting determined lately.

Her w stops damage and cc, and is pretty hard to time right.  Her e is auto attack reliant, which slows, but the problem with it is that you're auto attacking for that time, which means you aren't moving for those two auto attacks.\n\nThen you have your r, which is overloaded with damage, that you just can't ever pull off.  Then it has a heal?  And once again, the heal is set near the place your enemy died, meaning if you want to use it, you better hope the team fight stays right there.  In one spot, which is not thematic to the character at all.\n\nAt this point in time, it's actually more useful to use your ult on an enemy you don't want to kill, to catch up with an enemy you do.  Because once you kill the first enemy, you lose the speed and the enemy team isn't sticking around in the heal all your allies field.\n\nI'm not against change, especially seeing how broken a fed fiora could be pre rework.  But why would you make a jumping around duelist have 3 spells that require her to stop the battle from moving.  How about make it to where her q breaks the opposite sides vital point during the ult.  And decrease the damage of her vital point slightly.  That way you're getting the damage, and just forget about the heal, any burst make is just going to break through the heal anyway.  Or make it a less powerful heal, and have it only heal you as a H.O.T.\n\nThese are all good ways to make her  strong without making her stop to have full affect.","replies":[{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-08-08T12:24:43.236+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"The whole point was to make her more cohesive and consistent of a champion, but this is the opposite, nothing in her kit works together\"\n\nThis.

My biggest issue with Fiora is her laning phase, build path, and her passive. Against any champion with waveclear, she struggles to keep up until she gets Tiamat, but by rushing Tiamat, you must forgo any defensive stats, mobility items, or lifesteal (until you finish hydra,) and by that time it's not hard to just have your lane shoved into you constantly with no chance of actually interacting with your opponent. And of course by having Tiamat, you forfeit your ability to manipulate minion waves as well as you could without it.\n\nHer passive is mostly random and literally decides if Fiora can play up or not depending on if it decides to show towards Fiora or away from her, and if the opponent doesn't like the side it's on, they can just walk away from Fiora and reset the passive until it's favorable, then Fiora has nothing to play off of for 15 seconds.\n\nI think she's fine full build, but her lack of laning power forces her into a build path that's not optimal just to keep up. I would be happy with a buff to her Q that just let it hit multiple targets in a line, like a Yasuo Q. It would give it another dimension to master, not just having to be in range, but attacking from the right angle to line up multi hits.

I like her kit, but not her ult. I'm not sure how to make it work and I have tested it plenty in real games. In 1v1's it can be strong, it takes a while but as long as the opponent doesn't have a way to hard disengage you and just wait it out it's ok. Plenty do though.\n\nBut in team fights, unless your team is ahead, for a fighter that builds damage items positioning on team fights is everything, because you don't want to step into AOE or get in range of all their carries at once and get bursted down too fast. Her ult requires you to focus your positioning on burying your face into an opponent for an extended period of time. I feel like she has to be a lot more tanky for this to be usable in team fights, but her currently scaling require her to build a lot of AD to matter. So you're relying on your teammates to kill your target fast enough to get the heal field off and even then...\n\nThe heal field is strong but people move around a lot in team fights, even it if goes off which requires already a lot of things to work out, for it to help you would need the team fight to still be going on while it's up AND for enough teammates to be fighting on it, so if the enemy is running away, or their priority target just simply moves out of it your team just won't get much healing since they have to go to where those targets are.\n\nHere is what it comes down to. Ults are on long CD's and for this reason across the board they are designed to be nearly always impactful, you can still lose the fight but they always do something substantial unless you mess up badly. The contribution and effectives of her ult is very situational, even if you play it well, it too often can have no or minimal impact due to too many constraints.

This ability does not give any damage by leveling it\nRiven scales with Total AD and cast her Broken Wings 3 times!

Not to mention that if you dont like the current Vital point you have to go AAAAAAALL the way to the turret and come back to fight and this thing is over and over and over again. The range of this thing is not shown and even then the range is way too high. There is no other way to change the vital spot.\nYi and Irelia does 15 to 20 true damage every basic attack at rank 1\nvayne also has 20 + 4% target max health as true damage on every 3rd basic attack at rank 1\n\n[E] 50% bonus attack speed for 2 basic attacks\nOK why not 250% bonus attack speed at rank 5? Its only 2 basic attacks. This is not better than any ADC with critical strikes because it doesnt deal any different damage\n\n[Ultimate] OK her ultimate requires brains.. OK I GET IT!

I'll just leave a list of changes that I think could help Fiora.\n\n**Buffs** (not all of these changes are necessary just some ideas, even 1 would help her vastly)\n\n* Let her Q reset (only once in a short time window) if she strikes a vital, if they chose not to use the reset during the short window it does it's normal 60% cooldown reduction and if she uses it to just escape or after the reset Q it goes on its normal cd. So good Fiora's have options they can either hit 2 Q's in quick succession or hit the one on the 60% CD which would be better for Ult situations. This gives Fiora strong in and out like a real fencer, increases her dps, and makes her ult easier to pull off in teamfights.\n\n* Give her W a passive where either she avoids unit collision or gains bonus movement speed when approaching an enemy champion.\n\n* Make W a like less static.\n\n**Nerfs**\n\n* Not really a nerf as much as a fix.

Everyone know aa'ing a minion won't draw aggro.  Lunge deals physical damage just like Miss Fortune's Q - Double up.

I get that it's dangerous to completely block an enemy spell too often, but odds are you are only ever going to land it on an auto anyways. I would like to see it's CD cut in half if it blocks an auto attack, if it blocks a spell it gets the full CD.\n2. I like the passive. With Q it's fun to harass in lane and it has good damage. The problem is it causes minions to agro, so even though you did good damage you will still lose the trade most of the time. Passive procs need a bit better healing early.\n3. Even though you can Q harass a lot and be ahead in trades, there is no way to all in for the kill. Going for a combo into your ult just takes way to long. Most of the times I engaged with a very clear advantage I ended up chasing the enemy to their turret with 2 out of 4 vitals proc'ed and nothing I could do. I don't really have a solution for this one.\n\nSo far I've only had success with Fiora if the enemy actually tries to fight you.

Even with the perfection combination and use of her E, Passive and Q when it comes to poking it just dosen't do much damage. One final thing to mention is that Pre-Rework Fiora was OMEGA strong late game. Now she does absolutly little damage late game because since she's so squishy in teamfights she get's annialated first when she goes in so you have to build some armor MR and HP early on which cuts back your power significantly since she is such a build based champion. Her new kit is nice in the sense that it requires good timing but it's just too much difficulty with such low reward that it would be much easier and effective to just play another champion top lane.
