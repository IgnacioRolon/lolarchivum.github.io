Reform means knowing _when not to type_, and generally being a sportsmanlike player. I type pretty frequently in the chat, and I've gone without punishment for four years. It doesn't matter if anyone reports me, as long as I don't flame and don't throw out hate speech, their reports mean jack shit.\n\n> I refrain from using offesnive language, i dont feed, or troll how much more reformed could i get.\n\nHm. Try figuring out how you were harassing your teammates? 'Cause clearly, you do have room for reform if you got a punishment.\n\n> Pretty much only allowed to tell trolls that they are doing a \"great job\" or \"love the feeding keep it up\"\n\nHah, no.\n\nPro-Tip: Don't talk to trolls at all. Period. If someone's trolling, they're only doing it to get a rile out of you, and you talking to them, badgering them, flaming them, etc. is just rewarding them for their bad behavior.\n\nDon't feed the trolls - that's just friggin' Internet 101.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellmaximus1","date":"2018-01-08T17:14:03.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umbral Regent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=rNxg4AKs,comment-id=0003000000010001000000000001,timestamp=2018-01-08T07:40:56.462+0000)\n>\n> If you sell your account, you&#x27;ll just ultimately be screwing someone else over since, guess what - sharing accounts is against the rules, and the moment they&#x27;re detected as not being you, the account will be permabanned, and you&#x27;ll have swindled them of money.\n> \n> Your best option is to learn what you did wrong and work to reform yourself.\n\nSharing accounts or more importantly selling accounts has been done for a long time now, with rioting not banning individuals that buy accounts, the only real reason those accounts do get banned is because of scripting/botting.\n\nAlthough it is against the ToS and riot certainly is opposed to you sharing account info it rarely if ever gets enforced upon.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-01-08T04:35:52.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short answer: no. it's a combination of games played and time.\n\nWhy not just stop trolling your team and then your honor will reset naturally?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2018-01-08T03:58:38.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/PzY1ArN3-we-dont-ban-people-for-asking-for-reports\n\nThe way he asked for the reports is not against the rules.

Some examples of neutral chat would be \"ziggs flashless\", \"nami mia\", \"careful, jungler has blue buff\" or \"tribrush warded by bot laner\". You can even say \"please stop trolling\" in response to someone trolling (just say it once or twice though and don't keep on about it) or \"no need to start flaming. ashe just got backup at the last second\" in response to someone flaming. These are things that are neutral and game-related and more importantly won't get you punished. If that's still too much to ask of you then just don't bother responding.\n\nP.S.
