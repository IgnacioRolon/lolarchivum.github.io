And then there's me... Honor level 3. \nAnd two of the guys questioned me, how them. 3 silvers and a bronze. Had level 5. While I had level 3 when I'm Plat. \nI told em It was cause I'm a Support main. (At least 2500+ of my 3000+ matches are as support since season 1)  \nAnd that the support rarely gets honored, even If I carry the game. The adc who I set up with those 20/1/20 stats. Is the one who gets honored, even though It's me whose working his ass off setting up kill after kill for him. \nThe silver guy replied he was a support main aswell and he got Honor 5 just 2 weeks after honor system was released. \n\nNow, I still get honored. I mean, I got the honor flare in 8-9 out of 10 matches.  But I rarely get even 2 honors per game. \nI even went top lane a few times where I always had 10-20 kills and less than 5 deaths. Took tons of objectives and helped out a lot. \nBut premades would just honor eachother instead of the one who saved the game that they tried to surrender at 15 min... \n\nThis honor system really needs adjusting. \nSame with the Mastery levelling on champions, how come I can go 0/20 and win the game, and get +700-1300 points on my champion. \nBut I can also go 20/0 but lose the game, and only recieve 100-200 points of mastery on the champion... \nMastery points should be based on your Rating. S+ = 1300 points, S 1200, S- 1100. A+ 1000. etc etc. \nIt shouldn't give you tons of points regardless of your score &amp; skill level just because you won the game, and It shouldn't give next to 0 points even though you carried, got a penta. But unluckily lost by a tiny bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"F33DING101","date":"2017-11-27T01:44:42.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh i dont think this new honor system is a good idea, most people dont even honor they skip over the page and if it is going to take forever to get honor 3 then whats the point in trying to get honor?","replies":[]},{"poster":"VuleMadafaka","date":"2017-11-15T09:52:36.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reached lv 4 finnaly a day after they distributed honor reards {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordPeppers","date":"2017-09-14T19:48:15.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got Honor 3 two day after they release the honor system since this moment nothing else happend.
