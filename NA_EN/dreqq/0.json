I felt like beeing the only human. My thought through the game were confusing. I thought they may be premades and trolling, but then i checked their items and they just bought items until they couldnt and they didnt upgrade or sell any of them just until it was full. That was when i thought &quot;hey, maybe its a program which allows multiple account to run on a device and do random stuff as like bots do.&quot; It was just not rational or it didnt make any sense. Pls Let this get checked asap. I dont want to play a game where people are cheating in any way. And im totally sorry for my grammar as for my mistakes. Im dumb as hell.

Eve however was a system I'm not familiar with seeing in game. It's something simple someone setup on their own. They use that account to play normals when not botting exp/ip.","replies":[{"poster":"Luso Clemens","date":"2016-05-16T09:03:15.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eve is the player that created this topic, so not a bot...","replies":[{"poster":"AngryMidgetNips5","date":"2016-05-17T14:57:36.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Luso Clemens,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Esgy3sUV,comment-id=000500010000,timestamp=2016-05-16T09:03:15.464+0000)\n>\n> Eve is the player that created this topic, so not a bot...\n\nThe Eve I was referring to can be found in the match history I posted, in the post you replied to.\n\nIt is now presumed banned as it has stopped being active, after a red looked at this post.\n\nPlease try to keep up with conversation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zSkeletoRz","date":"2016-05-10T01:54:07.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cluvie,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Esgy3sUV,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-05-09T17:24:05.345+0000)\n>\n> DREQQ -- \n> \n> Thanks for taking the time to write up a post about this.

You can tell this is happening just by looking at the match history. My ticket was closed and the botting account is still  botting away...\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/3UTdhf58-people-using-scripts-to-level-up-accounts\n\nI'm personally keeping tabs on the account as it levels up using a botting script/program/app whatever you choose to call it. It was level 20 when I was in a game with it, reported it, sent a ticket to support after the match. The account is now level 24 and playing normals when not being botted. \n\nPS - Please explain to me how you guys have such a hard time picking out automated systems which follow the same algorithms, from human beings which don't tend to repeat the same consistent pattern over and over, thousands upon thousands  of consecutive times. Especially when there are 3 or 4 of the bots/scripts running in the same games, following  the same algorithms? I can pick a \"botter\" out just by watching the same patterns be repeated. Yes some are better put together. Running to and auto attacking Gromp, die and repeat until game ends. This is an obvious pattern...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wolfess","date":"2016-05-09T12:54:26.394+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like a good portion of them were possible bots.
