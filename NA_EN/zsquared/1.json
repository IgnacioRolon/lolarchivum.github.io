I reinstalled the new alpha client and my in game settings won't save. I have to change then every time I get into game. More specifically my quickcast settings and my hud scale settings won't save. Any help would be awesome!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-06T00:26:00.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your input settings file saved server-side may be having some issues. I recommend we complete a reset of this file using the following method. You'll want to **log into the Client** then leave it running in the background while you head to your config folder, which should be in the following directory:\n\n>**C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config**\n\nDelete these two files:\n**- input.ini\n- PersistedSettings.json**\n\nOnce you've deleted those files, you're clear to hop into a custom match alone to confirm your settings can now be configured and saved without redoing them again. Please let me know if this fixed the issue for you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zsquared","date":"2017-02-08T22:05:03.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!! It definitely did.
