Or even better, give the mana charge a MUCH higher cooldown and an equally increased mana increase so that it'll be attractive on a wider range of champions?\n\nRight now it's 4 per charge with a 3 second cooldown with the ability to stockpile up to two charges, right?

Considering that Riot has no actual reason to remove it. (It's not an abuse item, or had a history of abuse) And it's still have niche champions who depend on it. (Rather than just being a niche item that no one buys.) Lastly, if you adjusted Ez, Jayce, Varus, to scale more with crit chance(to make ER a viable pick) it would likely require them to give up some of their Siege like powers, which they are known for. And in Urgot's case, he actually has a mana ratio. Removing that source of mana could be a problem for him, as it's the only AD item with mana. \n\nLastly, even if only 4 or 5 champions fit that model, removing their item just because no one else uses it, completely closes the possibility space for other future champions with a similar model.

Give it a 1% bump in how much AD you get from your mana. At full charge, it could be the highest AD boost in the game, Just as {{item:3003}} can give the biggest AP boost in the game other than {{item:3089}} . It may not have a lot of the other things that could make it sexy to AD champs, but simply having the highest potential AD boost in the game makes it more viable for a broader spectrum of champs. If you had 2000 for your max mana, you would get a total of 85 AD, rather than the current 65 AD total. If you are hitting a measly once per second that is a flat 20 dps before armor. Most champs with this item are likely to get closer to the 1.5 or higher attack speed range, increasing the effect even further.\n\nPotential to make it much more sexy (imo)? Simple. Take the Shock effect of {{item:3042}} and bump the damage to 10% of current mana, but make it only go off every other hit. Again using the example above of 2000 max mana, you would go down to 1940 on hit and do 116 extra damage currently. That goes up to 194 extra damage if you bump it to 10%, but you only get it every other hit. Say you are attacking 1.5 times per second, not out of the question, and you use no abilities between six attacks. Currently those six hits would be (in 4 seconds) 116 bonus, 113, 109, 106, 103, 100 for a total of 647 damage (161.75 dps), and you would be down to 1665 mana (83.5 mana consumed per second). With the bump, you would be looking at 194, 188, 183 for a total of 565 damage (141.25 dps) and have 1826 (43.5 mana consumed per second) mana remaining. Overall you lose 13% of the abilities dps, but use about half as much mana to do said damage. This leaves you far more mana for using your abilities (which are going to do more to boost your dps than basic attacks anyway) at a fairly insignificant reduction of your dps when you look at the big picture. Also if the change to the attack damage boost above was made as well, you lose no dps, but greatly reduce the mana consumption of the item's ability. \n\nIt would wind up scaling faster than the current model as you bought more mana boosting items. I admit, it would still be a bit of a niche item for the more mana hungry ranged attackers and hybrid champs, but I think this would be a good rework of the item, and cause it to see more play, what do you guys think?","replies":[]}]}
