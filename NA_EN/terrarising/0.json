Spamming ghouls and being a tough to kill tank is a lot of fun.  It's also clear that Narrative (Jaredan specifically) only wants to talk about “core concepts” of a champion and not story ideas or examples.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm also not one to shy away from games, not matter the rules, so I'll give it a shot.  I'm probably going to fail at some point in keeping it to just “core concepts” since a great deal of my thoughts require that I give examples.  However, if a Rioter wants examples or me to elaborate on points further, I can certainly try.\r\n- - - - -\r\nYorick, at his base, is a grave digger and mortician.  Similar to ditch diggers, this is as blue collar a job as you can get, an aspect of League's lore and world that isn't dealt with nearly as much as it could be.  As the “Grave Digger” of Runeterra, Yorick's job on the Shadow Isles is to clean up the messes left behind by the other champions, whether that's Elise looking for a snack or Karthus preparing for his next concert.\r\n\r\nYorick does his job, rests in the manner that ghouls rest on Runeterra, then does it all again the next day.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Yorick has more in common with Helmet Bro than any of the “best and brightest” champions commonly seen on Runeterra.\r\n\r\n(I'm going to stop here at the moment since talking further would likely lead to me giving story ideas.  If anyone from Narrative would like me to elaborate on certain things, however, I'm willing to play.)","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-03-20T18:59:41.628+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the themes of him being the long-suffering, humble, honor-through-hard-work sort of guy.

Maybe he can epitomize quiet strength and extreme persistence.\n\nThat's pretty much what I went with in a recent Factions update. Yorick is the POV character in the third scene of **[The Harrowing](http://leaguefactions.net/nyroth-update-5/)**; the section is marked with Yorick's splash art, if you want to skim down. (He also makes a brief appearance in the first scene.) I think the \"blue collar\" or \"workman\" elements are pretty strong, and a nice contrast to other Champions, who are often rather aristocratic. He also draws a bit of pathos from his Sisyphean task. Actually, he's got it worse than Sisyphus in a way: at least Sisyphus knew where the boulder was at any given time. I wouldn't say that Yorick has a \"heart of gold\", exactly, and his grudging misanthropy goes pretty deep, but he's not really that bad of a guy, and he's still got a heart, at least figuratively.\n\nIn addition to \"quiet strength and extreme persistence\", I'd add that he also has a certain pride in his craft. He does good work. It matters to him that he does good work, and not just because he thinks it might be part of his \"quota\". He does good work because Yorick Mori does good work. He's no softie, and his outward resentment toward the dead (who incessantly beg him for peace) is generally quite heartfelt. But I think sometimes there's an intersection of his pride and his grudging sympathy for these poor saps that resolves into something like kindness. He's jaded, sure, but he does feel kind of badly for the restless dead, and every now and then, he gets some satisfaction from doing them a final service, and doing it right, after everyone else has forgotten about them.\n\n---\n\nSince there's been some fanfic apprehension, let me add what I think should go without saying: I'm very grateful that Riot encourages the community to create community lore, and I can scarcely fathom the temerity that would be required for a League community member to try to sue Riot for reading or using community lore. It's rather presumptuous for me to even say this, but for the sake of clarity: if Riot wants to use elements from this post, the linked story, or anything I've written League-wise, I would have no objection whatsoever. To get preposterous as well as presumptuous, I'd even add (I think quite needlessly) that I release any legal right to object to any such use, other than perhaps verbatim copy-pasting without attribution. I don't think this is going to happen, but for the sake of illustration, if you and Jaredan decided to write a story about Yorick going to Nyroth and digging up some lost souls, including some direct quotes from this piece, my reaction would be giddy delight, not litigiousness (that I'd in any event hopefully be sanctioned and fined for wasting a court's time with). Really, this should all go entirely without saying: we post stuff on these forums precisely because we want to contribute to the effort. It's not just that we're okay with Riot using our ideas: we're posting our ideas **because** we want Riot to use them. If I post some silly fanfic and it gives a Riot author an idea, I **want** them to use it. Permission is deeply implied in the understood nature of the relationship.\n\nThat said, I'll just link it rather than quoting from it here, in case any Rioters start having conniptions about legal liability. (Though seriously, talk to your legal team. If they're not idiots, and I have it on good authority that they're not, they should be able to put you at ease and demolish this needless barrier to Riot-community engagement. IP law is broken, but it's not **that** broken.)","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-03-20T20:29:17.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CupcakeTrap,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=f0xMkWEc,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2015-03-20T19:31:11.678+0000)\n>\n> That's pretty much what I went with in a recent Factions update.

Besides, I've yet to see anyone point to an authoritative judicial opinion that stands for the (ludicrous) proposition that any type of IP right attaches to a general story concept.\n\nThat said, it's not like there are that many novel story ideas in that link anyway. It's \"Yorick digs graves for dead people\". The main purpose is to illustrate some ideas about his personality.\n\nI'm very, very reluctant to do anything to increase Rioter or community anxiety about \"legal problems\". We have enough problems getting communication going; we don't need to add onto them by building up an unfounded sense of paranoia about the flow of ideas.\n\n**tl;dr: If any Rioters honestly believe that they can't read fanfic or use specific story ideas as a way to get at a character's essential personality, they need to go talk to their legal team and get some clarification, because that sort of belief is a major (and needless) impediment to community interaction. Imagine if Meddler felt he couldn't read specific ideas for Champion changes, or IronStylus couldn't look at fan art.**","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-03-20T23:58:36.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CupcakeTrap,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=f0xMkWEc,comment-id=0008000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-20T20:36:49.705+0000)\n>Snip\n\nWell, you *have* derailed this thread.

You're right: perhaps the longer discussion does belong in a separate thread. But, respectfully, **you're** the one who raised the \"taboo\" in the first place in this thread. I felt a need to respond. I think there's a real danger that community members will read casual references to \"the rules\" and begin silencing themselves. The costs of such self-policing can be very high indeed.\n\nMy understanding of \"the rules\" against discussing \"story ideas\" is that, if Narrative is working on a specific story, they don't want to start collaborating on that specific story with the community, because then its authorship becomes blurry. Instead, they want to hear about the basic elements of the characters, or the themes you'd like to explore. A story idea, or a \"fanfic\", or a bit of sample dialogue, may be helpful in illustrating these basic elements; it's often much more natural to use specifics than to talk in broad abstractions. They can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't read anything that they've said as a command to not use specific examples: it's just that they can't use story ideas, and the story ideas themselves are not useful to them (but they may still contribute useful material).\n\nYour understanding, if I'm interpreting your comments correctly, is that there's a ban on mentioning story ideas even in general terms, like, \"I think it'd be cool to see Mundo and Warwick fight. Maybe on top of a skyscraper in Zaun,\" because after reading that, a Rioter is forever prevented from writing a story about Mundo and Warwick fighting on top of a skyscraper in Zaun. I do not think that's the case, and I certainly don't think that means that they must go and scrap all draft stories they're working on that involve Mundo and Warwick fighting on top of a skyscraper in Zaun. There's certainly no legal reason for that.\n\nI imagine you were just trying to be cautious, but there's a real danger to throwing in so many \"gosh, I'm probably breaking the rules, but, maybe, can I sort of vaguely suggest that I'd like stories about, you know, Yorick and his past? Sorry! I may have said too much. Forgive me.\" comments, because they might give others the impression that we're not allowed to talk about stories on the Story and Art board.\n\nAlso, I'd point out that in this very thread, Bioluminesence and I are talking about fairly specific story scenarios. The goal is not to start writing a story together, but rather to explore a character (Yorick) by discussing some scenarios he might find himself in, or how he conducts himself. I don't believe that Narrative has any problem with that, and I can't imagine why they would, so I'm loath to begin spreading it as gospel that this is somehow forbidden.","replies":[{"poster":"TerraRising","date":"2015-03-21T03:19:03.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CupcakeTrap,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=f0xMkWEc,comment-id=000800000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-21T00:47:06.751+0000)\n>\n> I don't think it's completely clear what \"the rules\" are, and I think we should be very careful about codifying for ourselves a set of \"the rules\" that will prevent us from communicating openly.

However, I started the thread, so I think I should be allowed to remind myself (and others) that I'm trying to limit my thoughts to constraints previously mentioned.

There's certainly no legal reason for that.\n\nNeither of us know, for certain, if a *\"What if Mundo fought Warwick\"* post would be verboten by Narrative (other than to have someone say \"load up a game and find out).  The difference is, I don't want to risk mentioning it until I know what those lines are and you're willing to.\n\nYou're also so focused on the \"legal reasons\" thing that you seem to have forgotten that Jaredan also said it makes him \"personally sick to his stomach to use other people's material.\"  He has a high level of personal pride in coming up with his own stories and I'm also trying to respect that while also giving him and the rest of the team something about Yorick to focus on.\n \n> I imagine you were just trying to be cautious, but there's a real danger to throwing in so many \"gosh, I'm probably breaking the rules, but, maybe, can I sort of vaguely suggest that I'd like stories about, you know, Yorick and his past?

I really wasn't expecting this kind of behavior from you. I disagreed with your positions, but I never doubted your motivations.\n\nOut of respect for your request, I'll refrain from further discussion of the particulars of what I think Rioters think is okay or not okay. I say we leave it to them, and trust them to speak up as needed. They're grown-ups. They can do that. Suffice it to say that I think you're incorrect. I don't think you have \"selfish reasons\"—I think you're just very anxious to the point of error.\n\nI'm not really interested in getting in some kind of personal brawl with you over this. You're not my enemy. But if we're going to speak plainly, then I'll put it this way: you're afraid of scaring Rioters, and so you defensively buffer your posts with apologetic remarks about \"the rules\". In the process, I think you're scaring the community, spreading the idea that we can't talk about Champions except in the most abstract terms. Although I don't believe you're acting out of malice, I will say that I think you're doing harm, and should reconsider your modus operandi. The last thing we need is to make our own community paranoid about talking to Rioters. Telling people not to post \"story ideas\" is turning down the volume at a time when we're already having trouble being heard.\n\nAnd I will go further to say that, in the process, you are being deeply disrespectful to the community. You're telling content creators to hide what they've done, as though they should be ashamed of it. It's not me you need to worry about. You can yell at me all day. Go to town. The person I'm worried about is the community author or artist standing on the sidelines right now, who was all ready to come forth and pitch some ideas for a Champion, using their own work as illustration, and will now stay quiet because you've shamed them out of it. And implied that it's their fault—our fault—that Narrative hasn't interacted with us in the past, or that it will be our fault if they don't in the future. Sorry, no. This theory that Narrative staffers are delicate butterflies who are so terrified of people posting whatever \"story ideas\" might be, I don't accept it, and I think it's perverse to start making up reasons why the long silence is our fault. Stop putting these Rioters up on so high a pedestal: that's part of the problem. You're jumping at shadows, so scared of offending them that you aren't saying anything at all.\n\nI think you have the best of intentions. Or rather, you did, up unto the point where you attacked one of your own comrades.

Do you think those aspects are in conflict, or do you think they work well and create depth?\n\n(I want to read Lord Graves III's reply, but at the risk of breaching decorum, I'm also going to add in an answer of my own.)\n\nMy first thought: Picking a fight with Yorick sounds a lot like picking a fight with a construction foreman and his boys. Their job is beating up the earth all day. It's probably going to hurt when they turn that muscle and metal on you instead.\n\nMy next thought: Well, but the ghouls don't exactly have little hardhats on. Are they even clearly the souls of the dead, or just, well, omens? Maybe they're beasties from the \"other side\"?\n\nI admit I'm not really sure where his ghouls fit in storywise, especially with their horsemen-esque monikers (War, Famine, Pestilence, Death). I hadn't thought much about that. Off the cuff, I'd reach for an analogy about \"calling out the guys for a big job\". If he's a \"working\" Champion, it seems appropriate that he might have a ghoulish work-gang. As for the War/Famine/Pestilence/Death bit, I don't know. Maybe he's got an innate understanding of the forces that send jobs his way. Or maybe that's a point to add something else into the mix: he doesn't have to just be a one-note \"blue collar Champion\". Maybe those forces are tied to whatever brought him \"back\" and gave him his \"quota\".\n\nThe other thing is that, off the Fields, it's not immediately clear why Yorick would be fighting anyone. I was going to say that maybe Demacians or Ionians might get in the way of him and a job, but…that doesn't seem quite right. It's not like he has an actual army, and even as a Champion, I don't think he has the capability (or inclination) to go violating sovereign territory and taking on the heavy-hitters. I guess if Mordekaiser sent out a big army, he might follow in their wake. Perhaps he could show up in a plague-stricken area and start digging…and maybe have to fight off some local folk who don't take kindly to his spooky intrusion? But that's not exactly a recipe for an epic battle: Yorick the Champion against \"some guys\". Ehhhhhhh. Maybe if there's some controversy, e.g. Ionia wants to do its own funerary rites, and Yorick wants to do his, there might be a brawl with some Champs on the other side, and maybe he'd get backup from some other SI Champions, but it seems really hard to keep that from blowing up into a much larger fight. I guess if he appeared out of nowhere, and there were only one or two Ionian Champions nearby? It might be workable. And, unlike Demacia, Ionia might have reservations about just (e.g.) going on a smite-rampage to destroy the Shadow Isles in retaliation, figuring that such an act would cause a lot more damage to the cosmic balance. So, okay. Yeah. Might work. I take it back; I can see how Yorick might get into a fight off the Fields.\n\nOr, oooh, hey. Another idea for him getting into fights. It seems pretty clear that the Isles aren't totally monolithic. For example, Morde/Hecarim/Thresh seem to have a decidedly more (from a human perspective) \"malevolent\" attitude toward the dead, turning them into armies with which to conquer the mortal world. Maybe Yorick gets into fights with them sometimes over souls.

I dunno!\n\nI actually really like your idea, BioLuminescence, about Yorick, because that to me is more \"Yorick\" than him being a necromancer or an overlord would ever be.\n\nYorick to me is an undertaker through and through. I think Yorick is one of the only \"good\" Shadow Islers, because he is the one who puts them to rest. Rather than commanding the undead, forcing them against their will or being this overlord of sorts, I see them flocking to him because he's the only one who can peacefully put them to their final rest, as is the job of an undertaker. When the closest idea to a peaceful respite is threatened, his ghouls don't take very kindly to that, and the fact that Yorick himself wants to be remembered and to be a prominent figure, they in turn want to give Yorick the same form of respite he has given them for the centuries.\n\nThere is no undertaker better than the Mori family lineage, they have been undertakers for as long as they could remember, and I don't want Yorick to become a necromancer, or to become an overlord, or to become really anything all that amazingly special, I want him to be remembered because of who he is, what he does and what he will do: He will make you remember the name Yorick Mori. If Yorick used necromancy as a mortician, though, that can help add to the caretaker of the undead, this big lumbering guy just sort of lumbering towards you, and the fact that Yorick's the only undead who is confirmed to still have emotions and a soul (He cried in his judgement, despite not knowing why he cried). Heck, you can even tie why he's a bass player to the very same idea of how he stirs the undead, unlike a guitar, a bass will reverberate your chest, your very heart (you can tell Steve Harris at an Iron Maiden concert because of how your bones shake when he plucks his strings), and rather than being all screechy and nyer-na-nyer through the fire and the flames, it's much more muddled, much more thumping, much more soggy but he is the best at what he does, despite the fact that others may not appreciate it as much as he does.\n\nYorick's just a guy doing his job, and there's nothing wrong with that. He's a champion because he's the damn best at his job, and I wouldn't want that to be taken away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2015-03-20T23:03:49.181+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has anyone at Narrative read The Goon?

He's got the same feel as Edgar Allen Poe's Lenore (if you know the history of it and don't take it as just a love poem), or Neil Gaiman's Bitter Grounds. Or Lovecraft's The Outsider. \nHe isn't dark or scary or terrifying. He isn't monstrous. He's sad. If the shadow isles are a gothic cathedral lit by thunder and lightning on a rainy night, he isn't the figure lurking at the pulpit or the rotting photographs that watch you as you pass. He's the crumbling masonry that reminds you that this used to be something great and whole, the vague memory of what once *had* been but now is not.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that Yorick shouldn't be dark.

At least thats my experience. Im a first generation college student for my family. Lot of beefy blue collar guys who should not be messed with in my family and community. EDIT: Most of those guys are perfectly friendly too. Fighting them just probably isn't a great idea. I always liked that yorick is smiling a reletively pleasant smile in his champ art.\n\nOn the other hand, I likely shouldn't be held as Yorick core audience. I love the champion in theory,  but the gameplay end never really held up for me, and his personality didn't seem *that* gripping. There are serious diehard yorick fans out there though. I've always sorta felt like Yorick wasn't living up to his potential gameplay wise.\n\nFurther edits....\nI have some trouble connecting with a champion if I can't get into their combat style and fantasy involved there. The absolute best for me is when personality, and backstory, and gameplay all feed into each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ltank129","date":"2015-03-21T04:30:56.126+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion it magnifies it.

Or are there other themes that really draw you to Yorick?\n\nWell...\n\n* There is a definite lack of appreciation for the blue collar ethic.  The fact that such a champion exists in a video game like League is really awesome.\n* As a kid, I was drawn to ancient mythology, be it Greek, Roman, Norse, Japanese, etc.  One of my favorite stories was the tale of Sisyphus, the man condemned to an endless task in Hades for outsmarting the gods.  I see similarities to Yorick there, along with the Charon/ferryman aspect.\n* As I said in the opening post, Yorick should be the one resident of the Shadow Isles that best relates to mortals, since he's an undead version of Helmet Bro (Vel'Koz's constant victim).  He buries the dead and leads them to the afterlife.  There are tales that can be derived from that.\n* There's something compelling, to me at least, about a character who is as different as possible than anyone else.  Just about every other champion in League has power or seeks power in some way.  Then, there's Yorick, who was resurrected by the Shadow Isles to fulfill a task, one that does not require extra power from the island.  The possibilities would be exciting.\n* Then, there's the institutionalized hate within Riot itself for Yorick.  Not getting a new skin since launch nearly 4 years ago, over two years since he was put on free week and Morello once saying he wished Yorick was never released.  Yorick  is also a long waiting denizen of the hell that is the \"Rework List.\"  I do like an underdog, even though Yorick was the champion that kept me interested in playing League after the first few weeks.\n\nI'd go further into detail, but I might be providing actual story ideas and I don't want to do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2015-03-20T13:47:00.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I find Yorick's visual design to be antiquated; there's very little focus to his shape, theme or in-game read. One of the more prominent features of his model appears to be the lantern strapped to his back, yet it plays no role in his kit nor does it react when he attacks or casts spells. Likewise the shovel – which players link to his character – isn’t used for anything other than his Q.

Bring in the ethereal green/blue wisps of spirit energy, and make it seem as though Yorick is a corpse animated by the Isles’ power. Likewise, make him appear to pour that power into the earth in order to summon minions. His visual style and theme will be all the more cohesive for it. \n\nGameplay wise, there seems to be a clash of archetypes between Yorick being an undead bruiser due to his hunch-back shovel-hitting stature, and a necromancer with his ghouls. Given that Sion is already League’s undead Juggernaut, there’s reasonable cause to think Yorick should be pushed towards being the Necromancer of the game. The way the ghouls work currently allows Yorick to punish his lane enemies too easy as soon as they try to farm or get within cast range.

Every other champion is a legendary beast, a mighty warrior, an ancient myth, a nightmare story told to whimpering children. All of these champions are powerful, might beings, with unknown might, and unknown goals. But what does Yorick do? He digs graves. He doesn't go around destroying entire towns, he doesn't lead mighty armies, he doesn't create fantastical magic items, or technologies, he just digs graves. Why does he dig graves? Because graves need to be dug. People are always dying, and they need to go somewhere. \n\nYorick is interesting BECAUSE of his contrast to other characters, especially Shadow Isle characters. The creatures of the Shadow Isles always seem wicked, and sinister, but Yorick is just there, doing his job. He seems like one of the only Shadow Isles champions that you could run into and he wouldn't kill you/torture you/enslave you/feast on your soul/lifeblood. Yorick simply has better things to do. Yorick simply can't be bothered with conflict, or plots, and plans, he has graves to dig, he's too busy for this. He's a perfect example of the \"I'm too old for this sh*t.\" Character, which is a really cool character concept, because that sort of character is the one who has, in this case maybe literally, seen it ALL. He's been everywhere, seen everything, and it's impossible to surprise him anymore. Yorick seems kinda like this sort of Runeterra-wide legend, he goes where graves need to be dug, and he digs graves. He's a bad omen, he's bad luck, where he goes, War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death follow him(Thus the names of his ghouls!). Similar to how Bard goes around watching over ancient artifacts, and mighty relics to keep the world from falling into chaos, so too does Yorick go around ensuring the souls of the dead don't roam free willy nilly. He puts bodies in the ground, and makes sure their souls move on.\n\nWhich leads into some FANTASTIC story opportunities for him. His ghouls may not just be dead people, they may actually be representations of War, Pestilence, and Famine. Yorick's powers stem from the power of death, all the things that cause it. His job is to send dead souls to where they need to go, so what happens when they get redirected? Or start wandering where they shouldn't? Yorick is the guy who would go handle that. Beings like Thresh, Kalista, Mordekaiser etc. these people take, twist, and command the souls of others. So would Yorick go after them? Would he free the souls from their command, and send them to their inevitable destination? Or does he see them as just a different sort of destination for souls? Does it not matter where they go, as long as they don't roam free on their own?\n\nYorick has tons of opportunity, because he has such a simple, but focused job. Yorick digs graves. He's the creepy old grave digger whose been everywhere and back, and simply doesn't care about most things anymore, because he's got a job to do, and he'll be dammed(again) if it doesn't get done.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BastionKross","date":"2015-03-21T03:47:24.138+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick Mori has pride.
