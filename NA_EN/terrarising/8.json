Here's one I made a month ago on Reddit.\r\n\r\nElements Master Yorick:\r\n\r\nGun Goddess Miss Fortune - level \"Ultimate\" skin.  (2250 RP)\r\n\r\nThis version of Yorick commands the elements in the same way the original skin commands the Shadow Isles Mist.  Story could be that Mordekaiser unleashed the raw power of the four elements onto the Blessed Isles instead of the mist and that Yorick was one of the few beings not in Morde's army to survive.  (This skin could be part of a *\"Shadow Elementals\"* set with Hecarim, Thresh, Kalista, Morde, Karthus, etc...)\r\n\r\nThe main difference between this skin and Elementalist Lux is that she manipulates the higher, prettier parts of each element while Yorick channels the deeper, primal energies of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe four parts of the skin:\r\n\r\n* **Pyromancer Yorick:**  Ghouls are bright orange, if not walking and hissing fireballs.  Yorick's armor is orange and yellow and his shovel is shaped like a flame.  Maiden is a stylized fireball and her particles are a dark orange/red.\r\n\r\n* **Hydromancer Yorick:**  Ghouls are light blue, if not splashing water blobs.  Yorick's armor is deep blue and green and his shovel is shaped like a water drop.  Maiden is a brighter mist, more blue than black, and her particles are more ocean like.\r\n\r\n* **Terramancer Yorick:**  Ghouls are dust clouds or mud men, Yorick's armor is more brown and beige, with bits of roots and sticks coming out of appropriate places, and his shovel is shaped like a tree's root ball.  Maiden is a dust (sandy) cloud and there are tan and yellow particles.\r\n\r\n* **Aeromancer Yorick:**  Ghouls are bright grey and cloud-like, not the sickly grey of the base skin.  Yorick's armor is bright grey and light blue and his shovel is shaped like a hurricane cloud.  Maiden is a bright grey creature, maybe with a spinning base, and grey particles.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2019-10-15T22:35:12.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate all the thought that went into this concept!  I think the \"mud men\" ghouls was my favorite touch.  Overall I think the way you compartmentalized the elements into expressible aspects of his kit (armor, ghouls, shovel) was clever.\n\nThanks for sharing this with the community!","replies":[]},{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-10-15T19:17:49.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean yeah, it's a cool concept but it's not _original_ which is a pretty important thing for an Ultimate skin to be.\n\n That's the reason why GGMF was received so poorly, because the skin wasn't up to par with other entries of that tier and it wasn't groundbreakingly original. It's just MF in a suit with sub-par VFX.","replies":[]}]}
