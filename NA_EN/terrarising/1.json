So, here it is.\n\nFans of Riot's lore, what do we want to talk about with Narrative?  What's most pressing on our minds?\n\nConsider all topic suggestions on the table and we'll let Narrative pick and choose.\n\nJust act respectful, please.  There's a lot of anger and frustration here (from me as well), but we don't need to run anyone off before the conversation starts.\n--------\n\nEDIT:\nThank you everyone for your responses.  I'm glad to see that there's so much passion for the lore of League and I hope that Narrative and Riot Games understands that.  I hope that, while we may be frustrated and bitter, we do want the overall story to succeed and thrive.\n\nSecondly, I chose to condense these questions into shorter, easier to digest formats.  I don't think it's fair to simply copy/paste entire passages as Narrative can simply read them by scrolling down.  Some may feel that I'm not being true to their questions, but compromises must be made. \n\nForum questions for Narrative:\n\n1.  There are a lot of questions about what remains of the story, [post-Retcon](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra).  Specifically:\n  *   Are the League Judgements and the old Journal of Justice no longer \"canon?\"  Will the League Judgments play a part in future lore reworks?\n  *   What are the relations between regions and nations within Runeterra without an Institute of War?\n  *   What will happen to Jax, Cho'Gath, Brand, Fiddlesticks, and all of the other champions directly tied to the Institute of War?  Will resolving these stories (along with Singed) be an immediate priority for the Narrative team?\n  *   There is confusion on relationships established by previous lore teams, from Katarina and Garen to Ahri and Wukong.  Will these relationships just be abandoned due to the retcon or will they possibly be reestablished at some future time?\n1. What is Narrative's plan for releasing new content?  Will new stories have to be tied with events like reworks, Shurima, etc?  Will revised bios need to be connected with these events or can they be fixed independently?  Does Riot (as a whole) want these new bios released this way?\n1. There are a number of requests for an updated map of Runeterra and a new timeline of events.  Is this possible?\n2. What will be the overall tone of the new League of Legends world?  Serious, comical, a balanced approach?\n3. When all tech and creative issues are resolved, what will be the best way for new fans interested in League's Lore to find these new stories?  The in-game client doesn't have much in the way of linking fans to the story.\n4. What is the exact state of \"summoners\" in League, post-Retcon?  There is much confusion on whether Summoners actually exist in the new story and what their role is, if any.  \n  *   Related to that, what is the \"League of Legends\" supposed to be if not a device to resolve political conflicts.  What is the player's role in the game?\n5. Why did Narrative choose to retcon the Institute of War out of existence rather than have an event that destroyed it?  What was the debate that supposedly happened within the Narrative team?  Why weren't lore fans included in that discussion?\n6. What are Narrative's priorities when rewriting a champion?  Is there a priority on keeping as much of the original champion concept as possible?  Will the change to Xerath's story (from original to current) be par for the course?\n7. Which champion bios are the highest priority for Narrative to rework?  Does this priority list come from within Narrative, from Foundations or from some other source at Riot?\n8. Why is Jaredan the only person from Narrative posting on the boards?  Isn't there a team working on this?\n9. What is the status on the tech issues preventing the release of revised bios and lore?\n10. Which parts of Runeterra and Valoran can we provide suggestions for?  Is anything/nothing on the table for us to discuss with Narrative and/or Foundations?\n11. What is the actual state of Narrative right now?  Without going into excruciating detail, how many current people were with Narrative at the time of the retcon and how many are new?\n11. What was the topic Jaredan was going to discuss with us before the Valoranian Death-Flu struck?\n\nIf anyone feels like I've missed a question posed here, please feel free to let me know.\n\nAgain, everyone, thank you for responding and keeping it civil... mostly. :)\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nGiven the recent announcement in Ant In Oz's post about not being able to discuss story ideas for legal reasons, I think it's important to have this clarified as much as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Melancholy Exile","date":"2015-02-02T16:50:46.881+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think what I would like to see discussed is Riot's plans for actually welding the old Runeterra to the new one. We've seen them expand on areas that went relatively untouched before, but now there are a number of continuity snarls in the lore where major events that are confirmed to still be canon took place despite what happened before relying heavily on the role of the League of Legends. It just doesn't feel right to shove these things into the \"sort it later\" pile while the focus goes entirely onto the new and shiny stuff.\n\nI'd also like to see a discussion about how Riot plans to move forward in terms of inter-state relations. The Freljord, Shurima and now Bilgewater have all been presented to us in very isolated events that, Cassiopeia's presence aside, feel totally self-contained. I think it would be good to hear from them how they mean to go about picking up things like the Demacia/Noxus conflict again in the new Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"not a starburst","date":"2015-02-02T23:50:20.864+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"So much this.\nI'm okay with the lore getting changed, because frankly some of it was pretty terrible *cough* **Jax ** *cough* or riddled with inconsistencies (hi Singed).\nThe problem, as I see it, is that Riot *seems* to be going the wrong way on Lore.\n\nThere's no world that these champions exist in.\n\nLore got deleted. There's nothing left of lore that could reasonably considered canon except a handful of bios, some short stories, and a smattering of other work. These champions exist only in a vacuum, largely without interaction. People genuinely interested in lore have to painfully work their way backwards and extrapolate what they can from it. \n\nLet me be **very** clear in what I want from Riot. I want to know what the *world* the champions inhabit is like before I know more about the champions themselves. What's Demacia like? Where *are* the Shadow Isles? What were the Frozen Watchers? Did the Rune Wars actually happen? Are Yordles aliens or native to Runeterra? Riot has produced *spectacularly* good products around individual champions or groups of champions, and done a good job fleshing out Shurima. I want to see it on a larger scale.\n\nRiot is constructing meaningful narratives around champions, which is great, but that task is made infinitely harder when there's not really any *setting* for that narrative. Try writing Lord of the Rings without ever seriously mentioning Middle-Earth. That's what this looks a lot like on occasion. Maybe there are other factors affecting the process of storymaking, but since that hasn't been shared with us, I'm forced to guess what Noxus is like from the hints dropped in other work.\n\nThat, or they *have* figured it out, and they haven't shared it. Which, admittedly, given the track record Narrative has, is a possibility. I hope not. Riot is generally a responsive, honest, and open company. Narrative's relationship with the fanbase has been rocky since the retcon, but I'm fairly certain they can do this right.\n\nAnd Riot? If you want to talk to us, I advise and hope that you talk to us frankly about what's going on, what your thoughts are, and ask for input. The buck stops with you, obviously, and you can choose what feedback to take and not take, but please give us some a real update about where lore is and announce it like you announced the retcon. The Biography talk thing was great. More pls.","replies":[{"poster":"VardenSalad","date":"2015-02-03T06:40:22.093+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can you hate on Jax's lore? He's assumed to be the previous High Councilor of the league in disguise, having decided to affect events in Valoran in the physical arena instead of the political one. He was the best the League had ever seen, so much so that they handicapped his abilities by making him fight with a lamppost (or Nerf weapons).\n\nThe League rescinded the restrictions; Jax proceeded to smash heads with the same lamppost as a big 'Fuck you'.\n\nIn terms of lore in League, I don't think anyone had problems with Jax's lore. Pretty heavy stuff, actually, considering who Jax is supposed to be.","replies":[{"poster":"not a starburst","date":"2015-02-03T07:07:48.683+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He's assumed to be the previous High Councilor of the league in disguise,\n\nYes, but the lore needs to reflect that on a more fundamental level. Like, I *love* Jax, but I really don't like his lore. He could be so much more 'mysterious warrior dude' that everyone is *pretty sure* is the High Councillor or someone else because I guess League's not a thing. I mean, they barely even hint at it, and they just don't take him as a character anywhere.\nLiterally all we knew  about him was that he was a dude who was *probably* the former High Councillor, and that he liked to drink with Gragas. And he fights with a lamppost.\n\nHe also had three fingers on each hand? And what's with his mask? It's not consistent. In his in game model he has seven eyes, in the splash he has six, and in the cinematic he has *eight*. And are they his eyes or just some property of his helmet? *And why does he have purple skin*? And if this dude was the High Councillor, was the High Councillor human? If he wasn't, what on earth is he? Not Yordle, Troll, or human, certainly. And if he's not one of the three, why is he an \"unremarkable soldier-for-hire\" when very clearly the fact that he's clearly a member of another species (or masquerading as one) is remarkable all on its own?\n\nThe lore adresses none of this. Which was my complaint about old lore.\nOf course, new lore doesn't address it either. Which is my complaint about new lore.\n\nCome to think of it, Jax could use a VU.\n\n...rito pls. Karthus and Sion-style VU on Jax.","replies":[{"poster":"VardenSalad","date":"2015-02-03T07:16:55.817+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you want all that in the lore, I'll advise you to turn back now.

Which doesn't exist anymore. Because I don't know why.\n\nThe client lore was never good. Soon, all the lore will be likewise.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"quazymoodo","date":"2015-02-02T17:53:09.839+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Lore needs to be clearly defined after the post retcon.\n\n1.) The Institute of War is gone. Does this mean they scrapped all the lore in the judgements? Are they scrapping They battle of Kalamadas, the Battle of Ionia, and the Journal of Justice? Which parts will be left canon, and how much needs to be rewritten and reorganized for the faction tension of Noxus vs. Demacia, Piltover vs. Zaum, \"Summoner's Rift\" and the Crystal Scar, etc.\n\nI've noticed since the retcon, they've been avoiding regions affected by the Institute of War's lore, and instead putting focus in less fleshed out areas like Freljord (home to a bunch of characters with loosely-connected lore, now brought together with Lissandra and the Three Sisters stories) and Shurima (Same thing but with Azir and Ascension.) You could also say with Harrowing, Kalista and the Maokai VU brought us up to date on the Shadow Isles a bit.\n\nIf they continue this, they may put more focus on Ionia of Bilgewater, or start delving into Uristan & Icathia (Time & Space) since they've done a good job fleshing out the lore in Southern Valoran.\n\nIt'd be nice to see Demacia and Noxus brought back into the story more, seeing how they've been neglected since Kalamadas.\n\nAlso, champions such as Fiddlesticks, Nocturne, Shaco, Brand, Ezreal, Zilean, Taric, and Annie all need lore updates ASAP. They all dealt with Summoner Magic in some way, shape or form, and if they've been retconned, everything they've done needs to be refocused.\n\n2.) An updated world map would also be really -really- helpful. The Institute of War has been removed from the game, but is still located on the map. Also, areas such as the Fyrone Flats, Kumungu & the Plague Jungles, the Voodoo Lands, Tempest Flats, Uristan & icathia, Mount Gargantuan & the Great Barrier, Kaladoun & the Bubbling Bog,  and most regions on the exterior of the city-states and regions are all severely underutilized, with little to no champion lore in each zone. There may be one our two like in areas like Kumungu and Icathia, but not enough to give it a real story. A planetary map would be nice as well for space since we have the angels ({{champion:10}} {{champion:25}} ) and the void in space/\"alternate dimensions\" (rito pls no).\n\n3.) A timeline.\n\n-Darkin\n-Three Sisters\n-Uristan\n-Shurima\n-Void\n-Rune Wars\n-Demacia, Noxus, Piltover, Zaun, Ionia, New Freljord, Bilgewater, Ionia, Bandle City, formation periods, internal wars, etc.\n-Kalamadas, Noxo-Ionian War(s)\n-Shadow Isles\n-Icathia\n-Et cetera\n\n4.) Where are the Shadow Isles? Originally they were Northwest of Demacia and terrorized villages and hamlets, but with the Harrowing, it was located Southeast of Bilgewater, attacking the city. Does this mean that Runeterra breaks navigation laws, and the maps spins eerily around until it reaches Bilgewater? or has it's canonical placement changed?\n\n5.) Is the yordle Mothership and theory of \"yordles are aliens\" still canon? or is the theory of yordle evolution on Runeterra (Gnar) now the new canon?\n\n6.) Is Ryze's Scroll's maker Lilith still canon? Who is/was the Ruined King? What black goo corrupted Nautilus (and why is he the rival of the fish)? Who will give Nami her Moonstone? Is the next city-state Fizz's Aquarium-city?! Is Rammus an Ascendant Guardian/Watcher/Curator?! Will Blitzcrank's Dating Service still be canon?!

Every player could dig into lore, learning about their favourite champions and the world of Runeterra.\n\nNow the narrative is done through occasional promo content before champion releases. Sometimes it's promo sites (Sion's and Rek'Sai's were great at it), sometimes it's videos - but there is no easy way to get the old content.

One thing I liked about the JoJ in particular was it proved that the world wasn't static and that champions did go out and do things and were generally normal people.

Things like...\n\n- Gragas and Tryndamere working out a trade agreement.\n- Garen saving Katarina's life during the Kalamanda incident.\n- Blitzcrank's Dating Service pairing Rammus with a cactus.\n- Morgana trying to politicize a swimsuit contest.\n- Veigar trying to steal the Yordle mothership with balloons.\n- Janna stealing Nidalee's boyfriend.\n- Annie doing a spot for toothpaste.\n\nOr they just give us little bits of background we didn't know, like...\n\n- Janna and Zilean race airships competitively.\n- Akali really does have nursing experience.\n- Kayle (and likely Morgana) can't get sick because of her race's biology.\n\nThese are the things, the little things, that make the lore seem alive, active, and meaningful.  The new lore, like it or hate it, good or bad, amounts to 'This is the champion and how they became who they are.'  But that's only one part of the story.

What are Narrative's priorities when rewriting a champion?  Is there a priority on keeping as much of the original champion concept as possible?  Will the change to Xerath's story (from original to current) be par for the course?\n\nOur priority is always creating the best character, story and experience possible for the players. There is a priority on keeping the essence of the character whenever possible. Sometimes we (Narrative, Riot, and the players) will disagree, sometimes we'll agree, but creating enthralling characters and stories is always the goal.\n\n> 7. Which champion bios are the highest priority for Narrative to rework?  Does this priority list come from within Narrative, from Foundations or from some other source at Riot?\nThere are a number of priorities, almost always dependent on the work being done by teams on ridiculously cool stuff that you will see soon. In some cases, very soon. Those priorities are decided by the team, which includes Narrative.\n\nTo help clear up some confusion that I think has arisen, Foundations is a team that includes members of Narrative. It includes Rioters from across the company, from various disciplines and numerous teams. Internally, when we say \"team\" we mean product team, a bunch of people from different disciplines who are making something for players. A discipline is a collection of people form the same craft. Therefore, Narrative is a collection of folks who specialize in character, story and thematic cohesion. When a member of Narrative works on Champion team, for example, they work with artists, game designers, producers and many more to help bring the champion to fruition.\n\nWhen priorities are set, it is not by Narrative alone, it is by Narrative in conjunction with other disciplines who come together on product teams. Riot, as a whole, works very closely together.\n\nI hope that helped clarify things a bit.\n\nIn regard to which ones we want to tackle the most, it's those champions who have been effected greatly by the changes to Runeterra. \n\n> 8. Why is Jaredan the only person from Narrative posting on the boards?  Isn't there a team working on this?\n\nIt's a team that's not quite as big as you might think, mainly due to the rapid changes that we're working on in both structure, organization, process and staffing. We're working towards being more communicative with more consistency, and you'll see a few new names soon. For example, Loping Cinder will be having a chat about Bard as he was the principal Narrative member of the Champ team that's bringing my favorite cosmic wanderer to Runeterra. Essentially though, Narrative is a very busy place to be (it's very exciting too).  What we want to speak of is new stories, champions and more.  I apologize as I sometimes get the feeling that I'm sounding like a broken record to many of you. Until we are getting the stories to you with more regularity, it's challenging to be otherwise.\n\n\n> 9. What is the status on the tech issues preventing the release of revised bios and lore?\n\nSolutions are in process. I can't give an ETA as when I've done so in the past, well, you know what's happened.\n\n> 10. Which parts of Runeterra and Valoran can we provide suggestions for?  Is anything/nothing on the table for us to discuss with Narrative and/or Foundations?\n\nThere are just certain things we can respond to and other things we can't. It's not as much the topic as it is the way we engage about it. I know Ant in Oz riled some folks when saying that we can't read fan-fiction. I can understand how that might appear, but it's just a truth of being a professional writer. It's partly due to the legality of it, but also because using other people's ideas, even accidentally, is stomach churning to a creative writer. Talking about already created stories and characters, talking about the essences of people and places of Runeterra, it's all good. Pitching an idea for a story you want us to tell? Not so much.\n\n> 11. What is the actual state of Narrative right now?  Without going into excruciating detail, how many current people were with Narrative at the time of the retcon and how many are new?\n\nI'm not going to go into numbers, partly because it's misleading. The value of the number changes due to the context of need. What I will say is that there are some new members of the discipline, and there will be more very soon. The most important aspect, for me, is that we are a discipline that needs to respond to some amazing opportunities to bring unadulterated awesome to our players, and we are committed to growing the arse-kicking squad of talent to do it.\n\n> 11. What was the topic Jaredan was going to discuss with us before the Valoranian Death-Flu struck?\n\nIt was actually Demacian Death-Flu. It was Garen's fault for coming into work when he was sick. I was just going to ask what people wanted to talk about in relation to what champions are of most interest. Ant in Oz was kind enough to post along those lines so I could concentrate on why my stomach was crawling out my throat. I popped in to make a few responses about my ongoing adoration of Ashe (it's really getting unhealthy), but things worked against me spending time here recently.\n\nI hope my answers have been of some use. I know they are not as specific as many would like (including myself, I'm a bugger for spoilers; I've been biting my lip about Bard for ages, and I still am). It's not because I don't want to answer in detail, it simply would be irresponsible of me to go into things that hard-working Rioters are waist-deep on right now.\n\nNext week, as well as just catching up posting in a few threads, I want to put up a fun post about something I know a couple of us do in regard to getting to the heart of characters that we're creating, or when we're taking a fresh look at old favorites. \n\nThank you for your patience, and particularly I want to thank those in the community who have been striving to ensure our discussions are civil and positive.

Not so much.\n\nThanks for clarifying this: that you don't want people pitching specific stories, but that you're happy to talk about the lore of League, its characters, and its settings, or take suggestions on those topics. I checked with some of my IP law friends just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and yeah, it sounded really odd when it seemed you guys were saying \"we are not allowed to discuss the lore of League of Legends with the community, because we'd be sued if we used any ideas arising from the discussion.\" Were that true, it would be a pretty obvious gg wp for community interaction, and a quite dramatic indictment of the IP regime. I was pretty sure it wasn't true, but I wanted to make sure that members of Narrative were not under the impression that it was, and encourage them to talk to Riot's (presumably very good) legal team for clarification as needed. As I wrote before, a lawyer who casually tells a client never to do anything because there \"might be some risk that someone could file a lawsuit\" is really failing as an advocate, IMO.\n\nStrict legality aside, I do appreciate the associated issue of artistic ethics. That said, I'm pretty sure anybody who's posting in a \"let's talk about lore\" thread would be tickled pink to have you use their ideas. Even as for specific stories, for example, I consider myself in no position (moral or legal) to try to stop Riot from using anything I've written in **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)**: we're telling spinoff community stories in your universe, and we're glad for your support in that regard, and I cannot conceive of the levels of presumption and arrogance it would require for me to tell you not to use our material. We're grateful that you let us do our thing, and I am very happy if in some small way I can \"give back\" by providing you with some inspiration. Indeed, I started Factions principally as a proof of concept to help encourage Riot to do something similar; it's grown beyond that \"proof of concept\" status, I think, but it's still part of the idea.\n\nOn the one hand, I get the anxieties about appropriating others' ideas without consent. On the other hand, I think the much bigger threat is that this sort of anxiety can stifle creativity and collaboration. League's lore is itself mostly a pastiche of borrowed tropes, and I think that's part of the fun of it: tropetastic stories like that are great for rapidly conveying meaning to audiences, because the use of common cultural touchstones (the elven archer, the dark knight, the heroic paladin, the fallen angel) allows one to trigger a reaction rooted in a very deep cultural and artistic history. For that matter, Factions represents a microcosm of this concept: the Factions community can come together and explore a shared world because we're all familiar with the basics (the Champions, the factions) and can use that common vocabulary to tell stories. Sometimes, I think \"fanfic\" gets hated on for being \"unoriginal\"; that is indeed a drawback of fanfic, and roleplaying communities set in established settings, but I think part of why such things are popular is precisely because the shared setting provides a common foundation.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad we got that resolved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Verandure","date":"2015-02-03T09:03:09.099+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"-Worldbuilding through updated cartography\n-Integration of the new lore into what is going to carry over from the old lore\n-How in the heck Runeterra is able to still function with all of these disasters and genocide-driven characters running about\n\n-In the future, characters playing off one another rather than existing in a vacuum.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-02-03T12:50:45.165+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.... why aren't the champions/characters who are all... like burn the world... either dead or... burning the world....??","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-02-28T23:09:25.479+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":12,"body":"Hi all, sorry for my absence lately. Thank you Terra for putting this list together. I'll do my best to answer what I can.\n\n>  1.  There are a lot of questions about what remains of the story, [post-Retcon](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra).  Specifically:\n>  *   Are the League Judgements and the old Journal of Justice no longer \"canon?\"  Will the League Judgments play a part in future lore reworks?\n>  *   What are the relations between regions and nations within Runeterra without an Institute of War?\n>  *   What will happen to Jax, Cho'Gath, Brand, Fiddlesticks, and all of the other champions directly tied to the Institute of War?  Will resolving these stories (along with Singed) be an immediate priority for the Narrative team?\n>  *   There is confusion on relationships established by previous lore teams, from Katarina and Garen to Ahri and Wukong.  Will these relationships just be abandoned due to the retcon or will they possibly be reestablished at some future time?\n\nThe Judgements and the JoJ cannot be counted as canon any longer. However, we will be drawing upon those stories as we explore the new world and many things will be easily recognizable to aficionados of the previous lore. Each current and previous interpretation of the champions will be included in our thinking as we move forward.\n\nChampions who are directly linked to the IoW to the point their stories are inextricable will receive an update to their stories to reflect the change to the story world of Runeterra.\n\nRelationships that have been established previously will continue if the story is compelling (personally, I'm a big fan of Garen and Kat). In fact, how our champions interact with each other will drive a lot of stories and should impact the world around them. They're not your average bunch of folks, after all.\n\nThe relations between regions and factions without the Institute of War will be entirely dependent on the individual personalities and societies. Similar conflicts that you know of will occur, they just won't be passing through the filter or buffer of the IoW. Noxus and Ionia are not the best of friends, for example. How are Piltover and Zaun functioning in relation to each other? What kind of intrigue and friction occurs between them? Where are they similar? We will explore those ideas through stories driven by characters both longstanding and new.\n\n> 1. What is Narrative's plan for releasing new content?  Will new stories have to be tied with events like reworks, Shurima, etc?  Will revised bios need to be connected with these events or can they be fixed independently?  Does Riot (as a whole) want these new bios released this way?\n\nNew stories do not have to be tied to events like Shurima, etc. To give you the reason why this happens, it's simply an optimal use of resources. The Narrative discipline does not work independently from the rest of Riot. We produce stories, characters and drive thematic cohesion across a variety of teams. If one of those teams (Events, for example), is working on something like The Harrowing, it's a good opportunity for the Narrative folks working on it to also do the work on updating related bios. I can tell you that we're working on developing a bio format after listening to your feedback on the shorter character intros. We're also working with a team on implementing them, but we have a lot of champs and that will take some time.\n\n>  1. There are a number of requests for an updated map of Runeterra and a new timeline of events.  Is this possible?\n\nYes it is, and there have been some glimpses. You may have seen the Bilgewater map that was released at the time of The Harrowing as well as a look at the once great empire of Shurima with the release of Rek'Sai. A timeline of events is one of the aspects of Runeterra that is being explored, but is not currently ready.\n\n>  2. What will be the overall tone of the new League of Legends world?  Serious, comical, a balanced approach?\nAll of the above, depending on the story and champion involved. League of Legends' tone is a kaleidoscope, it just depends on the story being told at the time and the style we use to tell it.\n\n> 3. When all tech and creative issues are resolved, what will be the best way for new fans interested in League's Lore to find these new stories?  The in-game client doesn't have much in the way of linking fans to the story.\n\nCurrently, we are planning on the client being a place for players to get a good initial understanding of the champion and then have stories that put the character through his or her paces on the web. A link from client to the champion's web page is part of the plan whose implementation is currently being sorted out.\n\n>  4. What is the exact state of \"summoners\" in League, post-Retcon?  There is much confusion on whether Summoners actually exist in the new story and what their role is, if any. \n>   *   Related to that, what is the \"League of Legends\" supposed to be if not a device to resolve political conflicts.  What is the player's role in the game?\n\nSummoners are a part of the story of Runeterra, they have not been removed as a part of the world, but they are different. I can't speak to their role due to work being done in that regard that will be seen in the future. Sorry to be so vague, it's just not ready for us to release yet.\n\nThe player's role in the game is as the game defines it. The context that the story world brings to the game is something we will be talking about, but not just yet, sorry.\n\n>  5. Why did Narrative choose to retcon the Institute of War out of existence rather than have an event that destroyed it?  What was the debate that supposedly happened within the Narrative team?  Why weren't lore fans included in that discussion?\n\nFirst of all, the decision to remove the IoW and begin a new story world of Runeterra was not Narrative's alone. Rioters from many different teams have been involved in the discussion. It essentially came down to the difficulties beyond just removing the IoW. If we just wanted to remove the IoW, destroying it through some disaster, political maneuvering, or war, it would have been its own story to explore. However, there were a number of problems this caused with other plans we have for stories going forward. \n\nIn addition, there are a number of things unrelated to the IoW that we want to work on that individually could have enough of a profound effect that they would themselves necessitate the action we took. At the very least, many of those changes would necessitate creating stories just to explain changes, which is never a good starting point for a story. There were many threads that could cause many other things to unravel.\nWith all that in mind, it was decided that an approach that would take care of all of those issues at once, and free Riot to build anew, was the best way to go. Hence the decision that was made. I'm sorry I can't go into each of the individual cases as they're pertinent to stories we plan on telling.\n\nTo be continued!","replies":[{"poster":"Kuro Banshee","date":"2015-03-01T07:55:59.576+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"You have the gall to tell us that the IoW was such a constraint that educated and motivated professionals were unable to tell stories with it being in place.

Oh and, as I'll point out in my later post, I don't want to reveal how few people we have on Narrative, because you guys are going to rightfully rip us a new one on that and point out that **we shouldn't have retconned the lore if we weren't ready to produce**.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, that is the most important fact. You guys fucked up majorly by retconning with nothing to show for it. And now we're nearly 6 months later, and you've done pretty much nothing to alleviate any worries that the community had. You may as well pack lore up and throw it away at this point, because you've alienated the people you're actually producing this stuff for by your lack of communication and your constant requests of \"Please bear with us, as we get better at communicating.\"\n\nThere is no nice way to put it, you guys aren't handling this well at all and it's pushing people away in droves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cold ravioli","date":"2015-03-01T01:21:52.507+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get at least some form of ETA on some of this stuff?

Its clear that you're hell-bent and it happening regardless of the deluge of negative feedback you no doubt can see, so why bother telling us about it when it was clearly in a conceptual stage at best. It wasnt to get our feedback and opinions, because you've dismissed all of those time and time again. \n\nThe only thing it has accomplished was to break the lore over its knee for over 6 months with nothing to show for it. Freljord, Sion, and Shurima(*gag*) events all could have just as easily happened with the IoW, you've presented no story that could not have been compatible with the old lore. \n\nYou say that to destroy the IoW would be too complicated/too much work, but then say that every champ with ties to the IoW will get an updated story. How does that make sense? Oh and its been **months** since the recton has been announced and NONE of those champions have received an update. \n\nSo why are you here exactly? You dodge our questions with \"cant talk about it yet\" and refuse to budge on the subject that is almost universally loathed. So what are you here to do? Just remind us that our feedback is worthless and string us along with more promises of an interesting future?\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to be a dick here btw, I'm just trying to understand your logic behind this, because it MAY make sense to you, having more information from behind the scenes, but from my prospective it baffles me that you can defend this with such certainty and without regret.\n\nI want to believe that you know what youre doing and that this will all work out in the end, I really do, but so far you've only accomplished making me (and others) doubt that you even have a plan.\n\nEDIT2: But this will be ignored, as so much other legitimate criticism is, and Riot will continue to do a slow and mediocre job while constantly making excuses and dodging questions. I honestly dont know why I still care about the story of this game anymore, when the people writing it clearly dont.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2015-02-05T04:02:46.688+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are my questions.\n\n# What Champions or settings are being targeted for major rewrites, and when?\nThis is my primary concern. I have no clue what part of the League setting Narrative is going to go after next. This makes it quite difficult to have any kind of community involvement: I could spend all day making a Bandle City thread for the community to discuss what we like about Bandle City and what we don't like, but I don't know what phase the Bandle City rewrite is in. Perhaps Narrative has already decided what's changing about Bandle City, and it's too late for them to consider community feedback, making the thread a laborious waste of time. Or perhaps nobody at Narrative is even beginning to look at Bandle City, again making it a waste of time (unless they go digging through the archives to find old discussions when they *do* get around to it.) Or maybe it's in that Goldilocks zone, where someone at Narrative has started sketching out proposed changes to Bandle City, and is in the right phase of the project to be able to benefit from and participate in such a discussion.\n\nSurprises are exciting, but especially in an already inhabited universe, I don't think the element of surprise should be given absolute weight. There are other priorities, like community engagement. There is plenty to surprise us with; complete secrecy about everything is unnecessary.\n\n# Is it Narrative's impression that \"legal concerns\" prevent them from talking about their ideas before they're published?\nI couldn't tell if Jaredan was simply saying \"we can't post up actual drafts for public comment for copyright reasons\", which would make sense, or was further saying, \"the legal team tells us that we can't read community ideas or talk about our ideas with the community before they're finalized.\" I'm no IP lawyer, but that would be pretty crazy. Riot has been collaborating with the community on skins, gameplay mechanics, and even (sometimes) lore for many years. And I don't even know what sort of legal theory you'd use to try to sue Riot for borrowing a story idea from the community, when this tradition makes it perfectly clear that we're posting all these ideas precisely because we want Riot to use them.\n\nIf it turns out that Riot really does see a legal risk in even discussing lore ideas on the forum (and if so, that would be seriously shocking to me, in light of Riot's usual modus operandi), then surely that could be addressed by having some annoying disclaimer that says, e.g., \"by participating in this discussion, you license Riot Games to make use of your contributions in original or modified form, with or without attribution or compensation.\"\n\nIf Narrative truly believes that it cannot discuss ideas with the community before they're published for legal reasons, and that there is no way to mitigate this risk to an acceptable level (e.g. with a disclaimer), then it's pretty obviously GG for meaningful community engagement. I don't think that's the case, but given Jaredan's earlier remarks, I would like some clarification.\n\n# So, can we talk?\nWith those two preliminaries out of the way, my principal request to Narrative would be to start some discussions on upcoming changes. Let's say that Narrative is planning to, say, make Zaun a suburb of Noxus rather than an independent state. That should be discussed: that's a pretty massive setting change. So open up a Zaun thread and share your ideas for what \"the essence of Zaun\" might be, and invite the community to discuss.\n\nOf course, I'm not asking for \"design by democracy\". The decision is ultimately Narrative's. But I think the end results will be more vibrant, and the new lore's legitimacy greater, if the community is involved, especially where Narrative is tearing up and replacing long-standing lore.\n\nEverything else, I feel, is of secondary importance. Sure, it'd be fun to talk to Narrative and get their abstract thoughts on how they develop a story, or who their favorite Champions are, or what their influences have been, but at the end of the day, that's just a pleasant chat, not meaningful community engagement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistress Madoka","date":"2015-02-03T16:39:07.766+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, My Question is: What Caused Riot to Choose to go down the \"Total Retcon\" path Instead of Choosing something that would keep Die-hard fans of the old Lore Happy AS WELL as Free the champions ans Their Story arcs from the Institute of War? Something Like a Cataclysmic event that destroys the institute itself and Takes the Summoners down with it. In that Scenario, You can Keep a Lot of the Old Lore, Which some Champions make Little to No Sense without. (Malphite is actually my first thought: The only Reason He is on Runeterra at all is Because a Summoner Summoned him from another dimension.) But now with the institute Destroyed, How can Malphite return to his home? How will Nocturne Be kept in Line? Or Fiddlesticks? Will Lee Sin Mourn the loss of his former Brothers and Sisters? Will Demacia and Noxus Erupt into full-on War? These are just a Few of the Questions that could be expanded on Had the Old lore been kept, but a Destruction/Cataclysm Event taken place.\n\nMy main other Questions are (All based on total Retcon):\n\nWhat is the story behind the Rift? Is it still Between the IronSpike Mountains and Serpentine River? Is there a Story behind the location in the Works? The artwork for it Shows That the bases are parts of an old, Crumbled temple, so that bring the question of Who Built the temples and what purpose did they serve?\n\nThe same Questions could be applied to the other Fields of Justice, too. It's At least Clear Where the Howling Abyss and the Twisted Treeline are, But what about Crystal Scar? Is that Still in Kalamanda? Is Kalamanda still Directly between Demacia and Noxus? \n\nWhat Purposes Do any of the Fields serve now? Were they all Temples like ~~Summoner's~~ Rift? Did they serve the same Purpose, or did they belong to factions separate from the Temples of the Rift?\n\nWho Put the Nexuses on the Howling Abyss? It's Clearly not a Temple. Did the Watchers/Iceborn Know how to Make Nexuses? If that's they case, are they the ones behind the creation of the Other Fields of Justice?\n\nAnd Lastly: So if previously, the Baron we faced wasn't the REAL Baron Nashor because Summoners thought he'd be too OP, Are we fighting the REAL Baron Nashor Now? If So, he Doesn't seem much more powerful than Fake Baron. (Certainly more deadly, but Still just as Easy to take down.) If it's NOT the Real Baron, Then what is he? Is it a Clone? A Phantom?
