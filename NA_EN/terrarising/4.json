There's a possibility we had other ideas that just didn't pan out for him. That said, we were working on him in advance of the event, and of course, would not release him until the Pool Party event/Team Up Week since it made the most sense. \n\nYou're correct in us saying that Zac's model is difficult to make skins for, due to the stretchy nature of his model. That said, it's certainly not impossible to do as you've seen with Pool Party Zac, which has been one of the most requested skins for this champion.\n\n> On top of that, the Skins QA team kept telling Zac fans that \"we want to make the next skin worth the wait\" and that \"we don't just want to release a color swap for him,\" all the while creating exactly that.\n\nYup! We didn't want to give players *just* color swaps for him - and we didn't! We created Pool Party Zac, which has a lot of cool features! In addition, we did add a chroma pack, since that's something else players had suggested to add more options to his skin catalog.","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2015-06-17T20:40:15.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"poolparty zac would be perfect if, in game, there was also the spalsh fish swimming in him :p","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2015-06-11T04:55:19.921+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where does it say they have had the skin made/completed for 2 years?","replies":[]},{"poster":"aaronautumn","date":"2015-06-11T03:52:08.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"they weren't wrong, any zac skin that isn't just a recolor does take effort. the fact that they made one doesn't change that.","replies":[]}]}
