Additionally, every other short lore posted on the client (from Skarner and Amumu to Renekton and Xerath) has replaced their previous long form stories.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't expect a response from Narrative, since they're not going to say anything and do as little as possible without a leader.\r\n\r\nSo, I'll accept this as a surrender from the Lore team as far as anything promised in last month's Dev Blog.

Otherwise, they remain silent and never say anything at all.

We're used to things taking time with Riot.  \"**Soon™**\" did not become a running joke because it's funny.  It became a thing because Riot makes promises, then takes forever to get them going if they get to them at all (Both attempts at Magma Chamber, for instance).\n\nAnd the phrase \"rapidly evolving\" sounds too much like people are leaving and getting replaced by people who don't know nearly as much about the champions and story as one would hope.\n \n> Thank you for pushing.

That's putting it mildly. It's actually what we are attempting to fix and why we are communicating our narrative strategy. It opens up that dialogue.\n\nBy we, I mean Narrative and Riot. We all tackle things like this together. No team is an island. We discuss this a lot and our lore impacts many teams at Riot so we like to be in sync.\n\nIn terms of an answer to your original question, I think I can coax one out of the narrative team. I think you are right about wading in to controversial threads. We shouldn't shy from that.\n\nIn terms of our narrative lead, I feel some topics should remain private. But I will say, it's not about backlash at all. I think the strategy outlined is a good one. The right one. And that is what we plan to do. Also, that lead never strayed from a challenge! He has my deepest respect. But some topics are personal and should stay that way.\n\nWe need to be able to tell great stories about our champions in a really robust way.

That is amazing and I will always have goodwill for Riot for doing that.\n\nI loved the idea of Ashe marrying Tryndamere for convenience (as a political marriage to strengthen her bid for the throne), and I would really like to see if she has feelings for someone else (I'm sure Trynd won't mind, he seems like a chill bro in that regard). It would also be neat to see what plans Ashe has to counter Lissandra and Sejuani's. Sejuani wants to entice more warriors to join her, and presumably conquer land by force (that seems to be her style), while Lissandra is a master of patience and subterfuge. Ashe would rather try diplomacy, but what will she do when that fails?\n\nAs for her character, I rather like that she is a strong woman with leadership skills, unmatched charisma and a cunning mind (I always read the implication that her ultimate and hawk indicated a person with great vision and strategic thinking), and seems to be ready to match Sejuani's strength and Lissandra's chessmastering and beat them at their own game.\n\nWhatever you do in future stories, please do not damsel her. It would be so refreshing to have Tryndamere be her sidekick, support and friend, rather than someone who saves her or does the leadership thing. All I ask of the Lore team is that, instead of falling prey to \"the old classics\" and \"the tried and true tropes\", to please think of the people who don't get to see themselves reflected in stories. What happened to Sivir in the Shurima event was rather... disappointing. She became a damsel for Azir to save and then ascend. I am mollified by the interaction between Cassiopea and Sivir before that part, and how the first part was purely a story between two women (would have been nice if Sivir's mercenaries had included women too, but eh).\n\nIt would also be great to have more racial diversity (other than Karma and Lucian), and some champion romances that aren't straight (pretty much every relationship confirmed or hinted at has been straight: Kat and Garen, Lux and Ezreal, Trynd and Ashe, Tristana and Teemo/Rumble, etc.). That's basically what I want to see from the Lore team in the future.\n\nThanks for listening! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2014-10-05T03:17:14.748+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to sound like a prick here but go back and watch the Shurima videos but don't watch the visuals with it.

(Curiously, they both say that \"sure, you're Summoners in the game\" and \"the game and the lore are completely separate\", and at the same time insist on ripping out all the Summoner references from the voicework, so that Champions are now mumbling to themselves like lunatics.

I know that these pieces of fanfiction and not official, but it shows that you could vary easily give champions agency while still making summoners important and powerful.\n\nEven if they did control everything about a champion in a League match, champions do things outside the League, and summoners don't control them there!

Any number of stories could be created to prescribe a cure for Kayle's binding the the IoW, you and I both know that. She is a being from another planet, whose only connection to the IoW is her sister. (I'm a Morgana main, and love the character/dichotomy and the dual perspective of freedom of expression/tyranny, or however somebody wants to perceive it. What makes that story AMAZING is that both sides could be perceived as good or evil.)\n\nDon't fish for responses like that, because if you only look for the evidence that supports your decision (Removing the IoW/Summoners) you will always find cause to justify your decision. It is a huge problem in debates that anyone who has taken a Debating class 101 could point out.\n\nIf you want to have a dialogue about whether or not Kayle's story is enriched or left lacking due to the fact that Summoner's bind her to their will, that is a reasonable discussion. Please, don't mask that intent though, because of all the things I care about the most in this game, it would be a re-imagining of Morgana/Kayle. (I could name millions of ways for it to be done wrong, and I'd love to discuss that but this isn't the place and if you want those opinions by all means make a thread.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diahane","date":"2014-10-04T04:24:00.309+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Let me ask you this.

It doesn't mean that players are not Summoner's, it just means that Summoner's are not in the stories controlling our champions directly.\n\nThis argument is pretty much fallacious: champions were not controlled 24/7 by summoners in the old lore, they were linked to them only when in the Fields of Justice and that was a bit of a two way things - this was the explanation for the fact you always start at level 1 with the champion, because you have to synchronize. See Journal of Justice Volume 1, issue 21, where it's said:\n>The link between the champion and summoner essentially creates a “new being”, comprised in part of both of them.\n\nVolume 1, issue 11 mentions the words \"symbiosis\".\nVolume 1, issue 7 goes as follows:\n>*\"I am a bit confused about the role of a summoner in the League's matches. I have heard from several sources that the summoner actually has full control of their champion during battle, and that the champions simply serve as ragdolls for the magicians to manipulate. Now, here in Piltover we are all big fans of Ezreal, or \"The Prodigal Explorer \" as many of us call him. However, the thought that our skillful champion may not actually be doing any of the fighting himself has upset a great deal of us. Can you shed some light on these concerning rumors?\"* -- Boush\n>\n>Summoning is the most challenging of all magical disciplines. There is far more to it than simply relocating a being from one location to another. A summoner mentally and physically links with their summoned being (champions, as we call them), allowing for a fluid symbiosis. A champion is not a puppet of the summoner; instead, the champion is the executor of the will of the summoner. A champion is in full control of themselves, but they are fully aware of the importance and the necessity of the summoner’s will. A champion’s duty is to execute the will of a summoner with the utmost precision and execution.\n>\n>Bear this in mind, Boush: a champion is never forced to be a part of a battle arena where their loyalties and beliefs are not considered. During matches where city-states are resolving disputes, a champion will never act against their own interests. Garen, for example, would never charge out of the brush at a fellow Demacian if the match were about resolving a dispute involving Demacia. \n\nNow Volume 1, Issue 8:\n>*\"So I understand how strong our magic is to control a champion, but one thing has bothered me since I became a summoner. Do we really kill the champions themselves over and over again?\"* - Eraganus\n>\n>Constructing a Field of Justice is a truly remarkable feat, and the magic at play is beyond the comprehension of all but the most gifted of magicians. Once a battle begins, the Field of Justice becomes a kind of microcosm. Within this sphere of influence the champion and summoner exist as one shared mind.\n>\n>This does not mean that the champion is not in mortal danger. Death severs the connection between summoner and host champion and is an extremely traumatic experience for both parties. After the summoner has recovered, they can reenter the battle arena by completing the summoning ritual again. At this point the champion is revived on the summoning platform, once again entering the fray at the risk of their own life. For this precise reason, champions and summoners are a rare breed. \n\nThat is to say... the \"puppetmaster\" problem was already addressed a lot of time ago.\n\nP.S: I know, hyronically there is no Volume 2, so no point in saying Volume 1.\nP.P.S: 6.23 GMT+1, and I'm here reading through the JoJ to find the quotes I remembered about.

Sometimes it's to fight for their nation, sometimes it's to face a rival, sometimes it's just for the thrill of battle.  Sometimes champions will refuse to fight for whatever reason, and the Institute understands that.\n\nSummoners act as their extra senses.  They relay information about the battlefield and provide champions with extra powers (see smite, flash, etc.).

Batman's out there doing the fighting and grappling and such, but Oracle's always there to provide him with information and suggest tactics that will lead to the best results.

I really am just trying to feel this out.\n\nThis is part of why we're complaining: Narrative keeps referring to this awkward version of Summoners and the League, which we all agree is awful.\n\nNobody wants Summoners to be evil puppetmasters forcing Champions to obey them. While your team was completely inactive, the lore community has been reworking that concept over the course of *years.* For example, the consensus now is that we see Summoners as \"support\", mages who help keep an eye out for Champions as they fight on the fields, giving them advice and aiding them with magic. Likewise, we don't see the League as some heavyhanded all-powerful cabal of mages, but instead as a supranational entity founded on a common consensus that unchecked warfare would destroy the planet—and constantly having to walk a fine line between failing to place limits on the warfare that does break out, on the one hand, and being so aggressive as to provoke a backlash that would destroy this consensus, on the other. We don't see Kalamanda as \"Demacia and Noxus got in a fight, then the League overpowered them both because it is all-powerful, the end.\" We see it as a dramatic story of Demacia and Noxus bringing Runeterra to the brink of all-consuming war, the League risking everything on a last-ditch effort to prevent this, and their massive gamble paying off as Demacia and Noxus look each other in the eye and, grudgingly, acknowledge that they don't want to go down this road. Not yet.\n\nSo, in short, we spend all this time reworking and developing these concepts ourselves. Then, you come in years down the line and declare you're destroying all of that, and when we protest, you make arguments aimed at the ridiculous original version from years ago.\n\nDo you see how that feels like a slap in the face, to borrow your terminology?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-04T03:22:18.576+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It's hard for us to make big changes then ask you to \"trust us\", as I just did a while ago.

This is an example that many of us are still quite bitter about, and I think with good reason. We were given no opportunity to make a case in our defense, no opportunity to pitch alternatives. We were told that the decision was made and implemented. We were presented with some cursory allusion to \"opening up room for new stories\" and some accusations that the League had been \"constraining\" storytelling. And finally, we were given two new chapters of lore (Shurima and Sion), neither of which obviously required such a drastic and destructive retcon.\n\nIt's not that we weren't trying to start such a discussion: noticing that voicework was being stripped of Summoner references, and that no new lore (e.g. Champion bios) made any mention of the League, a theory began to circulate among the community that (as bizarre as it sounded to us) Riot was planning to erase the League from League. So we started posting threads asking about this, some more directly and others more circuitously. Months and months, perhaps over a year, went by in this fashion. (We actually did get one piece of feedback: a Rioter posted on Twitter that the League was still canon, but Riot was simply trying to focus on other aspects of Runeterra at the moment.) And then, bam, a quickie comment on a blog post rather casually remarked that everything was retconned and we (Summoners) no longer existed, followed by an equally casual (and equally astonishing) announcement that Riot was severing the link between the game and the wacky new lore adventures that Riot was going to be putting out Soon™.\n\n**[Here's a thread concerning Bandle City.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/A8hitWGw-bandle-city-lets-talk-before-narrative-retcons-everything)** We currently have no clue what faction you'll set your sights on next, but my hope in creating that thread was that Bandle City was still far enough away that there's time for some real discussion.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Narrative team needs to decide whether it plans to follow the Riot model of community interaction. That's not meant to be merely rhetorical: there are good reasons why one might decide to not involve the community. But if you do decide you want to tap into the community's thoughts and energy, be real about it.\n\nRiot-style community engagement is not simply about \"softening the blow\" or \"breaking it to us early\". It's not even just about \"taking the time to explain Riot's decision\". Those purposes may also be served along the way, but it's fundamentally a process of two-way interaction. Both sides should come into that discussion willing to hear arguments, evaluate ideas, and seriously consider what the other is saying.\n\n> We are listening.\n\nI'm pleased to hear that.

We are listening.\n\nThanks for taking the time to post this, even if it doesn't answer neither our questions nor our pleas, but it sure is a step forward.\nAt least it is some form of dialogue instead of having to shout at walls.\n\nNonetheless, without any substantial form of communication from the lore team on anything all this just seems like the team has utterly messed everything it could on the timing or, worse, that the team outright lied when saying we would get the updated and extended bios on the site.\nWhen dropping the retcon announcement you should at least have had those ready =/\n\nRegarding feedback, I know Riot's way is to highly regard it, but when it has come to lore it looks like it hasn't been sought nor heard at all. The retcon decision was taken without feedback and all the complaints which spawned here on the boards have gone unanswered. It feels as if the lore team was part of another company and not Riot Games; we didn't even get a QA on the retcon.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-10-04T03:47:55.304+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":11,"body":"We didn't lie about the new stories, but we definitely messed up on the timing.

We might not always agree, but we shouldn't shy away from the conversation.\n\nI don't want to harp on this, because I don't want to punish that particular Rioter for just doing their best to answer community questions, but you in fact did.\n\nWe aren't as dim as you think we are. We noticed your bizarre crusade to eliminate all Summoner references from voicework—the Sejuani change was particularly telling—and the completely dearth of lore development concerning the League. It sounded tinfoil-hat-crazy, but we started asking ourselves, hey, are they really nuts enough to delete the League from League? Every sign points to it, but are they *that* detached?\n\nSo we asked a Rioter. They publicly responded, confirming that the League was canon, and it was simply a shift in focus to telling some non-League stories. I felt that answered the question.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, TommyGnox quite casually announces that, because the poor little Narrative team felt \"constrained\", they were retconning the League and all associated lore, and divorcing the story of League of Legends from League of Legends itself.\n\ni don't think that Rioter meant to deceive. I believe that Rioter reported what they believed to be the truth at the time they said it. But the rest of you did lie, by failing to correct this misconception.\n\nAs for \"getting better\", well, it's a bit late for that. \"Well, yes, we've incinerated the lore the community's built over the years. But hey, we really promise to get better about talking before we flip the switch on the flamethrower.\" Yeah, that's not doing a whole lot of good at this stage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RiotNarsil","date":"2014-10-04T14:16:46.136+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":8,"body":"Yo!\n\nI think if you get a closer look at how our engagements start, you’ll understand Riot a little better.\n\nYesterday a concerned Rioter forwarded me this thread and said, “Hey man, our players are asking some questions and we’re ignoring them.

The problem with surprises is that pretty much by definition they don't allow an opportunity for us to have input before they're deployed. It becomes some kind of demented guessing game:\n\n\"Hey lore community! We have something super-fun planned. It'll be kind of a shock, but we hope you'll like it! I will say it might involve Ionia. ;)\"\n\nSo, what, we're supposed to start speculating on every possible change you could make to Ionia, then exhaustively list our positions on all those possible changes? Or do you expect us to just have giddy, giggly threads where we join you for a pajama party talking about how awesome Ionia is and how much we hope you involve our favorite Champions. Because, in case you've somehow missed this—though you could print this thread out, throw a dart, and have a good chance of landing on a sentence from someone expressing the same—when we have no clue what you're planning, we're all hoping on some level that these new changes happen to someone else's Champion.\n\nShock reveals are most appropriate when a universally positive response is reasonably expected.\n\nExamples where a surprise approach can work:\n\n* A fun new cinematic in the style of A Twist of Fate or A New Dawn, which isn't a heavy-handed lore-change vehicle.\n* Some lore about a Champion that doesn't rewrite them.\n* A Champion bio rewrite that simply enhances style rather than drastically altering content.\n* Some artwork of a Champion.\n* Some other story that fits with, rather than tears apart, established lore.\n\nExamples that are completely inappropriate as shock reveals:\n\n* Erasing the League of Legends from League of Legends.\n* Telling us we no longer exist in Runeterra.\n* Completely changing a Champion's backstory.\n* Overwriting a canon event, on which much lore discussion and community-written lore has been based.\n* \"Let's just put it out there, before they have a chance to complain, so we can just say, 'well, sorry, that ship has sailed, but we'll try to communicate better next time!'\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-10-04T17:53:18.793+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree, all these 'surprises' leave me mostly fearing the next one ever since the Freljord event.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2014-10-05T03:12:52.728+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"when we have no clue what you're planning, we're all hoping on some level that these new changes happen to someone else's Champion.\"\n\n\nSo much this.

No one ever believed it was so omnipotent pantheon of the gods that controlled walking demigods. We are not these gods of olympus sending demigods on quests.\n\n\nWe as Summoners are men and women gifted with summoning. Powerful mages who can love, hate, fear. Die. Summoners are not omnipotent gods. They never were.\n\nIf you want our trust. If you want us to believe what you have coming is worth it, you retcon your retcon. You told the PLAYERS this: \"YOU DONT EXIST\" and we took that personally. So if you want us to trust you and you want us to believe in you, it's time you wrote for the fans. Not for a paycheck. Write for the Summoners and our Institute, my love of Kayle. My dislike of Morgana and my affinity for mages. Write us back into the story and auit trying tk seperate the gake and the lore. Separating a game and it's lore makes no sense. \n\nI cant just separate the game Mass Effeft from its story.

One of its core purposes is quickly introducing players to a champion, and we've run into format and character limits that further constrain our ability to tell rich stories. Our plan for this space is to have a short, thematic introduction to the character, for players who want to quickly understand who and what they are, and then a longer story on the website that can be fully dedicated to being entertaining and showing the champions within our story world. Long-term, this will allow us to actually explore more story for each champion than was previously possible. We don't want to take story away, we want to do more.\n\nThat said, I get that this means nothing to you until we've actually delivered it. To be perfectly honest, we've run into a couple issues that have temporarily set us back. Firstly, the champion info pages on the web and in-client both pull from the same database, and the tech change required to implement the plan I described above is taking a bit longer than expected. \n\nMore importantly, when we knew we couldn't put the stories out to you in the way we wanted - and after listening to some of the concerns you expressed during the Shurima event - we took a long hard look at the prepared stories we had and, frankly, decided we could do better. Azir and Xerath's stories are being rewritten and we are already pursuing other opportunities with Shurima-related champions.\n\nEssentially, we're currently out of sync on a couple of fronts: 1) having the content ready for you, and 2) the tech issue we're working hard to solve.\n\nRight now you might be thinking to yourself, \"Surely, you should have had this all ready to go in advance?\"\n\nThe only answer I can give is this: you're absolutely right.\n\nWe've made mistakes and seen the unease it has caused, particularly at a time when so much change has happened in recent months and in light of the promises we've made.\n\nAs I've said recently on these boards, we care tremendously about you, the players, as well as the story of Runeterra. I also know promises that we're working to get you much more story are meaningless until you see results.\n\nAs I mentioned, we're currently hard at work on some Shurima-related stories (not to mention future content), and we want to get the first of them out to you just as soon as we can properly finalize them. If we cannot solve the tech issue within the necessary timeframe, we will get the stories to you in analternative way, perhaps even through this board.\n\nWe're making a lot of changes to improve how Narrative gets story to you and how we engage in a dialogue about it - we fully understand that we need to do better.","replies":[{"poster":"EnderForHegemon","date":"2014-10-04T03:32:42.102+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ouch.\n\nGuys...
