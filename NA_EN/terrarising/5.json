Poor guy, he just wants to dig some graves. . .\n\nI actually made a post recently on proposed rework to his abilities that doesn't drastically change him.  Keeping it short here and recapping for others:\n\nIncrease his base cooldowns by 20 to 30%\nGive his abilities AoE auras around the ghouls\n  Q = movespeed team 1/2 strength of Yorick effect\n  W = fine the way it is\n  E = heals nearby friendlies 1/2 strength of Yorick's heal\n  R = gives his passive to all champs near the Ult Ghoul\nMake E a skillshot with roughly 1k range.\n\nThat gives him some play making capability, team utility, counterplay in lane from longer cooldowns, and more decision making that just what's on cooldown?   When you use one of his aura ghouls to help team or to just do damage is important, making his E a skillshot makes laning easier for opponent while giving him some extra bush checking ability.  The biggest thing is the Ult, using it early makes the teamfight better, but using it late gets the revive, which is more impotant and when are great skill decisions.
