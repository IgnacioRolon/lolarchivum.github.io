You can name the file whatever you want.\n\nIt may take a few minutes to collect all your system information. When that's complete, upload the file to Drive, Dropbox, or your favorite file sharing website and share the link on the forums.\n\nThis'll help us try to figure out what's wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"poboro","date":"2018-06-14T22:54:00.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/16hz4szivm4cbvw/AAA7JcdEJHdmlxxHLvTrrwNSa?dl=0 \nhere is the info, please let me know what i can do to fix the problem.

I literally try and use as few other applications as possible to make sure my game runs quickly as possible and now I am stuck on the loading screen forever.
