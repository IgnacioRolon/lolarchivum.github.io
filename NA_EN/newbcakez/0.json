Our servers do crap out sometimes and I'm no stranger to admitting when it does, but that's not the case for this specific situation.  I know you guys have gone through a few steps already as well, which is definitely appreciated and helps a lot!  \n\nBeing able to connect to EU but not NA can be caused by a variety of issues, not just a server one.  You may have an ISP node, for example, that is having issues routing you to the game server.  Routing to EU would change that route to another location, and miss that faulty node to allow you to connect.\n\nSteps like Configuring DNS through the connection guide, and running traceroutes with WinMTR helps us determine that.  We don't have magic wands, as much as we wish we did.  Fixes aren't always easy and we don't always see everything that's happening, that's why these steps help a lot even if they might require a bit more legwork sometimes.\n\nContinue chatting with your Specialists and they'll keep working with you until a resolution is found.
