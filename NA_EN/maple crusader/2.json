I don't think it'll give him something. Giving him true damages will surely imply a nerf in his ratio,making him weaker on non-isolated targets.\nSorry,i'm off topic.

Would it be 6 months?1 year or 2 years?\nAnother thing I would like to know: can a RIOT member establish a ranking of strenght/power between champions (in their lore).
