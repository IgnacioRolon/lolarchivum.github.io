I've looked for this skin if its not the shyvanna skin through all of my champions &amp; I don't have any new ones that I've found.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T21:07:32.417+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlocked content should appear in your store's purchase history.  I checked into this for you, and I do see that you unlocked a Permanent for Ironscale Shyvana.  It turns out that you used this and 2 other skin shards, and rerolled them into Arctic Ops Kennen.  Let me know if that helps with clearing some things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Olded","date":"2017-04-13T22:07:57.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh shoot I used it to reroll again? must have been my bad in miscounting, either way I appreciate the help and you clearing this up for me. I was just confused about where it might have gone since I didnt have her yet because I was interested in using it, but the kennen skin suffices. Thank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
