With that in mind, are there any plans to add an option to close the client to the tray instead of shutting it down completely?\r\nThough I don&#039;t know whether you use Electron, Node.js or something homemade, I think all two are able to manage that just fine.\r\n\r\nOf course, that would imply some form of notifications on the desktop whenever you are invited to a game or receive a message. Windows has that since XP (for instance, Discord which is based on Electron uses the default Windows notifications), I don&#039;t think OS X has anything similar, but just as Chrome or Vivaldi (Node.js again) use their own legacy notifications, I suppose it&#039;s possible to use your own system and have rich notifications instead of the simple Windows ones.\r\n\r\nSo, the question was originally: are there any plans for that? I don&#039;t mind my League client running in the background but I like keeping my workspace clean, and one window less when I&#039;m alt-tabbing is always welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"SlashStriker","date":"2016-08-04T19:23:32.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by default the classic client goes to try when the game starts but if you call it when you minimize it it does not goes to tray again\n\ni think this option should be included that the minimize button sends the launcher to tray.
