To be fair the only reason to play League was because i dont like other games. I remember what i said at the end of S9: ,,Lol will die in S10 , too much dmg and Yasuo/Lee Sin are still in the game\" I was right , this game died. There isnt new players , only smurf accounts because all you need to climb is the right side of coin and fresh mmr. Maybe there are 5-10 new players every week but they quit because smurfs flame and destroy them.","replies":[]}
