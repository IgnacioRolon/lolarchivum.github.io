I  typically hold the cap at 144 without issue.  However, as the games continue, i get drops down as low as 60 up and down.  This appears to be new behavior as of 6.13.\r\n\r\nThank You\r\nHammer","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-07T02:41:40.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll want to visit the article below for information on troubleshooting FPS issues; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting#section-windows\n\nIt has a step that suggests updating your video driver, but if you need to do that step and it doesn't work I also suggest *rolling back* to an older driver, reinstalling the current one, and/or updating to a beta driver (if you're on the WHQL 'live' version).\n\nIf nothing helps, you'll want to make sure your CPU and GPU are not overheating, which often results in reduced performance the longer a game goes on.
