I dont like chease, tbh, most people here dont even eat chease, or even like it. We just make them because we have stupid cows (But for some reason all people here has some chease in their fridge..)\n\n2. Weed is ilegal. I am pretty sure in a small town in America they smoke more weed then in the netherlands. We are economical people, not some crackers. (I never smoked weed)\n\n3. Dutch and german is not the same. German people think they&#039;re funny and make alway&#039;s jokes about how Hitler destroyed our town. Some words are similar tho... (No hate to german people, i just based this on what i see and have experienced)\n\n4. Its true we curse with diseases. (Alot)\n\n5. We are one of the few country&#039;s who pronaunce the letter &#039;&#039;G&#039;&#039; like &#039;&#039;GRRR&#039;&#039;. Try it :D \n\n6. The Netherlands is below Sea level. If we didnt had dikes, half of the netherlands would be under water, even where i live\n\n\nSo that was my list. What do you think about the Netherlands on first thoughts?","replies":[]}
