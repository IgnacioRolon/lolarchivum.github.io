It happens when i play 3v3 Twisted treeline, after a few games i will start getting periodical FPS drops, from the regular 60+ down to 10 or so. This goes on for about 30seconds, then returns to normal, only to happen again after ~90-120 seconds, and it just keeps repeating indefinitely making the game more or less unplayable. This is the exact same thing that has been happening to me in Overwatch and i've been unable to resolve the issue there aswell. Again, this never happens on Summoners Rift, nor did it happen in any other games ive played. When this started happening in overwatch i searched the forums and the internet for any possible solution and tried everything i could find with no success. Ive reinstalled the games, ive updated the drivers, completely removed GeForce experience and reinstalled it several times, even some obscure advice about disabling one of the CPU cores etc. \r\n\r\nWhile my system specs are far from good i've never had any problems with LoL other than occasionally slow loading times and this is frustrating the hell out of me.\r\nSpecs fyi are : 4GB RAM\r\n                         nVidia Geforce GTX470\r\n                         AMD phenom II X6 1055T \r\n\r\nIm open to trying litearlly anything at this point just to get rid of this problem...\r\n\r\nthanks for the responses","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-16T05:45:55.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be some severe driver or hardware issues going on with your PC that are causing this, especially because you're seeing these issues in Overwatch as well as League.
