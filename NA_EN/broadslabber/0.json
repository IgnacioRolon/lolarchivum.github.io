It started after the 7.1 patch so i did the repair files thing 3 times to make sure that wasn't it but it only got worse after doing so.\r\n It doesn't affect my game in anyway but it is just getting really annoying having to keep clicking that button to remove the notifications.Oh and I am on the legacy client.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-09T04:10:30.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The *unknown error* usually crops up if your connection to our servers is *unstable*.
