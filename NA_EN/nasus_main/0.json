Thanks for watching the video.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the guitar you saw in the video did not got through the finishing process yet (which means, no painting nor glossy finish). The shape of the summoner will be painted in chrome and the rest will be painted in high gloss black. There will be a decal entirely made with Photoshop, placed under the bridge. The lightning inlay is made of turquoise Phoenix stone. A League of Legends&#039; logo decal will be placed on the peghead, as well as various inlaid apatite gemstones. With its gloss-like finish, the guitar will look amazing.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe guitar is expected to be completed at the beginning of June.\r\nOnce the creation will be completed, I will produce a music video to show you the performance of the guitar, where I will play a Pentakill songs as well as many guitar riffs of League of Legends&rsquo; soundtrack.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMake sure to ask your questions in the comments section below. I will try to answer them all.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for reading and I hope you will be following the project in the near future !","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Eno","date":"2015-04-22T04:27:23.662+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is completely bonkers and amazing!
