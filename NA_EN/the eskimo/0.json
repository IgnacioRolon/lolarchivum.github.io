To show what I mean, here&#039;s a quick webm. \r\n\r\nhttp://gfycat.com/GrimyKnobbyGraywolf\r\n\r\nNotice how in the first segment (live servers) casting Q does not make the cannon expand or contract in any way, while the ability preview in the client shows a nice animation when being cast.\r\n\r\nAnother example is in auto attacks. The cannon form clearly stays static when attacking, when it should be expanding and moving.\r\n\r\nhttp://gfycat.com/QualifiedRealKagu\r\n\r\n(I tested this with debonair Jayce since it&#039;s clearer to see, but this issue affects all skins.)\r\n\r\nCan these be fixed? That would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-29T18:17:15.802+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Joe Da Eskimo,\n\nThanks for the report!

You replied to my post on /r/leagueoflegends two months ago saying [you'd have the issue looked at](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4dypl4/half_of_jayces_animations_and_particles_have_been/d1wpdpm?context=10000). The only thing I've seen fixed since then is the preview for {{summoner:21}} on the League Client Alpha, as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/pBtGEap.gifv\nIs this going to be pushed to PBE / live any time soon or is this never going to be resolved? Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-20T18:18:49.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya! \n\nAs noted in the more recent post (2 months ago), I'd stated that this isn't something we're looking to resolve, but I would be looking into the particle issues (which we have looked into and bug tickets have been created accordingly). \n\nI spoke with the video capture team, and this video was created nearly a year ago, which is why the animation appears differently than it does on PBE and live. \n\nI just saw your Reddit DM - hope this clears up that post as well. If you have more questions, please feel free to ask me. As a heads up, I use these boards much more frequently than Reddit. :) My red name there is primarily for bug mega threads, or when skin stuff's broken and front page news. :P ","replies":[{"poster":"The Eskimo","date":"2016-11-18T00:38:49.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey sorry to bump an old post but I was watching the recent RPG skins trailer and saw that the auto attack animations seem to be fixed (at least on Jayce Brighthammer)! [Here's the link to the time code](https://youtu.be/k4IVtmmZudE?t=48). Since this was definitely recorded on internal servers, will this change be on PBE next cycle? I'm so excited that this is finally back to its original state.
