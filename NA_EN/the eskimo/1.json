It looks totally out of place, especially for an epic tier skin.\r\n\r\nI also know this isn't necessarily a bug but I'm not sure where else to post this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2019-02-16T07:05:54.746+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! \n\nYou're correct that she isn't intended to have custom (W) particles, looking at both her spotlights and our testing documentation. At this time, we don't have bandwidth to go back and modify this skin (and to be honest, most skins, unless we're talking bugs -- particularly those affecting gameplay. ;-;).","replies":[]}]}
