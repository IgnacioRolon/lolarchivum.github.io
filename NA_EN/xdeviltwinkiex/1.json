If you guys group and team fight (which wont happen till late gold/plat, and even then it rarely happens), if you win you need to focus on objectives.\n\nYou need to work on killing turrets, dragons not as important imo, but you can get it, since youre udyr and youre the jungler, so you need to be setting up for objectives like dragon/baron.\n\nImo, dont bother with baron unless youre in a call with your other teammates as their response time coming to baron will be so long that its more worth it for you to go for towers instead.\n\nAlways keep lanes pushed. \n\nUdyr specific, dont go devourer, go runic or warriors, but never go devourer. \n\nDont focus on ganking too much, focus on farming.\n\nOther junglers I'd recommend for you to get out of bronze/silver:\n\n{{champion:131}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} \n\n\n\nif you have any other questions I can help you set up rune pages/mastery pages, if youre actually serious of getting out of bronze I could help you personally (add you in game and spectate you).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatH1N1","date":"2016-04-12T20:05:48.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLAY MASTER YI, IGNORE YOUR TEAM FOR THE MOST PART AND FOCUS MAINLY ON FARMING AND OBJECTIVES, AND WARD SHIT.
