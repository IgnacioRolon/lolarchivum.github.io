Once you devourer is sated you go Q -> Punch -> Doublepunch -> Passive Stun goes off. Then you get your on-hit damage from braums passive, On-hit from devour, On-hit from Titantic. Titanic also gives you good wave clear. Is it THE BEST? No. Is it legit playable? Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-03-09T18:38:16.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds fun and I want to try it not in ranked because I can't play ranked but I feel like people would dodge the match if I chose Braum jg.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2016-03-09T18:44:08.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw a rageblade/wits end/tf top lane braum build that was disgustingly effective not terribly long ago. If he combined in his ult to a rotation, he could basically kill anyone before they could even really do anything. (Combo basically being q for the slow, Rapid AA's to get the passive stun, weaving in w and e for more sheen procs, then ulting for the knockup.)\n\nI don't remember the rest of his build, but I imagine frozen heart for more cdr and other tank stuff would be fine. Maybe add titanic hydra but that's probably overkill.","replies":[{"poster":"xdeviltwinkiex","date":"2016-03-09T18:52:34.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool I'm prepared to get reported for trolling or something like that.
