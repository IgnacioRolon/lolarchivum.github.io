She's not allowed to make mistakes like many other champions. I'll be honest, I'm pretty new to her, but I like her because the JG is almost all hypercarries right now and she just feels more well thought out and deeper than right click which is my problem with the current JG. It's boring, she's not. No one with half a brain wants to play Yi (or a right click champ) every game.\n\nLet me just add that no one can be truly great with a champion until they master multiple styles with them. Take Amumu, if you look at the top players it's tank amumus and AP amumus, then above them, people that play BOTH.","replies":[{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2019-12-21T21:59:02.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> You mean E spam?\n\n>TBH this is pretty much what I feel I'm seeing here, Shyv players defending her diversity and balanced win rate vs people who don't even know where her spells are worried that she'll delete them for building 0 defense.\n\nI know what her spells are thank you. Am I not allowed to do a hyperbole now? Her AP build is terrible in  both ways. It's very unfun/unfair to play against and terrible to play if you fall behind. I'm not completely against it.

So is Zac (even tho is AP build is rarer). Sejuani was very fun to play as AP before the tank update. If you take a look at champion closer to Shyvana's class (fighter). Vi is an interesting example who  can do Assassin / Bruiser / Tank. If you take an even closer look at subclass (juggernaut). Garen is a great example at a juggernaut who can both be played AD or tank. It just needs to be done right.

For her, AP is even more fair given that her combo relies on her diving into the enemy via her ult to pop off. Unlike your typical mage which stands at range and bursts you without so much as a change to auto them.","replies":[{"poster":"Muzét","date":"2019-12-21T22:48:26.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I met a fair amount of shyvana AP and, most of the time they're ulting on the side or backwards to better spam their E. \nBut when they can fly into most of the enemy team and W they do it.

While it cna be wonderful to you, I still think it's quite unhealthy, her spells aren't as telegraph as most ranged AP and way more forgiving since, unless I'm mistaking, it's \"ground\" targeted (it stops at enemy champion or when reaching the location right?).

Other champions are even worse with the damage meta and are way easier to exploit and safer.\n\n2. {{item:3155}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3053}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3157}} Nulifying Orb Rune  exist and her E has a cooldown.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Beerstein","date":"2019-12-21T22:03:34.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Muzét,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZRfkn1Jv,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2019-12-21T21:59:02.893+0000)\n>\n> I know what her spells are thank you.
