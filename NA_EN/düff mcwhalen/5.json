Twitch or evelynn's invis have a much shorter cooldown and apply on the champion, which is 10x more broken than a zone invis, which is why they get revealed by control wards.\n\nBoth are different invis mechanics, and it actually makes sense for it to be countered differently.

GG. Then punish her severely for it... \n\n2) The movement speed bonus isn't doing anything for her unless you let her abuse it. Even a weak slow not only nullifies it, but punishes her heavily... Most champs these days have some form of hard cc though. \n\n3) She mostly faces champs with point and click AOE skills, or mages again with point and click and easy AOE, skillshots that even in the shroud can easily punish her, and you can keep poking her from a ways away... \n\n4) Her only real mobility that makes any real difference (again if you're playing against her correctly), is her E, and ult... \n\nAnd lets talk about her ult for a second, not only has it been nerfed a few times, it still has a asinine cool down on it.. Every champion she goes up against her ult is almost double the time of theirs (in some cases double or triple the time of theirs), and that's where a majority of her kill potential comes from. \n\n5) Just because she can play safely, doesn't mean that = a winning lane, or even a winning game.. Not by a long shot.. Meanwhile, Zed, Yasuo, any mage, and quite honestly vast majority of any champs besides melee's can play even safer than akali... \n\nI don't care what you or anyone else says, Akali is hands down the most balanced champ in the game.. Even against champions she's supposed to \"counter\" has multitude of ways to outplay her, and cancel her... No other champ in the game can claim this.. \n\nChamps Yasuo, zed, and other supposed \"overloaded kits\" literally crap all over the champs they counter and there's almost nothing those champs can do to stop them.. Meanwhile with Akali, if you know how to work around her kit, (which is easy), you almost naturally counter her ability to kill you.. \n\nZed again for example.. requires you to buy zhonya's if you dont want to blow up in .5 seconds, and that's without him being fed.. Even if you \"win lane\" against him, you don't.. Because unlike Akali, he can poke you down with his shadows for free, and take cs that way with ease.\n\nZed is just one example but there are many of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I3Iame","date":"2019-11-28T13:41:39.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh though, Diana's gonna stomp Akali if the changes go through.

Thus, the high damage and the main cringe side of this champ (especially if there's lots of paper units in enemy team).\n\nThe lack of visibility - while hiding in smokescreen - does help her a bit at being more evasive - yet, in the same time - that can also work against her (that's actually what works as a counter vs Akaly). As in - units with AOE damage. Be it APC units like: Cassiopeia, Malzahar, Annie and so on... or tanky units like Olaf, Kled, Diana, Rumble, Morde, Galio and so on... Against this champions - Akali uses the smokescreen only to run or engage faster - cause the times she tries to hide is like an invitation for the enemy to do free damage on her.\n\nAkali is usually bad news - for players who play/main only 3 or 5 champions - which she happens to counter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-11-28T21:07:53.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The smoke screen is alright by itself. If you think about it, there's several champions in the game that you could give this exact ability, and yet they wouldn't use it as effectively as she does. So, what makes it so efficient on Akali specifically? To be honest, the whole \"hit and run\" theme of her kit is just so efficient that it becomes basically flaw-free as soon as you add stealth in it.\n\nNerfing her insane mobility by decreasing either of her 3 movement speed boosts would already make her shroud a lot more manageable, cutting both her escapability and her cheesy out of stealth poke attacks. She'd probably still be overpowered in certain situations, but that would be a solid start IMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boosted JG 4Head","date":"2019-11-28T21:04:20.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh, that's the thing.
