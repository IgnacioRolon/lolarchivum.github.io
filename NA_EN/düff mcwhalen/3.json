Yeah keep conqueror till we find a solution.\nOne solution would be buffing black cleaver back.\nNext patch last whisper gets buffed again to its old glory, that might already do the trick to make conqueror not necessary anymore, lets see!\nI mean conqueror is not fun to use anyway, earlygame its garbage, lategame necessary because of itemization disbalance.\nAnd you people can hatecirclejerk all you want, riot actually sees the problem thats why conqueror isnt touched yet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2019-01-23T14:37:34.086+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol.
