After the first crash, I am able to load into the game no problem, but this makes me late to the match by 2-3 creep waves which is a big problem. \n\nA small work around I've found is to open task manager right after it gets to the loading into game screen, and then manually end the process, shutting down the game. Then, I just keep pressing reconnect until it stops giving me a generic internet connection error message, and I can then load in normally without experiencing any crashes or glitches then on. Fortunately, my computer does load in very quickly...  \n\nWith the above method, I usually can load in about 40 seconds into the game, which isnt a HUGE deal, but it is quite annoying and does make things like invading or early warding impossible. Im wondering why I only experience this upon FIRST load in only. I have normal frame rate around 144 after loading in the second time and experience no other bugs.\n\nAny fixes? Ive never experienced this issue before I started playing again about a month ago, and it sucks having to essentially altF4 every time I load into a game and then spam reconnect. \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"NotBehindYou","date":"2016-09-09T14:21:29.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having an issue where it disconnects after champ select.

I tried a number of things, including this morning removing those two logitech.dlls from the league install (since the only other change I could think of was now I use a Logitech mouse). \n\nI also went through every startup process and manually clicked off every little thing in the list of hundreds, including the software you're talking about, and restarted. I've never used that Game Bar, but I went about disabling everything related regardless.  I've been playing fine all day since then, so who knows - that might have been it!\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]}
