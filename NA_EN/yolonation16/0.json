I don't get on much anymore so the only thing that bothers me is the money I dropped on the game, which of course I know is gone. But I've received no email of my punishment. Yes I've checked spam and all that, and I recently sent a ticket in and the confirmation email showed up in my regular mail folder so I'm not sure why I don't have an email about my punishment. Any thoughts? Does this give me leverage to fight the ban? *Also I see I spelled Perks instead of Perma, auto correct*","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-24T21:37:09.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not receiving the email regarding the suspension will not give you leverage to reverse the suspension.
