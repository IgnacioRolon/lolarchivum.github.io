Outside of that, nope, nothing. \n\nSeriously, the number of people who try to tell me the \"proper\" way to build him is ridiculous. He simply can not burst. Period. Even with some of the ridiculous builds I've heard of. \n\nI think his kit is fantastic, just allow his Q to let him move through terrain, increase the range on his ult, and suddenly, Nocturne will FEEL like Nocturne: a terrifying ethereal spirit whom you don't know where he will pop out next. \n\nAnd maybe with the change on the Q, the stupid item advisement that tells you to get a poacher's knife would make more sense (Nocturne, a counter-jungler? LMFAO.)\n\nCould he become too powerful with those changes? I would argue no. His only gap-closer is still linked to his ultimate, and his Q is still going to be relatively the same in terms of damage output (so to speak.), the only thing that changes is his opportunities to make plays increase, which isn't a bad thing IMO.\n\nIf he does become too powerful, you could reduce his passive AS on his W, I know Riot is not a fan of hidden powers so that could definitely be a starting point for trading off power. \n\nAnd change his label as fighter for the love of god, sick of people in solo queue claiming he's capable of bursting. He's an assassin in the sense that if you're caught out against a proper Nocturne, you're screwed, but it seems the perception of assassin is high burst, not the ease of singling someone out of position easily, which is what Nocturne does, and what I think quite frankly, the assassin class should be revolving around.","replies":[{"poster":"AFK Push","date":"2015-06-16T23:34:49.786+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is somewhere in between assassin and fighter kind of like how tryndamere is.

There he can farm the gold needed to actually build the items he needs to assassinate properly, then he can roam easily mid-late laning phase using his ult.\n\n.\n\nBack to the main topic, I'd be hesitant be buff or nerf him because his steroids multiply each other and his spellshield, while underrated, makes him incredibly difficult to peel without multiple sources of easily hit CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"largefish","date":"2015-06-16T22:26:48.214+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Firstly, the concept of an assassin as purely a high burst character is specific to league, assassins are just characters that get in and duel/take out a high priority target. Let's assume nocturne is at level 8 with a warrior enchant skirmishers and a tiamat, he has .668 + 20% aspd, 137 ad, and 10 armor pen, not counting runes/masteries.

This totals up to 1466 damage flat in less than a second after his q impacts. \n\nFor this example, he'll be assassinating a level 8 jinx, who has 991 health and 43.1 armor (reduced to 33.1 by warrior pen), unmodified by runes/masteries. Jinx thereby reduces 30% of Nocs 1466 damage with her armor, to a total of 879.6 damage, reducing jinx from full hp to 111 health in less than a second.
