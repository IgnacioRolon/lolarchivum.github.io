Fix his insane lategame snowballing and teamfight pressure and revive his damages to an actually reasonable scale**\n\nNow I shall begin.\n\n\n\n\n\nKassadin has always been a frustrating champion to balance due to his intense snowballing and teamfight presence; being able to continue chasing and slowing enemies even when getting an incredible distance away. Kassadin gapcloses with 700 units using riftwalk and then uses force pulse, having  a 700 unit cone; this very simple combo covers 1400 units instantly. A common complaint nowadays though is that Kassadin's damage is just outright lacking, and just for his long history of being perceived OP, Riot has been pretty trigger happy to slap on another nerf that isn't supporting the real issue to keep him in check. This has left his damage butchered, but regardless of it, in a perfectly set up teamfight, he can still devastate the enemy team. Riot has pretty much ran out of reasons to keep cutting his damage, so it's time to cut his utility so that he can actually have decent base damage and have it be on a more fair level.\n\nFrom my point-of-view, here's what I would like to see for Kassadin to nerf his godlike teamfight pressure, but also give him the damage he deserves when being scaled/leveled.\n\nKassadin does not have lockdown utility. The only thing *is* that Kassadin can always continue to deal his damage very effectively with his constant giant gapclosers. Kassadin should still however be deserving of snowballing and dealing actual meaningful damage when appropriately played.\n\n(Basically lower utility to increase damage, but also not have it to be able to repeat until everyone cant do anything at all about it)\n\nMovement speed increased to **345** from **340**\n\nAttack speed per level reduced to 2.5 from 3.7\n\nMana per level reduced to **62** from **70**\n\nNull Sphere: Damage - 80/105/130/155/180 > **80/120/160/200/240**\nCooldown changed to **11** from **9**\nShield duration now lasts **2** seconds from **1.5** (shield value unchanged)\n\nNether Blade: Damage - 40/65/90/115/140> **40/70/100/130/160**\nPassive damage is now **20/25/30/35/40** from **20** at all ranks\nCooldown changed to **6** seconds from **9**\n\n\nForce Pulse: : Damage - 80/105/130/155/180 > **80/110/140/170/200**\nCooldown changed to **12** seconds from **6**\nKassadin no longer needs to stack charges to use Force pulse.\nMana cost changed to **70/80/90/100/110** from **80** at all ranks\nSlow duration increased to **1.5** seconds from **1**\nSlow percentage changed to **38/46/54/62/70** from **50/60/70/80/90**\n*Kassadin now gains an attack speed buff of 30/35/40/45/50 for 4 seconds*\n**Active sound effect moved to the attack speed duration**\n*Sound effect speed slightly increased*\n\n\nRiftwalk: Range changed to **600/650/700 **from *700* at all ranks\nCooldown changed to **6/5/4** from **7/5/3**\n\nCooldown for mana to reset to 75 reduced to **15** from **20**\n\n*Riftwalk's cooldown is now **unchanged** from cooldown reduction*\n\nFrom these changes, this will make Kassadin stay in melee range during the fight to keep participating in the fight. It's either that, or he's punished for a long time to wait for cooldowns to join in again. He will be able to waveclear easier in lane, but with his CD doubling in teamfights, Kass needs to rely on his attack speed boost to continue being effective in the fight, thus putting himself at a reasonable risk to continue doing damage.\n\nNow at the end of all this, the values end up being unchanged, but the biggest part to this is that he will not have access to the same utility until level 16, and even then, he wont be able to just spam everything away in a teamfight to just heavily clean house. but even then *again*, he will have reasonable bases to have a decent innate start to fighting.\n\nPlease leave constructive criticism and feedback on what you think about these changes. It's supposed to be a nerf and buff and the same time, but moreso a nerf to being able to *chase and ace.*","replies":[{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-05T21:03:00.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-05T05:24:11.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-05T04:55:37.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-04T20:03:41.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-04T19:50:56.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuIlmute All","date":"2015-02-04T18:49:21.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The CD is also going up. He should deserve to have reasonable damage like everyone else.

Thats not to say once late game hits he cant do a lot of damage but I still strongly agree with this. Idk as If these changes would really do much, they seem like very minor changes in some spots the biggest change would be not needing 6 spells for his E. I think it would be cool to just buff the shit out of his W's Damage and nerf his E's damage.. To me Kassadin should be really good at picking off 1 person. And doing damage to 1 person. So by putting most of his damage on a single target spell rather than his E which is AoE, you can kind of shift his play style from \"team fight utility disruptor\" to Assassinate and get the fuck out. Now obvoiusly this would be kind of hard to do because then he could just W smash the entire team. So perhaps giving it a high Cool Down would help against this. I think his R is fine.. They pretty much gutted the reset on it a few patches ago. But yeah I would love to see Lich bane be an awesome early game option as it is for Fizz.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DisasterSola","date":"2015-02-04T09:42:22.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... I think kassadin just needs a new ultimate. A toggle that drains mana, augments his stats, and allows him to move through terrain. His godly mobility is only a problem because he blinks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-02-04T10:11:16.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with all of this except for the Q. The 2 second shield is fine but having that much damage mid to late game makes him too safe for the type of champion he's supposed to be.","replies":[]}]}
