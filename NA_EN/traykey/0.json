But That's not right.\n\nCause apparently no armor. Also, how the hell did you let the game go to the point that you hd 1k stacks? Literally every game I've ever played as Nasus, I've seen a max of 800 stacks since nearly every game ends in under a half hour. Once you have 500, you push down towers in 3 Qs (works out to just over 6 seconds, and you can tank the tower damage in that time without issue, using the minion wave between that and the next to Q regen)\n\nThat makes you a giant threat to backdoor, meaning enemy sends 2-3 to you, leaving a 4 vs 2-3 scenario for your teamfight, makes it an easy win.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirion Sol","date":"2015-02-10T03:18:19.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, alright then.
