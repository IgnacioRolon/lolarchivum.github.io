You should be proud of yourself that you achieved so many wins from either yourself or with your friends. Instead of \"asking\" people to respect you. Why don't you actually EARN respect, by helping lower elo's with advice, or by being nice and friendly? It's not hard dammit! If you are the type that keeps to yourself then that's fine, just don't expect people to hand you a plate full of respect just because of how many wins you grabbed in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-08-24T21:53:58.337+0000","up_votes":49,"down_votes":1,"body":"Diamond rank in LoL is probably their greatest achievement in life if they act like that.

Nowhere else does someone who is a novice win an argument with someone who is considered extremely good- their argument is validated by their clear amount of experience and game knowledge, which is displayed by that little icon that says \"diamond\" on their profile.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, getting to diamond has been the absolute worst thing I could do to enjoy normal games. Anytime I lose lane, fuck up a gank, or move one hair out of place, I get asked where I bough my account and  how I got diamond if I'm such a shitter. Low elos talking shit to high elos is just as prevalent as what you're complaining about. I'm getting fucking sick of these circlejerk threads (ADCs are assholes, support power!, high elos should put up with everyone's bullshit, etc) that just exist to stereotype a specific part of the community. You guys are causing just as much negativity as the people you call out, and you're really **hurting** the situation if anything.\n\nIgnoring something someone says purely based on rank isn't acceptable, but you bronze players need to get it through your heads that diamond players are just plain better than you at league, and their opinions should be weighted for more, just as a challenger's opinion is worth much more than my own. \n\nMy goal really isn't to make anyone feel bad based on their rank, but at the same time I'm not going to sit here and let you guys perpetrate that high elos are doing all the bullshitting.","replies":[{"poster":"S2C2Xd9KOy","date":"2015-08-25T04:46:42.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"And while I'm at it, getting to diamond has been the absolute worst thing I could do to enjoy normal games.

The second anyone in the game op.gg's me and sees me higher elo than everyone else in the game, I get blamed for everything. If we lose, my fault. If I die, I'm trash, even though my lane is 3v1 half the game. Not enough wards? Blame me for not having the map lit up when Im playing mid and not building a sightstone even though I'm higher elo....\n\nI wish my normals MMR was actually correct and put me in gold/plat games more often because every single time its a silver game its either I carry and get flamed for beating on silvers or I go like 3/5/0 and get called a trash feeder who went negative to silvers when I had a bad game...\n\nEDIT: After finishing reading your post, I love you.

That's fine! You don't have to play ranked. Just know that there is a specific dichotomy in League for the \"casuals\" and the \"try-hards\"- normals vs ranked. The reason rank shaming exists is because it is a clearly definable, and sometimes the ONLY clearly definable, characteristic about a player's skill level. I can play like shit and you can go legendary, but at the end of the day the only thing people in our next games are going to see are our borders. Sad but true. \n\nIf you want to be taken seriously, the tough love message I'm giving you is you have to rank up. It's not enough to know you're good if you want people to respect you more. If you don't care then being in low elo is fine, but if you want to garner instant and relatively undeniable sway, that icon with your ranking on it sure doesn't hurt.\n\nIf you're competitive, and I assume everyone in gameplay and balance at least would consider themselves somewhat competitive, then your rank in relation to discussion is important, because it shows you survived and thrived in a competitive environment and came out on top. You know the game well, and- again I stress this- you have a CLEARLY DEFINED WAY TO SHOW IT! \n\nThat's all it is. While the results of one, three five, or fifty games may go one way, your ranking is always there and always available for people to see, and is a completely irrefutable testament to your skill and knowledge.\n\nYou want to be taken more seriously? Show me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-08-25T10:40:50.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't automatically demand respect as a diamond player, but if you're bronze and you're trying to argue a point to me then I am damn sure going to pull rank as an argument. \n\nA point isn't invalid simply because of the person who said it (or valid)\nSomeone claiming something without anything to prove/support it can be dismissed without proof\n\nHowever the claim that Talon is best played as an assassin because he doesn't provide anything except damage (Is just as true/false regardless of who says it.. be it a bronze or a diamond player)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2015-08-25T17:46:33.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Then maybe higher elo players shouldn't be egotistical assholes about it.
