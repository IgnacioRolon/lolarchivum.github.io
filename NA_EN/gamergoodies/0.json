However I am on an NA account, with a ton of work done on it. I got alot of skins, got all the runes and etc. \r\n\r\nHowever the only way I can play with them is that they let me use their extra account that happens to be level 5. \r\n\r\nI wanna buy the EUW transfer but If I do that my account just get's permanently placed in euw instead of having it where I want it to be. Why is that?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-27T00:45:11.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GamerGoodies,\n\nIt's probably best to make you own account so you don't get in trouble. Riot takes account sharing pretty seriously and no one needs to get in trouble over a low level account :)","replies":[{"poster":"GamerGoodies","date":"2015-10-29T17:31:44.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose but the effort of making another Email sounds like a MAJOR drag.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-23T01:10:50.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GamerGoodies, \n\nFirst, I wouldn't say out loud they allow you to share accounts. Just a heads up, Riots pretty strict on that and punishes for it. Second, you can transfer back to NA but some things won't transfer with you. You should read their transfer faq to get a better understanding of how it works. \n\nTransfer Faq: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751924-Account-Transfer-FAQ\n\nHope this helps! \n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"GamerGoodies","date":"2015-10-23T09:06:35.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really like how I have to \"transfer\" my account in order to play with my only 2 friends that use EUW. \n\nI've also been using a level 5 account my friend is making me use since I am too lazy to make another email for another account for another country. Do I get punished for doing that? Cause It's harmless, we are trying to level it so we can play one for all, not even planning to do ranked with it.","replies":[]}]}]}
