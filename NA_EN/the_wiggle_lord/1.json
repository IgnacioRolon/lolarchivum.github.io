I've tried all types of things online and none seem to work.

So i usually get 330ms or less , which is still playable for me. But for last one week i'm getting 480ms in custom games with bots and 550ms in pvp games, which is not playable. I never had this problem before.

Big changes in latency (ping) are almost always caused by an issue along your route to the server. Before we can take a look into that, we first need to ensure all your local settings are [**compatible with League**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\n\nAfter you've taken those steps, if you still encounter issues, let me know so we can investigate further.","replies":[{"poster":"Pancakkess","date":"2016-12-14T05:34:13.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had any issues with ping until I play normals draft with friends this past week. Normal ping is usually about 89- 90 when I play ranked but now I'm getting 160-250 in normals draft. Reboot my router, reset my computer and connect into a custom but still receive high ping. My internet connection is running just fine. Seems to be a server issue to me to be honest. Hope this gets fixed","replies":[]}]}]}
