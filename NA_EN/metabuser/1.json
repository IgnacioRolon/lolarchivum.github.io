(As other's said, a patch note somewhere a while back..)\n\nWhich makes me a little sad. My headcanon was Herald side was she, and dragon side was he, and they were both wondering back and forth looking for each other. Lost, scared, and lonely, but were always too afraid to cross lanes to keep looking for each other. Probably because of their 'safe' spot. (Side note: you never actually 'kill' scuttles, they just run to their hiding spot and become a ward/speed boost when they take near lethal damage, and stay 'hidden' till they heal their wounds. But maybe if they ever got too far away from hiding spot, they would actually die?)\n\nI think I'm still going to think of dragon side one as 'he,' regardless of what Riot says.\n\nFk u rito, you can't take my tragic romance away from me!!11 {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman5pff","date":"2017-02-04T23:16:19.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Jesus christ you can EXPLAIN it is a joke and people STILL don't get it is a joke.\n\nAlso, your entire headcannon (minus gender) can still exist if you stop excluding homosexuality as a real thing.","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2017-02-05T08:37:34.617+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spaceman5pff,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=BgHB4NxT,comment-id=000700020000,timestamp=2017-02-04T23:16:19.057+0000)\n>\n> Jesus christ you can EXPLAIN it is a joke and people STILL don&#x27;t get it is a joke.\n> \n> Also, your entire headcannon (minus gender) can still exist if you stop excluding homosexuality as a real thing.\n\nWell...reproductive values. Sure a female scuttlebutt can love another female scuttlebutt. But can they make little future scuttebuttlings? *-coining that word now too, btw, 'scuttebuttlings', it's mine, don't use it >:O*\nWhere's the next generation??\nOr our we hunting an extremely endangered species? FOR A WARD. FOR A WARD FOR CHRIST SAKE?? Last 2 scuttles on the planet, they're both female, and in love...and we're trying to kill one. FOR.A.WARD.\nAlso if they are both female...and there keeps being new ones...\nMaybe we have like some Jurassic Park shit going on. Females cloned from females from DNA trapped in amber.
