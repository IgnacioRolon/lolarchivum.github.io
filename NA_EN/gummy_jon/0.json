People in my last few games were complaining about lag and I thought they were just joking because they'd say it after every death. Then I noticed it looked like they opened mid but it was actually 4 of them getting disconnected. We won the game off that and I went into my next game. After winning that game, I was stuck loading the game stats where it shows score, damage, and everything else. I decided to restart my client after because usually when that happeneds, my game crashes in champ select and i lose ~10 LP from it. The servers shortly went down after and I went to bedthinking about how I gained so much LP kappa. The enemy team didn't even get loss prevention.\n\nThe game I didn't get LP from - http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2295801173/216086193?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-18T23:12:35.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The unfortunate thing about service incidents is that the game server can miss recording the match results and thus not grant you the right LP for a match win/loss.
