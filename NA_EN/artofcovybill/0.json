But recently i have had some problems. When i jump into a game I've noticed i am having issues with scrolling the camera and using the left click button.. So while in a game, my left click doesn't work unless i double click, and i can't scroll the camera with the mouse.. I have tried switching from fullscreen to borderless. I have left the game and logged back in, and my camera is not locked! Nothing is fixing this.. Can anyone give me any suggestions on how to fix this. I literally can not play with these problems. If i can't get this problem resolved I will have to stop playing.. And I dont want to have to do that!\r\n\r\nThanks for any help","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-03T04:32:13.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh bruh, I feel ya there. It's incredibly hard to play with settings or configurations you aren't used to. The first thing I'd like you to try is to reset your config files to make sure everything is working properly there. Follow these steps, and let me know if that helps or not!\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"artofcovybill","date":"2017-07-04T01:14:47.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bropor\n\nJust wanted to let you know i followed the steps you recommended and it fixed my problems!
