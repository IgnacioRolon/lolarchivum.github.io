Is there any way to make it so normal people can actually play or is worlds all that matters? I am running 500MB bandwidth i should not be lagging at all. \r\n\r\nIf I cant play during worlds then im just not going to play at all and want a refund on all RP spent. I am not going to pay for a game that I cant play because all you fucking care about is the bull shit worlds tournament. This is a game not a sport.
