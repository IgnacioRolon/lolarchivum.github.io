The game will randomly slow down to around half speed and then suddenly speed up again. My ping is at a stable 29-30 and I have never experienced internet lag before. This is also not a graphics problem because not only are the league graphics still fine (just happening slower), I can still run other games with high frames too. I also get instances where I appear to teleport short distances after freezing for a second and the delayed use of abilities or movements. Any ideas on what could be happening and what I can do to fix it is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-18T16:55:28.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's key to figure out if this is happening as a result of something like packet loss, or game files not rendering properly.
