So in commemoration of poros and xmas I am holding a community art competition. The reward given out will be a $10 RP card giveaway at the end of this week (Saturday the 20th). I will be the one judging.\n\nThe rules are simple. \n\n1. You must use Microsoft paint\n\n2. You cannot use Pen and Art computer tablets, only a mouse.\n\n3. It has to be xmas themed and have at least ONE poro visible in the picture.\n\nI will not be officially in the competition, but I made one anyway. Good luck!\n\nAlso, don't eat the yellow snow :)\n\nI do not stream (often), but you can often find me on twitch if you want to. Let me know if ya do.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-12-15T18:41:53.363+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"O___O Hello, new favorite thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Besteau","date":"2014-12-14T23:11:47.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you tell if someone uses a mouse or not.
