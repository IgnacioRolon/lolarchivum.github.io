I've tried all the recommended solutions: switching to Google DNS, disabling firewall and antivirus, running as admin, deleting files in projects etc. and nothing seems to help at all. If anyone has encountered this error and found a solution, please help, this is extremely annoying. Also, I've submitted a ticket but the guy just keeps telling me to do the same things even though I've said they don't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T20:57:46.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see that you're already speaking with a specialist in your ticket and updated today.
