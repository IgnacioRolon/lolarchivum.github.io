I wasn't negative AT ALL in the chat, but I was being harassed. The only thing I think I could have been doing wrong is that I was talking in chat so much about the issues and asking for the people who were harassing me to be reported. I don't think that's unreasonable because people like that should be punished, so they learn to stop. If the reason that I got banned was because I was asking other people to report them so much, I didn't know that could get me banned and WILL NOT DO THAT AGAIN. I think that statement is important because I believe that in this individual situation I am really not deserving of this ban and have learned from my mistakes as a consequence of this happening. I want to continue to play on my account at this very moment because I really like playing league of legends and I think that because of that I will do everything in my power not to get a suspension on my account. Please revoke the suspension on my account. I promise I won't make the same mistakes that I made in the particular game that this situation is about. I also think that I'm addressing important issues with riots banning system. I don't know the inner workings of the system, but it does seems to be flawed, and I'm not sure if riot is motivated to fix the issues. I think that they need to look into the issues on a more individual level and address the problems individually, because situations like mine where I very seriously didn't know what I did wrong and want to work toward not getting banned again. Thanks, Hezus.\n\nEdit: I think that having a lot of conflict in the short term can solve a lot of problems in the long term and I think that I've done that in this situation.\nEdit (my chat log):\n\nGame 1\nHezus: I'm staying\nHezus: ya\nHezus: okay\nHezus: like you don't make mistakes\nHezus: you didn't even play as well as you could\nHezus: if you had walked up with me from the begining you would have killed her\nHezus: I MEAN FROM THE BEGINING WITH ME\nHezus: You were behind me\nHezus: do you see what I'm getting at though\nHezus: your inefficency\nHezus: do you not see it\nHezus: ?\nHezus: you're making me want to walk up and fight htem\nHezus: are you happy now?\nHezus: should I still afk?\nHezus: team is it okay if I afk?\nHezus: team\nHezus: is it okay?\nHezus: What\nHezus: I did nothing wrong\nHezus: nah forget you\nHezus: You know what I'm going to report you for negative attitude\nHezus: hey guys can you report twitch for a negative attitude?\nHezus: hey guys can you report twitch for a negative attitude he's being really mean to me...\nHezus: I didn't not even once\nHezus: you guys can rewatch the vod\nHezus: I did not int\nHezus: I'm reporting you renekton\nHezus: yas pls report twitch too\nHezus: u were late twitch\nHezus: not trying to be mean\nHezus: still reporting you\nHezus: for negative attitude\nHezus: Woah\nHezus: malph stop before I report you too\nHezus: I knew if we were together we would kill him\nHezus: you ran\nHezus: i didn't want to\nHezus: Did you not hear my explination?\nHezus: I said I thought together we could kill him\nHezus: but you ran\nHezus: there\nHezus: You're getting reported\nHezus: so what\nHezus: this isn't even ranked\nHezus: I would get your point if this was ranked\nHezus: I'm not trolling\nHezus: You know what\nHezus: I'm done talking to you\nHezus: please report twitch and malph they said very hurtful things to me\nHezus: Wow that was not a good play\nHezus: Twitch you have to start accepting responsibility for you plays or you will never get better\nHezus: No\nHezus: You externalized blame\nHezus: No one benefits from irrelivent negativity....\nHezus: That's why I hope you get banned so you learn that lession\nHezus: I hope you get banned\nHezus: great\nHezus: please report twitch and malphite for negative attitude and verbal abuse\nHezus: malphite told me I had 60 iq and that I was stupid he deserve the report just as much as twitch\nHezus: twitch is telling lies you can tell his character is bad because he told me \"go fuck yourself\" in all chat just reread it.

It looks like there was a disagreement, which led to you using the chat to put them down and beg for reports. You can always reach out to the player behavior team in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you wanna open up that discussion a little more though with the player behavior agents.","replies":[{"poster":"Hezus","date":"2018-01-07T22:02:21.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did open up a ticket. I'm waiting on a response. My primary problem with getting banned was that I did not know what I was doing was wrong and  now that I know it wont happen again. I think that merits an unban and an exception to the rule of banning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Venomvaj","date":"2018-01-07T21:54:49.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I've never had a chat ban, I do get tilted often by people who just seem to WANT to start an issue over nothing. My new strategy is to start off with something nice to say in select to pump everyone up or always try to recognize my mistakes before anyone else has a chance to be negative. And when people start to flame, your reaction feeds them. I just ignore them or mute them if its so consistent. Sure it's still a mood killer but at least you wont see a bunch of negativity. Then report them at the end. Sure, they will probably get many games in before they actually have a consequence, but just reporting them without fueling the flame will out you one step ahead of them. Hope that helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hezus","date":"2018-01-07T22:00:16.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're right, but I also think that if you don't address the toxic people in the community on a game to game basis individually, and have everyone report them they will never stop. I also believe that if every starts doing what I just said that even the toxic people will change for the better out of necessity, or they'll have to find another game and who wants that. What I'm saying is that its a good strategy and I'm trying to defend my position because there is some merit to it.\n\nI also agree with you. I have done that too a lot, but today I was particularly badly tilted, and to be frank with you I have a bit of a mental illness (undiagnosed) so I might be wrong about that, so I really can't help myself when it comes to addressing things that I see as problems. I do mute people a lot and I really do aim at not adding to the negativity, but today I just had to try a new way of dealing with the toxic people. I was like I felt compelled to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kokua","date":"2018-01-08T11:17:50.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A single report will be just as powerful as a handful of reports. Their logs will be looked at whether one report or 5 reports are made against them. If the logs show that they indeed are displaying negative behavior, then they will be punished accordingly. While your chat logs alone don't seem like something that would be worthy of a 2 week ban, it leads me to believe that you've previously received punishments already.\n\nYou shouldn't be advertising for everyone to report someone else, as that makes you out to look like the bad guy in a way that you're putting others down. Threatening to report someone will only give them greater negative feelings towards you, and this creates a negative experience for everyone. You don't need to tell someone that you're going to report them, just do it. You also shouldn't bring your team's drama into all chat and as a result create a negative environment for your opponents too. If everyone does what you did in that game, everyone would be crying \"report this guy\" in all chat for no real reason - which people already do, and games would be even more tilting for everyone than they already are.\n\nI personally don't mute anyone, as I want to see whether or not they try to change their behavior, or if they are continuously negative and deserve a report. I just don't feed them the responses that they're craving to get. I either try to change the mood with a positive suggestion, or try to help someone by suggesting something they could do that they might not have known, otherwise, I'm just a passive observer. Apart from the infrequent disconnections that result in me abandoning games against my will, I don't remember receiving any punishment. While I will admit that my behavior wasn't the best when I was younger and first started off playing this game, I'd like to believe that my behavior has been increasingly better, and the expectations for the community also seem to be getting higher.\n\nIt's nice to see that there is hope out there for people to appeal their bans, but I would be extra cautious about how you respond to people. I wouldn't even respond in a passive aggressive manner. If you were this close to getting a 2 week ban, then you have to show that you've improving your behavior for a good period of time. You don't want another 2 week or even a permanent ban coming up again.","replies":[{"poster":"Hezus","date":"2018-01-09T23:55:16.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude you're a hero for writing this for me. When you said \"I would be extra cautious about how you respond to people. I wouldn't even respond in a passive aggressive manner.\" This is a problem I have been dealing with recently in my life. Hearing this from you motivates me even more to change myself. I want to thank you for that from the bottom of my heart. I am very aware that my temper is a problem for me.
