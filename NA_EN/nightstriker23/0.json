They're openly able to ruin the game for others until they're reported in a fair number of matches.  I'd highly suggest putting in a ticket to Support with screenshots attached as well as the story of the affect game(s).  Riot has all the chat logs available from pre-game and post-game, although the IFS doesn't (to my knowledge) monitor that.\n\nIt's usually the most frustrating and what gets under our skin, both as players and human beings, when someone insta-locks at 5 seconds left when everyone else has already mutually agreed upon their roles.  If I play Rek'Sai in the jungle and think our team comp fits it, it's going to be rough when the person locks in Lee Sin at 5 seconds and says \"jg or feed fk u.\"  It puts players in that awkward position of \"Should I dodge?  Is he actually going to troll?  How good is ADC Rek'Sai?  I'm guessing terrible.  I didn't set up my Runes and Masteries for going into lane, am I screwed completely?\"  It shows a definite lack of empathy from the other player, and more often than not it's going to result in a bad time for the allied team, while the enemy team has the time of their lives farming the poor double-melee bot lane while Lee Sin is busy executing to Raptors.  Sure there's the times where it actually works out since you aren't able to see the enemy team in Blind Pick, resulting in Yasuo having a miserable time against Rek'Sai in Bot lane when all he really wanted to do was cheese an ADC, however this is likely not the case.\n\nI'm all for being able to have \"unique\" builds and off-meta picks so long as the team is playing as a team, but in the situation we're describing it's usually one individuals looking to bolster their own ego or play their own game.  Usually players don't hold up in their threats of \"trolling/feeding,\" as they generally want to play the game to win, however it's incredibly demoralizing to the player that lost his role and lowers morale for the entire team - essentially making them a man down since they would rather not count on that individual.\n\nThere are many positives and negatives about Draft Pick:  You're able to counter-pick your opponent and they're able to counter-pick you.  This, however, works very well with a team that communicates and swaps around roles.  Darius probably REALLY wants to fight Irelia at level 1, however he would rather not fight Gnar and this leaves the perfect opportunity to lane swap and try out off-meta roles.  Irelia mid?  Sure.  Irelia jungle?  Why not.  Irelia support?  Let's do it, I'll pretend I'm Rengar and jump around giving the enemy team whiplash.\n\nTL;DR:  I'd highly suggest trying out Draft Pick.  Yes it sucks that you're forced to go through 19 hours of waiting in queue while someone plays the \"gg autofill\" game and dodges 10 times while you're half the time going to be suckered out of your own role, but in the long run it's much less frustrating.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-04-30T04:31:27.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blind pick is for whatever you want.
