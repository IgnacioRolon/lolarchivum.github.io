Thousands of people have reported issue with lag spikes over the past week, and not a single valid red post has been made about it, other than the typical problems.\n\n16 years in IT, and I can guarantee that there is something very wrong with LOL servers.\n\nJust had my ping hit 1000+ several times in a row this last game, netanlyzr says nothing about my connection except that the typical ports that should be blocked, are blocked.  \n\nTracert is fine.  Ping is fine.  Ports open.  blah blah blah 100% on Riot's end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"amd098","date":"2015-04-05T18:17:49.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'm getting the same issue, can't even log back in.

As I stated it was the servers because youtube could play perfectly fine with no buffers. Again thank you for reading and commenting.","replies":[]}]}]}
