I&#039;ve never really done this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nFirst off, when I used her Blood Moon Kalista skin a few days ago and did her taunt. Her mask disappeared and it showed this weird, scary-looking purple face. I asked my friends in the game and they said they were sure it wasn&#039;t supposed to do that. I then went to go check the Skin Spotlight and yeah. They were right. It&#039;s still doing this even after the new patch. I&#039;m actually in a custom to check right now.\r\n\r\n(The face is really creepy, dude--)\r\n\r\nSecond, I played a lot of Kalista recently because I decided &quot;Hey. I wanna learn Kalista.&quot; I had no problems with her W before, aiming from the Minimap or otherwise, and now it randomly likes to put out a ghost in another direction for a shorter distance or in the same direction for a shorter distance. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s supposed to do that or not. I&#039;m just saying I had no problems with it before and I suddenly do so it might be a bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Valyreon","date":"2015-09-30T13:56:16.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also Kalista bug, when Master Yi throws Q on her, if she jumps (passive) after he Qed, he will reappear where she was before she jumped.
