Since this recent patch, my FPS has been dropping from the normal 130-140 range to around 30-60. This normally occurs post minion spawn and constantly when in lanes. I've supported a ticket on this issue. Thanks for your help in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-09T03:43:58.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you have a ticket open already, those tech guys will most likely be able to help a lot more than I can here on the boards.
