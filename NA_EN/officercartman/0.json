I am NOT comparing League of legends to Runescape here, but anyone that has heard of it has also heard of Runescape 2007. They released an older version of the game and there were more than 500K who not only played the game, but voted for the older version to come out. This could encourage new tournaments, new Old school 5v5 and 3v3 teams, and plenty other possibilities. Don't make the older version your main focus, but allow players to vote for what can and could be released (older champion updates, Items, map shrubs)  \r\n\r\nSO, lets make a poll where we can get players to vote for Riot to release older versions! If there are enough of us we can hopefully get a chance!","replies":[{"poster":"Reikken","date":"2016-08-19T02:25:00.330+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"would be the best thing Riot has ever done, but will _never_ happen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elros Thranduil","date":"2016-08-19T02:26:18.728+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want them they release the game from season2 or 3 client, pay to play....
