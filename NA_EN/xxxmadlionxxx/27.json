Their stamina buff (blood pact) increases their own stamina by 20% (and everyone else's by 10%). Even without the talent, if you compare a mage and a warock's HP pool, the warlock as a lot more health.\n\nThat said I agree with your points in general, just pointing out that even in a \"mage is squishy\" game, there are exceptions :P","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2016-05-25T12:08:50.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blood Pact was removed more that 3 years ago.

They have dark intent (castable buff) for spellpower + multistrike, and passive aura bloodpact for stamina (which further increases their own stamina by an extra 10%). If you notice, even Demonology warlocks (which I play) have increased HP pools, and they CAN'T sacrifice their pet.","replies":[{"poster":"Voluug13","date":"2016-05-25T23:12:17.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, Wowpedia needs to update its whole thing.

Ive never seen a normal mage build more than 1 or MAYBE 2 AP items with hp on them specifically because you have to sacrifice damage output in the mid game to acquire them.

Youre talking about a mage surviving for maybe another 1-2 auto attacks/spells come mid/late game, which is pretty negligible.\n\nI main {{champion:112}} , who in my opinion is the kind of champion that you would want to build pseudo-tanky on, but because of how he works with items you really cant afford to.
