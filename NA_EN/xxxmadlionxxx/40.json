The only real benefit is the raw stats as not many items have 100-120AP and 10% movement.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-05-01T20:16:08.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's supposed to be a burst item, thus only last for a short window.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2018-05-01T20:20:31.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Votable Jester,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EoY1nUqZ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-05-01T20:16:08.198+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s supposed to be a burst item, thus only last for a short window.\n\nThe original item when it was in development had an active of 8 seconds.

They'd probably need to up the cost to 3k but would still be worth going into. I think the big problem with it at the moment is it's just not as GOOD as other items. What I mean by this is compare it to what people are wanting to buy and its far from a priority. Most want a 20% cdr item 1st or 2nd (roa users for 2nd), and will then look at either rylais liandry's or lichbane zonyas. Then it comes to void staff or deathcap, normally followed by one of the previously mentioned items to finish up. Of course theres sometimes amorellos rush when your adc doesn't want to spend 800 gold, but the only people I see really benefit from Spellbinders in the mage lineup are Syndra and Orianna because their ults/combos can burst so hard and they can spam spells cheaply to watch it stack up. Even then they tend to only go Spellbinders when they're ahead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BALDG1VEN BOOMER","date":"2018-05-01T18:49:31.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These champions are meant for extended fights, not burst you down the minute they get you.","replies":[{"poster":"xxxMadLionxxx","date":"2018-05-01T18:56:02.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThÄ™ Weeknd  XO,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EoY1nUqZ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-01T18:49:31.536+0000)\n>\n> These champions are meant for extended fights, not burst you down the minute they get you.\n\nWell the extra ap doesn't really give them burst because their kits aren't designed for that, it would give them a higher DPS like ADCs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ok sure but why","date":"2018-05-01T18:40:44.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phase Rush should be like this too tbh","replies":[]}]}
