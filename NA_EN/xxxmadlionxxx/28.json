Sorcery tree lends itself to supports, bruisers and mages. No other tree supports that many classes. This means there are less runes for actual mages than compared to what is offered to an ADC the precision tree..... ADC, can pick 3 to 4 keystones in precision. Most mages only have 1 real keystone in sorcery, Arcane comet. Summon Aery works well for supports and phase rush is geared toward bruisers.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2018-10-25T08:33:38.913+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":6,"body":"Phase rush for bruisers when literally everyone who takes it is a mage?","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-10-25T14:11:47.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know why you get downvoted, the majority of champions I see taking it are battlemages.\n{{champion:136}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:13}}\n\nThe only bruiser I can come up with using it primarily is this guy:\n{{champion:5}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2018-10-25T19:36:18.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can talk as an Aurelion Sol main, what is he supposed to build then?
