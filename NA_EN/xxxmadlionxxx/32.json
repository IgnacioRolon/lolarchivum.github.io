Both mages and assassins are building full/semi tank items and straying further and further from straight damage items.\r\n\r\nYou have assassins going full tank (Ekko, Fizz) and mages are offered health on so many items that they almost have no choice but to get some health/ap.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? Are pure damage items underpowered? or tank/health items are just better?","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2016-06-26T15:28:32.746+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"AD assassins, ADCs dealing 750 on a single auto attack, all that stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Support BÎ¿t","date":"2016-06-26T15:22:12.217+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened that sometimes they are not even able to reach teamfight, and they just die from someones fart.

There is little point of playing as a squishy mage when enemy team is _almost guaranteed_ to have an assassin, if not in mid than in jungle, who will kill you dead before you even finish casting your stun.\n\nAlso if you lane against LB or Zed or whatever, you often simply _need_ to build sizable amount of defenses, or you will die every time their ult comes off CD.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-06-26T17:23:44.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot made all the AP items that give hp waaay too good with the mage update...while also reducing the AP of glass cannon type AP items. Why build glass cannon with low hp, when i can build 3k hp and still do my job very effectively? Theres supposed to be a trade off when it comes to mages/assassins....very high dmg in exchange for being super squishy and easily killed. But Riot went and screwed up that balance and now we see fizz's, lux's, and oriannas with over 3k hp while sstill melting ppl","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gibberwatt","date":"2016-06-26T17:03:14.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the thing is that with a bunch of glass cannons running around, whoever toucches the other dude first wins.  building bruisery (ad or ap) allows champions to engage in teamfights that last more than 1.5 seconds","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoggyStyle","date":"2016-06-26T16:51:04.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"could be the metas starting to come to my conclusion and is tired of getting blown up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erockandroll","date":"2016-06-26T15:57:50.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The longer you live, the more damage you deal. (and people wonder why Juggernauts do so much damage) \n\nI would say siege mages would have better luck glass cannon since they can kite and poke their enemies from afar, but they can go oom way to easily, and are still a little less reliable than burst mages.\n\nAs for assassin, The Bruiser/tank builds allow them to be effective duelists/split pushers. Which makes them far more reliable than the feast or famine style that assassins normally have to adhere to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swiftstrike4","date":"2016-06-26T15:38:08.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well since the mid-season change, {{item:3157}} and {{item:3001}} have become almost must buys for every mage. They are pretty cost effective  now and almost any mage benefits from building these items. Even though the mid season mage update was supposed to make mage items a little more diversified, most mages, no matter who they are playing have {{item:3001}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3027}} and {{item:3165}} as part of their core build. With items offering CDR and becoming more cost effective it is much easier to get 40% CDR. This is an improvement from the past, but it also lead to most mages building the same items.","replies":[]}]}
