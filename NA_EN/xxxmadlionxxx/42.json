Tristana hasn't in patches which, honestly, is a bummer. I liked it a lot on her but it just cant compete with shiv/rfc... honestly, they could have changed shiv/rfc back to the way it used to be(the two items having no synergy at all) and things would have been fine with ADCs... as it stands, I wish they'd make zeal items have synergies with each other that would encourage build diversity. Instead of RFC/Shiv just always being the right choice...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Primaquarius","date":"2018-08-03T19:40:55.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im still trying to register the fact my dumbass comment got upvotes","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sono Un Kebab","date":"2018-08-03T19:38:08.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOW YOU DARE LYING THERE ARE ACTUALLY 3 CHAMPIONS!11!1!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2018-08-03T19:46:14.058+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3285}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-08-03T19:37:36.213+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the best example of the Boards mage player, congratulations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Dog","date":"2018-08-03T20:20:41.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be a great argument if yknow, runaans was even slightly a problematic item in any form","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rexxiee","date":"2018-08-03T21:18:18.483+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know whats the funny thing?\n\nMages are one of the strongest classes in the game now and adcs are one of the weakest, and we still see garbage like this by silver mage players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2018-08-03T21:25:23.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because nearly every single mage has AoE as it is - Adding AoE to AoE would just be doombots levels of absurd.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZephyrDrake","date":"2018-08-03T20:21:17.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it would be broken since most mage skills also come with some form of CC and/or higher range.
