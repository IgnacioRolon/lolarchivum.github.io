The point LankPants made is that there are too many runes in Sorcery that focus on additional movement speed, which is a thematic mismatch with the intended purpose of the tree, and which crowds out space that could have been given to actual spell-focused effects. With the removal of Ultimate Hat and the addition of yet another movement speed rune, this problem will only worsen, as there will soon be 4 runes out of 12 in the tree, including one keystone, that focus on granting movespeed. Do you not see a problem with one-third of a spell-oriented tree being all about moving quicker?\n\nI get that it must be exciting as a designer to implement the option to go into Sorcery and stack nothing but movement-based runes, but that is simply not what players in general want or expect with the tree. Considering how disappointing Sorcery has been overall, it is sad to see it taken in what is largely being regarded as exactly the wrong direction. Why not simply move these movement-based effects to Domination, and give Sorcery some of its more caster-oriented effects instead? There are several Domination runes that could be a good fit to Sorcery, namely Ingenious Hunter, Cheap Shot, Electrocute, pretty much all of the Tracking/ward-based runes, and obviously Ultimate Hunter once it gets added.\n\nIn general, it feels like Domination got a lot of the cool effects that Sorcery could've used, and I think switching at least some of these options around would establish a clearer difference between the trees, as both currently offer different ways of dealing more damage and moving faster within each tree. Would it not make more sense to have Domination focus on offering different ways of enhancing one's movement, and have Sorcery augment one's casting?","replies":[{"poster":"Vartius","date":"2018-05-17T10:36:06.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Just take goddamn Domination then.

This is why we have experienced such a degree of CDR inflation on items. CDR is therefore incredibly powerful on any kind of caster, no matter how bursty, because it gives them faster windows of damage and recovery, which can make all the difference in fights.

It's just not the whole story. I simplefied it. That's it.\n> \n> The very fact that so many mages go primarily for Domination, when Sorcery is meant to be a spell-focused tree (and that in itself need not be mage-specific), itself demonstrates a thematic mismatch. If Sorcery did such a good job of enhancing one&#x27;s casting, why would the game&#x27;s most dedicated casters have to go for another tree entirely just to boost their spell power?\n\nAnd since when suddenly is domination a non-spell-focused tree? As far as I know most assassins, AP or AD, are CASTERS! They have some damage on their autos, but most of the burst comes from spells. (The rest of the question is pretty similar to the one below)\n> \n> &quot;They take what works&quot; is precisely the reason to change both Sorcery and Domination. If &quot;what works&quot; isn&#x27;t ideal, then there is room for improvement, as detailed here already. Moreover, you completely fail to see the point here: if a champion wants to go for Domination, even if they&#x27;re not an assassin, that&#x27;s fine. What&#x27;s not fine is when they do so for reasons that are meant to be core to another tree. Therefore, when people go into the caster tree because they want to move faster, and go into the assassin tree because they want to augment their casting, something&#x27;s wrong with the way those trees have been designed.\n\nOnce again - Both Domination and Sorcery are augumenting casting. They do it by different means, however.\nDomination does it by giving you burst damage (Once again - simplified - it does it by other things as well), while Sorcery is augumenting casting by giving you more poke damage and allowing you to keep poking/hit your spells in general.\n> \n> And this is relevant to the argument... how, exactly? Are you saying the totality of mages are artillery mages and Mordekaiser? Does nobody else matter to you?\n\nNo, I was giving some examples of mages who sorcery tree is actually designed to. Also EXAPLES. That's not all the mages who use this stuff - I don't play ALL mages so I don't know what works for all of them.\n> \n> Yes, let&#x27;s design a massive portion of a whole rune tree for just four champions. Splendid idea. Meanwhile, those champions would be perfectly fine if those options were in Domination, whereas many more champions suffer with the removal of Ultimate Hat, one of the most caster-centric runes around, from Sorcery.\n\nFirst thing... again... EXAMPLES. I wasn't presenting the totality of it. \nAlso again... Why would those options be in domination? The mentioned champions, if you notice, aren't really burst oriented. They have some burst, because nowadays everyone has some burst, but it's not their FOCUS. The mov. speed speed route seems perfect for the tree not focused on burst, but towards other caster-related issues.\n> \n> Literally one-third of that entire tree focuses on movement speed. It _is_ the movement speed tree, as literally no other tree provides nearly as much movement speed, not even Domination. Why is Sorcery the best fit for this, exactly? Why not Domination?\n\nIt has a single speed route. The rest of the runes aren't connected to speed. It's not THE MOV SPEED TREE since it's not all mov speed. It's the most mov speed tree out of all, but it still doesn't mean it's the only focus.\nAs for the latter - I already said it above. Mov Speed wouldn't fit with domination, because mov speed isn't burst-related in any way, shape or form... It is however related to non-burst casting, which as I said many times over, is the focus of Sorcery tree.\n> \n> Any champion who wants movement speed, and not just mages, would be just as fine, if not better, picking it from Domination. Meanwhile, a ton of mages are still underserved by Sorcery, and the one rune that was attractive to mages in general is now being given to a tree that already has a ton of great bonuses. What exactly is your own rationale for designing Sorcery here? How exactly does it fit into the bigger picture?\n\nThey are literally taking a rune that didn't fit well with sorcery and giving it to domination... Where it fits. Thereby making it EVEN MORE more attractive for burst mages, who should take dom tree in the first place! Again! It's not the assassin tree... it's the caster-burst tree. Meanwhile sorcery is caster-sustained tree. \n> \n> By that logic, literally any ability is part of burst, so Domination should be the caster-focused tree. That could be fine, but then you might as well call it Sorcery, and have Domination be the tree full of movespeed effects. It feels like you&#x27;re getting the purpose of Domination and Sorcery confused, as apparently has whichever Rioter in charge of removing Ultimate Hat from Sorcery.\n\nYes! Domination IS A CASTER TREE. Sorcery is also a caster tree. Both just focus on a different part of casting. \n> \n> The very fact that Aery and Comet don&#x27;t synergize with other caster-oriented effects is part of the core problem with Sorcery. Its keystones are notorious for being among the worst out of all the rune trees, and its only saving grace was that some of its lesser runes worked well on casters. Ultimate Hat was the best example of this, as it was legitimately useful on most casters, so to see it removed simply has the entire tree become less interesting and consistent overall.\n\nHow is it becoming less consistent, if I just said it had the worst synergy with the rest of the tree? If anything the removal makes it MORE consistent in it's goal. \nAlso I worded it wrong: They don't interact BADLY with ultimates... They just interact with ultis as well as with other spells, as opposed to better than with other spells - so the difference between CDR on ult and CDR on all abilities.\nAnd even if there are ultis they in fact interact badly with... Ulti is not the whole kit. \nAnd how are the runes interacting bad with casting in general? I say they interact pretty great. Just now with the burst-casting... which makes sense, since it's not the focus.\n> \n> If you are literally _any kind of caster_, you will want to make the window between individual spells shorter. Why do you think CDR only works for poke and battle mages?\n\nYeah, sure. Everyone wants CDR if they casts spells... I am talking who's the most effective with it. Burst mages will benefit more from more damage rather than CDR - it will be more efficent for them.\n> \n> Which is why assassins don&#x27;t try to build CDR at all, let alone max it out or have it in their dedicated items... oh wait.\n> \n> But no, bursty champions do want lower cooldowns on spells, because burst champions have been balanced over time around dealing less burst, and casting faster. This is why we have experienced such a degree of CDR inflation on items. CDR is therefore incredibly powerful on any kind of caster, no matter how bursty, because it gives them faster windows of damage and recovery, which can make all the difference in fights. Where exactly were you getting a different impression? What you&#x27;re saying almost sounds nice on paper, but falls apart with even a modicum of practice.\n\nOh sure, I must admitt... That part I am not exacly right on... But I also think inflating everything with CDR was a bad idea in the first place.\nBurst mages SHOULD have insane bursts but high cooldowns... after all, that's what they are there for. Why should you reduce burst but reduce cooldown between spells if that's what ADCs are there for? If that's what sustained-damage casters are there for?\nBurst mages should be able to kill someone in a burst and an ADC shouldn't be able to burst in the first place. If you notice: that was the time most people look most fondly at.\nAnd if you look at it that way... Yeah. Making Domination tree the: More Burst, Less CDR tree, while Sorcery the: Less burst, more CDR tree is a step in the right direction.\nUltimate hat while it is a CDR rune is also different in what it aims to provide the player. It aims to give him a bit shorter windows between bursts... a bit because it's supposed to make it go from like 60 to 50 sec. Or whatever. I don't care enough to do math now.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-18T13:03:20.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=000900010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-18T00:25:57.172+0000)\n>\n> As for the latter - I already said it above.

Therefore, its removal makes the tree as a whole less consistent. Also, how exactly is Nimbus Cloak a good fit for the Sorcery, then?

The very fact that it doesn't accommodate burst casting, including comboes that are central to the playstyle of many mages, is already not good, and your own yearning for Domination to be the burst-casting tree does not contradict this. Neither Comet nor Aery are a particularly good fit for most mages, and we're still in an environment where there isn't really a keystone for battle mages. There does happen to be a good keystone for burst mages, but that keystone's in Domination: it's now called Electrocute, but not all that long ago it was called Thunderlord's Decree in the old system, and was hugely popular among casters of all kinds, including mages.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=000900010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-18T00:25:57.172+0000)\n> \n> Yeah, sure.

Not only is this new version of the argument utterly weak, as it does nothing to explain why CDR, a caster-centric stat, wouldn't be appropriate for a caster-centric tree, but it still isn't even really true, as CDR has always been desirable on burst mages, even when it was more difficult to obtain. Raw damage only goes so far, and CDR acts as a very large multiplier to one's casting power, which is why it will always be desirable even on the burstiest of champions.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=000900010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-18T00:25:57.172+0000)\n> \n> Oh sure, I must admitt...

By your own rationale, then, it is a better fit on Sorcery than on Domination. If the intent is for burst champions to have noticeable downtimes, and if you want Domination to be the burst champion tree, then I don't see why you would advocate to include a rune that specifically aims to reduce a champion's downtimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-18T13:02:54.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=000900010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-05-18T00:25:57.172+0000)\n>\n> I still find that ridiculus.

If you want to talk about Mordekaiser, for example, Predator is a great keystone on him, and giving him more mobility options farther down the tree would work really well for him. The same could apply to many of the other mages you mentioned, as well as non-mages opting into the tree for mobility. Why so much attachment to having Domination being the burst tree?

It is as arbitrary as it is inane to claim that a tree needs to offer _nothing but_ a certain mechanic in order to have it at its theme, and all of this is a transparent attempt to dodge the fact that Sorcery clearly offers far more movement speed than any other tree. Sorcery is the movespeed tree, whether you like it or not, because it is the best tree to go for right now if one wants mobility. This is the core of the matter, as it simply makes no sense to go into a tree ostensibly designed for mages, only to pick a set of bonuses that the near-totality of mages strictly do not possess or need.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-05-17T17:10:22.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vartius,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=0009000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-17T16:58:53.756+0000)\n>\n> Why would assassins want to move fast though? Like really. Most have ample ways to go in and out of fights (May it be for the better or for worse). Aside from that:\n> 1. Who gives a shit what were the trees supposedly designed for? What matters is what they do - in Domination you have burst, in Resolve you have tankyness, in Inspiration you have some random shit lol, in sorcery you have: Mobility, Poking tools, other things useful in mid lane (Nullyfying orb against other mages).\n> A lot of mages use electrocute already: Ahri, Anivia, Syndra and Lissandra are just some examples. Most of AP assassins use the dom tree as well: LeBlanc, Fizz, Akali, etc.\n> Why wouldn&#x27;t they go Domination? Because it&#x27;s &quot;the assassin tree&quot;? Bullshit. They take what works. And Domination works for Burst Mages and AP assassins.\n> Sorcery, on the other hand, works for mages who deal more in pokes.\n> Ziggs, Vel&#x27;koz and Xerath for example use Arcane Comet. Why?\n> Because they poke enemies from afar using their abilities, but said spells have enough cooldown for them not to use aery.\n> Aery is for mages like Karthus or Orianna, who are either encouraged to do basic attack or have a CD low enough on an easy to hit spell.\n> Mordekaiser uses Aery, but he is switching to Phase now that it got buffed.\n> Malzahar uses Aery because he has tons of dots and other abilities that make aery attack each time it&#x27;s ready.\n> And for those mages Aery will do a ton of damage over the course of the game.\n> 2. Mages who want to move quick? Aurelion Sol and Cassiopeia are good examples. I can see Viktor using Nimbus Cloak with the way his ulti works. Also he was already taking Fleet Footwork, so that&#x27;s that. Mordekaiser will most likely take the entire movement speed route. I don&#x27;t play that many mages so I don&#x27;t know.\n> 3. They aren&#x27;t turning sorcery into a movement speed set. Yes. A lot of runes give movement speed in that tree... So? It doesn&#x27;t mean they are turning it into a mov speed tree. They are making it possible for mages who WANT movement speed to make a tree for that purpose. Meanwhile the other mages who want to use sorcery (poke and sustained damage dealers) still have what they need.\n> \n> Ultimate hat by all means belonged far better in domination.\n> Dom is for bursts. Ultis are usually a big part of bursts. Making the window between those bursts shorter IS the way to go for a tree that caters to burst.\n> Meanwhile if you look at sorcery NOTHING there made sense with ulti cooldown lowered. Aery and Comet are used by poke mages and don&#x27;t really interact overly well with most ultimates.\n> You have 10% cooldown on all spells instead. It also makes sense. If you are a poke mage or sustained damage dealer you will want to make the window between individual spells shorter.\n> If you want to burst opponents... you don&#x27;t need cooldown on all spells to be lower. You will most likely use a spell once in a combo.\n>\n\nDiana will benefit a lot from things like Hail of Blades and Nimbus cloak. Her passive adds a lot to her damage but often the enemy has escaped by the time she can make that final hit. Hail of Blades will give her the attack speed needed to get this off after her ult, and if they flash away nimbus cloak will get her close enough for her e to pull them back in (rather then having to ult a second time just to hit that final passive).\n\nMalzahar could also see great benefit from Nimbus Cloak as his old ability to Q after his ult was ruined but the reduction in e duration, but with nimbus cloak he'll be able to have a *mini* ghost effect to get him close enough to do this again (One of the changes they have made is to have nimbus cloak take effect a \"short time after you ult\" meaning that if you channel your ult like Malz it doesn't proc until after the ult is finished!)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2018-05-17T01:12:35.967+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"The most passive aggressive comment I've seen in awhile lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-05-17T01:20:44.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Stay hungry; stay humble](https://www.riotgames.com/en/who-we-are), y'all!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-05-16T23:15:18.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Rovient,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EtX5N9zL,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2018-05-16T23:10:31.277+0000)\n>\n> Hey all,\n> \n> Nimbus Cloak/Ultimate Hunter are still bound for 8.11 patch and will be returning to the PBE for further testing soon.\n\nThat's Awesome news!
