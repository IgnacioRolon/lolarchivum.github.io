That being said, you can't do much with blue essence right now and you'll be able to dump your excess blue excess when they come out with the exclusive content for ridiculous amount of blue essence price.\n\nWith all that being said - I'm pretty sure blue essence will have the same spending value and time as IP with maybe just a few more things to use it for. Not much of a change minus changing IP to blue essence i guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2017-09-04T14:19:42.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either way it just means I'll have a ton of IP that I can't use.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-09-04T14:02:09.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because we are not you? not everyone has a surplus of IP? that's like saying ''why are people complaining about starving?
