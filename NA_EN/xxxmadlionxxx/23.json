You don't use spells on cooldown, you learn to manage your mana and you learn that C O M P O N E N T S exist. Know what builds into Armguard AND Chapter? Amp Tome. It's cheap, it's good.

Those are scarier, because they will likely jump you with their E first to slow, then follow it up immediately with a double shuriken. To avoid that you need to move unpredictably. Try walking forward instead of backwards to your tower, because that's what most people would do. Play mindgames, throw him out of his routine. Punish whenever W is on cooldown. Remember that minions reduce shuriken damage and never stand close to the shadow. \n\nWhen he ults you and has a W out, try throwing out your spells where he comes out of his R. Stuff like Cassio ult are amazing at this. He is always behind you afterwards and if you land a CC or even walk in the right direction you can almost dodge all of his damage already. If he does the instant switcheroo don't panic and still try moving unpredictably.

If you have trouble you can buy a second Doran's. You don't have to finish Armguard, the 15 armor of Cloth Armor for 300g is enough to negate the Lethality he gets from his full item. Lethality isn't that effective early in the game, so at the point he has a Duskblade it will negate around 15 armor, giving you enough time to get a Chapter and Stopwatch.\n\nAlso learn to flash his ultimate properly. Helps deal with him a ton and avoid wasting Stopwatch. You flash the second he leaves ult so he can't shuriken you instantly. \n\nAbuse his W cooldown. Once he used it or jumped you have a window to punish. Sometimes you can bait them into using it by making them think you left to roam, but you stand behind the river wall. When he used it you just walk up to him and deal damage for free.","replies":[{"poster":"The Chillin","date":"2019-04-25T05:32:59.008+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Low elo mage players HHHHATE when you ask them to learn how to manage Mana.","replies":[{"poster":"2Charmnot2Charm","date":"2019-04-25T07:39:44.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Chillin,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b0WApoV0,comment-id=0006000000000001,timestamp=2019-04-25T05:32:59.008+0000)\n>\n> Low elo mage players HHHHATE when you ask them to learn how to manage Mana.\n\nWith how popular that stupid mode called urf is we shouldn't be surprised.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ephixus","date":"2019-04-25T11:28:20.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Saltarin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b0WApoV0,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2019-04-24T23:53:39.105+0000)\n>\n> Because armor exists, next time dont rush a full mana item, keep the Lost Chapter and then buy Zhonyas.\n> \n> But well, you can also refuse to learn how to play against Zed and cry on the Boards.\n\nThat's the point even armor doesnt help against lethality items he get first.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Saltarin","date":"2019-04-25T11:39:57.221+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">That's the point even armor doesnt help against lethality items he get first.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna ask you in a polite way if you have even readed what Lethality does, because what you just said doesn't make sense","replies":[{"poster":"Ephixus","date":"2019-04-25T11:58:18.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Saltarin,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b0WApoV0,comment-id=000600010000,timestamp=2019-04-25T11:39:57.221+0000)\n>\n> Okay, I'm gonna ask you in a polite way if you have even readed what Lethality does, because what you just said doesn't make sense\n\nYou are legit (removed by moderation) {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}\n\nDo u understand that mages can't stack armor?","replies":[{"poster":"Iota Theta","date":"2019-04-25T13:27:39.440+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ephixus,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=b0WApoV0,comment-id=0006000100000000,timestamp=2019-04-25T11:58:18.751+0000)\n>\n> You are legit x {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}\n\nWhoa there.

I by no means enjoy that matchup with most mages,  but it is by no means the \"hugging the tower for 10 mins\" nightmare you make it out to be.\n\nWhat? You've probably never played against a Diamond+ Zed main.\n\nZed puts his W on top of you and hits you with E + at least one Q. It's unavoidable.\n\nThat combo deals 473 damage at level 7 with only Serrated Dirk. Casters have about 44 armor and 960 health with Chapter. Lethality reduces the armor to 37. Total damage taken after armor is around 347. That's 36% of your max health.\n\nIf he lands two shurikens, it does about 443 damage, or about 46% of your max health. This is low enough for him to just ult and kill you once his cooldowns are back up.\n\nYou now **also** have to play around his shadow, because it effectively zones you from the wave, and you're creating distance from your turret by side stepping around it to continue CSing. Zed can use this for cover while he picks up some CS before the shadow drops, then get the rest from a safe range with Q, only missing maybe one or two.\n\nAbsolute worst case scenario, he does this twice and always misses the second Q, and the third time he can kill you with his ult. It's unavoidable damage, and most mid laners have no way to reliably trade with him when he does this, either because the minions are blocking your skill shots or because he's too far away to guarantee a skill shot lands.\n\nIf you try to rush Armguard, you just delay the time he needs to kill you to three W + E + Q combos, instead of four, with the added bonus that you quickly run OOM and have to leave lane, giving him plating gold, priority over objectives, and also free roams, which is potentially even worse than if he had just killed you.","replies":[{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2019-04-25T13:10:54.158+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed mains sure try to downvote anything anti-zed related :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slogg","date":"2019-04-26T03:02:50.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy.
