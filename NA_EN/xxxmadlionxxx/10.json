The worst part is there is if you die before the ult ends, you do no damage. The only way to solve this is to buy {{item:3157}} which has been gutted by riot. Meanwhile, you need to rush mana because her W now cost more than an ult at 130 mana full rank. This means you can't rush zhonyas anymore because you need more mana just to farm. Champs like {{champion:238}} get to do this for free all day while mages as a class, on the whole, was nerfed for this by the mana changes. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the second part of her ult damage was spread out over the 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe best part about all this is how long it takes before she actually kills the target. Enemies tend to have a full 2-5 seconds to react, heal, dash/flash out the way in order to survive her kit.\r\n\r\nI love her kit, but there is too much room for counterplay for AP Morgana to ever be effective. I kinda feel like she should have a built-in grevious wound at the very least.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ecdysiast","date":"2019-04-15T23:06:34.396+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think her ultimate should do its second part if she takes damage. It'd really play into the \"pay for your sins\" theme of her new character.

Another thing they can do (since they took this away from galio) is cause the second part to deal more damage based on how much she took over the duration. This would make her more potent in either role without making her overbearing, and you can take a bit of damage off of her W to force her to be more interactive for her damage output in teamfights.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-04-15T22:56:05.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's why most people play her as a support now.\n\nEither way, they have her some love in her W shaving CD on tick from champs and cannons, and she's always run the risk with her ult but that's part of the fun in her kit - managing to get off a full ult is super rewarding.\n\nPlus...in order for them to lower the time for her ult to kick in, they'd have to either gut its damage, or take something from another part of her kit...and I don't particularly think she's in a position to be losing anything for a faster ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2019-04-16T06:02:36.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe stop rushing {{item:3285}} and go for {{item:3027}} .

Pool only needs to be leveled high enough to waveclear, so stop leveling it when it's high enough to clear the caster minions from full health. After that, AP will keep it's damage high enough.\nAfter that, putting ranks into Q still increases the damage W does to champions, not just because of the snare but also the more damage Q does the lower the opponents health is for Pool.\nAnd this way, you get to start ranking your Q up in time for team fights.\n\nI don't know if 3 ranks in W is still the right number though, so remember to pay attention to the casters and when it starts killing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illabethe","date":"2019-04-16T02:07:03.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need Inspiration Secondary runes to reliably carry with her.\n\nYou can easily pull off insane plays as Domination/Sorcery and get good KDAs, but you won't control a game without Inspiration's Gold budget and move speed and CDR.\n\nIf you're worried about her ult, Try Nimbus Cloak.
