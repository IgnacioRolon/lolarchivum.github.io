Hextech Revolver gave spell vamp for six fucking years and you lot never bought it. Clearly, you value your burst more than your sustained defense, and Riot acted appropriately. That was the power of the consumer, based on data. If you want items to stick around, you have to buy them and use them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2018-02-10T00:44:47.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3157}} should be be more of a squishy mage item because a battle mage shouldn't fear getting into a brawl and they should have better scaling on their abilities to make room for proper defensive items, similar to fighters as they also have to get at least one tank item if they hope to be semi-tanky. What mages need are more defined armor options so they can semi-brawl or tank damage from Physical damage dealers.","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Sandy ","date":"2018-02-10T02:16:51.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not how battle mages work.

If you give someone like Vladimir or Cassiopeia better scaling, then it's like an adc getting a free bloodthirster. Unlike fighters, these battle mages do not have high MS, mobility, invulnerability (except vlad), or base stats to aid their survival. Since they're ranged they can't have tools like Fiora or Camille.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicalDemons","date":"2018-02-10T01:57:12.820+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Mages aren't suppose to be tanky, they are suppose to deal tons of damage.","replies":[]}]}
