Meanwhile Ryze gets reworked 4 times before they get it right. What a waste of resources. Kayle could have gotten 1 of those reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2016-12-12T08:14:54.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kayle broken ? Lmao. I'm a Kayle main and if you want to beat her pick Akali, Nasus, Tryndamere, Leblanc, Yasuo(but you MUST be super agressive), Xerath, Annie, Mundo. Everyone of these champions can soundly defeat her when played with some sense. Kayle is not close to being broken. You have to think of her like Nasus, weak early strong late.\n\nIf you want to counter her in general, {{item:3211}} + {{item:3111}}. Those two items alone render her helpless against you until she's like 4 to 5 items and those items MUST include some form of magic pen. Kayle might seem strong but trust me, she had far more weaknesses than your average meta picks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sexy Jack Rabbit","date":"2016-12-11T05:07:08.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Ryze has only been reworked 3 times btw, try not to spread mis-information thanks)\nShe's actually not that bad at all, she has a somewhat oppressive kit against certain match-ups in the top lane, but so do Teemo, Singed and Darius.\nShe's super weak to CC and Squishy as all hell.
