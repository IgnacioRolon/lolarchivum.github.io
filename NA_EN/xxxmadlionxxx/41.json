It makes Cassiopeia completely reliant on her ult to mitigate dives which is an issue because of its accessibility (post 6, cooldown). A far better trade off for Miasma would be for the 'arc' to widen the farther away that it is cast. Essentially, if Cass were to cast it right in front of her it would be smaller than her old W, with a single pool of poison to stop enemy movement, while if cast at max range it would have the same wide coverage.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-06-09T19:29:53.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UltimaFatum,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ze0HMt4Y,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2016-06-09T15:30:35.950+0000)\n>\n> I feel as though the minimum range is a problem actually.
