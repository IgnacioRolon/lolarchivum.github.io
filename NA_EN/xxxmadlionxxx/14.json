So it's fine.\"\n\nBut I didn't say that.\n\nI specifically gave an instance where a player can outplay Blitzcrank. A tank using their ability to intercept another ability to put them in a favorable position to initiate an engage is different than Blitzcrank accidentally grabbing the tank. A little more involved than just standing in front of them, which *would* be a misplay on Blitzcrank's part but that's not the specific scenario I mentioned in any form. Sejuani using her Q to intercept a game-changing skillshot is not \"[standing] in front of someone more vulnerable and all that.\" That would specifically be an outplay on *Sejuani's* part, not a misplay on Blitzcrank's. \n\nPositioning is a part of the game, and it's part of counterplay. It's why we don't have ADC's in the frontline of a teamfight, and tanks behind them. If a team properly positions themselves, they can outplay enemy mechanics that rely on aim and timing (like a Blitzcrank Q).","replies":[{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2016-06-03T08:57:43.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say that you  did.\n\n\nI have been addressing ZephyrDrake's comment this whole time.
