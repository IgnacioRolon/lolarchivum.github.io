I have never bothered making a post about it but it literally makes no sense at all for her to have 340 MS. For crying out loud her MS matches half of the melee roster. If you land a chain, or are kiting a melee, you WILL kite them out. Melee champs are supposed to be faster so they can eventually close the gap. Be that she already wont be caught, the 340 MS is definitely insult to injury.","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 grams","date":"2018-12-12T23:10:10.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ice is cold and heavy","replies":[]}]}
