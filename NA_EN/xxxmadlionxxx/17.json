Zed was only complained about till ppl realized  you could rush a zhonyas and negate his ult for the rest of the game. after that i believe they nerfed zhonyas in response and from there zed was fine till this patch where the new items left him behind. LB doesnt need to be nerfed cause like fizz she is a counter mage. her job is to counter your shit and blow your ass up for it. she is only good when she can capitalize on your mistakes. any other time she is to squishy and will either die or she will be forced to run away when passive procs for trying. now it is not lucian that is being nerf'd a lot of adc's are going to be cause of how unstable 5.22 was. the game needs to be rebalanced in regards to adc's. pls dont complain your being singled out and stop this. this needs to happen and a lot of the community agrees","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2015-11-17T02:57:10.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Wrong the game is controlled by ADC mains and has been for seasons.

Siege, sustained damage, multiplicative scaling, among others. Being an equal pick to them is one thing, but being an equal pick because of blatantly unfair mechanics (Hi, Morde!) is entirely different. \n\nYou can propose things to take their place, but they should also preferably be replaced by something that can do those same things (strong siege potential, high sustained dps (preferably multiplicative to bust tanky champions later in the game)). There are champions that can do that, like Azir and Cass, but they usually lack in other regards to ADCs, such as badly needing levels, which an ADC often doesn't need as much as they need gold. Since they have strong lategames due to multiplicative scaling, strong siege potential, the power to bust through tanks (thanks to the multiplicative scaling) and sustained damage, they're going to be a go-to pick for the game until someone comes up with a viable alternative that isn't viable due to something broken in concept.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you subscribe to the ADC Conspiracy.
