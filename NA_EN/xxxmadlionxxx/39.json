The reason I say this is because static shiv can crit for about 400 magic damage with IE vs about 140 magic damage from Luden plus Rabadons. \n\nNow you can argue, Luden echo has 100ap while static shiv has no AD. While that is true, static shiv does give 30% crit and 35% attack which when combined with 70AD from IE plus 250% crit, does a lot of damage just from stats. Static shiv also give some movespeed. \n\nSee maths at the bottom.\n\n\nWhats my point? Well I know their are plenty of other things to consider such as CC movespeed armor MR and so forth. But the point I want to make is {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} cost 7000 gold while {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} cost 6000 while able to do more burst and sustain damage.\n\nLuden echo cost 3200 while static shiv cost 2600. \n\n\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n\n\n\n\nMaths (You can skip this if you want)\n\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} = about 308 AP.

He can just walk around and charge it again. The person who steps on teemo's shroom takes massive damage from doing so probably even giving him a kill. There isn't any real hindrance here.\n\nMages can already do large aoe burst and the ability to actually choose who gets bursted more or giving them _more_ burst is just gonna be overkill.  Then you have to also consider assassins that can pop off relatively easily, the fact that mages will take thunderlords that _also_ adds burst where as an adc rarely goes in that tree. Wanting more ludens burst is kind somewhat entitlement given that mages and other ap champs already have multiple burst options outside of their already bursty kits.\n\ntl;dr\n\nLuden's doesn't need more burst because of:\n-bursty kits \n-thunderlords\n-range advantage\n-other bursty items","replies":[{"poster":"Wildlife1","date":"2017-09-25T00:38:23.448+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The same can be said for adc's shouldnt have shiv.\n\nShiv needs less burst because of:\n\n-they are intended to do ad damage\n-have range advantage\n-shouldnt be bursty\n- warlords\n-RFC","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"abbbez","date":"2017-09-24T16:11:49.652+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"doing so that Static shiv would deal physical damage might make it pretty balanced.
