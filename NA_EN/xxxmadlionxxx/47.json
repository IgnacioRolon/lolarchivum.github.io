Immobile champs become like sitting ducks as they miss all their spells.\n\n\nThese champs don't have \"outplay potential\". Jumping around the screen at 2000 projectile speed while most mage skill shot go at 800-1200 projectile is not outplay potential. It is broken and simply unfair. To top it of, most of them don't even use mana. They can sit in lane and do it all day. Akali even has a built in heal as fcukking assassin. Heals are not for assassins. Its okay on assassins/fighters, but not pure assassin like Akali. That's why bruiser akaili was a thing. She had plenty of burst and sustain damage/heal in her kit.\n\n\nAnyway, the point I really want to make its, these new champs are simply becoming too fast for players to physically click and maneuver their mouse to be effective. Especially for immobile champ. If i were playing with a PS4 controller okay, they can fly across the screen all day, but I'm use a mouse. I simply can't keep up.\n\nIt would be totally unfair to increase the projectile speed of mage spells right? Well thats exactly what riot is doing with mobility in this game.\n\nNot to mention how unfun it is to play against those champs. The only defense is to sit far away and wait patiently, for their cool downs to go off, then you get your chance to participate in the game. Before long you get to sit your ass back under the tower because you can't do anything until the next round of cooldowns.","replies":[{"poster":"wildfox99","date":"2018-07-16T18:41:58.501+0000","up_votes":153,"down_votes":1,"body":">Not to mention how unfun it is to play against those champs.

In this particular case, Akali has hypermobility and stealth, which she used to have, except both now have been upgraded into free-targeted mobility and unrevealable stealth respectively, yet on top of this she is ostensibly designed to have a lot of burst and DPS still, especially with the addition of her execute, with much more waveclear to boot. The only thing she's truly missing is crowd control, and even then, she has a slow and a ministun for whichever reason. \n\nAs an immobile champion, one has to ask oneself: \"how do I outplay this?\" New Akali is visibly designed to expose herself minimally at melee range, not just with her stealth, but with her hit-and-run playstyle in general, so all of this begs the question as to how the average mage, fighter or tank would be able to deal with her, particularly if she gets ahead. \n\nAs with many CertainlyT champions, this champion looks cool to watch, and potentially exhilarating to play, but does not seem to offer meaningful counterplay: most of her interactivity seems to boil down to \"dodge the skillshot/dash\", but all of her abilities operate at extremely high speeds, which screws over immobile champions all the more, and what little counterplay she used to have with her stealth, low range, and general lack of escapes is now gone. As such, even though it is very early in her release still, it feels difficult to imagine how to successfully outplay her, particularly since she looks almost certainly too strong with her current numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2018-07-17T00:24:37.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"Her E needs a target for her to dash to for her second cast.
