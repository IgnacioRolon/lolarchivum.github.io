The problem with Eve being Hybrid is that giving flexibility to Assassins most often means giving Assassins the possibility to play Bruisers without counter-play.

Regardless of AD scalings, Eve could possibly still use Gunblade. Just like how Master Yi can still up and use Rageblade despite all the ap it gives.\n> \n> As for the last time Ahri was used in competitive: Before she got nerfed because of solo queue that last time.\n\nI mean, whatever you say. I doubt Riot will ever add it.\n\nAlso Ahri was last picked 2015 according to: https://lol.gamepedia.com/Ahri_-_The_Nine-Tailed_Fox","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-09-30T17:09:46.728+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That source is wrong as fuck then, cause she was in pro play using Gunblade just this year at one point, along with LB, after Rito nerfed LB and she started using it.\n\nRegardless, given the way Gunblade works, there's hardly a deterrent for someone like Eve to use the thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahris","date":"2017-09-30T17:14:02.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chipndip1,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=tiOr9Lgv,comment-id=000200010000000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-30T17:09:46.728+0000)\n>\n> That source is wrong as fuck then, cause she was in pro play using Gunblade just this year at one point, along with LB, after Rito nerfed LB and she started using it.\n> \n> Regardless, given the way Gunblade works, there&#x27;s hardly a deterrent for someone like Eve to use the thing.\n\nPlease give me an updated source pls. I don't remember her being picked in competitive since season 5.

Her damage overall was really just average.\n\nGunblade is really good. I take gunblade + lichbane. I don't take morello because it delays my damage spike too much.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2017-10-01T03:23:52.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She was nerfed because people complained about her \"no skill W RRR Ignite 100 to 0 kills\", even though they never happened. It was a nerf overall, but was still basically a power shift from her W and R to her E.\n\nI despise Gunblade. The active is great but the build path and stats are very underwhelming. No Mana, no CDR, and sitting on a Vamp Scepter/Longswords in lane don't make the active worth.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2017-10-01T02:01:38.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She was nerfed for the same reasons Ori was. She was just too consistent for a long period of time.
