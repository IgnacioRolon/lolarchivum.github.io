If red kayne heals for 2000 health, grevious wounds can prevent 800 health from healing. But I&#039;m never sure if it actually did anything. There are no indications that it worked, or the amount of healing it prevented.\r\n\r\nI suggest the same way green numbers appear every time you heal, blue numbers should appear indicating the amount you didn&#039;t heal. \r\nAlso, {{item:3165}} should indicated the total amount of healing it prevented in the tool tip.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"whizkid75","date":"2018-05-22T13:55:36.264+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Adding more colored numbers to the fray would cause nothing but confusion.
