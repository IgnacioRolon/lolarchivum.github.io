Muramana works on its own, but has a long stack time while not seeming worth while when compared to crit/lethality. It also gets weaker in long fights. The cons seems to outweigh the pros.\n\nI would like to see the item appeal to more champs as I think it is unique in its single target/on hit damage. I would also love to see mages use it. Adding a hard cap to the number of times it can be proc&#039;ed per second will prevent champs from completely abusing it with a multiple single targeted cast or spells that can proc like over 5 times per second.\n\nSo Meddler, can you pls let us know if riot is even looking at this item?

It's passive only works well with frequent singletarget damage, while most ADs that need mana have AOE abillities, that alone limits the number of potential users quite alot, as you need either spamable singletarget spells or High AS while wanting that mana to spam spells, which really aren#t much champs.\nOn top of that, Muramana has a kinda identity crisis, the costs and stats of it make it an early/mid items, yet the stacking mechanic makes it a mid-late item, which results with it only giving a brief powerspike duering mid once it transforms, and then it falls of due to the lowish stats for the slot.\nHowever, my bigest issue with it is that it drains your manapool like crazy **and it gets weaker the less current mana you have**. The reason for why this is such an issue to me is simple: If i go for mana, i do so to stay effective even in prolonged fights instead of running oom, and the muramana effect directly goes against that.\nAnother issue is that there are few mana items that you would combine with it, which further limits it's scaleing. You'll hardly see more mana than a trinity or iceborn on top of it.\n\nSo even with out the stacking issue, muramana would still be a flawed item that isn't very statisfying to get, while AA is a quite a nice item with quite some other mana/ap options for the synergie","replies":[]},{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2017-08-25T00:53:42.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a reasonably common build on Karthus and Cassiopeia, and is actually almost mandatory on a non-support build for Zilean (yes, those do exist).
