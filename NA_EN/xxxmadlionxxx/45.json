Most mages use it for burst, but you can use it for sustain if you have low cooldowns or try to cast atleast 1 spell on a 1.5 second interval.\r\n\r\nHence, would adding Lichbane to the new 20%/500 mana AP item set be op? \r\n\r\nCompared to {{item:3078}} 20% cdr should be fine if you raise the cost of lichbane as well.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think lichbane would be a great addition to sustain damage mages bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi","date":"2018-02-15T08:12:41.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No please.

Bot lane support makes will want utility items instead anyways.
