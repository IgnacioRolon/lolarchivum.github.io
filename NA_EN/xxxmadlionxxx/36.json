Assassins looking for dive openings, and are willing to give up some damage for the tower to be a non-factor.  It could also be a fitting Inspiration Keystone that uses the boot enchant method to make it something we can activate when we want it, so that anyone who wants to opt into diving could do so at the cost of the keystone.  Imagine if a jungler could opt to give up their keystone, but after their first back in the jungle could turn off a tower once every 2-3 minutes?  Perhaps even make it a Keystone enchant that makes ANY objective in the area go into stasis for ~5 seconds or so.  Turn off an enemy tower for a dive?  Sure.  Protect an allied tower for 5 seconds so that we can clear the minion wave so they can't get much damage on it, compared to killing it?  Sure.   Notice that the enemy is doing Baron, and you JUST are too far to reach it in time?  Gotcha covered.  Perhaps the enemy jungle is going to try and contest that dragon, and are just about to blast cone over the pit?   Would be a damned shame if the Dragon was suddenly stasised for 5 seconds now wouldn't it?\n\nThis would fit perfectly as an Inspiration keystone, without making it something that may be must take or not, and makes it something you can opt into as any champ, not just a tank or perhaps a tanky support.","replies":[{"poster":"Spank the Fox","date":"2018-03-15T03:10:30.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem with giving it to an assassin is that towers are supposed to be soft counters to their playstyle.

The issue ISNT that the people who used it arent mana-gated at all. Just that what the benefit is isnt all that helpful on everyone. And a lot of them have other options.\n\nSo maybe instead of being a bonus on auto-damage, have the benefit being something else AD related. Maybe something like \"When you deal AD damage you deal an additional 3% of current mana as additional damage.\" or \"Active: You spend 20% of max mana to deal 15% bonus damage for 8 seconds\" Sure those may be imbalanced, but something NOT auto-attack reliant is what im getting here.\n\nSince ADCs already dont have mana-issues, and the ones that do have {{item:3508}} changing what the item gives to better suit the {{champion:91}} or {{champion:83}} or {{champion:126}} or {{champion:6}} or {{champion:80}} etc, I think would be where to take the item.","replies":[{"poster":"big boi edri","date":"2018-03-14T23:42:14.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Muramana\n\nIsn't that what it does already?","replies":[{"poster":"Skorch","date":"2018-03-15T01:18:27.153+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Härd Stuck,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=d0o7nNgO,comment-id=0013000100000002000000010000,timestamp=2018-03-14T23:42:14.388+0000)\n>\n> http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Muramana\n> \n> Isn&#x27;t that what it does already?\n\nNo it is only basic attacks, and unit targeted abilities.
