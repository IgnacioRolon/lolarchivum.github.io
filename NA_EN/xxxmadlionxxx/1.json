It also has a pretty large band of ranges you can use it at so it isn't hard to throw it at whatever range you need to stop flashing over a wall.\n\nAlthough I thought the wall thing was more interesting and was kinda sad to discover Riot went with that buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2016-05-26T21:30:48.171+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for me its much better now, you can W over a wall or tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-26T21:44:19.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bobloser3555,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eYwxvz4u,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2016-05-26T21:30:48.171+0000)\n>\n> for me its much better now, you can W over a wall or tower.\n\nI agree it's better, I just wish it had been made better in a different way.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobloser3555","date":"2016-05-26T22:03:42.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"in what way?","replies":[{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-26T22:30:51.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bobloser3555,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=eYwxvz4u,comment-id=000100000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-05-26T22:03:42.042+0000)\n>\n> in what way?\n\nlower cooldown, bigger AoE (wider arc or thicker band), more damage or duration, stronger slow, granting vision in bushes, just buffing a different part of her kit, really anything at all.

Pre-Shurima, her power was loaded into her kit as a whole, with E being general cleanup for poisoned foes, though some did use it as their bread and butter. Flash to post Shurima with that abysmal Aspect passive and now her poisons do absolutely nothing but set up E. People new to her, and the people who enjoyed the E focused playstyle before liked that rework, despite the power gating and major flaws. However, people who enjoyed using her poisons were screwed over because they were no longer an offensive viability to her kit anymore. And then we flash forward again to the MYMU, where E has been gutted and the overloaded fluff that was added in Shurima was canned and the old passive was scrapped so that the rest of her kit could breathe and come out from behind the overbearing nature of that bloated Twin Fangs. Her poisons now are actually dangerous if you land them, and it's entirely possible to whittle down opponents without pressing E. E is still powerful, but the power is locked behind poisons, which is the entire intention of the power, as a follow up to poisoning a foe, so I can't quite understand why people are upset that you have to hit poisoned foes to deal the most damage with E.\nHer overall flaws, such as range and landing skill shots have always been crippling flaws for her, and nothing has changed in that regard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gg git diff","date":"2016-05-28T22:48:13.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, I donâ€™t like her new W.
