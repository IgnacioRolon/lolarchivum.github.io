I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it kinda defeats the purpose of a gap closer if you can walk the same distance in the same amount of time it takes to dash.\n\nIn the video below, you can see Morde using protobelt to catch up to a fleeing Illaoi, the result is the same as if he had just walked instead. All probelt did was apply damage, but the distance between the two remained almost the same\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kLvRUvSSS2s?t=76\n\n\nLet me know your opinion on this.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-05-29T19:57:17.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is just protobelt + high movespeed, always has been. It sucks as a long-range gap closer.\n\nWhat it is good for is juking or getting just close enough to cast a different ability, or that last little hop to avoid a veigar E.","replies":[]}]}
