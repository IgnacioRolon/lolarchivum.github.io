If I see an item with this ability I will delete this game and burn my computer. Literally one of the worst things to play against as the \"counter play\" is terrible especially if that person is ahead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sona Ping","date":"2018-08-06T14:35:20.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xxxMadLionxxx,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=OWJLu3lP,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-08-06T13:36:50.380+0000)\n>\n> I know what you’re thinking....’Why would anyone want this?’\n> \n> Because skill shot mages can have a tough time landing their kit and the last iteration of {{item:3116}}  was so broken that riot gutted the slow.\n> \n>In any case, I think it would be healthy if only the champ with the item can hit the soul.
