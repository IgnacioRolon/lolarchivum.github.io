This opens you up to all the enemy's abilities. This is a double hazard for for melee DPS, as they need to stay in that close range for an extended period of time, but the DPS build leaves them squishy by necessity. And scaling burst damage ensures that there will always be enough damage to blow the melee carry up.\nDotA doesn't have this problem, as burst damage hardly scales in that game (there is no AP, and cooldown reduction is MUCH more limited). This means that the increased tankiness from base stats will eventually outscale the burst enough for the melee carry to close the distance and get that Lifesteal rolling. Also, BKB exists to help melee carries with not getting blown up - it takes getting damaged by magic completely out of the equation for a short time.\n- **No double-dipping.**\nIn League, a high DPS build is always fairly squishy and susceptible to burst damage. This is due to none of the ADC items giving major defensive stats (even Phantom Dancer only works if you got to auto the burster at least once before he unleashes his damage).\n- **Kiting is better.**\nThe smoothness of the game generated by the lack of turn times contributes as well, as it enables kiting as a ranged ADCs defense tactic - can't hurt what you can't hit, can you?\n- **No XP feeding.**\nAs melees need the tankiness from levels, they cannot afford to share XP. In fact, the class that loses the least effectivity when sharing XP are ranged ADCs, as neither their safety nor their damage output are as dependent on the stat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nocturniquet","date":"2016-12-27T05:43:29.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this entire thread occured to me the other day when playing as Talon.

Ccing her during the gap closer is useless, but if you CC her during the damage, she stays stunned even after her ultimate ends. Most of the burst she's known for comes with the Triforce empowered  E after her ultimate, so stopping that is more effective. For instance, with Ezreal, don't arcane shift until after her ultimate goes off. With an Annie or Ashe, stun her as she reaches you. She will still do damage, but she won't be able to combo off the ultimate.\nIf your playing a Jinx or Twitch, you have to rely on your team to do this. Jinx is a low mobility ADC, and her lack of peel or escapes is an intended weakness.\nIf you're  squishy against Vi, stay grouped, because alone she will just wait out the stun or chase you down and kill you. ADCs or mages can't 1v1 divers.\nSome very effective counters to Vi are Sivir, because of her spellshield, Tahm Kench, as he can eat whoever she ults and make her useless, Kayle, because they can trade ults, and Shyvana, who, post 6, will always beat her in a 1v1. Fiora can Riposte her ultimate easily, Jax can dodge her E, Tryndamere will just kill her, and Olaf ignores her CC. Fizz, Vladimir, Shaving, Elise, Zed or a Zhonyas all do the same thing.
