Could give us insight on why Mages are getting so much health?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I know spell vamp was removed and mages are prone to being weak, but is giving them easy access to health the best solution riot could come up with?\n\nIn my opinion, most mages, whether they are artillery or battle mages, are going for health/ap items. Overall, I don&#039;t think this is healthy for the game as mages are beginning to function like bruiser/off tanks, while retain tons of damage/utility. Not to mention they don&#039;t have as much trouble getting in range to do damage as a bruiser would. The situation is similar to tank ekko where mages are not dying easily and are doing a lot of damage/CC.\n\nOn top of that, they are becoming less attractive as priority kills for assassins in particular. In the heat of a skirmish/team fight, when there are all kinds of spell effects on screen, I usually look for the squishes health bar as my priority target before identifying who the target is as I want to act quick. Before, that health bar would almost always be a mage or and ADC. Now, its just the ADCs that look squishy, putting more focus on them and not mages.\n\nSo Meddler, could you give us some insight into what riot is trying to do for mages and why are they getting so many health/ap items?\n\nShould mages have more creative defense systems such as {{item:3812}}  and {{item:3046}} ?","replies":[{"poster":"EpicMusic","date":"2016-05-23T19:59:22.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was thinking the same thing.

Atleast a fed or end-game ADC may have a chance (albeit a small one) with items like Deaths Dance or alot of Lifesteal to survive the assassin's onslaught, not to mention they are priority to peel for. \n\nOne point of the mage update is to make the mages, and mostly the immobile ones harder to deal with when it comes to being assassinated in my analysis.\nHence Cass's nope zone being a good example.\n\nNo immobile character likes Zed waltzing up to them, 100-0ing them and waltzing away. This is doubly so for mages.","replies":[]}]}
