Every role could be represented; you could have a utility support with a tank, assassin, adc, and a mage. This is because team fighting would be the focus of this meta. It'd be front to back with some spice and pretty good for competitive. Thing is an item like ardent cencer, or however you spell it, isn't a good way to do that. By making it an item riot made the most effective strategy in bot lane rushing this item. From there snowballing was much more likely since it amplified every adc spike afterwards, and the adc became the center of the meta because of how well adcs deal with certain strong tanks. Ofc this is hindsight bias of mine, if I was making the decision I probably wouldn't have done better.\n\nIf I was to change ardent cencer in a way to promote that meta I described I'd make it heal your ally after you heal or shield them for 5-50 on hit for some seconds and have some ap and move speed on it and cost some gold.

But when people refer to an AD mage, it's usually a siege style mage with a lot of poke. (Since most AD burst fall into the category of Assassin) \n\nAnd it's interesting, cause whether an AP mage is classified as \"Burst, Artillery, or Battle\" doesn't change the fact that a major mana item is a core part of their build. But for AD counterparts, only the siege builds really need a significant source of mana in their itemization. \n\nSo we are talking a very narrow band of champions who A) Scale of of AD, and B) want to poke. And some champs like Jayce who use to build Tear, look to different styles with different builds. (Namely, that Lethality builds will kill before mana's a problem) Likewise, the more AA centric champions turned to ER. \n\nIt's difficult to really analyses this because Poke so far out of meta at the moment. Glass cannons are sustaining thanks to the enchanter meta, and Tanks have Knight's vow and Wormargs to shrug off damage. Meaning that nothing sticks. Personally though, I would actually look at the effect of the fully stacked Muranamana, since it basically functions on auto attacks. (For a siege style effect, shouldn't it's active/passive/whatever, be ability based?)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2017-10-20T08:03:37.693+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when {{champion:34}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} used to all build tear.","replies":[]}]}
