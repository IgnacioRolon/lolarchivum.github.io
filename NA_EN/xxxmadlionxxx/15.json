I main AP Lucian...Please read this...","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"I know I&#039;m going to get down voted but I&#039;m really hoping someone from riot sees this.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a ap Lucian main and more than confident AP Lucian is a totally viable build with its pros and cons compared to AD Lucian. Most ppl think it is trash until they see me in action.\r\n\r\n I don&#039;t play ranked as I&#039;m interested in playing for fun and not stressing myself out.\r\n\r\nNow, what I would like to point out to riot is, the nerfs to Lucian on the PBE, will destroy AP Lucian. \r\n\r\nHis ult is taking a big hit in its base damage in the early ranks but remains relatively the same at rank 3. A big part of AP Lucian is his ult and I feel like his AP Lucian is getting a huge nerf base on AD Lucian armor pen building ways.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is his W lost some range too to make it match the range on his ult. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll, I&#039;m asking is that you take into consideration his AP kit and provide some compensation for this. Champ build diversity is very important and a fun part of the game for me at least. As long as it is not OP like tank Ekko/Fizz.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"redniwediS","date":"2016-06-03T16:48:55.926+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know I'm going to get down voted\n\nPeople really need to stop putting lines like this in their threads.  It does nothing and is just a waste of space.  Just make your thread and let the votes happen.","replies":[{"poster":"TSwift Is Sexy","date":"2016-06-03T16:50:43.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I downvote everything I see with this.
