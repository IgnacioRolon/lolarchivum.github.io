They can't get past the frontline though, so they could either use items that make them somewhat dangerous to tanks/bruiser (doesn't mean the should be able to oneshot tanks, of course), or items that help them attack the backline with the proper positioning. Also they tend to have some form of CC, that makes them still useful even if they're waiting for their damaging abilities to recharge. But it's better for them to focus on the burst, rather than becoming CC machines. \n\nAP assassins tend to have more AoE and/or CC than AD assassins, while still having the access to the backline that ad assassins have, and burst mages don't. Katarina has the AoE of burst mages and the mobility of assassins, but lacks the CC that pretty much every burst mage has, while Fizz has some CC and initiation, at cost of some AoE damage (he still destroys single targets).

They can&#x27;t get past the frontline though, so they could either use items that make them somewhat dangerous to tanks/bruiser (doesn&#x27;t mean the should be able to oneshot tanks, of course), or items that help them attack the backline with the proper positioning.
