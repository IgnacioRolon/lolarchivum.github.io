Now, this is a poor example since those two items are barely usable for a vast majority of AP users. But we can still remove some items, like {{item:3041}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3907}} {{item:2065}} . The first 2 because of how far you need to be ahead to both either build or use those to even BE a decent build option. Zhonya is a little tricky, but to put it short, it brings barely anything considering how this item has been nerfed, from active cooldown to amount of AP to armor being a joke anywhere in the game, so objectively, this item is very situational. Now, spellbinder is barely used and its just obvious why since it brings not much while coming with a powerfull active... that you can't use most of the time because of how long it needs to stay innactive to even remotely be relevant. Now, shurelya should almost be brought to {{item:3174}}  and {{item:3504}}  in terms of AP items utility since it barely brings raw stats to AP champions (who are, possibly, the most raw-stat dependant champs in the game most of the time) while being focused on being supportive and the same can be said about {{item:3905}} . If we go even FURTER, {{item:3027}} and {{item:3003}} , to a lesser extent, can also be considered ireelevant SITUATIONALY, since both those items also need stacking and can be intirely irrelevant to build at certain points in the game where the early/mid game is gone since the game are so short nowadays that those are barely options at some point.\n\nWithout even going furter and using a mage ({{champion:136}} ) that can use a majority of the ap item roster (even this abomination {{item:3030}} ), we can objectively say that his AP item roster is approximately and situationaly between 8 to 12 items out of about 18 usable AP items. This ranges from about 45 to 65 percent of usable (!!!) item roster situationnaly!! With this example, how the hell is this statement true when compaired to AD champions?? :\n\n>  in reality most AD champions have less options than AP champions as they can only utilize some AD items while many AP champions can use practically all AP items to some degree\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BEQYFjQ.gif[/img]\n\nSome examples, like {{champion:112}} , can't even make use of some more items because of other reasons! And this is only covering classic mages, it only gets worse for other AP scaling classes...\n\nIf we get to the AD part, how the hell is this even remotely comparable? The only items I can think of who \"can't\" be used by AD champions because of whatever reason are the melee/ranged limited ones ({{item:3748}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3085}} ), {{item:3004}}  and only recently {{item:3031}} . If an AD build ever gets repetitive its only because some items are far more effective together or just plainly stronger. If the same happens with AP builds, it just because, well, in 5 items post-boots you barely have any choicce on what you build so you end up with the same 2 or 3 builds for more than half of the AP roster!","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-07-15T05:13:01.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Exactly.

It's not bad but it didn't really change anything either. I would best describe them as \"4fun\" items.\n\nMy biggest problems with AP Itemization are.\n\n1. {{item:3089}} being a blanket multipler for EVERYTHING while not actually introducing or adding interesting of cool gameplay. It doesnt have any sort of useful utility effect that can shape how you will play the game like Rylai's slow, gunblade healing or Nashors on-hit effect. its just flat out more damage and scaling across the board for the SAKE of more damage and scaling across the board.  Really lame item and I think its passive is far overdue for a rework.\nRabbadons should actually have a niche set of users (preferably those looking to maximize damage like Kennen,Fiddlesticks or Katarina) rather than being a \"cant go wrong\" item applicable to literally anyone who builds AP. I mean even old Infinity wasn't bought on EVERY AD champion (Juggs/Bruisers/Assassins). \n\n2. too reliant on the {{item:3135}} {{item:3165}} /{{item:3020}}  double pen interaction.

Because of the really sterile build directions its extremely hard for {{item:3115}} to shine in the same room as {{item:3100}} . Any champ who would build Nash is probably just better off getting Lich and calling it a day. Both the DESIGN of AP melee champions and the ITEMS of melee AP champions tend to not support sustained fighting. Hell even when it comes to takin down towers LichBanes burst proc will give WAY more damage than the 50% AS from Nashor.

And maybe not everytime it was good but the one you got this year realy fixed much.\n\n> The misconception that there are simply more AD champs than AP is not true. There are almost the same amount of AP champs in the game as AD. Take a look at the list\n\nit doesn't come up to this. it just comes up to stats the diffrent classes skale. Adcs scale with ad, as and cit or onhit. Assassins like their ad- lethalaty mix. Fighters beside ad like to be more bulky, so ehalth and lifesteal is good.\n\nLooking at all the ap champs they like, well, ap. Ofcourse magicpen and cdr is also nice, but most chapions like cdr and magicpen with the boots is available to every ap champ plus voidstuff si amndatory for every ap champ to go threw mr. \nSo even if you make even more diffrent ap items and effects, as long as it is attractiv to every ap champ it is ahrd to split the items up.\n\nLets looka t exampel at {{champion:68}} . Mages normaly have not much health but gain much threw the items, as you cans ee there are a lot of ap health items. But rumble as a toplanechamp has more health as a mage. This makes especially {{item:3151}} really broken on him as he not only gets more dmg but also gets super tanky. without changing the champions you can't change much the items or introduce new ones as it will always give one class who dominates with the items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HP Crookshanks","date":"2018-07-14T06:43:50.482+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":7,"body":"Riot always favored AD over AP.
