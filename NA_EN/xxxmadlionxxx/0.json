I mean the way to make it sound is that it works out to the same thing....but I notice it which means it is different and it feels like less range\n\n\nI've been testing old cass and new cass, and overall, I feel like new does less damage, and is less reliable. I know her W has this great grounded CC, but the lack of range control make it hard to use. And it feels like the rest of her kit was nerfed for this new mechanic.\n\nAlso, her ult has like a 20-30% chance to stun. This is because of both the delay and the fact that enemies have to literally be facing Cass directly.\n\n\nIDK....I like the new ideas for Cass, but it feel like it is off a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canastus","date":"2016-04-23T11:51:32.680+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why on earth do you keep nerfing her?

And don't even think about using her ultimate, the thing is still extremely delayed and even had its slow reduced for NO apparent reason (down from 60% to 40% now), do you want her to remain unplayable in this mobility creep infested meta where every assassin can simply jump on her head to evade her hitbox entirely? \n\nShe'll be even worse at dealing with slippery opponents now since her only way of even hitting them was her Miasma, now it's just an extremely unreliable ability with a fixed range that goes way beyond the reach of her other abilities.

However, with the changes to her E, I want cdr to make it decent. It's like her requirements went from just needed mana, to needing mana, cdr, and slow control.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2016-04-23T18:15:08.735+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a particular reason why there are so many other targeted spells whose range is calculated center-to-center, rather than edge-to-edge?
