You just don't see it because you're used to seeing champions who aren't perfectly balanced snowball extremely hard. The example you used, Vel'Koz, is known as one of the few champions in this game that is perfectly balanced. Not just balanced, but fun to play against even when fed. Although Vel'Koz can't snowball as hard as other Champions, he's at least perfectly balanced because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeresyHorus","date":"2017-08-08T22:49:08.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**1- Mages get kills by landing a COMBO on their target.\n**\nThis is the general idea behind Mages design, and here i \"supposed\" that a combo is enough to kill the target but sadly even that is not possible anymore thanks to riot lowering AP scalings ( Total AP + Champs Kits + MR/HP options ) while increasing AD scalings but i am trying to answer ur question on why Mages cant carry.\n\n**2- Mages are ABLE to use thier combo.\n**\n\"ABLE\" means u are alive, not under CC, have the resources to cast ur spells and have them not on CD, if u are not ABLE to use a combo than u cant get kills ( dictated by point 1 ).\n\n**3- Mages have LANDED their combo.\n**\nIf u are out of range or missed a skillshot that spell/s will go on CD and will make not ABLE to use a combo ( back to point 2 and than to point 1 ).\n\n**__**\nADCs while having the same switches ( i think ) dont have as much limitations as Mages do :-\n\n* They dont need **COMBO** they need only **AUTO** ( 1 button ).\n* Fewer CCs can make them not **ABLE** to auto ( silence ) and their **AUTO** is neither on resources nor on CDs and lifesteal + {{item:3812}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3026}} make it easier for them to stay alive, so form point 2 they care only about 2 limitations while mages care about 4, and they care about those 2 even less than mages do.\n* from point 3 ADCs need just to be in range ( made easier for them with edge to edge targeting and {{item:3094}} ) to AUTO and dont care about missing it like mages do, so fewer things can  turn them back to point 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sobi999","date":"2017-08-08T21:07:49.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mages have been shitty as of lately. You can get fed and build all the AP you want and even MP but the enemy just needs to have some MR to take the brunt of your damage and whilst you're useless (when your abilities are on CD) they can finish you off with their combos.\n\nWe hardly have any choice to build Armour other than zhonyas but i am glad that banshee and abyssal are good items to build against other AP champs. Although AD champs have Maw and mercury and many other options to use against mages. Mages could do well with more build paths.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2017-08-08T21:00:59.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because you're building 6 boots","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-08T20:59:20.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can if you play it right.","replies":[]}]}
