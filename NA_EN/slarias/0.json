Everyone's punishment is different as everyone is on a different petal when it comes to being punished. If it was the first tier of punishment (10 game chat restriction) it shouldn't take that long, but that also implies you are playing regularly as well as having a positive attitude while playing. I've seen people say they gotten rewards back within a few week, whereas people who got punished harder had to wait months in order to get rewards again!","replies":[]}]}
