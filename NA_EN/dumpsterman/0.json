The second I go over to their support pages, it auto logs me out, and I cannot even begin the submission process, because to even select the issue category it requires account verification to proceed.\nWhat happens when I try to login [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) I get redirected to their [login error page](https://i.imgur.com/EHSAyRK.png).\nI have been [GOOGLING](https://www.google.com/search?q=riot+support+ticket+cant+login) and [THE RESULTS ARE ANCIENT](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/RuAVVk5h-i-cant-login-to-riot-games-support-center-ive-been-automatically-signed-out)!\nMaybe im missing something... I have tried to login through Chrome, Chrome Incognito, Chromium, Chromium Incognito, Opera, Opera Incognito, and even MFking IExplorer, which doesnt even work on that part of the site. Wiped my cookies, and cache, the whole 9 yards. Nobody should be expected to jump through these hoops to contact a business to get some sort of support. Tried to reach out on twitter, and now on this board too. Maybe someone will see this, eventually... Eventually so I can then finally start to SUBMIT MY TICKET in the first place.\n\nCan anyone even submit a ticket tbh...?","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2019-02-23T20:53:06.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try submitting through the email support@riotgames.com about the issue you are having submitting a ticket and your overall issue. This will send a ticket to our team and they can help you through there as you should get replies through the email you are sending from. Definitely odd as we haven't had high reports of this interaction and hopefully our Tech team there can help you out with it!","replies":[]}]}
