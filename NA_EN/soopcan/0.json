Everything from his gameplay, design, interactions, SHOTGUN KNEES, all of it. I just want to say that Urgot is one of the coolest reworks I&#039;ve seen in my opinion. Sure, he isn&#039;t commonly played like Warwick, but it truly feels like a metric shit-ton of effort went into recreating him. He is fun to play and feels balanced really well. Also that ultimate is my favorite ability in the entire game.\nhttps://imgur.com/0m3AOrc\nI know that only like 2 people will read this but if you love impaling people and pulling them into your saw blades then try out Urgot please","replies":[{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2018-01-26T03:30:54.353+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Sure, he isn't commonly played like Warwick\"\n\nHe actually wasn't intended to be.

He's a short ranged tanky marksman, he has a slow and shield ability, he's this monstrosity that wishes to spread the pain he feels... lots of the theming and gameplay desired is there and the new stuff they added is very interesting (THAT INSTAKILL ULT IS SCARY AND RAD).\n\nI wish I could be as excited about Swain as I am Urgot, and I did read testimony from old Urgot players who were upset the Q spamming and kiting was dead with the clunky new kit.

I couldn't manage to land it properly the first few times playing him after the rework but when I finally did it felt amazing to chew someone up like that. I'm still willing to play him in ARAM for his Ult haha. \n\nI can see that about Swain. I was never too attached to his old lore and looks, but I feel bad for those who were. They took a lot of iconic things away from him like his full transformation and his crooked walk. I don't think these things should have been taken away and could have easily fit the new Swain.\n\nHowever I do really like the update. He looks like the leader of Noxus much more than the old Swain imo. Old Swain kinda looks like a kings angry dark magician or something compared to new Swain. \n\nSo objectively I love the Swain update, but I could see how someone as a Swain main/player would not like the new update. \n\nAt this point I don't expect a lot of things from the new VGUS and by that I mean I think its fair to assume anything might happen at this point. Personally I am open to that, even for the champion who I started playing LoL for, Volibear. He's now a demi-god with a bunch of spears sticking out of him, like lolwut.

I've played this game since S1 and I've seen a lot of changes to this game, most of them don't go away.  I can give a bigass essay on the reasons I liked Swain and one tricked him through the entirety of late S1 to late S3.  He was my favorite champion and was like a friend to me.  Just because a lot of people like Buzz Lightyear over Woody doesn't mean I'm going to be satisfied when you burn Woody in front of me and stuff Buzz Lightyear in my hands.\n\nYorick did a great job of keeping his important theming and character traits while opening to a wider audience.  Same with Poppy, same with Warwick, same with Twitch, same with Evelynn, and ofc same with Urgot.  These are not characters that became radically different.  Every rework has controversy but you did a Karma/Galio level rework on a champion that wasn't that weak, was only relatively unpopular, and his main issue was being unviable in pro play due to a limited outplay potential and having a dated model.\n\nIf Riot wanted this new Swain to grow on me the teams wouldn't have deleted all of his Raven theming outside of some birds showing up on the map and a joke.  If Riot wanted this new Swain to grow on me the teams wouldn't have taken away his deceptive appearance - an old frail man with a visible limp but incredible power.  No, a slightly injured arm that was miraculously healed by demon energy doesn't maintain the same feel.  I'm honestly to the point where I'm so convinced I'm being ignored as well as everyone else who liked the old version of this character where even just the haircut would make me happy.  I don't like that the old abilities I valued were deleted and you didn't even keep the Raven theme or the deceptive old man theme that I valued highly.\n\nI won't lie and say there aren't interesting things about this new Swain, but its not going to grow on me.  I'll eventually get over it and be ok with seeing him, but what I appreciated is gone and I will never get it back in-game.  That nostalgia is dead.  A friend in the game is gone for me.  Maybe more people are happy about him than I am, but seeing responses like this on every rework, including ones that are way more unpopular than this one, is a verbal slap to the face.  It shows a lack of consideration to what we value just assuming we'll like it.  When a rework is good its easy for me to tell as soon as I've gotten my hands on it or seen a breakdown of the kit.  I think Riot designed a good kit, but that champion isn't Swain and never will be what I saw in Swain.","replies":[{"poster":"KennysDreamGirl","date":"2018-01-26T21:33:02.787+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"all im gonna say is that if the only thing notable about a champ is some dumb ass walk animation, a cane and a bird on his shoulder then the champ needed to change\n\nim not saying that these are the reasons you might have loved swain but its what i see most of the time when someone complains about him","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2018-01-26T23:30:54.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Swain was a champ that had really not much stuff going for him, so people got attached to the few stuff they liked about him.

It lasts long enough for the target to get clawed to death where you can still use your R to secure the kill or get away but she doesn't scale at all from her abilities.
