I checked my firewall, my antivirus, and even ran it with administer but still no luck. Are the servers having problems or anything because it says everything is running fine. This is also occurring to my friend as well.","replies":[{"poster":"KumaraP","date":"2017-05-21T11:50:35.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also had the error: \"LoL new Client unable to connect to the login queue\". Even though i thought i did everything good and it was a Riot server issue it wasnt.\nAllready tried all Riot's solutions and they did'n work. After some debugging i did finaly resolved the problem myself..\n\nThe problem was with a configuration setting in the Esset Security Software. And it was a setting that did'n deactivate even while u fully disable the software (like temp. disable firewall).\n\nIn the Esset software you can enable Protocol Protection in the Advanced Settings menu. From then on the software starts controlling all SSL and TLS configuration's and every certificate that comes with it.\n\nI came to this while reading the Log: 2017-05-21T13-09-01_1968_LeagueClient.log\nI has the following line:\n000012.699| ERROR| lol-login| ALE-4C0F8C92 - FAILED_TO_COMMUNICATE_WITH_LOGIN_QUEUE - Plugin \"rcp-be-lol-login\" couldn't talk to \"https://lqak.euw1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queues/lol/authenticate\" because: 60 - \"Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates\".\n\nThis got me thinking that i let Certificates be mastered by the Esset Security software and not by Microsoft. And thus i started searching in the menu and found that i could deactivate that option. It's called Protocol Filtering and SSL/TLS-Protocol Filtering. Once i deactivated both of these settings. The issue was gone.\n\nSo this got me thinking, because at some point this did work. Even with the new client. Did something in security changed on the client? Remember the old client did work, new did 2 but after a certain change it didn. So i think Riot's higher level of security also needs attention in 3rd Security Software. \n\nHope this resolution can also help others with same kinda problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-11T17:24:16.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this still an issue for you?
