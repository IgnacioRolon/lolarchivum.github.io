I myself am seriously missing old karma so much I would like a fan user type weapon champion in the game like Old Karma. Not that the new karma is bad, just missing old champions! {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2018-07-24T00:16:24.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too miss her, but we gotta be realistic:\n\n**Old Karma is gone.** Like, literally, they don't have her data anymore.\nAnd even if they did, inserting it into today's game would just lead to a few hundred error messages and bugs. She would need a ton of changes anyways, because her old kit - in terms of gameplay - wouldn't work either. It was really rich in ideas and suprisingly deep, but it just doesn't fit today's design standards...\n\nThe best we can hope for is that in her upcoming small rework Karma gets back a bit of her old self, like a bait passive, duality-mantras, shieldbomb, a creative tether,\nand maybe one day we get an awesome new champ with fanweapons.","replies":[{"poster":"Elegant Egoistic","date":"2018-07-24T16:11:00.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"should we even give up on the fans ? implementing them in her design is not really a tough thing though, she already got them in her robes so the model is ready and fine","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2018-07-25T01:48:14.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of a fanwielding champion is to use them in their abilities as well.\nJust tacking them onto their character model is a waste of a weapon,\nboth visually and in terms of gameplay.\n\nShe would need abilities that actually feel like using fanweapons,\nlike blocking sight, dancing around, deflecing missiles, being deceptive.\n\nOne could argue that old Karma did this.\nShe had the duality aspect of fanweapons, \nthat can both block and hurt,\nher passive was deceptive,\nher basic spell had the SHAPE of a fan, but...\n\nher rework tried to realize the other parts of her,\nthe enlightened part, the shieldbomb, the mantra, etc,\nand ditched the fanweapons to NEARLY include a visual identity focused on twindragons, whirling around her arms and being part of all her spells. If you look closely you can see the slight shadow of circling serpents on her Q, for example. But it hasn't been fleshed out at all...\n\nSo long story short:\nYeah. Current Karma went for twindragons, spiritual energy and enlightenment.\nAdding fanweapons would not ADD to this character, but take away from it.\nAnd block any future champion from using them.","replies":[{"poster":"Elegant Egoistic","date":"2018-07-25T08:50:47.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, but even the new concept in not well depiced and everyone knows this already, i just hope they take these things into consideration","replies":[{"poster":"SilverSquid","date":"2018-07-25T18:29:10.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a lot of faith in NeuroCat.

It is highly unlikely if not impossible for Riot to revert her. Due to high demand of change in her kit back then, Riot changed her entire kit, and introduced something new. The old kit was way unbalanced, where just pressing W on champion literally tethers them, slows them, speeds up Karma, and if an enemy doesn't get away in time, it's a snare. It's the same now, just costs more mana to do it now.\n\nAlso, the high revert we've ever had in League was Rengar and Kog'Maw with ability reverts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-23T16:40:14.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]}]}
