Riot needs to fix the rank system. how are you gonna make the other team with better kda fight against a team who has lower KDA with a person at LVL 31 with no RANK STATS? Tell me Riot. Honestly saying, you should only match Q with people in their own division. and People with NO division and or stats, they shouldn't be at this high of a level who did poorly in game.
