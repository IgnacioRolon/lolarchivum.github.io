Evolution? The STEM fields? The future of the human race? Ask a scientist. Anything is fair game though. \r\n\r\nMy specialty is genetics, specifically genes involved with xenobiotic detoxification and applications of those genes, such as bioremediation. I&#039;m studying to be an astrobiologist though, so questions about space, geology, chemistry, etc. are all within my realm due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Because I&#039;m not a scum-sucking statist, I also have a budding education in business and will be applying for my MBA once I finish my MS. So, this is also a businessman AMA.","replies":[]}
