I lost 35 pounds, then gained back 50-- and I'm now alcoholic-- it's stressful. But I see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI'm a scientist by education, from a family of scientists. I was a chemist, initially, who eventually expanded into biochemistry and molecular biology. I did my undergrad in that, it was rad, had some great research experience and great professors who supported me, resulting in publication that benefitted every party. Great start, right? STEM grad school was nothing like that-- 32-40 hour research weeks on top of the minimum 20 hours I was doing for a teaching assistantship, to a thesis that was constantly in flux-- it was stressful and bad, until I eventually graduated. No thesis-- but a silver lining, GD. The alternate plan overlapped with an MBA degree from the same university-- the degree that I'm only 4 weeks out from completing.\n\nIt gets better. Despite struggling with the different approach to schoolwork that business has vs. STEM, I have maintained a GPA amenable to being invited to Beta Gamma Sigma international Business Honor Society. Another line in the resume.\n\nCelebrate the small victories, GD.","replies":[]}
