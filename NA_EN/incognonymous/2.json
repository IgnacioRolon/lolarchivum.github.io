This will never not be true. The early game power of ADCs has always intentionally been understated. The truth is, comparing stats in a vacuum is dumb. The truth is, there isn't a melee character in the game, who starting off at an ADC's max range, can run up and kill them before they're killed at level 1. \n\nAnd while you say \"Of course, that's dumb, no one would do that\" keep in mind that last season an entirely new class of champions was released who do EXACTLY that (Juggernauts), and if Mordekaiser is truly a juggernaut, than they are expected to do so with LOWER base stats than those supposedly weak early game ADCs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-08-08T04:33:52.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You realize that to deal 1,000 damage through 200 armor, they need to do 3,000 damage per AA before damage reduction.  2,000 - 2,500 damage per AA if their armor pen reduces it to 100-150. \n\nYou don't get to call this a constructive thread when you make shit up to complain about.","replies":[{"poster":"Incognonymous","date":"2016-08-08T04:36:22.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wanfear,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8jEotM27,comment-id=000e,timestamp=2016-08-08T04:33:52.669+0000)\n>\n> You realize that to deal 1,000 damage through 200 armor, they need to do 3,000 damage per AA before damage reduction.  2,000 - 2,500 damage per AA if their armor pen reduces it to 100-150.\n> \n> You don&#x27;t get to call this a constructive thread when you make shit up to complain about.\n\nExcept that 2000 is still totally in the range of late game ADCs, and 100 isn't even that much to reduce.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2016-08-08T04:42:11.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Incognonymous,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=8jEotM27,comment-id=000e0000,timestamp=2016-08-08T04:36:22.017+0000)\n>\n> Except that 2000 is still totally in the range of late game ADCs, and 100 isn&#x27;t even that much to reduce.\n\nIt's in range of a Draven IE crit with 450AD and Q spinning.
