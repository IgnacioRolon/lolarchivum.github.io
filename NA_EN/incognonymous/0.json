I guess there&#039;s some appeal to seeing what the next generation is like, but I was okay with it ending at Shippuden ep. 500 or whatever. There&#039;s still some interesting issues in the new series though:\n\n-Keeping shinobi relevant in an age of unwarranted peace\n-Implications of some of the darker policies of the village system in the past\n-New shinobi technology\n-Walking in the footsteps of literal god characters\n\nSo far the characters are okay. I&#039;d say there&#039;s more emphasis on secondary characters than before. Some old characters come back in interesting ways, like Orochimaru as essentially kage of the Hidden Sound. The recent arc had Kakashi popping off with his post-sharingan techniques, which was cool. \n\nAll in all, looking forward to it.","replies":[]}
