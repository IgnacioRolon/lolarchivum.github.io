I've tried modifying the resolution through the config file (tried a low resolution and the resolution my display is set to) but to no avail. The game thought I was connected and my team couldn't /remake which cost me and my friend 20 lp and a 20 minute leaverbuster ban.

Tried disabling GSYNC to troubleshoot in game, apologized to the people I was playing with and told them my screen isn't stabilizing. I can't adjust options in game, thought I'd try and change display settings and see if that would fix the issue. \n\nEdit: Just to add, I normally play at 2560x1440.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-11T17:23:59.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's currently a [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page screen issues upon loading in-game.
