I can still find the runes, masteries, and spells though. Does anyone know where to find this feature again?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T18:28:37.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The updated client currently doesn't have item sets.  In the meantime, there are other features that could use some help with testing like replays.  Let our client devs know about any feedback you have with item sets over at the [client discussion](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion) boards.  \n\nYou can also return to the legacy client at any time to use your item sets:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nThanks for testing!","replies":[{"poster":"tomasjmr","date":"2016-12-18T01:12:07.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So there are no Item Sets and you cant play with bots either?\nWhy do you guys present us such a flawed Client?","replies":[]}]}]}
