Ult then stand on top of minnions and Q. Its not like it was before the patch. So you cant Q out of your ult anymore. You have to end your ult with an AA and then Q to get the proper hit box with no delay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Team 4Skin","date":"2017-08-28T18:57:15.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shoot, I wish I would have seen this today.

Also her ultimate is sometimes bugged (not always).
