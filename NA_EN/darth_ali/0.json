You also have quite a few tickets open, which can cause delay and confusion towards helping out.  It's usually best to stick to a single ticket and not reply until you received a response, otherwise you can drop back to the bottom of the queue.  If you have any further concerns, hit up your specialist!","replies":[{"poster":"awwwestin","date":"2017-11-10T03:33:29.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IS it possible for you to look into my ticket right now","replies":[]}]}]}
