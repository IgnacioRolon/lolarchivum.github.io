When I stop disconnecting, I try to move or buy things at the shop, but it doesn't let me because I start disconnecting again. I even try to search up ways to fix it, but they never work for me. I don't know why this is happening, but I know its not my ISP because my sister plays perfectly fine, while I can't. I even tried to uninstall League, but the same problem still happens. Please help me resolve this issue because I really like this game and I don't want to be yelled by teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-04T01:27:06.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since your sister isn't having issues on the same network, this may very well be caused by specific network settings local to your PC. As a quick check, I recommend working through our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure your settings are compatible with League.\n\nLet me know if you still experience issues after working through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
