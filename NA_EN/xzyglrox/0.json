The first gone I queue for I get a leavers 20min queue. Now keep in mind, when I transferred my account was in good standing. I am mad of course, since I am a busy person (work 50+hrs a week, father of 2 toddlers) I don't get a lot of game time. But whatever... I suck it up. It took me like a week to play the 20min queues games. And now because of the stupid new UI (and I'll be honest I also had music playing too, not too loud but anyways) I was setting up my masteries while on the pick and ban and guess what... It was my damn turn to ban (I am like 90% sure it was a banning turn and not my pick turn) , but since the timer, now with the new UI is so damn quiet, I failed to ban a champion... So now I am stuck with a 30 minutes queue... Like if 20 wasn't enough for me. I gotta be honest if this whole timer sound thing is not fixed I have to say I was happier with the old UI. This new one is gorgeous but is inconvenient af.\r\n\r\n  But I digress, what I REALLY want to know is if a GM or someone can look at my past matches and confirm if the punishment is required. It seems excessive from my point of view, I know I did drop an ARAM game due to my internet going out and this latest fail to ban a champion but that's it. I honestly don't have the time to wait 30+ minutes in queue for a game, I really dont. If I did i'd probably just suck it up even if I didn't like the punishment, but like I said, If you look at my matches I barely am able to play the game that I love. I really hope someone from RIOT sees this and chimes in even if it doesn't resolve my issue. You've probably heard this and many other stories before and I am sorry if I waste anyone's time, but I really needed to vent. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T05:08:52.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look at your account and I do see a trend of disconnections within the last month, which would explain why you're getting hit so frequently by those low-priority queues.
