So after that, the LoL Logs folder started to appear on my desktop. After a couple times of using league, I reopened it and the \"Update failed\" thing popped up again. Now my league doesn't update or open up properly. Is it something about the repair tool? or is it my League? Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-29T02:24:53.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Hextech Repair Tool isn't likely to resolve this issue, as most patching issues are caused by a poor connection to the patching servers.
