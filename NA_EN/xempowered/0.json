So, I wonder, why don't we get a rework for this champ?","replies":[{"poster":"Shoken","date":"2014-07-22T17:18:21.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because she is one of the few \"old\" champion to really fit her theme really good. She is  a deceiver, and her kit is perfect for her role.\nAlso, the removal of the silence **was necessary**, since it offered absolutely no counterplay to her burst. She is still strong, she just needs a bit more skill now.","replies":[{"poster":"XEmpowered","date":"2014-07-22T23:41:02.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sub par =/= need skill to play.\n\nLB was just fine with the silence.
