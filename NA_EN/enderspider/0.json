I randomly couldnt move or cast abilities anymore. Meanwhile, everyone around me could move and act normally and it would display it normally too. What made it even weirder, was that my ping was normal and the fact that I could type normally. Later at some moments, I could move and cast abilities normally again but it would stop again after about 10 seconds. \n\nAdditionally, our Zilean was experiencing a different kind of lag, his ping was normal but he would still have a 2-3 second delay on all of his actions while everything else was moving normally(apart from me)\n\n\nand in the video you can see how nicely the other team handles the situation :)\n\nEDIT: video didnt upload properly so here is a reupload: https://plays.tv/s/LX_s7GR9ffwu","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-07T18:36:35.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I agree with Kokua that the [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) can give us a solid overview as it does sound like packet loss.  A lot of these issues are also probably being caused by using Plays.tv.  I highly recommend uninstalling it to rule it out as a possibility!  Let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Enderspider","date":"2017-12-07T19:06:54.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't think its due to plays.tv because I have never had such lags before.
