There used to be some functionality in place that would automatically include a link to the content being touched in the message, but that stopped working so the moderators have been doing it manually. I'll touch base with the team to make sure they do this moving forward. In the meantime, I've sent you a private notification to better explain the action that was taken. I hope that sheds some light on things for you.\n\nSorry again!","replies":[{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-01-13T00:23:19.396+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \nThank you much for clearing that up!\nI appreciate you answering that and for sending me a message!\noff to reading it XD\nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-04-14T14:38:47.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\nHere i am again after a message was removed.\nI think you guys have made progress! Links are included now so i at least know in which post a message was removed.\nThat's great!\nNow to my problem:\n\n**I have no idea what was removed.**\n\nThere is a link but it shows me only the thread, not my post.\nWhile i remember the topic i actually have no idea (4 days later) what i actually said.\n\nTo be able to change my behavior (in this case my post was removed for the \"dont be a jerk\" rule) i need to see the violating post.\n\nSay i had an active day posting on the boards and then didnt post for a few days. there is no way that i will remember ad verbum what i wrote.\n**That severely hinders a \"reform\".**\nOne needs to be able to reflect on the post in order to understand why it was removed.\n\nThis is like giving me a time ban in game for eg. \"verbal abuse\" but not telling me what about the things i said was verbally abusive.\n\nWould it be possible to include the violating verbiage in your notification message?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Sweet","date":"2015-01-12T22:24:51.389+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Aerothal, I sent a message over to Tamat to investigate.","replies":[{"poster":"Aerothal","date":"2015-01-13T01:10:11.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you too for sending it to Tamat!\nCheers!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"forist","date":"2015-01-12T19:47:24.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could probably better speculate if you could show us the post that was removed.
