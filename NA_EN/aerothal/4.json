True dmg OP.\nSo a 2 sec delay was added, which was fine. On top of that though, the damage on that passive was nerfed aswell.\nstill not too bad until the mobility meta was introduced.\nall champions had their base ms upgraded. high mobility champions emerged with dashes and other fun stuff.\nnow it was EZPZ to get out of zyras passive range or to dodge that passive, because of the delay and the clunkiness in execution.\n\nAll that doesnt even touch the main problem: you can only use the passive when you die. but you dont want to die.\nyou dont want to be frontling, but rather backline in a teamfight. \nthat puts you further away from the enemy and if you end up dying anyways, they mostly are out of passive range.","replies":[{"poster":"Earl Eulrich","date":"2015-04-15T16:51:53.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"if i ever fall beyond an 80% winrate on Zyra i´d opt for a buff...but as it is, she could use some actual nerfs such as lessening the front-up burst on her ult+ lowering the radius of impact.
