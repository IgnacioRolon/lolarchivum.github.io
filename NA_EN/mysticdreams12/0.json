Overall, I'd start troubleshooting this in a practice match by updating a few of your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) like Port Forwarding and DNS server settings. Those can help make sure you get a cleaner signal with Riot's game servers.","replies":[{"poster":"MysticDreams12","date":"2017-11-27T00:21:22.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeahhhh, don't think so.\n\nI haven't played in a few days besides today and haven't dodged any recently.\n\nIt's a problem with LeaverBuster, period.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-27T01:46:57.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"LeaverBuster doesn't track your leaves over a few days, it tracks over *eternity*. The system does not \"forget\". It may *overlook* leaves if enough time and games pass without you leaving, but it doesn't forget.\n\nIf you got a 5 minute timer this one time, then Riot's servers saw your computer disconnect from them during champ select - that does not make it their fault. If you got a Low Priority Queue for the next 5 games, that is LeaverBuster and is due to leaving behaviors over your past games.\n\nKeep in mind that you disconnecting does not mean it is Riot's fault, and it does not have to be intentional for you to be hit, as you still wasted Riot's time. If you want them to investigate further it's best to follow the steps the poro linked you and then submit a support ticket if that doesn't work.\n\n----\n*keep in mind I'm not a Rioter nor do I work for Player Support, just another friendly community member trying to help you understand what happened*.","replies":[{"poster":"MysticDreams12","date":"2017-11-27T02:52:14.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry but no.\n\nIt was their fault, period.\n\nAnd \"wasted Riot's time\"? Holy fuck. How conceited they are, then! I didn't \"waste\" their time! Their stupid serves plopped me off the champ select then punished me for it. My connection was fine!\n\nI already hate Riot for their stupid decisions and balancing making. This just adds to the pile.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-27T03:58:46.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like the wording there got lost between my brain and the keys - what I was *trying* to say is that you wasted the time of a champion select by disconnecting.\n\nIt wasn't Riot's connection. If it was theirs, their systems will enable \"Loss prevented\" which eliminates those penalties from occurring. Ergo, it wasn't Riot's fault, as you still got the penalty.\n\nIf you want help solving your issues, ask Riot in a support ticket. Or keep complaining and continuing to get punished for what is not Riot's fault.","replies":[{"poster":"MysticDreams12","date":"2017-11-27T04:01:39.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wow. What a piece of crap you are.\n\nYes, it was their fault. They can't enable loss prevention if the game hadn't started yet. It was in fucking champion select.\n\nI didn't waste the time of a champion select OR DISCONNECT.\n\nHave you read anything I have said in this thread? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. My connection was fine. The client kicked me out and then punished me for it. I was reaching to click my champion and it screwed me over.\n\nAlso, I don't have any other issues so I don't need to submit a ticket. And btw, no one asked for your help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BrotherOfSinged","date":"2017-11-26T23:30:08.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This has happened to me several times, and I have never dodged a queue even one time.","replies":[]}]}
