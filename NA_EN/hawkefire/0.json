I know I was able to bind it in the past, but it does not work anymore.  I am able to bind mb4 in other games (and it works fine in those games), so I know it isn't because of the mouse.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T02:34:41.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still working on getting some of the issues with binding MB 4/5 smoothed out, but you might be able to find a little more success by binding MB4 to whichever key you're trying to bind to MB4. For example, if you're trying to bind Q to MB4, instead try making it so that when you hit MB4 it reads as you pressing Q. You should be able to do so through Razer Synapse I believe! Let me know if that works out for ya.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2017-07-26T20:15:25.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After this patch, I can now bind my mb4/5 again, but I can only do so in the launcher client and not during an actual live game.\nBut thank you for the suggestion, I shall have to keep that in mind if this issue resurfaces :).","replies":[]}]}]}
