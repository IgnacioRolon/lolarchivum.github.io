Bugsplats are definitely not part of the *known issue* though, so I'd recommend troubleshooting this by working through the common fixes in our [**Bugsplat Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes). I also wanted to mention that a single disconnection cannot land you in any sort of penalty, but if you had a *recent trend* of disconnections on your account, then it would be possible to receive a penalty from this disconnection.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morgana support","date":"2016-12-14T04:56:44.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:25}}{{summoner:3}}  **I am also repairing the client atm to see if i can reconnect, but looks like the repair takes longer than the game would, so year... i hope i dont get penalty on my other account.**","replies":[]}]}
