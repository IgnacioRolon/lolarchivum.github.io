It's a dictatorship.   He pretty much said I'm going to do this and did it whether they agreed or not.  HE is the one refusing to compromise.

If you basically telling your teammates I'm playing this way no matter what you say, that is not communicating. It pisses people off.\n\nIt's no different than people who first play champion in rank. You lower your teams moral because you obvious have no idea how to play said champion, and stating it in chat basically tells your teammates you have no idea either. So why would you do it?\n\nPlus I'm not sure what you are trying to prove by reporting people who aren't communicating.
