I prefer the current way. This way it is the bad people who have to work harder by creating new accounts when their old ones get banned. Good guys only have to deal with the trolls, who are (hopefully) banned away soon and forced to start from beginning. Good guys don't have to buy new accounts; it is the bad guys who don't want to bother grinding themselves back to lvl 30 and get the ips to their champions. \n\nCurrent way is the lesser of the two evils. If you have a better solution to offer, I am sure Riot is happy to hear you out. Just complaining won't do any good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2017-05-26T11:02:17.995+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any kind of punishment that can be circumvented by literally not doing anything is not a good punishment.\nIn my case, there's at max a 24 hour window for me to even **notice** being IP banned.\n\nBut let's ignore that for a second and face another huge problem with dynamic IPs (and people simply playing from several locations): **Which** IP do you ban when an account is being logged in from multiple IPs? And what happens if somebody logs into a different account on a banned IP? Will that account be banned? What if I try to log into an account that triggered an IP ban from an IP that was not yet banned? Will that IP be added to the list?\n\nYou are asking Riot to use their resources on an ineffective, overly complicated system that will inevitably cause innocents to be punished.\nThat's not a good use of resources. In fact, I'd like to turn the archetypical argument people use around and say: Having the people from that department work on new skins would be a better use of those resources than implementing IP bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martensitic","date":"2017-05-26T12:13:45.139+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And your proposal is what exactly?\n\nTo implement a technically useless methodology, that would be damaging to the game, and not solve the issue at all (most IPs are non-static, and VPN tunnels are a thing)?\n\nSounds like the worst plan to combat toxicity I ever heard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-05-26T10:18:01.520+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your title is a gross oversimplification of the problem and I don't believe it is an actual quote from Riot. If it is then you are leaving out additional information that would follow.\n\nIP bans are very, very easy to circumvent. In most cases you can just unplug your modem and plug it back in.\n\nThere are two main reasons you would not be able to circumvebt them. First, you could have a personal static IP for things like hosting small servers for friends, like a minecraft server. These are rare as in most cases you will just set the server up when you want to play and you can give them the IP address then. \n\nSecond, you are using the network of a business or other organization. This is what you talk about in your title, and it could hit a lot of people that did not do anythi g. People would probably make accounts to get their college (collage? idk) banned for kicks.\n\nNow for the posts in the body of your post.\n\nThe reason you see more smurfs than noobs is because you are a smurf. The game attempts to detect these fairly quickly and pair the like ones together.\n\nThe second issue is potentially a problem, but a lot of those accounts are detected and banned.\n\nThe third issue is true, but it is why new accounts are punished more quickly than higher level accounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dark100dark100","date":"2017-05-26T06:23:40.132+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some IP-s represent a whole country.
