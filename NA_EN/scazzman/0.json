If someone actually wants help then they'll meet us half-way so-to-speak by providing actual evidence to back up their claims as this helps separate the people who want help from the people who just want to rage and troll the forums just because they didn't get their way.\n\nI don't know what was said in the tickets and threads by either you or them so I can't really comment on that. However, it's been my experience that threads are often closed if it is deemed that the original poster of them doesn't really want help after all and is stuck with a \"my way or the highway\" kind of attitude, yelling and raging at everyone who doesn't give them the Yesman answers that they wanted. I'm not saying that this was you, but generally this is partly why threads here are closed and/or deleted.

I could go into details about more specific examples of this, but I will just summarize and say that in the last 2 years that I have been playing, I have kept track of 5-10 players who I viewed as exceptionally guilty of breaking the Summoner's Code, and who proudly said that they do it all the time and will not get punished for it.

For example, let's pretend that the average number is 5 reports in 5 games (it's not, but it's an easy number to deal with XD). If a player is reported more than 5 (the average) games within 5 games, then the system automatically pings them for punishment. It then automatically searches that player's chat to find words or phrases that indicate negativity or verbal abuse, and if it finds indications of those words then that player receives a heavier punishment. Then over time, if the system picks up that player being reported and saying those same words or phrases then the punishment stacks onto the previous same offenses, and a higher punishment will be given.\n\nHere are the problems that I see with this system:\n1) The Tribunal is completely gone, it is not \"in recess\" as they have said for the last 3 years.

This new system is 100% automated, working only through indicator words, not by judgement calls or situation-based choices.\n\n2) This system is very ineffective at punishing for intentional feeders and intentional trolls, since they are often no indicator words to be seen, and even if there are they are not as clearly defined as indicators of verbal abuse. \n\n3) This automated system is programmed to very heavily punish players who defend themselves against other players, or who openly point out that another player is being verbally abusive, intentionally trolling, etc... These include phrases like \"my team is trolling me\", \"I'm muting and reporting you\", \"will you please report my yi\", \"leave me alone\", etc... The first problem with this is that saying those things is not remotely against the Summoner's Code. In fact, in my opinion, you would think that RIOT would support players pointing out the players that are actually violating the code. The second problem with this is that it is essentially punishing the players that are standing up to the bullies that have been allowed to stay in this game. If this were a school or a similar real-world public setting, people would HIGHLY encourage others to stand up to the bullies and defend themselves if the bully attacks them or insults them. This doesn't mean that the defender has to throw punches or insults back, but it doesn't mean that they should just \"mute\" the bullies and pretend that they don't exist either. \n\n4) Finally, the automated system is flawed because it often seems to have little to no affect on the mass populous of actual verbally abusive and trolling players in the League community. Why? I honestly have no idea. But I'm sure that we have all played games with numerous people that proudly say that they have never been punished by RIOT for trolling or verbal abuse, and that they never will. Now I understand that many of these people could easily be lying and could be punished for their actions further down the road. However, there have been 5-10 cases of players that I considered to be the absolute worst violators that I have played with, and I monitored their profiles over the three months after their offenses which I viewed (offenses which, according to the Summoner's Code, should have instantly received either a temporary ban or easily a permanent ban). Out of all of those cases, none of them received punishments that restricted their gameplay (they all continued to play consistently over that three month period, indicating no temp or perma ban). \n\nSo why is it like this? I don't know. But you can ask almost any league player, and the grand consensus is that players are quitting league, refusing to play ranked, or just muting everyone at the start of the game because 99% of the games that they play have at least one verbally abusive or trolling player that ruins the game for everyone. The bottom line is that the percentage of those players is far too high in this game, which in my opinion shows that RIOT's current method of reporting and punishing is not working.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Stasis691","date":"2016-07-26T20:00:19.076+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ZRYZ5Hik,comment-id=000600060000,timestamp=2016-07-26T18:53:26.865+0000)\n>\n> The system doesn&#x27;t place bias on an individual.

I spent a week uploading replays, screenshots, obtaining data and presenting it to defend myself and got a blase, \"you're guilty as sin breh\" from you, when I couldn't possibly have been guilty of anything but chat violations. \n\nI sat out two weeks and my first game I played after my ban there were six people who did much worse and at least as much as I was accused of doing. Two afks on my team and my support followed me around trying to take my jungle camps. I played a few just a handful more games after that with similar experiences and I said I'm done. Other than a few games I played because an attractive female friend asked me to (to which I have since responded no, I don't want to play this torture called a \"game\" anymore). I hadn't played since July 4. \n\nThen last night I couldn't sleep and was looking to burn a little time, so against better judgement I q'd up. Huge mistake. Our 0/3 mid ragequit 6 minutes into the game followed by incessant \"/ff pls\" requests from bot lane as they intentionally helped the enemy team, you know, something you personally affirmed to me was a bannable offense. This is my consistent league experience. Why don't you check out my chat logs since I was banned. \n\nMeanwhile, in response to your reply, I decided to look into the match history of the player who told me, \"I hope you're killed in a mass shooting\" the game before I was banned for two weeks. \n\nYou know, this guy: http://imgur.com/4HjCfEY and his buddies: http://imgur.com/DyyEj1i\n\nFound some interesting stuff.\n\nFirst and foremost, it appears there have been no time bans for said player.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/mJDvJ - Five zeal Anivia?

You have more data than me, you be the judge, or not.\n\nI just want to know how you can, with a straight face, tell me that a single player can violate and harass another individual or even an entire group, report them, and since they weren't reported themselves for whatever reason (it shouldn't matter, honestly, if you're going to set standards, everybody needs to be held to the same ones) that they should remain unpunished simply because they reported someone else, and while that person may have been guilty or not, it doesn't matter, they  are simply absolved since they themselves were not reported?\n\nSounds like a massive oversight, deficiency, and skirting of responsibility.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dehitay","date":"2016-07-26T20:12:29.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ZRYZ5Hik,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-07-25T21:22:59.419+0000)\n>\n> Give me some ideas on how it could be improved.

However, you are wrong in stating that most of them don't want to be ***holes. Many of them revel in how verbally abusive they can be, especially if they are queued with some friends who will support and add to their verbal abuse agaisnt other teammates or enemies. \n\n3) As I have mentioned to other people in this thread, I am sure that we have all played with players who proudly say that they can do whatever they want, because RIOT has never and will never punish them for how they consistently verbal abuse and intentionally troll. I understand that sometimes they are then punished even if they think that they won't be, but many of those players are the ones that I kept track of who received no temp or perma ban (when it was quite obviously deserved according to the Code's standards). \n\nSo in my opinion, there is something wrong with how the automated system is working that is being unsuccessful at detecting and removing a large majority of the worst Code offenders from this game. Why? I have no idea. But until RIOT steps off of their high horse acting like their system is perfect (sorry, don't mean to sound mean but it's true), then it will continue to happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Ekko NA","date":"2016-07-26T09:06:41.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=ZRYZ5Hik,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-07-25T21:22:59.419+0000)\n>\n> Give me some ideas on how it could be improved.

I feel like unless someone says something absolutely inappropriate that in these cases players should NOT be punished by the system. If a whole team of players are flaming each other calling one another bad and letting them know how much they love each other, there's no reason for the system to take any action unless they are using racial or very bad hate speech. Yes it's unsportsmanlike however people get frustrated when things aren't going how they want it too and say things they normally wouldn't.
