I don't have to mute trolls. Also most people just mute after shit talking and ignore most people. There is also no reason to type in chat if you are mad, it has zero use.\n\n3: you can mute people or disable your chat. (disable chat by binding your chat to control f12 then disabling your chat.)\n\n4:this argument against toxicity is actually an argument for better security against toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon eis","date":"2017-01-07T00:03:20.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1: currently working on it in china they implemented the first live anti troll system source:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5l11ag/lol_china_has_implemented_an_ingame_voting_system/ it actually looks like this one might go internationally. \n\nthis is actually the worst thing that could happen to league.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T06:56:38.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing with an awesome name such as JUDGEMENT SCYTHE can possibly be bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathgod5","date":"2017-01-07T00:18:07.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how so?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
