Is \n\nA. \"Hate speech\" is escalated to a \npermaban from tier zero often after just one game. Yet people who use slurs can STILL be muted just like \"regular\" toxic chat . You can't stop an intentional feeder. Im under the belief that feeding should at the very least have the same punishment \n\nB. BECAUSE it takes so long for them to get caught. When the system \"or a rioter\" finally says theyre inting.
