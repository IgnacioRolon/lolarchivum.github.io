Not that I care. But until then, maybe go with \"executing\". Though I doubt everyone would still know what you're talking about. Sucks. There should be a better way to let your allies know cuz I know exactly the situation you're talking about. Maybe spam danger pings around them... But I know that probably wouldn't work and you've probably done it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"e46 Fanatic","date":"2018-03-02T03:07:28.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about you just post in the right board? if you don't know where to put it then just go to general discussion...
