RIOT dont care about reforming a player, they care where or not that player who has issues will shut up and behave for 35 mins so the 9 others playing  their game will have good time and continue playing. and you wanna know why? a happy fan base is a fan base who buy stuff ,  who watches events and guides ect. if you piss off all the majority who act right then your left with a bunch of immature kids \"taking their ball and going home\" and riot dont make $$$$$","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dealth","date":"2016-08-01T18:39:34.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Players reform by themselves after learning they will be banned if they continue to flame","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-08-01T18:40:32.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"my point being though they arent really \"reformed\"  just silenced","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-01T20:39:58.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you really can't change others if they decide to not to change.\n\nIf that is the case, I prefer silence over reform.","replies":[{"poster":"scazzman","date":"2016-08-01T21:23:11.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"fine. im just saying to stop calling it reform","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-08-01T21:53:02.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people do reform upon chat restriction.
