Of course it is. I played Raka top/mid for a while and it was crazy op. The way I did it was rush banner of command/zzrot, athenes, then whatever else you want. Just put insane pressure on them and you usually get first turret (especially if they are AP laners top). Max Q first then E second, it does _so much damage_. The fun part is when you get to solo 1v1 people like darius, lux, cass, etc. They never see the damage coming.... and you get healed while you attack.

I don't mid losing; it's the constant reminder that I'm wasting my time on a match that's shoving against me. However, I am not saying that I can decide a match at minute 1 based off of whether we have a troll or not. I've won games almost by myself, though very rarely just by myself. Honestly, when I get a troll, it takes an equally dedicated and kind person to push that win out of me. One thing scarier than a troll is lack of team communication. I can win a 4v5 easily if my team is together and willing, despite an afk or troll trying to or accidentally ruining our 50/50 chance match. 4v5 is only an issue if our key player is missing, or we all hate each other. Positivity won't win every game that you are stuck with a troll in, but it sure as hell does win some. And if you have a 48-50% win rate right now, it only takes  another 5-10% to really climb in spite of your teammates. Just like I buy track cleats to shave off a few seconds from my mile time, you too can use positive behavior and team-rallying to squeeze out that remaining 5% or so to climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Great Muta","date":"2017-03-24T16:35:54.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Fun vs trying to win has always been an issue that Riot has no interest in talking about unfortunately. If your fun requires ruining the game for other people, what you are really doing is trolling.\n\nJust in the last few days in blind pick, I've had to deal with:\n\nCamille Jungle - Said she was just playing for fun and went 5-10. Is getting stomped fun? Loss.\n\nKled Support - We got destroyed and lost our first turret in 5:30 after a 4 man gank. Loss.\n\nJhin Double Top - Decided to go top for whatever reason. We had no jungle and got destroyed. Loss.\n\nRenekton Crit ADC, Yasuo Support and Syndra Jungle- They were openly mocking me for trying to win as they were \"playing for fun\". Syndra went 2-17, Renekton went 2-11 and Renekton/Yasuo kept saying no on surrender votes to waste time.\n\nKayle Support who wanted to be adc - He took tons of CS and I left lane. We ended up winning this because the other team had a double AFK, which isn't uncommon at all in blind pick and they immediately surrendered.\n\nVladimir support - This started because Quinn, who was supposed to be support decided he was going to be top without any discussion. This forced Gragas mid and Vlad offered to support. But he said he was going to be taking cs - What kind of support takes cs from the adc? I told him I'm not sharing CS and I went to the jungle and proceeded to go 1-12. Loss.\n\nYasuo Support - Said he was going to support then just went double mid anyway, leaving me alone. Somehow won.\n\nRiot really needs to investigate this stuff and the refusal to play the assigned role, because as all of them pretty much said \"go ahead and report me, I won't get banned\" and they were right.\n\nBut yet I'm the jerk for saying something back when I have to deal with this everyday.","replies":[{"poster":"Laxfan52","date":"2017-03-25T04:39:57.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but these were in blind pick...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chønklord","date":"2017-03-25T02:02:47.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only a few of those are actually trolling and punishable... fyi Camille was made for jungling.
