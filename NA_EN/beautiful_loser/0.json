If the 3 players you're with are average players, and are willing to listen most 4v5s are possible to win. All you have to do is control the enemy team via vision. Know where they ward, know how to control the map, and you can control a whole enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Wright II","date":"2014-12-30T03:10:55.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am sorry kind sir, i went into a game with a 0/14 karthus and a 0/10 heimer, now, i am just a 3/2/1 tris, even if we hit late game, their fed champions are, {{champion:122}}  and a {{champion:90}}  good fucking luck carrying that shit","replies":[{"poster":"SeargentAnus","date":"2014-12-30T03:21:29.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gabinator1000,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kpEWK0ZQ,comment-id=0001000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-30T03:10:55.566+0000)\n>\n> i am sorry kind sir, i went into a game with a 0/14 karthus and a 0/10 heimer, now, i am just a 3/2/1 tris, even if we hit late game, their fed champions are, {{champion:122}}  and a {{champion:90}}  good fucking luck carrying that shit\n\nYou'd probably be unable to carry that even if it was a 5v5 XD","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Wright II","date":"2014-12-30T19:56:02.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but nooo all 4v5s are winnable right? think my point is proven XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigglesO","date":"2014-12-30T17:19:49.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SeargentAnus,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kpEWK0ZQ,comment-id=000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-30T01:07:23.370+0000)\n>\n> If the 3 players you're with are average players\n\nIf is a strong word when used like this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Slime Appears","date":"2014-12-29T21:18:27.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because ranked matches actually matter.
