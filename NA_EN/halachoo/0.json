I can either wait for it to respond (never works), or quit the program.  whichever method I choose I end up dodging the match and losing 3 lp/gaining a 5 minute wait timer.

The most common culprit right now has been due to a recent windows 10 update.  If this is the case for you, disable the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) which has been freezing the game for some players.
