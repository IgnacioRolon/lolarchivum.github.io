However, my internet has been having some issues. The whole idea of Leaver Buster is fair but the way it's set up is very unreasonable. If you put me in a low priority queue at least let me do other stuff on league. Don't cover up the whole screen with the countdown until I get put into a queue. At least make it so I can do other stuff. My other suggestion for Leaver Buster is to at least give the person a chance. Yes I have had it happen to me before but that was a long time ago and then the second time it happens I still get 5- 20 minute queue times? Like I said very unreasonable. Please change/reconstruct this as soon as possible. You don't have to get rid of it because like i said before it is fair, its just that the way it is set up is very ridiculous in my opinion and I'm sure there are many others that would agree with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T02:34:09.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't change the leaverbuster system, but I can explain a few things that may clarify how the system works.\n\nFirst and foremost, we understand that sometimes emergencies come up or *shit just happens*. Whether it be a family member needs you, your power goes out, or your angry mother unplugs the WiFi router, we understand stuff can happen. This is why you'll **never** receive a 5-game penalty for a *single disconnection*. It actually takes a *recent and consistent trend of disconnections* before you see this particular penalty, because, at that point, it is beyond reason and these continuing disconnections are **negatively impacting** everyone else in the game.\n\nYou can find a complete guide on how Leaverbuster works in [our FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ). Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"HoodNCC1701","date":"2016-11-28T02:47:17.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand how it works but I guess my only question would be how long does it take in between leaves. For example I \"left\" a game like three weeks ago and just today my internet went out and I didn't get a warning or anything. I got another 5- 20 minute low priority queue time which is unreasonable. I still joined the game halfway through because my internet came on but after the game I got that. Which is why I typed the first message in saying that the whole idea of Leaver Buster is fair but the way it is set up is unreasonable and needs adjustments.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-28T21:27:56.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide a specific Leaverbuster *cooldown* period, but taking a look at your account, it seems you've gone AFK or left an abnormal amount of games within the last month.
