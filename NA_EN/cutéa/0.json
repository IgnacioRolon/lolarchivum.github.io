Despite all that, I am unable to interact with others in the league of legends board. It keeps saying that I have to be a certain level to perform certain actions or post a discussion. Is this a bug? Or is it referring to a different kind of \"level\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-13T20:21:58.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can take a bit for your account to sync up to the boards, but you are showing as level 7 now.
