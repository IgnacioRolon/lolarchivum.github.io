After both teams selected their champs the game froze and never opened up the game-play window. I exited and re-opened the client just to find out my team did a remake causing me to lose my ranked series and receive a 5 game, 20 minute leave buster. I understand the purpose of the leave buster but in this scenario I feel as though i was wrongful punished for a bug in the new client window. The series I will get over but I would like to know if I can have the buster removed due to the problem originating from the client and not me intentionally going afk.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-29T21:53:50.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a game issue, and not necessarily with your client.  Once champion select ends, you need to transition over to the game but something is causing that launch to fail.  Were there any error messages?  What happens if you try to play a game on the legacy client?  We can't remove leaverbuster penalties even if it's for testing, so if you want to return to the legacy that's fine too.  Let me know.","replies":[]}]}
