Zyra is more earthy plants, as opposed to a more magical approach that Elderwood LeBlanc has. \n\nLooking at the splash alone, there are two very different sources of power - vines v. a staff. The silhouettes of the champion are different (especially when in game). \n\nI'm not sure what else I can say in this case; this is a matter of personal tastes and opinions. We're not seeing eye to eye, and in cases of art, that's not uncommon. \n\nWhat I can say for sure is that we aren't making changes to this splash, and what's on live is the final product. I do appreciate your feedback and you taking the time to put it out here on the boards.  :)","replies":[{"poster":"Penta Ace","date":"2016-09-08T00:57:28.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Katey Khaos hinting at a possible Zyra skin confirmed! :0 lol jk\n\nSeriously tho, I'm a huge fan of yours Katey and i know you sometimes save board comments or discussions about skins or people asking about skins for champs, which you later comeback to when a skin is then released for that champ.

QA does not decide which skins should and shouldn't be made, nor the final look. We aren't personally designing the art. While we do advise our team in decisions being made, we do not make the final calls. You are correct in your following statements that we do have test suites that we run on every skin to ensure its functionality. \n\nIn this case, QA did not advise that this should be changed, because we didn't feel it would be confusing. This feedback wasn't something that was prominent in PBE feedback either. \n\n** If Riot's QA saw a LeBlanc artwork that is easily mistaken as Zyra, it should have been a P1 blocker, no release.**\n\nThis is your personal opinion - which you're absolutely entitled to - but the Skins team did not feel that base Zyra and Elderwood LeBlanc would be mistaken for each other. In general, a splash wouldn't block a release (especially when it's implemented v. not missing).","replies":[]}]}]}
