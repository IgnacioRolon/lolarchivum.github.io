They're now registered as having a loss on their record when they did nothing to illicit that loss. Riot's already bad about giving out loss prevented even when there's one or two people gone for an entire match, let alone when you have someone who connects back in at the last moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Malkere","date":"2014-12-22T09:07:21.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would you put them in at level 1? The character has been selected, the levels have been earned, the money has been rolling in. You put them in in those shoes, of course. Just as if the player reconnected, but it's not them, it's someone willing to take over.\n\nAgain, it's choice. anyone who's not interested in playing and only wants to win is never going to use the option; it's not meant for them. It's meant for people like me who enjoy playing, enjoy working with others, and when possible helping out. If you get in, the game ends, you start again. I don't get angry when I lose 30 seconds load time for connecting.\n\nThere would probably be no queue anyway given the state of things, only a yes or no or at worst \"Continue to wait? (Players currently waiting to help: 4)\" etc. which you could cancel. You wouldn't have to wait for others to load either, it's already in progress, it's only you who needs to load. A player with an SSD system could be in and playing in seconds.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PrinceOfStorms","date":"2014-12-22T08:04:52.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason why there are a lot of 4v5's is because Riot's having server issues where people are straight-up unable to connect.\n\nAnd no, I'd rather not get in-progress games thank you very much.
