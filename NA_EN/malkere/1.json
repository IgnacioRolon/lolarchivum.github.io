I'd like to suggest the automatic removal of players and their selection during drafts from the middle, back to their starting bubble, as soon as their selection is made. The bubble might be better to have a different graphic than the waiting bubble to be clear that it is a \"finished\" bubble. When people stand in the carousel it is very annoying.\r\n\r\n2. Remove collision between little legends during drafts. Some people go out of their way to try and make your little legend path around theirs and end up picking something that you were not aiming for. During the first draft this can cause little legends to go all over the place as well. Just remove collision and if someone gets there first, they get there first. If however suggestion 1 becomes a reality this will generally only be a problem during the first draft and may be considered intentional.","replies":[]}
