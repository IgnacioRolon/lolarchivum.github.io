For other players it&#039;s like 1/100 now. It used to be a lot more but I think people felt the system was so lackluster they stopped using it. We could revive this though with some fun changes!\r\n\r\nMy idea is to allow -most- players to have a badge on their loading screen and have that badge progress through different stages, much like the champion mastery icons, or even like the ranked borders, just a smaller little thermostat like bar or badge. Whichever they have the most points in shows up, with a set minimum of their total honors received versus total games played(since inception).\r\n\r\nI really think people would use it 100x more if they actually saw it happening to themselves rather than just other people once in a while. It seems such a rare occurrence now for anyone that people have stopped bothering. If they were the lowest rank, maybe they&#039;d try harder to be better sportsman to try and level up their badge. And that&#039;s what all community improvements are aimed at right? =D","replies":[]}
