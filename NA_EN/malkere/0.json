Usually no one says anything, though sometimes people react very positively. Once in a while someone reacts very negatively. I've started reporting these players with a report at the score screen and screenshot submitted ticket. I'm only up to 2 players so far as most people are just playing an online game, no big deal, but the 2 I've reported deserved it (no I won't be sharing their responses). I'm talking about before the game starts, before anything happens, immediate and vile responses. I don't respond, I don't want to hear more, I just report and play the game.\n\nIn bringing that up to some players, I've again been met with both positive and negative reactions. Some seem to think trying to foster a more positive community is a bad thing. I thought it might make an enlightening discussion here.\n\nDo you agree with lite punishment for downright offensive and uncalled for language, if only to make it clear that such behavior is childish?\nOr do you think everyone should be free to just mouth off anonymously?\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Zlera","date":"2019-09-09T14:25:32.597+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I def do agree, to an extent.

It's best to ensure that extreme cases don't go ignored. Plus you get a sense of satisfaction once receiving confirmation from Riot support that they'll look into it. Because even though they can't give you the details of who gets punished and for how long, you already know someone's gonna get punished when you report these kinds of players. The ones that are so overwhelmingly toxic that they warrant sending a support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Malkere","date":"2019-09-10T08:38:46.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I wish there was more incentive to do so than just, like you say, feeling good about it.

I find it difficult to understand why people defend the other side of the argument. Almost as if to say \"yes please let more toxic players into the game\". It's certainly not as if we have a shortage of players. As Xphineas commented, sure sometimes people get a little frustrated, but when they go beyond that, a warning from the devs, a 2 week ban (God forbid), lite punishment to say \"hey, that's not okay, shape up or get out\" is most welcome in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotFreecell","date":"2020-02-16T02:43:48.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zombie Gerbil,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NuRpI0eg,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-09-09T20:24:17.676+0000)\n>\n> A child should be treated like a child.\n> Nothing more and nothing less.

Holy moly you need to chill the heck out. Like i don't know which \"toxic\" person touched you in a bad place but every \"Player Behavior\" forum post you're casually just slinging backhanded insults at people posting. Edit: im suprised forum mods havent at least warned you for degrading peoples mentals.\n\nYou must be tiny","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xXxThanosxXx69","date":"2019-09-09T15:20:39.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"No. Idc about toxicity.
