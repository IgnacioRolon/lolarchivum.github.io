Riot would need to have the poster sign some documents saying that they are the original owner of the work, that they give full use rights to Riot, discusses compensation if any, and that they would take no claim to Riot's use thereafter. Then, or beforehand, Riot would need to compare the work to any other trademarked material in order to avoid being sued. I know that many people like to make skins based off of other copyrighted/patented material such as Mario, sailor moon, etc. as you can tell, this would involve a fair amount of time to search the national registry databases, pay an attorney to write th contract, have the owner of the work prove the work is fully their own and that no other person can claim title to the work, etc. Thus, it's usually not worth it.

If the idea were vague enough that they could just change the name and abilities somewhat, then they could pass it off like they just had a similar idea. However most concepts on the boards are quite specific, leaving Riot unable to use this method.\n\nFor an idea to be used off of the boards as it was intended by it's creator, Riot has to hire that person on as an employee to legally use that idea without legal ramifications. Once the champion was made and placed in game, Riot could then end the employment of the concept owner, and legally keep the champion as a part of league of legends.\n\nHowever most people do not wish to lose control of their champion ideas to someone else. This is one of the things Riot must face when it comes to champion concepts, and is one of the things that prevent them from reaching out and asking to use the concepts. Due to people claiming ownership of their concepts, Riot runs the risk of being sued should they not keep exactly to the creator's specifications for the champion. Even though there are ways around this, Riot does not want such incidents to happen and wishes to avoid these confrontations.\n\nI can't give you all the reasons Riot cannot accept champion concepts, as I do not know them all. I only know a few reasons that I gave some serious thought towards. This is one of the reasons I stopped pestering Riot about accepting champion concepts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gati","date":"2015-05-18T00:44:33.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must be since they never listen to us","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-05-17T20:41:03.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only idea this train of thought applies to are existing champion lore and story progression.
