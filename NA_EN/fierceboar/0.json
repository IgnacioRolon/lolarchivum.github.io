When I say this, I'm not talking about receiving kind-hearted jabs or playful jokes, I'm talking about people telling me to kill myself, or calling me a %%%%%%, or just labeling me as r%%%%%ed or autistic.\r\nI know there is a mute button, I just don't want to have to start every game with silencing 9 people in a team based game.\r\nAt this point, It just not worth it for me to even play the game anymore, as I get so worked up that I forget to enjoy the game.\r\nI hope nobody has to go through an experience like this one ever again.","replies":[{"poster":"The3cho","date":"2015-09-09T09:21:32.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry for the toxicity you've come across. Really I am.\n\nI think ever single one of us has been rage at by the \"I'm better than you\" player. This might not help, but, I found the best thing you can do is be the better PERSON...personally THAT is what makes the better player.\n\nThe people I've played with - the very few that said in chat \"play for late game\" - have been the people I've ENJOYED playing with.  Despite losing sometimes, I'd rather have THAT kind of person on my team fighting for a chance to win than the mechanically skilled A-hole who can't keep his mouth shut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-09-09T09:15:14.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never get criticized for my item build, what the hell are you building?","replies":[]}]}
