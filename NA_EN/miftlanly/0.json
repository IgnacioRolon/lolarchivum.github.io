Our lp difference was only 2. We both hit promos together at the same time, lost the first game, then won the next two. At the end of this, he was promoted and I was given a message saying \"grats on hitting promos\".... when I checked my history on op.gg and league match history, I found that league put me down in lp even though I was in my promos. It said I was one loss, two to go, with 84lp.... which is impossible. I should be in silver 3 atm, any help Riot?\r\nThank you, \r\nMiftlanly","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-16T02:01:32.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After looking up your match history, it looks like there was a match in your promos where you dodged (intended or not). Most summoner's don't realize, but queue dodging in your promos will result in a loss.
