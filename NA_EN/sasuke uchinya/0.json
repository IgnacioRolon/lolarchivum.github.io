I check the Task Manager and its open however sometimes it wont be on Task Manager. \r\nI've tried reinstalling about 6 times  and I've also deleted the lol_launcher and lol_patcher folders, reset my laptop SO many times and it still doesn't work.\r\nIt's opened like twice in the past and that's about it. I don't know what's wrong with it. i've checked the compatibility and however many times I've re-installed I don't see a lol_air_client folder. \r\n\r\nWhen it does open, I try to update it and it says Unspecified Error over, and over and over. I know my wifi can mess up sometimes but I don't think that's the reason every single time. Even when I press repair, it says unspecified error, sometimes it's even crashed and made me send error reports. I have HexTech and tried to re-patch but I checked the logs and it always says Failed. \r\nSomeone please help me with thorough instructions even if I have to uninstall and reinstall again just as long as it works. \r\n\r\n**Most Recent Log**: 1/16/2017 2:11 pm (idk if im doing this right lol)\r\n\r\n000000.000| ALWAYS| Logging started at 2017-01-16T14:09:32.775\r\n000000.000| ALWAYS|
