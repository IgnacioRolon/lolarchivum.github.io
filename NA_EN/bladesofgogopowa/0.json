Is there anything I can do about this situation?

In this case, I see there were a few leaves this week.  We don't reduce lower priority queues, but it's possible as a player to return to a positive standing through constant, uninterrupted play.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-05T11:13:43.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, sorry. Riot will not remove penalties or enable loss prevention unless the error is on their end.
