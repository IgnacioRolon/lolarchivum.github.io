I would understand if we were in the middle of the game when ranked became disabled, but that is not what happened. The other team surrendered as we were pushing in, so I feel gypped out of the lp I would have received in a normal situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-03T23:05:04.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like quite a few ranked games have been played since then, so I'm not sure which one I'm looking at.  What champion were you playing?  There were some server issues last night, and ranked queue had to be disabled for a few moments.  Has your match history since updated?  If the match doesn't appear by now, it's possible that it wasn't saved.  If that's the case, unfortunately there's no way to force it.  On the bright side, it looks like you're owning  in ranked today!
