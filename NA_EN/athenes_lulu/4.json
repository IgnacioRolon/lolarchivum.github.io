I know this isn't the first one here but I feel like making another one.\n\nYou nooblords, don&#039;t y&#039;all know that Lulu needs a team to work, no matter what lane she goes? And come on, it&#039;s either she deals a fuckton of damage and gets blown up when someone sneezed on her, or she deals NO damage and is unkillable.\n\nAlso {{champion:45}} = bane of her existence.\n\nGoddammit, after reading some of your posts I NEED to add more:\nHer poke is really subpar compared to poke supports, have absolutely no sustain, even tank supports can just snipe her in lane and she's gone; they all deal more damage than a Lulu support would anyways. Just camp the fuck out of her lane, her peels are so limited!\n\nYour turn!","replies":[]}
