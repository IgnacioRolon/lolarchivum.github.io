Currently, the only program that's actively looking to expand is the Arbiter Program, and you can get involved by becoming active in the Player Behavior & Moderation sub-boards. \n\nWe're still having discussions on the direction of the Wrenchmen Program, so we're putting things on hold indefinitely. And lastly, we're looking at opportunities to create new volunteer programs that provide real value to the community, but I'm not in a position to share anything just yet. We've very recently finished establishing a volunteer program on the Oceanic Boards (Emissaries, Wrenchmen, Instructors), so now a lot of focus can be shifted back to North America projects and programs. I've just brought in one particularly active individual to collaborate with to work on the logistics on this new program, so hopefully everything pans out and we have somethijg to announce by summer. \n\nOne more thing aside from the Riot Games Volunteer Program is that there are plenty of other opportunities to contribute to the community. Several tournament hosts are regularly looking for staff to work on graphics, recruitment, moderating, and mediating, and there are also plenty of opportunities to get involved in local events from viewing parties and LAN parties to large-scale conventions. \n\nIt's always great to see individuals who are passionate like yourself and Deep Terror Nami, and you can trust that I'll always be listening to your suggestions and concerns and advocating for what we, the community, feel is best for the community.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss anything, you can find a lot of the volunteers, including myself, on the Community Discord Server linked below:\n\nhttp://rito.pl/z/discord\n\nCheers,\nWuks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-12T06:08:13.567+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[General description of what the Arbiters are;](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/opVBd7rZ-introducing-the-arbiters)\n\n> We’ve set up this group up to allow players we’ve identified as deeply knowledgeable about our behavior systems to reach out to their fellow players, providing information and helping address questions and concerns you guys bring to our attention.\n>\nArbiters are volunteers, not Rioters, so there are some things they can't do (no pulling chat logs or lifting bans, sorry!), but they are ready and willing to help you find resources and become more familiar with Riot's player behavior policies.
