If you experience a delay, it should probably last ~~about 1-15 minutes~~ up to 2 hours, and if you encounter any further delay, feel free to drop a comment below. \n\n> **Network Operations – 7 minutes ago**\nWe're aware of a problem granting rewards in Missions and are working on a fix. All rewards gathered during this time will be granted after this is resolved.\n\n[](https://.)\n> **Network Operations &ndash; 12:58 PM**\nWe are seeing some delays for players receiving Augments and are currently investigating.\n\n[](https://.)\n> [{quoted}](name=Mortdog,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=QlPtuKq6,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-09-12T22:14:28.056+0000)\n>\n> Give it some time.
