Harassment and insults will not be tolerated (&ldquo;just playing&rdquo; is NOT a catch-all excuse).\n\nWe understand that there are certain topics you&#039;re passionate about, and we&#039;ve been able to see time and time again that game balancing is one of those topics. Historically, we&#039;ve been relatively lenient on these types of comments, as we didn&#039;t want to stifle criticism. Today, we are putting our foot down and ensuring that everyone on the Boards, Rioters and players alike, are treated with respect. Folks who engage in harassment against another will be given a warning, and repeated attempts to harass players will result in suspensions.\n\nIf you have something to say, you can do so respectfully.","replies":[{"poster":"Falcon Of Death","date":"2017-10-27T05:12:34.783+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":66,"body":"Oh so is this post referring to the recent posts of players putting their foot down and saying the balance team at Riot is actually missing chromosomes and should be fired after the RETARDED and GAMEBREAKING Galio changes?

Here you could have said something like this instead:\n\n«Is this post referring to the recent tidal wave of complaints about the (in my opinion) game breaking changes to Galio’s Q? I think it might have been a mistake to turn the scaling up that high, and the people in the balance teams should have tried making a bit more gradual changes over time rather than dumping every stat increase imagineable onto him immediately.» \n\nPlease. The post was making an example of ways you can better convey your message through civil mannerisms.\n\nThe moderators want us to be better.

The language I use is intentional and reflects the severity of utter fucking stupidity and incompetency of this company. Just not being a bunch of fucking apes would suffice, but no, they can&#x27;t even do that. They devolved into pre-ape intelligence. It&#x27;s not like they overbuffed Galio just a tiny bit. WHOEVER thought ANY of that would be okay on paper needs to be shot. Every single person in the balance team let THAT through PBE and ignored all feedback saying it was broken in PBE, and put it live. It&#x27;s beyond fucking stupidity. If I worked as a web developer and got a shitton of negative feedback and just ignored it, I&#x27;d be fired instantly. But apparently, there is a different standard for game developers.\n\nOnce again, your extreme hostility is unnecessary. These are people, and they are a lot more likely to listen to you if you treat them with respect. The moderators want you to resist the primitive impulses in our brains that tell us to throw our poop at whatever we dislike. My initial impulse to reading your comment is to use the same description you repeat over and over against you - but where would that get me? You would get mad, stop reading whatever else i write and we'd be stuck here throwing our own poop at each other, like our primate instincts scream at us to do. \n\nYes, Galio is overtuned. Yes, it was a mistake. If you say that, calmly, they can accept your criticism and get to work righting their mistake. Now instead, they have to deal with the frustration of being called names by you first, before they calmly compose a reply that follows their company guidelines. Unlike you and i, these people have their livelihood relying on their behaviour. They have to be better.\n\nAnd that is what they ask of us, now. Be better.\n\nIf i were to guess at the thinking behind the changes to Galio going live, i would think they thought there was a learning curve involved in figuring out how to deal with AP Galio. Perhaps players would learn how to play against it, and that once they did, it wouldn't be utterly busted.\n\nNow, as we have found out - Galio is a little too strong. But he is not WAY too strong - he still struggles a little against team comps that deal a lot of physical damage.\n\nHe doesn't struggle quite as much as he should, but it proves the buff was not entirely wrong either. A couple number changes on his scaling and he'll be right where we want him to be - an anti mage that can actually deal with mages and still be a mage himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Dienekes","date":"2017-10-27T05:44:50.344+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"In fairness here, deleting the comments of or condescending being superior to angry people doesn't actually get rid of angry people.

I keep seeing those same rioters who are responsible for balance issues only posting on &quot;Memes and Games&quot; joining the &quot;funneeh&quot; discussion and wasting their time there.\n\nWell, most Rioters have nothing to do with balance beyond what they have through proximity to actual balance team members. Tantram, for example, has only _slightly_ more to do with balance than any of us do. And some Rioters' jobs are _actually_ to post on the boards and communicate with players.\n\nThere's also the thing that _not everyone is working all of the time_. They could be posting from home, they could be on-break, they could _just not have anything they need to get done at the moment_, as they could be waiting on some other team member's work, or just be between projects.\n\nThere's _also_ a line for attention. Wukong would need a small-scale rework at the least to fix his problems - simple numbers shifts won't be enough. You could check [The Champion Roadmap](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/) for details into this, to see when Wukong might have time to be fit in.","replies":[{"poster":"Morendabanus","date":"2017-10-27T18:05:28.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You clearly haven't ever tried communicating with Rioters that make changes to champions.\nThese people will legit go into the subreddit of champions they're reworking, ask for feedback and ignore it.\n\nAsk oldschool zac mains, rengar mains etc","replies":[{"poster":"DuskDaUmbreon","date":"2017-10-27T18:07:35.724+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's for an entirely different reason.\n\nHalf the time they ignore it is because it's unhealthy, unrealistic, or just stupid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2017-10-27T13:58:41.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's mainly because they're only going to share something if they have something to share on the topic.\nIf they're not doing shit with Wukong, saying \"Oh, this is interesting\" and then never following up makes the community angry","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Falcon Of Death","date":"2017-10-27T05:34:51.401+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":26,"body":"more censorship ++","replies":[{"poster":"Sp33d Zer0","date":"2017-10-27T06:17:01.117+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":3,"body":"Boards are a privilege, not a right.","replies":[{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-10-27T19:17:00.496+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Censorship on account of respect and lowering harassment is fine, imo.

Historically, we&amp;#039;ve been relatively lenient on these types of comments, as we didn&amp;#039;t want to stifle criticism. Today, we are putting our foot down and ensuring that everyone on the Boards, Rioters and players alike, are treated with respect. Folks who engage in harassment against another will be given a warning, and repeated attempts to harass players will result in suspensions.\n> \n> If you have something to say, you can do so respectfully.\n\nIsn't life about balance? Shouldn't good comments and bad comments go hand in hand? If somebody is allowed to be praised should they not be allowed to be flamed as well? Why the kid gloves? Why sugar coat everything? People need to get thicker skin. This over protection mentality is sad. They are just words.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Poro","date":"2017-10-27T13:59:53.005+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is a difference between a bad comment and harrassment. You can say that the rioter that a rework/change sucks and is stupid. But when you say that the responsible rioter should get fired or commit suicide, that's obviously too far.
