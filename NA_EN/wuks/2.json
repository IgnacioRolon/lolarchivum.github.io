As such, it might be useful to go over some of the best ways to communicate with Support. Here are the top do's and don'ts for submitting a ticket:\n______________\n>#Don't:\n\n* **DO NOT** threaten player support, whether legal, physical, etc. Once you've indicated that you're looking for a legal solution to your problem, you'll likely be redirected to the Terms of Use's legal section; in this case, Player Support won't be able to assist you any further. \n\n* **DO NOT** create multiple tickets. Player Support will try to reference information in past tickets as well, and most likely respond to the most recently opened ticket. This means that new tickets will effectively bump your tickets to the end of the queue, delaying a response. \n\n* **DO NOT** bump your ticket/reply to your ticket before Player Support has the opportunity to respond. This will bump your ticket to the end of the queue, delaying a response. \n\n>#Do:\n\n* **DO** if possible, create one ticket per account. It's easier to manage requests this way. \n\n* **DO** treat Player Support with respect. Cussing won't make the process go any faster.\n\n* **DO** read the appropriate Knowledge Base article before sending a ticket. This will allow you to provide as much relevant information as possible so Support doesn't have to follow-up asking you for more information. \n______________________\n\n>#And lastly: \n\n* **If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nRequests like Player Behavior requests, event questions, etc. would be fine in this category. \n\n* If you're unable to submit a ticket through the Support Portal, send your request via support@riotgames.com. It may take a bit longer, but it'll get the job done as well. \n\n* If you're submitting a tech ticket, please attach the logs generated with the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).\n_______________________\n\nIf you have any questions or have any tips that you'd like to add, drop a comment below!\n_______________________\n># Community Tips:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Maximus Paine,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=W6ZhEsPG,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-08-23T22:24:39.971+0000)\n>\n> These are some other tips that apply to requesting technical support in general from anyone. They are mostly geared to software/system issues, but you get the idea.\n> \n> 1. **Provide information as concisely as possible** – Support people spend all day reading tickets and it’s tough to read through a couple of paragraphs to get something that could be said in a line or two. Formatting the ticket in sections and bullet points makes it easier to read than a solid block of 1,000 words.\n> 2. **Provide the most information you can that closely relates to the problem** – This is information that you know they’ll probably need to know and will ask of you. Instead of waiting for another round of messages exchanged, provide details on the initial ticket: error messages, screenshots, how to re-create the problem, what you have tried to resolve the issue and the results, changes in your system before problem appeared\n> 3. **Some sections to include** - Thankfully, Riot’s ticket submission form specifically asks for some of this information, but these are: \n> \n> \n> \n> * **Subject** - Use a few keywords describing the situation without necessitating a long phrase. The subject information will assist the Support Team in understanding at a glance what is the nature of the request. Avoid generic phrases such as \"Help Needed\" or \"Urgent Assistance Required\". An example \"Client crashes with message \"PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working\". An accurate subject line may help a support tech to quickly identify the problem/cause/solution because he may have seen it many times before. \n> * **Description **- Here is where to include the detailed information regarding the request. Include the following information but not limited to\n> * **Issue **– Brief re-statement of the problem\n> * **Error Message(s)** – may pinpoint the problem, cause and solution to the agent\n> * **Steps to reproduce** – What you do, what happens just before the problem occurs, changes made to system prior to problem ( updated OS, re-installed LoL)\n> * **Attachments **– screen shots may show error messages or things on screen that may be difficult or take long to described, log files with possible error messages\n> * **Steps you have taken to attempt to solve problem** – this may save time since support agent may have been planning to tell you to try just that (like re-installing), it gives an idea of how well you understand the problem, the attempted solution needs to be taken into consideration for the solution (changes original conditions or made the problem worse)\n> \n>  The more information there is, the better the support agent will be able to assist you with the request.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=octavian1127,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=W6ZhEsPG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-22T23:37:26.148+0000)\n> \n> I'd add that at least being familiar with the ToS before submitting account and store related tickets is a good idea.

Back when Riot updated the client and the patcher interface (end of season 4 I believe), mine never updated.

And im pretty certain that is lazy human doing the tickets pressing random resposne macros, because I bet a computer would do a better job sending out at least relevant information.\n\nI generally do a second  response paraphrasing the core of my question in short and simple terms, but I usually end up writing a third along the lines of \"Nope, now go and actually read my Ticket, then try again\"\n\nWorst is if they send you a \"final\" response that is at best only remotely connected to your question but think the issue solved and close your ticket.\n\nMy worst case included a total of three tickets and seven requests before I finally found someone that seemed  my question. (In short: Is it a bug that Jinx get's AOE on Runaan but Kayle doesn't?)\n\nAnd this Problem has existed for year. When I joined in Season 4 and read the warnings on the forum I thought it couldn't possibly be that bad.

It's just an example of variation in messaging). \n\nAdditionally, Support is trained to respond to your requests efficiently, and from what I can tell, that may mean utilizing a pre-formatted response.
