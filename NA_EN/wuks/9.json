I'm Wuks, one of the folks who has been developing improvements for the Boards over the past 2.5 years.\r\n\r\nMy journey with this community began sometime in 2014; and on January 14, 2015, I was brought on officially as one of the last Wrenchmen volunteers. Over these past 5 years, I've had the privilege to work with a large and diverse group of individuals across the world- volunteers, community members, and Rioters alike- to create the foundations for programs such as the Oceania volunteers program, to help establish the foundations for the Arbiters Program and subsequently the Advisor/Herald/Archivist/Moderator/Specialist programs on the NA Boards, and currently and ultimately, to develop features for the Boards that would ideally improve player experience on the Boards.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I admit I was over ambitious and over committed on a number of ideas for Boards improvements. For this, I'm sorry I couldn't do more, and I'm sorry I didn't do them faster. \r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm happy to answer questions regarding myself or the Boards; but please understand that there are some topics that I either am not at liberty to discuss or don't have the information to discuss (for questions that fall in either of these categories, I'll respond with a generic \"I'm not able to answer this question at this time\").\r\n\r\nCheers, and thanks for being an incredible and uniquely special community.\r\n\r\nWuks","replies":[]}
