{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-24T21:37:23.168+0000","title":"[7/23/19 OUTDATED] 3rd Party Applications/Modifications - What's allowed, and what isn't","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":158,"down_votes":10,"body":"_***~~Update 7/23/19: This post is outdated and does not reflect the current stance of Riot's 3rd Party Application usage policy. Please refer to https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications for more information.~~***_\n\n> Just to clarify, this thread is a compilation of what I've found when researching Riot's responses regarding different applications and modifications. This thread is meant to easily find what some Rioters said about those applications and modifications, but is not an official Riot thread. **As such, the information on this thread might not be completely accurate or up-to-date, so please keep that in mind and use due diligence in using unsupported applications. **\n\nWith the latest ban wave for 3rd party applications and modifications, I know there's some confusion as to what can get you banned and what can't. Hopefully this post will be able to clear up any confusion that you might have regarding what is acceptable to use and what violates the Terms of Use. \n\nPlease note that I cannot guarantee the accuracy and validity of these stances, as **Riot does reserve the right to change their stance on an application or modification at any time** as the result of changes to the application or in light of new information. Furthermore, this list is not comprehensive; just because it's not listed here doesn't mean that it's acceptable to use. Use 3rd party applications and modifications **at your own risk** (or don't use them at all). \n__________________________________\n>#Voice Pack Changing/Modifications - Allowed (for now)\n\nI use \"allowed\" very loosely. What I essentially mean is that Riot is currently not banning for voice over/voice pack modifications; however, this stance may change in the future. I'll try to keep this post updated if anything new comes up. \n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Draggles,realm=EUW,application-id=NzaqEm3e,discussion-id=V361v6AO,comment-id=0013,timestamp=2016-02-24T17:41:21.557+0000)\n>\n> As an update to this, we're not banning for any VO replacements, but as with every other modification to League of Legends, anything you change is at your own risk.\n\n#\n>#Custom Models &amp; Artwork (Skinning) - Allowed (for now)\n\nRiot, not too long ago, announced their stance on using custom skins and models. Essentially, these modifications can cause issues on your end (Bug Splat/Game Crashes), and generally have the potential to impact gameplay. Riot will be keeping an eye on custom skins, and if the policy changes, they'll likely announce and warn before taking action. I'll do my best to keep this updated; if you notice Riot changing their stance, feel free to comment below! NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN MKLOL/MKJOGO IS ALLOWED. See the MKLoL/MKJOGO section below for more information. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Cluvie,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=5kx4F7VE,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-28T18:09:18.385+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> For now, custom models and artwork sit firmly in a “use-at-your-own-risk” category, but we’re keeping an eye on them. We can’t optimize for assets we don’t develop, and if they do become a concern in the future (ie. they provide measurable player advantage), we’ll take action based on the stance we just discussed.\n> \n\n#\n>#Curse Voice &amp; Discord - Allowed\n\nWhile Curse Voice was not allowed at one point because a few features violated the Terms of Use, such as automated jungle timers, the developers have made modifications to the software to ensure that Curse Voice operates within the Terms of Use and does not provide any competitive advantages. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=Ag8jgd8Q,discussion-id=EbE4QMZW,comment-id=000f,timestamp=2014-10-14T16:13:02.628+0000)\n>\n> Over the past few months we have been working with the developers of many applications, including Curse and Razer.  Because of this, the latest revision of Curse Voice (version 6.1.X) and Razer Comms (version 2.1.X) no longer violate our current guidelines. \n\nDiscord is completely fine to use and doesn't violate the Terms of Use. (y)\n\n#\n>#Replay Software (Replay.GG, BaronReplays, LoLReplays, SkinSpotlights Replays) - Allowed\n\nBecause these softwares and services utilize documented features within the Riot API and the spectator stream and they don't interfere with in-game experiences, replay software and services are allowed under the Terms of Use at this time. \n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=TNPB5XZK,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-02-22T23:11:38.798+0000)\n>\n> It depends on the app, but generally speaking no it will not get you banned. Things like LOLReplay, and SKinSpotLights tool, which are replay specific apps, are totally okay. However, if you use an application that has Replay support built into it adjacent to other functionality that is NOT okay, such as cheating abilities, then obviously not.. even if you claim to only use the replay functions.\n> \n> There's been some good posts from us in the past to help provide this kind of guidance: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications\n\n\n#\n\n>#Elophant Client - Allowed\n\nFrom what I could find (or couldn't find), Riot has not directly addressed the Elophant Client; however, because it does not interfere directly with the in-game player experience between when the player presses \"Play\" and the end of game screen, it does not violate the Terms of Use and is allowed! \n\n#\n>#Frame of View modifications in game.cfg (or other applications that modify Frame of View/Zoom hacking) - Not Allowed\n\nThe game.cfg file is intended to reflect the settings that are made available to you in the in-game client. Modifying the game.cfg file to use a resolution that is not supported by League of Legends inherently provides an unfair advantage by giving the user a wider frame of view. As such, modifications such as these violate the Terms of Use. Don't do it. \n\n#\n>#Scripting - 100% NOT Allowed\n\nBy its very nature, scripting provides an unfair advantage over other players and often removes the skill required from actually playing the game. As a source, I've included an excerpt directly from the Terms of Use (updated October 23, 2012):\n> The following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:\n> J. Using any unauthorized third party programs, including but not limited to \"mods,\" \"hacks,\" \"cheats,\" \"scripts,\" \"bots,\" \"trainers,\" and automation programs, that interact with the Software in any way, for any purpose, including, without limitation, any unauthorized third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication between the Software and Riot Games and any unauthorized third party programs that collect information about the Game by reading areas of memory used by the Software to store information;\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse\n#\n>#LoLWiz &amp; Overwolf; LoL Summoner Information - Allowed\n\nRiot Sargonas has addressed the topic of whether Overwolf applications were acceptable and announced that these applications are acceptable for now. Riot, of course, reserves the right to change their stance on Overwolf; however, if Riot's stance were to change, an announcement would be made and warnings would be given out before any punishments were applied. \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=ao7rYcrT,comment-id=0012,timestamp=2015-03-25T07:17:22.320+0000)\n>\n> Hey everyone! Just wanted to chime in, since someone asked about our thoughts on this. LoLWiz, in it's current incarnation, is no different from visiting OP.GG or LolNexus or any other similar site. The only real difference is that it is displayed via an Overwolf Plugin, rather than a web page. It's powered by the Riot API, and no questionable access the game client, so as of right now we have no issues with using this app and will not frown upon players who do so.\n> \n> That being said, we reserve the right to change our stance on this, if in the future the LoLWiz app adopts any functionality we find to be harmful to player's experience or the game's ecosystem. (Though if that happened we would first attempt reach out to LoLWiz and try to course correct things there, instead of banning players.) Also, naturally, we can never officially condone or promote the use of any third party tool, as we can never guarantee your game stability or safety in doing so.\n> \n> TL;DR - It's not directly affecting the client, as it is a component of Overwolf and not a game-mod, so you won't be banned.\n\nSargonas also addresses LSI in this post:\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=0gi4P5dE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-01T07:16:47.896+0000)\n>\n> Totally fine to use it. We worked with LSI directly to ensure that their features fit within our 3rd party guidelines.\n\n#\n>#Championify - Allowed\n\nRiot has shown support of this application, and several Rioters personally choose to use this application. Because Championify does not interfere with the game once it begins and essentially is copying and pasting a build file, this application does not violate the Terms of Use and is acceptable to use. [**[RiotDiscourse]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3u32jl/championify_121_were_not_dead/cxbmfvn) [**[Phreak]**](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3nqn81/championify_100_championgg_item_sets_in_game_the/cvqmdh2)\n\n\n>#MKLOL (MKJOGO) - Not Allowed\n\nRiot has punished Summoners in the past for using this application and will continue to do so. The application has features that are against the Terms of Use. Here's what a notification will look like regarding the use of MKLoL:\n> After an extensive investigation, your account: [Summoner] has been detected using MKLoL/MKJogo, a third party application that unfortunately violates our current policies and the League of Legends Terms of Use. More specifically, this application automates several actions on your behalf, including chat and jungle timers.\n\n>For now, this is a warning, but continued use of this program will result in suspensions placed against you, and may ultimately result in permanent account closure.\n\n>Please take a moment to review our stance on third party applications here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/5kx4F7VE-reminder-third-party-applications\n\n>The Terms of Use in its entirety can be found here: http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse\n\n>We want you to take this seriously and understand that we take actions like this to ensure the competitive integrity of League of Legends. While we are unable to go into specifics, if you wish to dispute the actions taken against your account, you may contact us via this link: http://support.riotgames.com. Please know, however, that it’s very unlikely that the action will be reversed.\n\nHere's a [**quote from Riot tmx regarding MK JOGO**](http://forums.eune.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=751387): \n> Anything that interferes with the competitive game play -- from when you click the PLAY button till the Game End screen -- is considered as illegal. This means using any programs like MK jogo or BoL is a bannable offence.\n\n#\n_____________________________\nIf you have any questions about any applications that are on the list or not on the list, drop a comment below and I'll do my best to get some clarification on Riot's stance on the application. \n\n[**Remember to have fun, but never at anyone else's expense!**](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/)\n\n— Wuks\n\nAdditional Resources: \n- [Terms of Use](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse)\n- [Riot's Stance on 3rd Party Applications](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/our-stance-3rd-party-applications)\n- [Third Party Applications - Riot Games Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848-Third-Party-Applications)\n\n######This post was last updated on **November 13, 2016**.
