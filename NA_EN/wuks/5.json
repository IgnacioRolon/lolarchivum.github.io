{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-11-24T19:35:37.573+0000","title":"Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! (+ Elementalist Lux Giveaway?)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","up_votes":116,"down_votes":3,"body":"About a year ago, last Thanksgiving, I was playing a more active role in the North American Wrenchmen Program with the Arbiters Program in a more secondary role. As the plans to have dedicated Rioters help out in the Help &amp; Support sub-boards started to come to fruition, I began to pivot my focus to the Arbiters Program and the Player Behavior &amp; Moderation sub-boards. \n\nThere are so many people I'd like to thank, but first and foremost, I'd like to thank the other volunteers in our different regional volunteer programs, from NA to OCE to EU. Their work in providing more insight, clarity, and engagement to players has been nothing short of amazing. \n\nIt should be no surprise that my next thanks goes out to Riot and the Rioters who have made this program possible. Working with Player Support specialists, NOC Technicians, Community Coordinators, and Project Specialists has been an absolute honor, and to be completely honest, has given me a lot of the perspective on the Player Behavior systems and Riot Games as a whole that I hold today. (Also, shoutout to my Recruiting Coordinator for giving me an opportunity to speak to her about my passions and experience, and then a further opportunity to speak with the team I'm applying to; hopefully I'll have good news to share at the end of this)\n\nAnd finally, saving the best of the best for last, my deepest thanks to the League of Legends community. You guys have been amazing to work with. The Arbiters Program didn't have a perfect launch and the implications of the program weren't yet clear, but somehow things came together. Thank you for being patient with us, and thank you for your help in the Player Behavior &amp; Moderation sub-boards. We're at a point where community members are able to step in and provide insight into the punishment escalation system, Leaverbuster, and the other PB systems. But most importantly, thank you for keeping us honest. There are times where I find myself speaking in defense of certain Riot policies or decisions, and a good number of you will passionately speak in favor or against of what I have to say. I do read your comments, and regardless of whether you agree or disagree, I respect what you have to say and give a lot of thought to it. \n________________________________\n\nAs a small token of our appreciation, we'll be giving away 5 mystery skins and Elementalist Lux. How can you snag a gift? Post a comment with something that you're thankful for (League related or not League related, doesn't matter) and a number between 1-1000! 5 of the skins will be given away randomly. Elementalist Lux will likely be given away if someone picks the right number, but I'll have a more definitive answer on the guidelines later.  Winners for the mystery gifts will be selected at random times throughout the giveaway period, so the sooner you post, the better. The giveaway will close this Sunday at 11:59PM PST, when remaining recipients will be determined. Be sure to upvote!\n\nAnd of course, to celebrate the diversity and inclusiveness of the Boards, all players in good standing from NA, OCE, EUW, and EUNE are eligible for gifts! :D\n\nHappy Turkey Day!\n\nhttp://img07.deviantart.net/a4f0/i/2011/328/2/6/anivia_turkey_by_evangeelliot-d4h67lk.jpg\n\nNow where da heck is this skin?!?!

Even if it's sometimes a rather negative than positive experience. With negative experience I mean the hate of the community which isn´t rare. I already have seen death wishes to others and that isn't even that rarely then some might think it is. But I for myself also wasn't always innocent; I sometimes spam pinged others when they annoyed me somehow and also was negative in chat sometimes -> complaints about why they didn't play safe/wait. But I never insulted anyone or said worse things which I am glad for I didn´t do. But I´m sorry that I spam pinged or complained about mistakes. And I will try to be more friendly in the future.\n\nBut despite this I also had some great moments with the community which I'm thankful for. For example as I was relatively new to league I played Teemo top together with an Udyr and he was calmly and gave me advices and said that when I died it wasn't that bad. I also had people who celebrated others when they did something great. I'm just thankful for that and want to reminder that we all came to league because it was funny/amazing/.... so don't forget that moment and relax if your mates do mistakes, instead of complaining we should cheer them up and motivate them, it's just that a great community makes an already awesome game much, much better. \n\nI'm thankful for my cousin who showed me the first time league (even if he never downloaded and played it -> we wanted to play a game together so we searched for something as the result I still play it while he never downloaded/played it even when I told him that league is awesome xD); I'm also thankful for those community members who are friendly and make the game more awesome.

The chances for every number are 1/1000. Sure, some of them looks special like 777 or 1000, but chances are the same. Sure, 843 looks more \"random\" (this number is not taken as well) and you think you have better chances because \"random\" numbers usually show up more times because there are two number families: \"special\" numbers and \"non-special\" ones, and the last one contains more elements (for ordinary people).

Oh, you're going to look at this post, and you're going to think, \"Wow, another one of those people who couldn't think of something legitimate, like the millitary, or something else\". But no, this isn't going to be one of those responses.\n\nI've been playing League since the beginning of Season 4. Why did i start playing? Well, one day, my brother had his friends over, and they were playing. Well, I didn't have any idea what was going on, but they were just playing this one champion over and over. {{champion:115}} Ziggs. I wasn't really sure what this was all about, but the idea that he set up minefields to prevent people from getting away, and just threw bombs in general captivated me. One day, I snuck onto his computer, and opened up an account on my own. I played through the tutorial. That was the best game tutorial I have ever played through. I enjoyed playing an archer {{champion:22}} on some sort of snow map. I loved how it was sort of like an RPG, like how you get to control a character, yet it was still sort of a combat game. Soon, I started playing on Summoners Rift. Being honest, I only played champions that were super easy, and I only played jungle. Back when I was level 8 or so, I remember smite used to be unlocked at level 8. I would only play Warwick jungle. It was Warwick, Warwick, Warwick all the time. I never stopped playing Warwick until the end of season 6, last year. Then, during preseason 5, everything changed. The jungle changed, everything looked... Newer. More exciting. My interest in League had never been higher. However, unfortunately, they raised the level for smite! I was only level 9, so I coudln't use smite anymore! This didn't deter me though. I brought my Warwick into the top lane. Then, that season, for Christmas. I was gifted a mystery skin by Riot. It was FIREFANG WARWICK! A skin for the only champion that I ever played! I was so happy. In fact, Im pretty sure Warwick was one of the only champions that I played all the way up until I was level 30. Then, my champion pool started to grow, and I started to play magnificient champions such as Zed, Ashe, Draven, Lee Sin, Amumu, Annie, Riven, Lulu, and others. \n\nHowever, during the end of season 5, where my toxicity level was at it's highest, I would frequently get chat restrictions. I would get frustrated sometimes, being limited to only 5 posts. However, after my 3rd (And final chat restriction EVER), I started getting reformed (in my opinion). Now, I believe that I am fully reformed. I am only sorta toxic to my friends, and they are toxic back, so its not really toxicity just friendly banter. And sometimes, when there is a Rengar on the enemy team, and Im a Nasus or something, I always say \"Woof Dog>Cat ff20 pls thanks\". or something like that. Never really toxic anymore.\n\nSo, throughout my league career, I am thankful for many things.\n1. I am thankful for the punishment system. It reformed me. Despite what everyone else says, I believe that the Chat restriction system is good.\n\n2. I am thankful for the creators of every champion. But mainly, I am thankful for the creators of Draven, Zed, Annie, Amumu, Leona, Riven, Lulu, Shaco, Ashe, Lee Sin, and Sivir. Champions that I play a lot.\n\n3. I am thankful for the creators of Warwick. I played that champion so much, and without your hard work put into making him, I might not be here on this forum post today. \n\n4. I am grateful for the Rioter by the name of Firefang Warwick? Sorry if I got your name wrong. You were the one that replied to my ticket on why I was chat restricted 2 years ago! Im sure you don't remember me, but I remember you!\n\n5. I am grateful for the people who make skins and chromas. Don't listen to the people that say your Chromas are bad, or your Skins are bad. They are good. Trust me. I love the skins.\n\n6. I am grateful for the hextech crafting system and their creators. That system is the best.\n\n7. I am grateful for the person who made the Bard wallpaper, Yi wallpaper, Veigar wallpaper, Amumu wallpaper, and Annie Wallpaper. Im sure there are more, but these are all I remember. YOU ARE THE BEST, THE ANNIE WALLPAPER IS GOING TO FOREVER BE MY WALLPAPER!\n\n8. I am grateful for the League of legends community in whole. There will always be people doing positive acts outweighing the negative in this community.\n\n9. I am grateful for Riot games in general, keep up the good work!\n\n10. I am grateful to be alive today, and grateful for everyone I know for making me be able to post this on the forums this very moment.\n\n\nMy number is 336.\n\nAnd as always, the Amumu icon on the bottom of my every post...\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Aeszarck","date":"2016-11-26T20:24:55.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome reply!
