The reason why Riot made Honor a season long grind is because they wanted to reward consistent good behavior, which is hard to fake if you're trying to pretend you're a good little boi for many months.\n\nAs an analogy (and we're going back to school on this one), begging your teacher for a passable or even a better final grade than you deserved ultimately results in you still not caring to learn from your mistakes or make an actual effort because all you were chasing for is either a good median from all grades or no failed classes.\n\n>Goals and rewards are essential to human life and preserving the human psyche.\n\nAnd for people that don't want to make an effort but just beg for free passes, by your very argument, also look for easy ways out. It's also a part of the human psyche - to find shortcuts in life and take free rides all around. That's why lavishing people with rewards for essentially breathing, is what makes people lazier in the long run.
