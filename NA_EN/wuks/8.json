Post text is HTML-escaped, and only unescaped in the actual rendered post - not in the hover preview, not in quoted text. It's pretty bad. Also, speaking of the champion:nnn syntax, it breaks search (if you want to know about {{champion:266}}, do you search for Aatrox or the number 266?), and provides nothing in return other than pretty pictures. It doesn't even pop a tooltip when you hover - not even the _name_ of the thing, much less an item's stats, champion's abilities, etc.\n\nWhen you click through to the next page of a discussion in chronological view (not just GD), the new discussion page is not actually taking you to a new web page; it's just replacing the post elements with new posts, without automatically jumping to the top reply. I kind of can't believe no one caught that in testing. It reminds me of reading ebooks by traversing memo entries backwards on my Palm Pilot IIIxe nearly 20 years ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2019-07-14T06:39:39.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually crazy how it's been 10 months since I made this post.
