However, if you win more games, you&#039;ll level up faster than if you lose. This creates a hyper competitive atmosphere at level 1-30 for most players, and they&#039;ll try their hardest to play to win rather than play to learn or play to have fun, defeating the purpose of the barrier between level 1-30. \r\n\r\nNow, if we reduced the difference of experience between wins and losses as players level, I think that players would be less inclined to try hard and do everything in their power to win. This might lead to a reduction in toxicity, a reduction in negative experiences for new players, and generally a better experience for everyone overall. These XP adjustments would only affect normal, player vs. player Summoners Rift queues, so there&#039;ll still be plenty of time to identify bots as they level and ban &#039;em out. \r\n\r\nYour thoughts are always appreciated :) Thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-12-20T21:38:31.173+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I don't know why Summoner experience is dependent on w/l in the first place - seems silly to me.\n\nIn fact, most of the leveling experience feels very much like unnecessary gating at this point.

For players who don't intend to play ranked I think level is rather meaningless. For those who do, achieving level 30 is just a chore. Also, for new players reaching level 30 is rarely sufficient for being successful in ranked. Most likely, those players will rapidly plummet towards the bottom of bronze.\n\nI think Riot should sell level 30 accounts. Possibly restricting this to only players who currently have an account in Gold or above or something like that. That alone would do more to improve player experience in the low levels because it would get a good deal of smurfs out of that queue. Me killing a legit level 5 ten times in ten minutes is probably far more negative for experience overall than people being highly competitive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"waspcreaturesx","date":"2015-12-21T08:15:44.107+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"I may be part of the unpopular opinion but leveling to 30 was not bad whatsoever. I just got to 30 about two weeks ago, and before that the grind didn't bother me at all. I was more focused on leveling my mastery scores with various champions that I liked. I didn't even save or start buying any runes until I hit level 30, and I did fine against players with full rune pages. \n\nThe only REAL problem with being a new player are smurf accounts. Other than that, all other players dealt with the same shitty tutorial and shitty recommended items. At the same time, you can't give new players everything. You can't just automatically recommend them the best build path for their character, as it is constantly changing and it's something they need to learn on their own. A player who wants to be better should know to look up guides. Watch streamers. Watch YouTube videos. Do your studying. It's a hard game to adjust to. It takes a long time to know EVERYTHING. Ultimately, I don't think the tutorial is THAT bad. It leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't feel like I was incredibly lost as a newbie. \n\nThe Internet is a powerful thing. If you're dissatisfied with the information the game gives you, look up more.\n\nAs far as experience gains, I personally didn't even realize wins gave you more exp. I didn't usually look at the numbers and leveling happened pretty fast anyways. I feel like a lot of people have the natural \"play to win\" competitive attitude regardless. Even if wins gave the same exp as losses, a lot of people would still be focused on winning. It's in our nature. There has to be SOME reward for winning. It makes sense to me at least that when you show you're a decent player (by winning a lot of games) you progress to level 30 faster. If you're a bad player and lose an obnoxious amount, the game merely holds you back because you have more to learn. When you learn what you're doing wrong, you'll fix it and be on your path to winning.\n\nTLDR; The new user experience is not as bad as people make it out to be. New players have extra sources they can take advantage of (Google, YouTube, twitch). Runes don't make THAT much of a difference. And more exp for winning encourages people who are getting the hang of the game, and holds back those who have more to learn. It's there for a reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-12-20T21:36:40.279+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wouldn't this also make more bot accounts, since they can gain level quickly even if they lose?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-20T21:39:39.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=5000000000000000,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=caA0EOxf,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-20T21:36:40.279+0000)\n>\n> Wouldn't this also make more bot accounts, since they can gain level quickly even if they lose?\n\nNo, sir.

Playing a new champion allows you to face lower MMR enemies, but not completely new players. \n\nRune slots would be fully unlocked with a few pre-set pages for AP, AD and Tank. I believe this means everyone will require a free page. Perhaps each champion will have a recommended rune page setup for rolls on their champion page. With a note about them only being a guideline. \n\nRanked will now require the same 16 champions, but all of these champions must be a mastery rank 2 a set # of unlocked T3 runes.

(Makes it more fair and also allows players to play around with different rune page layouts while unlocking slots for tier 3)\nMake tier 1 rune equivalents for **every** tier 3 rune (there are currently a ton missing)\nRemove tier 2 runes (they're just traps for wasting IP and just lead to over all frustration).\n\n\nAbout the original topic:\nI don't feel there is a need to make losses more forgiving and wins less rewarding. If your matchmaking is working oka-ish (and I know, smurfs kinad messess it up in lower levels) players should be able to maintain ~40% win rate at the very least. If players feel they're progressing too slowly it would seem to me it's a problem with the overall progression system as opposed to the rewards for winning.\nBasically if you can't enjoy LoL before reaching 30, you shouldn't focus on making the grind easier, you should make the grind less frustrating in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2015-12-20T23:03:13.417+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zenhii,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=caA0EOxf,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-12-20T22:58:45.867+0000)\n>\n> Make leveling linear (same amount of exp needed each level)\n\nI don't understand why this isn't already the case.\n\n> Allow players to chose which new  summoner spell to unlock on level up (playing against other people who have flash when you don't feels absolutely horrible, and I find it ridiculous you literally can't play jungle before level 5).\n\nI like this idea.\n\n> Remove tier 2 runes (they're just traps for wasting IP and just lead to over all frustration).\n\nI could be mistaken, but I thought they already did this?","replies":[{"poster":"Nyanthe","date":"2015-12-23T05:07:55.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not remove runes completely for under 30's? it would make it easier to focus on learning game play mechanics.\n\nSpeaking as someone who has only been playing LOL for 5 days and is only lvl 7 ...

There are YouTube videos (I believe Riot has one but I'm not entirely sure if it was them) that explain how to play the game and what \"bot\" means. As far as feeding goes, it's like a slang term, like a lot of other league terms. No one will necessarily teach them to you, you'll learn them as you go. No one explained to you what selfie meant when that term started up, you figured it out (although it is quite obvious). I just think the problem is that people don't take advantage of the Internet. There are guides, YouTube videos, and a bunch more stuff that will literally teach you how to play the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Clockwork Madoka","date":"2015-12-21T02:33:02.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: Overhaul the rune system. I'm level 25 and have spent over 10k IP on runes, and I honestly wish I could have gotten a new champ instead, rather than being forced to get runes so i can be at all competent. \n\n2:  Have all summoner spells unlocked right from the get-go, and give something else has a level reward (forcing people to get below-average spells is bad. You are also unable to jungle due to the lack of smite)\n\n3:  Rather being a win of the day, add new possible ways to get the daily IP.  Not sure how, but it would be nice to not be forced to play bots if I want to guarantee I get the IP.\n\nI also have a friend who has been at a disadvantage in every game we play for the reasons stated above. He couldn't jungle for a long time because he didn't have smite. Laning was difficult because he didn't have runes as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tenzosan","date":"2016-01-07T18:28:58.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with leveling isn't so much the experience; It is more the recycled toxic players. Players who have lost their accounts are making new ones and starting over just as toxic as before. They fill the lower levels with hate speech and show them the ugly side of the community before the players even get to the ranking scene. Leveling in itself is a learning process and teaches the more valuable things like performing well and winning garners a better reward therefore try your best even if your best falls short. But again, with recycled toxic players flooding the gates and creating a negative experience for lower levels only spreads that toxic behavior around faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"S H A Y C 0","date":"2015-12-21T19:12:00.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This wont stop the toxic tryhard smurfs from ruining the new player experience. i think that should be addressed while were on topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Nyanthe","date":"2015-12-23T05:40:13.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Riot should give new accounts a choice when they sign up ... faster leveling and less support or more support and slower leveling. That will immediately sort out the smurfs from those who genuinely need to learn how to play the game.

I think ADC or ADS or something, whatever that means. And many of the videos talk about jungling and being ganked .. yet then don't seem to happen in the intro bot games.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of good tutorial videos for actual beginners ... ones who don't understand the jargon, have no idea at all about the game and don't yet have the better summoner abilities.","replies":[]}]}]}
