Before we begin, allow me to introduce what the Wrenchmen Program is and what a Respond-a-thon entails. \n\nVery briefly, the **Wrenchmen Program** is an international volunteer program, with the purpose of resolving whatever questions we can answer on the Boards, as well as working with Rioters in identifying problems that may be affecting the community at large. If you'd like more information about the Wrenchmen Program, check out Ymir's post on the forums: [The Wrenchmen: Helping Solve Issues, One Post at a Time!](http://forums.eune.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=65139)\n\nA **Respond-a-thon**, on the other hand, is an idea that we had that would allow summoners and Wrenchmen to work on resolving issues in a rapid-response type manner. The underlying concept is that Wrenchmen will be online during the set date(s) and time(s) and regularly checking this thread to work with one another to resolve each issue that summoners experience. \n\n>**How's this event going to work?**\n\n________________________\nWhen the time/date comes, we'll be posting a new thread where we'll be taking replies where summoners report issues that they're encountering. Hopefully, summoners should be able to find another summoner encountering similar issues and find a resolution to that issue without posting a new reply. We'll do our best to respond as quickly as possible, and to get you back on the rift with minimal hassle.\n\n> **Event Details**\n \n________________________\n**Date/Time:** Thursday, May 14, 2015 from **7:00PM PDT to 10:00PM PDT** (Wrenchmen will still be resolving questions in the thread after the allotted time; however, you may see a more noticeable delay in those responses.)\n**Hosts:** Doctor Elduris (NA Wrenchman), Kao Atlantis (NA Junior Wrenchman), Wuks (NA Junior Wrenchman)\n_(Various Rioters may pop in to help out as well)_\n \n________________________\nThanks for reading, and we look forward to working with y'alls to quickly resolve any issues that you may be encountering! If you have an account-specific issue, [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have that issue resolved (remember, we're not Rioters; we're community volunteers). If you have any questions regarding today's event, I'll be happy to respond to any questions, comments, or concerns!","replies":[{"poster":"Ephreaym","date":"2015-05-06T20:34:52.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have been having issues with getting the red exclaimation point saying you have been disconnected from pvp.net,it may have been caused by a problem with our service, then it says attempting to reconnect and it does after a split second but it makes it so i cant talk in chats i get random dced  or i dont get que pop up so that i  can hit accept it it quite aggrivating i cant even play the game right now because of it. please help .......","replies":[{"poster":"Cookie Troll","date":"2015-05-07T15:54:30.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this same issue aswell.
