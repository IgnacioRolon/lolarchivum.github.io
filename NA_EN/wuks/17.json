You might as well go take the Summoner's Code behind the shed, shoot it in the head, and bury it in the hill if that's the case, because a game that has forming teams and working within them as one of the core values of the gameplay that doesn't make an effort to support positive, sportsmanlike behavior condusive to teamplay whilst discouraging the opposite will never be a sport.","replies":[{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-01-22T20:50:50.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They may be happy with the results of how the IFS is working.  Being that we don't have the raw numbers, it's hard for us to say whether it works better than the tribunal or not.  It's not biased the way the tribunal was.  That much we know.  It's faster.  We can also know that.  But we don't have numbers showing the numbers of reports submitted to the tribunal, percentages of false reports, percentages of players punished, or their corresponding numbers for the IFS.  I would be very interesting to see how that has changed.  I suspect, the IFS has become much, much more efficient from a numbers standpoint.  It may need a tweak or two when it comes to handing out permabans, but I think it does probably work better than the Tribunal system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-01-22T20:47:48.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Are we to take this as Riot not putting player behavior anywhere near the top of their priorities list?\n\nNo, we're to take it as the Tribunal isn't being worked on.

Silence tends to breed doubt in situations like this. Doubt is something best avoided when you're trying to gain or keep your community's trust. \n\n#justsaying","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-04T04:41:51.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They recently [mentioned](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/02/ask-riot-where-is-butchers-bridge/) that \"Player Behavior has a few high-priority things on its plate at the moment\".

I'm not going to disagree that it's not top priority, given that they're also working on other systems like bans, the various class updates and onboarding. Given how long league has been around and that tribunal has been down for >50% of that time now, that should warrant SOME kind of response as to what they're doing to replace it and what kind of ideas/projects they have in the works for player behavior.\n\nBecause let's be honest, Instant feedback was never designed to be a replacement for spotting and correcting behavior that isn't primarily chat based. It has a terrible time spotting in-game behavior like feeding, trolling, or just plain giving up after 5 minutes and dragging the team down if there isn't a ton of chat feedback about it. Flaming and verbal abuse are only two things out of a huge list that instant feedback actually corrects. The rest of the summoner's code has pretty much been left to flounder at this point...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Carcus80","date":"2017-05-04T04:50:33.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cmon man, they haven't released anything in 2 years..\nHow can you say that with a straight face..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Carcus80","date":"2017-05-04T05:00:25.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is bullshit, pathetic riot. \n\nThats going back on something they promised to deliver 3ish year ago and a lot of people \nhave really been hoping for for the last 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-01-22T21:59:09.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Community review without fear of a personal audit, especially when incentivised, is a poor way to go about reviewing cases like this.
