I have never spent money on this game until last night. I have Dragon Slayer Vayne, Bad Santa Veigar, and Hextech Sion. (Vayne and Veigar were gifted from random people that I met and Sion was given for behavior).\r\nI finally decided to spend money because I love playing Ashe and I thought the Marauder Ashe looked super cool. Come to find out, the only thing that looks cool is her outfit. Other than this, NOTHING else changed. I mean you couldn't change any of the abilities or anything? I'm not asking for something as ridiculous as Heartseeker Ashe. I know that Heartseeker is a very expensive skin so I understand why her arrows look so cool.\r\nBut for Marauder Ashe can't you at least change the color or something? How hard would it be to make the arrows black? Idk, maybe I am alone with this opinion, but it seems like something else could be changed about Marauder Ashe.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-02-20T00:10:54.131+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should probably watch a preview of a skin before you buy so you don't assume things and get disappointed.","replies":[{"poster":"lightdragoon88","date":"2015-02-20T00:27:56.064+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. \n\nNever decided on just a splash. \n\nAlways check skin spotlight.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-02-20T00:37:42.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Or get a PBE account and test out new skins before they are released.","replies":[{"poster":"Shynkle","date":"2015-02-20T01:40:30.489+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh, gee, I sure forgot that PBE was something you could just *choose* to be in.","replies":[{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-02-20T02:38:30.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can sign up and test out new mechanics and what not.
