Oh you won lane? You ganked bot 4 times as a top laner? You killed enemy mid laner 3 times in the first 15 minutes? Thats still not enough to win if you have the most bad players on your team.\n\nExample:\nhttps://imgur.com/skEBRYu\n\nLegit Diamond 1 player last season, still struggling to win in Silver 3 elo lmao. SILVER 3! AS A D1 LAST SEASON! Holy cow no wonder everyone is constantly complaining on the forums about this game. Literally every other season, youd see maybe 3-6 posts a day on the forum from people saying something negative about League. But now it feels more in the 20s+ posts a day about this game being bad.\n\nYou cant solo carry, nada zip. That means its all based on luck for winning, 50/50 chance. Oh hey I just ganked my teams lanes and shut all the enemy laners down, this mean we should win right? Nope, your Zoe overextends dying nonstop, Lucian keeps trying to 1v2 Kai sa and an Azir. Thresh misses every hook and overextends with the Zoe all game. Udyr is your only hope on your team. You ping nonstop to your team mates to back, they dont listen, they give 2 kills because they overextend. You tell your team to group, they split up. You tell your adc to just play safe so you can carry, goes in to 1v2 all game.\n\nIn S6-S7, you could win lane, roam, and actually carry. Why? Because when you had a gold lead, you could actually use it. Now you can get people to 2/7 yet they can still 1v1 you when youre 13/2. And why is this? Because DAMAGE IS TOO HIGH. Like man its ridiculous. You see posts literally every day, multiple times a day complaining about damage being too high in this game and yet Riot still wont do anything about it. There is 0 reason a 13/2 should lose to a 2/7 unless they missed all their abilities or are troll building. There is 0 reason a tank should be able to 1v3 just because hes a tank with insane damage. \n\nThe new patch coming up tomorrow isnt going to fix anything either. Ive played on PBE, and its still the EXACT SAME THING. ADCs can still 3 shot you even when you have a 4k gold lead on them, and you have ninja tabis/GA. Hail of Blades is a fail keystone, literally cant see anyone taking this. You want to improve this game Riot? Heres how!\n\n\n_**What Needs Fixing**_\n\n1. Bring back old Jungler camps. The ones that actually provided different smite buffs. Instead of this &quot;Heal when you smite&quot; bs. You guys literally took out some strategy and replaced it with brain dead heals for junglers to abuse. This is allowing junglers to gank nonstop with full health. Back before these changes, Junglers would try and gank top laners with about 50% health, which if the top laner was good could outplay this. Now its just impossible for top laners to outplay this, and in return they have to run back to tower or just get ccd by the enemy jungler and die.\n\n2. Nerf Dorans Shield. Poking champs are here for a reason. You shouldnt be able to just take Dorans Shield and Resolve against a Teemo or Panth and not take any damage. The point of Pantheon is to get fed early so he can end early. And if he doesnt end early then he falls off and is pretty much gg unless his team carries him. This actually requires skill to play against Pantheon, rather than just ignoring all his poke with 2 braindead items. \n\n3. Dont nerf ADC&#039;s base damage. That isnt the problem with ADCs, you can even see that in your fail attempt of nerfing them this patch. What you need to do, is lower their ability damage. Stop being so lazy and just nerfing all ADC&#039;s attack damage by the same number. Actually go through each ADC, and fix their kits. Also fix Ashe and Sivir already. They&#039;re very outdated and seeing them on your team just brings sadness. Things to nerf - KaiSa&#039;s Swarm of Missiles (Q), Ezreal&#039;s Mystic Shot (Q), Xayahs R Feather Count needs reduced, Jhin&#039;s Passive Damage, and Draven&#039;s Q damage by like 10%. \n\n4. Nerf Grasp. There is 0 reason I should take Grasp on Jayce and still be able to deal more damage with Grasp than any other keystone on him, while also getting the heal from Grasp and the bonus max health. \n\n5. Nerf Infernals damage down by 3-4%. Infernals are way too big in this game. If the enemy gets 1 infernal, then youre already gonna be down 3k gold late game. Because 8% damage/ap is given. Lets say you have a 441 ad top, 412 ap jg, 873 ap mid, 537 adc, 192 ap support. Add 8% to each of those. Top laner gets 35 bonus ad. Jungler gets 33 ap. Mid gets 70 ap. Adc gets 43 ad. And support gets 15 ap. 1 AD = 35 gold (long sword = 10 ad = 350 gold / 10 = 35 gold per ad) So 35 + 43 ad x 35 = 2,730 gold in items. Ap = 21.75 gold per AP stat (Amplify = 20 AP = 435 gold / 20 = 21.75). So 33 + 70 + 15 x 21.75 = 2,566 gold in items. Add them both up and thats 5296 gold in items just off one drake. Get all three infernals and thats 15,888 gold in items late game. Its just unfair and lame that one objective in the game is worth that much gold.\n\n6. Revert Teleport back to normal. Ever since this change, top laners have been having hardly any impact on bot lane. Because by the time we tp in, the enemy is already backed off. The only way they dont back off is if they got a gank from their jungler or if theyre kill bot lane. Now top laners can pretty much only take teleport to tp back to lane, because tping bot is almost pointless now. \n\n7. Revert Ignite. I dont know why they buffed this in the first place. &quot;Hey theres too much damage in this game, we should buff ignites true damage!&quot;. I dont like seeing bot lanes take ignite every game now. Exhaust is there to counter adcs, and when they dont take it, it puts people who are trying to carry in a hard spot. Because trying to kill someone who has high damage without exhaust is rough.\n\n8. Tank items. Tanks arent even tanky when they get Frozen Heart, Ice Gauntlet, Gargoyle, etc. The new tanks are champions that build Health and Damage. So people that build Black Cleaver, Trinity Force, Titanic Hydra, Abyssal Mask, etc, are a lot more tankier than tanks. Which is why almost every player is building Bork now, otherwise they cant kill tanks in this game. I would recommend nerfing health on damage items. Black Cleaver shouldnt be giving 400 health, I mean come on, maybe 250 or 300 but not 400.\n\n9. Lots of Champs are still missing Keystones that fit their play style. As a Jayce, I still have yet to find a rune page or Keystone in general that works with my champion. Some take Electrocute, but its not that good especially against tanks. Most pro Jayce players dont take Electrocute either. Jayce players take Aery which isnt a very good keystone for him. Back then most Jayce players would take fervor or Storm Raiders. Yes we have Conqueror, but it doesnt work on Jayce at all. \n\n10. Tower Damage. I have no clue why Riot decided to get rid of the laser towers. Literally anyone can tower dive you once they get about 30 armor. The tower shoots slow, low damage at you while you tower dive the enemy. This just promotes no outplays for the person being dived and is tilting for people who die under tower watching their tower fail to protect them against puny 30 armor.\n\n**_What Is Right_**\n\nDont get me wrong tho, there are some things in this game that are right but people want Riot to change. \n\n1. Gold is fine. Tower gold bonus, New bounty gold, First blood, Cs, Jungle camps, Scuttle, all the gold income in this game is great right now and doesnt need any tweaking. Most people dont like the gold because they think it snowballs people harder, which isnt a bad thing. The bad thing is when you snow ball, and you can still get 1v1d by someone with 2k gold less than you because damage is too high. \n\n2. Lethality. As a Jayce player I love lethality and last season would build 24 lethality as my runes and l would use that one lethality slot in the keystone page in S7 which was 12 lethality i think? Nobody really uses Sudden Impact, and with the removal of Lethality from Runes Riot did buff the lethality on items by 6. Which means I lose  about 18 total lethality from my build. Which is fine because it seems about balanced now. Back then you could one shot people with lots of lethality, but now it feels a bit more balanced.\n\n3. Wards. New warding cooldowns and time active is pretty good. Lets top laners survive lane a bit easier without having to worry about a gank every 20 seconds.\n\n4. Rift. Rift is supposed to get you a tower pretty much 100% if you use it right. Its a good objective to get and its not too overpowered like the Infernal. It takes longer to do, making it risky to get. \n\nThats about all I can say for this game right now. Its in a pretty bad state, I just dont know why Riot isnt doing anything about this damage in the game. People have been complaining about it since Pre-Season started and nothing changes. Its like they nerf damage, then give the person they nerfed the damage to a buff to a different part of their damage, making them do the same damage as before. Highly doubt a Rioter would respond to this, most Rioters like to respond to Meme&#039;s n Games posts. Just bums me out, I used to be so excited to get in a game for League, and now its like I open the game and just feels like a chore to play.","replies":[{"poster":"GG Thanks For LP","date":"2018-05-31T08:48:50.235+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":3,"body":"Just in case anybody would question me being low elo trash making a rant post, heres my main account with a picture of me hitting Diamond 5 on it.

Sure i don't like the turret changes, the scuttle changes and the retarded amount of upfront burst damage but asking for TP to go back to 3 seconds or old jungle camps shows how little you've thought about these changes as you're mostly telling Riot to put more arcade-y elements in for the sake of variety.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW Diana","date":"2018-05-31T11:35:54.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JAYCCCCCCCCCCCCE,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zos6Lpuh,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-31T08:28:01.373+0000)\n>\n> No matter how good you are, no matter how hard you try, you yourself cannot carry. Oh you won lane? You ganked bot 4 times as a top laner? You killed enemy mid laner 3 times in the first 15 minutes? Thats still not enough to win if you have the most bad players on your team.\n> \n> Example:\n> https://imgur.com/skEBRYu\n> \n> Legit Diamond 1 player last season, still struggling to win in Silver 3 elo lmao. SILVER 3! AS A D1 LAST SEASON! Holy cow no wonder everyone is constantly complaining on the forums about this game. Literally every other season, youd see maybe 3-6 posts a day on the forum from people saying something negative about League. But now it feels more in the 20s+ posts a day about this game being bad.\n> \n> You cant solo carry, nada zip. That means its all based on luck for winning, 50/50 chance. Oh hey I just ganked my teams lanes and shut all the enemy laners down, this mean we should win right? Nope, your Zoe overextends dying nonstop, Lucian keeps trying to 1v2 Kai sa and an Azir. Thresh misses every hook and overextends with the Zoe all game. Udyr is your only hope on your team. You ping nonstop to your team mates to back, they dont listen, they give 2 kills because they overextend. You tell your team to group, they split up. You tell your adc to just play safe so you can carry, goes in to 1v2 all game.\n> \n> In S6-S7, you could win lane, roam, and actually carry. Why? Because when you had a gold lead, you could actually use it. Now you can get people to 2/7 yet they can still 1v1 you when youre 13/2. And why is this? Because DAMAGE IS TOO HIGH. Like man its ridiculous. You see posts literally every day, multiple times a day complaining about damage being too high in this game and yet Riot still wont do anything about it. There is 0 reason a 13/2 should lose to a 2/7 unless they missed all their abilities or are troll building. There is 0 reason a tank should be able to 1v3 just because hes a tank with insane damage. \n> \n> The new patch coming up tomorrow isnt going to fix anything either. Ive played on PBE, and its still the EXACT SAME THING. ADCs can still 3 shot you even when you have a 4k gold lead on them, and you have ninja tabis/GA. Hail of Blades is a fail keystone, literally cant see anyone taking this. You want to improve this game Riot? Heres how!\n> \n> \n> _**What Needs Fixing**_\n> \n> 1. Bring back old Jungler camps. The ones that actually provided different smite buffs. Instead of this &amp;quot;Heal when you smite&amp;quot; bs. You guys literally took out some strategy and replaced it with brain dead heals for junglers to abuse. This is allowing junglers to gank nonstop with full health. Back before these changes, Junglers would try and gank top laners with about 50% health, which if the top laner was good could outplay this. Now its just impossible for top laners to outplay this, and in return they have to run back to tower or just get ccd by the enemy jungler and die.\n> \n> 2. Nerf Dorans Shield. Poking champs are here for a reason. You shouldnt be able to just take Dorans Shield and Resolve against a Teemo or Panth and not take any damage. The point of Pantheon is to get fed early so he can end early. And if he doesnt end early then he falls off and is pretty much gg unless his team carries him. This actually requires skill to play against Pantheon, rather than just ignoring all his poke with 2 braindead items. \n> \n> 3. Dont nerf ADC&amp;#039;s base damage. That isnt the problem with ADCs, you can even see that in your fail attempt of nerfing them this patch. What you need to do, is lower their ability damage. Stop being so lazy and just nerfing all ADC&amp;#039;s attack damage by the same number. Actually go through each ADC, and fix their kits. Also fix Ashe and Sivir already. They&amp;#039;re very outdated and seeing them on your team just brings sadness. Things to nerf - KaiSa&amp;#039;s Swarm of Missiles (Q), Ezreal&amp;#039;s Mystic Shot (Q), Xayahs R Feather Count needs reduced, Jhin&amp;#039;s Passive Damage, and Draven&amp;#039;s Q damage by like 10%. \n> \n> 4. Nerf Grasp. There is 0 reason I should take Grasp on Jayce and still be able to deal more damage with Grasp than any other keystone on him, while also getting the heal from Grasp and the bonus max health. \n> \n> 5. Nerf Infernals damage down by 3-4%. Infernals are way too big in this game. If the enemy gets 1 infernal, then youre already gonna be down 3k gold late game. Because 8% damage/ap is given. Lets say you have a 441 ad top, 412 ap jg, 873 ap mid, 537 adc, 192 ap support. Add 8% to each of those. Top laner gets 35 bonus ad. Jungler gets 33 ap. Mid gets 70 ap. Adc gets 43 ad. And support gets 15 ap. 1 AD = 35 gold (long sword = 10 ad = 350 gold / 10 = 35 gold per ad) So 35 + 43 ad x 35 = 2,730 gold in items. Ap = 21.75 gold per AP stat (Amplify = 20 AP = 435 gold / 20 = 21.75). So 33 + 70 + 15 x 21.75 = 2,566 gold in items. Add them both up and thats 5296 gold in items just off one drake. Get all three infernals and thats 15,888 gold in items late game. Its just unfair and lame that one objective in the game is worth that much gold.\n> \n> 6. Revert Teleport back to normal. Ever since this change, top laners have been having hardly any impact on bot lane. Because by the time we tp in, the enemy is already backed off. The only way they dont back off is if they got a gank from their jungler or if theyre kill bot lane. Now top laners can pretty much only take teleport to tp back to lane, because tping bot is almost pointless now. \n> \n> 7. Revert Ignite. I dont know why they buffed this in the first place. &amp;quot;Hey theres too much damage in this game, we should buff ignites true damage!&amp;quot;. I dont like seeing bot lanes take ignite every game now. Exhaust is there to counter adcs, and when they dont take it, it puts people who are trying to carry in a hard spot. Because trying to kill someone who has high damage without exhaust is rough.\n> \n> 8. Tank items. Tanks arent even tanky when they get Frozen Heart, Ice Gauntlet, Gargoyle, etc. The new tanks are champions that build Health and Damage. So people that build Black Cleaver, Trinity Force, Titanic Hydra, Abyssal Mask, etc, are a lot more tankier than tanks. Which is why almost every player is building Bork now, otherwise they cant kill tanks in this game. I would recommend nerfing health on damage items. Black Cleaver shouldnt be giving 400 health, I mean come on, maybe 250 or 300 but not 400.\n> \n> 9. Lots of Champs are still missing Keystones that fit their play style. As a Jayce, I still have yet to find a rune page or Keystone in general that works with my champion. Some take Electrocute, but its not that good especially against tanks. Most pro Jayce players dont take Electrocute either. Jayce players take Aery which isnt a very good keystone for him. Back then most Jayce players would take fervor or Storm Raiders. Yes we have Conqueror, but it doesnt work on Jayce at all. \n> \n> 10. Tower Damage. I have no clue why Riot decided to get rid of the laser towers. Literally anyone can tower dive you once they get about 30 armor. The tower shoots slow, low damage at you while you tower dive the enemy. This just promotes no outplays for the person being dived and is tilting for people who die under tower watching their tower fail to protect them against puny 30 armor.\n> \n> **_What Is Right_**\n> \n> Dont get me wrong tho, there are some things in this game that are right but people want Riot to change. \n> \n> 1. Gold is fine. Tower gold bonus, New bounty gold, First blood, Cs, Jungle camps, Scuttle, all the gold income in this game is great right now and doesnt need any tweaking. Most people dont like the gold because they think it snowballs people harder, which isnt a bad thing. The bad thing is when you snow ball, and you can still get 1v1d by someone with 2k gold less than you because damage is too high. \n> \n> 2. Lethality. As a Jayce player I love lethality and last season would build 24 lethality as my runes and l would use that one lethality slot in the keystone page in S7 which was 12 lethality i think? Nobody really uses Sudden Impact, and with the removal of Lethality from Runes Riot did buff the lethality on items by 6. Which means I lose  about 18 total lethality from my build. Which is fine because it seems about balanced now. Back then you could one shot people with lots of lethality, but now it feels a bit more balanced.\n> \n> 3. Wards. New warding cooldowns and time active is pretty good. Lets top laners survive lane a bit easier without having to worry about a gank every 20 seconds.\n> \n> 4. Rift. Rift is supposed to get you a tower pretty much 100% if you use it right. Its a good objective to get and its not too overpowered like the Infernal. It takes longer to do, making it risky to get. \n> \n> Thats about all I can say for this game right now. Its in a pretty bad state, I just dont know why Riot isnt doing anything about this damage in the game. People have been complaining about it since Pre-Season started and nothing changes. Its like they nerf damage, then give the person they nerfed the damage to a buff to a different part of their damage, making them do the same damage as before. Highly doubt a Rioter would respond to this, most Rioters like to respond to Meme&amp;#039;s n Games posts. Just bums me out, I used to be so excited to get in a game for League, and now its like I open the game and just feels like a chore to play.\n\nYou missed out Mages who are currently unable to contend. Look at the number of mages being played now compared to last season alone and you'll see they are barely seen anymore. It's always assassins/yasuo midlane.\nThey need to revert/rework Malzahar, fix Lissandra (her entire kit needs a buff and she needs a new passive), and basically allow those mages that used to counter assassins to do so again. Currently the only answer to them is play a similar snowball champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIayton","date":"2018-06-01T05:16:44.203+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a previous diamond struggling in silver / gold elo this season, I concur. It's almost impossible to solo carry a game, your impact as a single player is mitigated too much and you can always just get goon squaded and killed by their high base damages now, armor feels like it does nothing as well. \n\nBut somehow if you have a turbo feeder on your team, it can drag the rest of the team down with him. It's like reverse carrying is possible but you can't positively influence a game nearly enough to crank out wins solo like you used to. As you said, it feels like it's down to team RNG more than skill this season, which makes the experience pretty frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheCodeisCupCake","date":"2018-06-01T00:21:58.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Holy shit someone else thinks ignites buff was un-neccesary","replies":[]},{"poster":"NorthernRedStar","date":"2018-05-31T16:23:05.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is soooo true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SUBLIMEgianTT","date":"2018-05-31T16:01:10.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same smurfing from plat and i'm hardstuck silver 2 , like wtf ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"D4M2X0","date":"2018-05-31T15:57:33.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"agreed, lets buff jayce teemo kennen gnar panth and nerf dorans shield. they also need to buff caitlyn karma and janna.\n\npoke champs should never be meta cause they make people want to quit, infact when i see its a jayce/gnar/teemo meta im forced to change role until riot fuckin nerf it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PapaGreg21","date":"2018-05-31T14:19:26.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"This is allowing junglers to gank nonstop with full health.\"\n\nI laughed at this.
