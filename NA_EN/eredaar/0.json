I honest to god don't think anything that I said was really toxic in the slightest, so I'm assuming I got reported simply for the amount that I said. I'll freely admit that I'm someone who can get drawn into arguments if people are saying shit and that's what happened here. I just wasn't aware that it was considered a punishable offense by riot simply to talk to much. If it is, well, fair enough I guess. I wouldn't necessarily agree with that policy, but it's their company. My main questions to y'all are: Do you think it was something besides the volume? If not, do y'all know where it specifies that volume is something you can be punished for? And third, is there any way if I can at least see if some of the other people got punished lol. I've added annotations to help provide context that I guess you'll have to take my word on being truthful but that's the best I can do. This was norms btw, so I wasn't taking it overly seriously. \n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nEredaar: rip wrong runes\nEredaar: same\nEredaar: rip I'm wearing the wrong body\nEredaar: sir this is a wendys -- This &amp; above was just in response to multiple memeing off of the wrong runes comment. \nEredaar: I thought veig was going mid when I picked syndra -_-\nEredaar: I hate you for picking cho :(\nEredaar: I know and I hate you for it lol\nEredaar: I just have negative kill potential\nEredaar: u scale -- This and above when I realized Cho was my lane opponent and not Veig. Granted I said I hate him, but I meant it (and I feel it came across) in a fairly joking manner. \nEredaar: that was free plates for u ashe lol -- pinged bot lane to help w/ after a won fight in river\nEredaar: what exactly was I supposed to do there\nEredaar: lol  \nEredaar: run as fast as I could? -- coming back from respawn, got spam pinged for not getting there when bot got double killed by cho.\nEredaar: they scale too unfortunately :/\nEredaar: this may be over -- Susan and Cho were both starting to get hella fed. \nEredaar: lovely\nEredaar: yeah it's over\nEredaar: I think it's the 7 kills you had lol -- Cho just straight ran me down and flamed in all chat\nEredaar: 4/1\nEredaar: no clue who 1 was -- Graves asked \"ff?\" in all chat pre-20\nEredaar: and now it's 1/4 for some reason lmfao --- graves asked again at 20. We were down to base turrets. \nEredaar: it's norms, I played a champ I'm not used to into someone who got fed off jungle and sidelane fights\nEredaar: shocker that I lost  \nEredaar: wut\nEredaar: I'm silver lol\nEredaar: which is bad enough to insult, but no need to make shit up\nEredaar: amumu...\nEredaar: you're silver\nEredaar: self-own I guess lol --- Amumu was flaming me for losing lane, calling me bronze for fairly standard itemization, and spam pinging me at this point. \nEredaar: for?\nEredaar: why were u pinging lol\nEredaar: she spam pinged me for getting my combo off perfectly in that fight lol\nEredaar: I'm honestly confused --- Janna spam-pinged me after I got a perfect combo off in a fight, but fed cho killed her anyways. \nEredaar: amumu\nEredaar: you're 3/8\nEredaar: I'm 2/9\nEredaar: stone\nEredaar: glass house \nEredaar: bot fed cho more than me lmao  --- more shittalking from amumu prompted this. For context, bot brought Cho from 2/1 against me to 4/1\nEredaar: wut\nEredaar: amumu\nEredaar: idgaf if you report me\nEredaar: I haven't been toxic\nEredaar: unlike some people --- guess I was wrong, his report did work :p \nEredaar: cool\nEredaar: keep digging that hole\nEredaar: nice\nEredaar: do you need a shovel for this hole you keep digging for your account amumu? --- He was continuing to flame me hard in all chat including calling me a dog and any manner of names.\nEredaar: y'all gonna end anytime soon or just keep wasting everyone's time lmao ---- they were easily 20k+ gold up and were just fcking around\nEredaar: I can't force my team to --- Graves said ff again\nEredaar: riv\nEredaar: do you see their champs and ours?\nEredaar: they can literally end at any point they want --- riven said we still had a chance. \nEredaar: game --- they shortly after aced our team with no losses\nEredaar: for?\nEredaar: for trying to ff when yall were at our nexus lol  --- amumu still talking about reporting me.\n\n\nIdk. Yeah I talked a lot, but none of it was particularly toxic. The game was legitimately over when I said it was, and I didn't keep yelling about it too much.

That's a fairly vague descriptor of \"what'll get (me) punished.\" I can very easily argue that nothing I said or did in chat comes close to any of the qualifies, or I can argue that almost anything falls under them.

The summoner's code is even more vague and is more just a set of maxims to live by to be the ultimate positive teammate than a descriptor of what qualifies as punishable action. So it's pretty absurd to act like Riot is telling me what'll get me punished when their description of it is so vague to include anything.  If I'm just missing somewhere they've more clearly described this than please let me know, because I think the most toxic thing I said all game was \"do you need a shovel for this hole you keep digging for your account amumu?\" And that's certainly not: threatening, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, or racially/ethically objectionable. Which leaves it to fall under possible abusive, \"otherwise objectionable,\" or just generally \"what (they) reasonably bellieve to be offensive to plays.
