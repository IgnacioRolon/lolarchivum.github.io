What are the chances of getting it unbanned. the only programs i use while playing league are curse discord overwolf, and a program to help with me being dyslexic. I feel like plenty of other people use everything but the dyslexic program, so that must be it. Would league remove my ban because of that, or am i just wasting my time. Im not a salty player or a troll ,just a guy wondering. Read and Write Gold 11 is the Dyslexia program i use it helps alot.

The sort of lawyer you want is the same kind of lawyer that takes cases of employer discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. You will actually have a case because this is a form of discrimination against a disabled person on the basis of his or her disability.\n\nIf you cannot afford a lawyer, try contacting the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). They may take your case pro bono as a disabled American. If you are a person of color, you may also contact the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). If you are a person of color, the NAACP may be willing to take a case that the ACLU may not.  There are similar associations for women, Hispanic individuals, LGBT individuals, and other disadvantaged individuals.\n\nConsider this. A privately owned venue for entertainment, such as Yankee Stadium. The New York Yankees sports organization owns Yankee Stadium, and the Steinbrenner brothers own the New York Yankees. The City of New York does not own the New York Yankees or Yankee Stadium, nor does it own any part of the stadium or organization, despite the use of NYPD and FDNY personnel to provide traffic control and security at the stadium. Yankee Stadium is required by law to provide handicapped accessible seating, entrances, exits, access to sales vendors within the stadium, and restroom facilities. If Yankee Stadium closed handicapped ramps at any time the stadium was open for business, the New York Yankees could be sued in court and would be found to be discriminating against disabled individuals on the basis of their disability. The Yankees would \n\nOnly a lawyer could truly tell you if rulings such as that apply to Riot Games. I suspect that there is a threshold of possibility for this sort of case. Since programs such as Curse, Discord and Overwolf are recognized by Riot and whitelisted to prevent false scripting bans, it stands to reason that your dyslexia accomodation can also be whitelisted alongside the aforementioned common programs. In this instance, Riot would be compelled to restore your account and shield you from further action. This would also require Riot to take you to court again if they ever desired to ban you for an unrelated offense, such as toxicity. Retaliation against individuals who have invoked their rights in court is highly illegal, so Riot would be compelled to prove that you were in violation of the Terms of Service if they sought to ban your account after the case for an unrelated reason. \n\nSuch a case could easily spiral into a landmark case before the Supreme Court. If this happens, your name will be scribed in history forever, win or lose.\n\nHowever, in the event that you are lying and have used scripting programs, Riot can countersue you for the cost of their legal fees, plus any believed monetary damages to their brand. This may be in the millions of dollars. Cyber forensics experts can source from your machine and from Riot's server data any and all programs that may have interacted with League of Legends. All of these can be forced to be turned over to the court via a warrant. So, if you're right, and your dyslexia assistance program was the cause, you will be unbanned and likely be rewarded money in addition to your account's restoration. If you're wrong, you could be on the hook for millions of dollars and even possibly go to jail for perjury, falsification of documents, and some other similar charges.","replies":[{"poster":"Randy Teh Sexy","date":"2016-11-09T03:42:04.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have the time or money to cover their court cost, on that note I also have nothing to hide.
