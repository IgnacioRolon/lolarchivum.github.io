He has been for the longest time. \r\n\r\nJax can take on an entire team by himself. He scales absurdly. He has zero mana issues, with extremely low cooldowns. \r\n\r\nHis damage is off the charts. He is extremely tanky. He has ridiculous mobility. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is balanced about this champion? What about him can you even call a \"weakness\"? Of course, there is nothing. He is all benefits with zero drawbacks. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the other team has a Jax, you know that you are going to lose. It is just that simple. Unless the Jax is a first-time player or wants to lose on purpose to troll his allies, there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop him. \r\n\r\nNerf this bull shit and let the game be played. Games should not be won at the champion select screen.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-05-23T03:38:02.033+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me guess.

I got \"rekt\" by every single Jax I have played, and usually, there is one in at least every second game since everyone knows he is a free win.

No sweat. Good luck to my jungler trying to gank him.

I agree, he can beat a whole 4 players, ive seen it in multiple games. There are bad and good jaxes the good can beat 4 out have 5. He can jump and be invincible, stun you, silence. Hes annoying. Hes practically a slow fat fizz. I dont find him to be OP but i think his stun should be removed.{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}]}
