The general lack of magic damage in the jungle, and the jungler's low overall vulnerability to magic damage at the start of the game (this doesn't always apply if you're afraid of getting counterjungled by an AP champion) mean you will get more out of those glyphs than flat MR by the time it really matters. On occasion, if you're playing against an AD laner, or a lane with very little magic damage, scaling magic resistance will also provide a bigger bonus by the time teamfights happen without hindering your survival early on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rootworth","date":"2015-04-05T17:27:16.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean Magic Resist per Level Glyphs?\n\nI run those on supports; and maybe top lane if I'm going against an AD top laner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-04-05T04:44:22.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much.\n\nFlat armor seals, Flat/Scaling MR glyphs, ad marks/ap pen marks, AD Quints/AP Quints.

You can absolutely run AD instead of Armor Pen, and you can change up the Quints as you desire (movespeed is just an \"at least useful\" quint regardless; you could for instance put ASPD quints on the first or CDR quints on the second).\n\nI still use these pages as my general 'go to' if I don't have reason to another.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you play Dominion or ARAM as your main modes, you should *always* focus on scaling runes instead of flat ones.  Flat I believe are generally stronger pre 6-9 (it depends on exactly which), but in those settings you're already starting two full levels ahead and accelerating fairly quickly beyond that point.\n\nFinal thing: I'm not sure if people still do it much, but if you feel like it, any AD-oriented champ page can slap just a single Crit Chance red on, ensuring you always have *a* chance to crit.  Even if it's unlikely to happen, that crit chance going off in a situation where you're trading damage will likely do more for you than any of your other runes could.","replies":[{"poster":"DeltaDmann","date":"2015-04-17T17:46:08.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help.
