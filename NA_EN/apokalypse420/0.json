I updated this morning, now every time I try to login I get the above error window. I've tried a full reinstall, ran hextech repair tool, nothing else on my system changed since last night when everything was working fine. I tried both ways running legacy client by default and tried to upgrade to beta client, both ways on clean installs of LoL client. {{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nFull error window text is: \r\n\r\nLeague client error.

There may be another issue that the updated client can't define, so I'm curious if any other errors show up on the legacy client.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know how things work out through there.","replies":[]}]}
