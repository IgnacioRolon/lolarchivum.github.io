I&#039;ve sent a report to riot support and they said they couldn&#039;t help me or get in contact with the design team. If anyone knows a person to contact that may have the ability to revert the changes I would be interested in having that info. Also what does everyone else think of riot changing old skins? Is it fair to the people who bought the original?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-05-13T17:17:15.234+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey D A V I 5 - \n\nWe do update skins and champions as they get older.
