This issue is likely a security setting somewhere within your OS or antivirus that's just blocking your game files from scanning and being accessed, so it's not able to launch.  You'll want to go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to restore that access and get through the update.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]},{"poster":"VodkaCrotch","date":"2017-05-12T14:55:23.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I recommend for this is to go into your Task Manager.. Ctrl+Shift+Esc. Look for everything that has league in it, league client, leage rendered, all that and end those. Make sure none of them are still up. Now right click the client and open as an administrator. Let it open up, and give it a bit time to finish updates and downloading game. This happened to me. Downloading without it saying it was. Try again in about 20 min to open the game. Let us know if this works.","replies":[]}]}
