At first, it was happening after I locked in a ban, but now I freeze up at any point. The worst part about this is that the client mockingly allows me to access chat in real-time... But changing masteries, choosing a ban, locking in a champion, picking a summoner spell, ect. is impossible. The timer for who is picking and who is not also disappears, making it so I am suspended in this never-ending loading cycle. At one point, I did get an error saying \"Could not change masteries.\" That was the first and only error I received throughout this ordeal. \r\n\r\nI've received penalties for this despite the fact that I did not \"dodge\" on my own free will. This is very frustrating, considering I waited out all 5-minute wait times only to be discouraged into facing this problem all over again. I do not know if it is on the client's end, or my own end. I did a \"full repair\" after this issue happened for the SECOND time tonight, but alas, the repair did nothing. As it is, my account reads \"in Champ Select\" as I am waiting in the home screen while writing this post.\r\n\r\n**Post-Game**\r\n\r\nThis has only happened once so far, but I am still terrified of it happening again, so I will do my best to explain what happened.\r\n\r\nI loaded into solo-queue in hopes of playing a game while waiting for friends to get on. Unlike how my last few game attempts have been, I did NOT freeze in champ select and was able to mess with masteries, spells, ect. The game started up, and we were in loading screen. Everything seemed fine. My ping was at 70-80 (the norm for me), everyone was 100% with the exception of me and an enemy summoner. \r\n\r\nOut of no where, I got a notification that my client had DC'ed from the internet and that I should \"try to reconnect.\" I, of course, attempted to reconnect. No luck. I didn't even get to the loading screen before the same error showed up again. I closed the client completely, re-logged on, tried again. Same issue. This happened 3 or 4 times in a row before I said screw it. I went to another computer and tried to connect from that. Despite that computer having a different internet connection and being a different power, THAT computer got the same error. \r\n\r\nBy that point, I was on the verge of giving up and accepting that my team was going to remake. However, because I am particularly stubborn about squeezing in a good league of legends match in the middle of the evening, I tried again. Finally, the game showed me that I had connected to loading screen, and I watched myself climb to 100% in seconds. Pretty soon, I was in the game. Only 30 seconds had passed, so I was able to get a leash and carry out my masterful Shen jungle.\r\n\r\n**In-Game**\r\n\r\nThis problem has been dragged out for about a week now, and I still am not sure if it is my internal computer or the client. Again, I will do my best to highlight everything that has happened.\r\n\r\nRecently, I have been having out of the ordinary lag. Now, hear me out. When I am in game...\r\n1. My FPS is at a constant 30. It never drops or rises (particularly because I have it locked). This is NORMAL for me.\r\n2. My MS is at a solid 70-80, sometimes reaching 90. Again, this is normal for me.\r\n3. All other applications (Discord, Chrome, ect.) work in the background without lagging out or slowing down. Usually I only have Discord open, and even then, I have started to use it on my cellphone instead of on my laptop. \r\n\r\nAll of these factors are the \"norm\" for me and I have been able to play this game for several months without a problem. However, recently, I have started having the strangest lag. My champion will slide across the screen, health and mana bars freeze up, and I often can't see ANYTHING moving! During all of this, my FPS and MS stay the way they always are, never dropping or changing, yet I am getting lag that seems as bad as 600-2000+ (and yes, I have seen that lag occur before). \r\n\r\nWhat makes this worse is that I get \"attempting to reconnect\" at my 70 ms and 30 fps. Recently had a random teammate who flamed me for this, but I swear to god, I was not lying to them. I get this constantly now, where I will be either \"lagging\" as explained above or having a normal game. I now expect to see \"attempting to reconnect\" at least once every game.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with this strange lagging problem, I often can't tell if I've backed, if an item I attempted to purchase made it into my inventory, if a ward I placed is even where I placed it, ect. It's the worst feeling, not knowing what's going on in the game even though you aren't lagging according to the numbers on your screen.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI have re-started my wifi router. I have updated all of my NVIDA driver(s) to the latest installment. I have updated Windows, checked for viruses, cleared files, ect. I have even started to play and keep all of the devices throughout the house off so the only device using the internet is my laptop while I play League. Unfortunately, none of these actions have done much for me. \r\n\r\nI haven't had any problems with the game/client up until this point in time. I'm very frustrated. League of Legends is a game I play every day because it is how I connect to my close friends and wind down from real life stress. However, it looks like the game is doing everything it can to NOT let me play. I really don't want to give up a game I put ~$800 into just because the client is suddenly lagging out and giving me errors that I can't seem to solve. \r\n\r\nI'm a pretty patient woman, but any help as fast as possible would be loved right now. If more information is needed to fully access these problems, I will do my best to give more info so the problems can be fixed. Of course, if anyone else is having these same issues, I'd love to hear what's going on for you guys... After all, sharing problems is always pretty fun, right?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help someone can give me. Really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T15:45:13.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've gone through a lot, and it sucks that it's been resulting in these penalties and getting left behind in your games.  :(  It sounds to me like this might be stemming from an overall problem with your connection.  You mention restarting your wifi router, so I'm considered that your connection to the game server is degrading as a result of going wireless.  Have you tried using a wired connection to troubleshoot?  \n\nA reinstall wouldn't really solve this as the issue appears to be network related, and not game files.\n\nMy recommendation here would be start going over every single step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide.  This will help rule out possibilities and clear up whatever is causing you to disconnect like this.  Test it out in a custom game though, to be safe.  I hope that can help!","replies":[{"poster":"Sett Can Maul Me","date":"2017-06-13T16:44:58.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not tried using a wired connection at all, but I can attempt that sometime today to see if that will fix anything. \n\nI'll be sure to go through every step possible.

I'll be sure to post back on this thread if one of those options ends up being what I need.","replies":[{"poster":"Sett Can Maul Me","date":"2017-06-13T18:13:39.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went through the connection issues guide, and decided to opt for the firewall settings. However, after allowing what the article said to, my client can't open. Every time I try to, admin or not, the app opens up in a black box. The game is now actually untouchable. I tried un-doing the settings I made, but no luck, same black box... I'm going to try un-installing and re-downloading the client. I have a rather sinking feeling something in my computer is messing around with League's connection, and that it's not the WiFi.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T18:27:03.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's no bueno, this black screen can happen if your connection is failing to download assets.
