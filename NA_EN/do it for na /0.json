These are usually called Ghost Games, and may lock up your client for the next 2 hours.  \n\nLet me know if you are still experiencing any issues after this!","replies":[{"poster":"Do It For NA ","date":"2016-05-04T00:14:04.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok so i restarted my computer, but the same issue persists. I open up league of legends, sign in, the page where it says \" you have left a game in progress, please reconnect\" pops up. I click the button and the that page disappears to the background so I just click that league client/chat page so the page with the reconnect button pops up again, press it again, but the loading screen never opens.\nI don't think the problem is the game never started, because no one dodged/the champion select went fine. It's just that once the champion select closed as it usually does when the loading screen is supposed to pop, the loading screen just never popped up\n\nI hope I don't get low priority queue for this, because last week I had to leave a game because of severe 4k ping for some reason. sigh i really wanted to play zed and i cant even load into the game...","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-04T01:10:05.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that the game should have ended by now, I wanted to follow up to see if you are still stuck on this screen, or whether this match appeared in your Match History and we'll have to do some further digging with regard to troubleshooting so it doesn't happen again.\n\nReply back when you can!","replies":[{"poster":"Do It For NA ","date":"2016-05-04T01:36:38.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for responding, yeah the game ended and I went into a custom game to see if the loading screen would pop this time and it did, but about 1 minute into game I got a bug splat.  The game did show up in my match history, my team won so I was pretty happy for them and added all of them, apologizing for this issue and  they were pretty nice about it, they won somehow :p\n\nAnyway so I got the loading screen and loaded into the custom game and all, but my  fps would go from 45 to 60 to 53 and just constantly change like that over and over, and I even got a bugsplat around 1 min in. So i don't know if this is related to my earlier issue, or just a separate problem on its own. Thanks for the quick responses btw\n\nEdit: Just got into a normal game, EXPERIENCING RANDOM 4K-7K PING SPIKES wtf and then it goes to 80 randomly but im lagging VERY hard, ping spikes to 4k and sht and it sucks","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-04T23:07:40.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting a BugSplat error is actually a very specific error and points to an issue with your hardware/software interaction.  Unfortunately, BugSplat is a very broad error message and it's impossible for me to tell where the exact issue is.  Because of this, make sure to complete all of the steps in our [BugSplat Article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).
