Even if the humor is directed at someone you know, it can still negatively impact another player's game.\n\nYou could be joking with your friend and using the N-word. Could call each other it, and sure it's fine with you two because you both know it is a joke. But another person won't know that and they could be upset and hurt by your words. It doesn't matter if they aren't directed at that other player, because they can still see them and it still affects them.\n\nMy suggestion: keep this sort of humor in your private discord chat. It's fine to trash talk with friends if everybody involved is okay with it. When you bring it into the game's chat with others who are not aware of the satire of your humor, they could take it seriously and it could ruin their experience.","replies":[{"poster":"DaNinad","date":"2017-08-02T18:48:51.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah the Miss Fortune on my team(not the one I was calling op) was saying to stop typing and start playing, even though i was 17/5 or somewhere around there.
