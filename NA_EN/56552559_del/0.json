I had a lobby last night that me and my friends had 1 random and that random was first pick and banning. I called Top and my friends called their respective roles. The guy getting first pick said NOTHING until i asked him not to ban Gangplank at which point he said &quot;sorry but im top&quot;. Not only did he take my lane away but he also picked the champ that I was going to pick. I then said &quot;this is why i dont like draft&quot; to which he said &quot;then dont play draft&quot;. So as I was supposed to pick i told the guy &quot;by then, next time dont be a dick just because you have first pick&quot;, and I dodged.\r\n\r\nNormally in those situations I dont care IF the first pick player in question says something right off the bat, but the fact that he waited until everyone said their role and AFTER I asked him not to ban a certain champ, just told me he was doing that to be a dick and I was not going to play in a match where the guy was going to troll me on purpose just because he had first pick.\r\n\r\nThis is why I would like the ability to choose which role you want to play in ranked or normal and have the computer find you a team like with TB, but then have you guy go into the draft like a normal draft game.","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-10-29T17:20:28.130+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're working on it...","replies":[{"poster":"56552559_DEL","date":"2015-10-29T17:21:44.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"They are working on something like it but im actually afraid of what they are doing because it never turns out like people hope despite suggestions.

Personally I've got mixed feelings about it. You only ever will have to play two roles, but it doesn't sound like they are going to separate the ladder by role, so it may lead to certain roles being heavily favored if they are perceived as being more influential in climbing. I think only having to know 2 roles instead of at least 3 or 4 in order to be able to play ranked is kind of \"meh.\" It means you can be high rank in theory and have no idea how to play 3 out of 5 of the roles. That's over half the game that rito is just saying \"nope, you don't need to know anything about that, your rank skill can be represented by 40% of this game.\"  If they had a separate ladder I think it would be one of the coolest things they've ever done, que for top/support or whatever and be like \"I'm top X percent of support players, but only top Y percent of top players.\" To have your ranking vs people who main the same role would be so cool, but they won't do it bc it would be a lot more work I'm sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korillo","date":"2015-10-29T18:22:21.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"20 min ranked queues yes plz I always wanted to feel like a challenger","replies":[{"poster":"T RexHasTinyArms","date":"2015-10-29T21:08:31.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":D learn's to play the less popular roles, ques instantly and climbs easily when random players start playing those roles bc they're sick of the wait time for mid.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Drunk√®n Master","date":"2015-10-29T17:43:41.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the reason they may end up making ranked team builder type queue.

Personally I'd just rather have separate ladders for the two. If you never want to play regular ranked you never have to, but there would still be a distinction between people who could reach a certain rank having to play more than 2 roles, vs someone who just learns one or two roles really well and can't really play more than 20-40% of the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bazerald","date":"2015-10-29T17:34:16.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would reduce the fruitloops screaming \"TOP OR FEED\" in ranked, but I feel like it could create other problems like really long queue times.

He was disrespectful in how he did it. I dont care if he had first pick or not, if other people called roles then that should be respected but he didnt do that.\n\nLike i said, i wouldnt have had a problem with it had he said something after we called roles, but he waited til after we called roles, after i asked for him not to ban gp AND after all the bans were done. He had plenty of time to say that he wanted to go top and i more than likely would have said ok and been fine with that. But the fact that he not only waited after all that but he also picked the champ that I wanted to play just told me he was doing it to troll.\n\nIn those situations, im sorry but i have to completely disagree with you. Just because people have always been asses when it comes to this doesnt mean it should always be like that.\n\nAnd the reason i talked about having the TB element in the ranked draft is because i want to go ranked but i wont do it until this next season when they provide us with a less stressful way of getting the roles we want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2015-10-30T16:22:01.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasnt trying to disagree with you in any way. Like i said, he was a dick in the way he went about it. He should've said something when everyone else did. And as far as you waiting for a ranked team builder to get into ranked.....I rarely have the issue of not getting a role when i ask for it. I always say \"adc/jung pref pls\" at the start of every ranked game and about 90%--95% of the time i get one of those 2 roles. Thats the thing about ranked...you need to be atleast sufficient in each role to play in it, for reasons just like this. If you dont get the role you would like, you have to be able to do other things. Idk if i agree with the idea of ranked team builder cuz then ppl can just play their 1 champion in their 1 role to climb. Theyll never learn how to effectively play other roles and really learn the game. Its one thing to learn adc in league of legends, its another to learn how to play all roles atleast decently. It helps you to understand the game better and be a better player. Also they would need to have 2 seperate ranked queue's cuz team builder teams cant play against draft pick teams. Idk how they would go about making that work or if its even feasible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
