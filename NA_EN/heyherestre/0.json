Imagine being a minority and have your race depicted as the bad guys and then another minority group is put in as the heroes and the company that made the game says the game is filled with diversity.\n\nOk, either you're playing dumb or you aren't aware of the bot wars on twitter. Some white supremacist groups were making fake accounts and pretending to be minorities and then going into threads discussing race and racism and acting like jerks, just to make people think that that minority were all jerks. Then someone got wise to it and made a bot to find and expose those impersonators and then the white supremacists made their own bots to track and stop such efforts. It was a whole mess and it's probably still ongoing.\n\nI don't think that being middle eastern makes one hot headed. Being hot-headed is simply common among humans, especially those who happen to be young-ish and/or male (not assuming anything, just making a point). I have looked at it from your perspective, like I said before you have every right to be upset. But you've got to learn how to funnel that anger into being productive.

Its undeniable that white people are not a minority in America. being a minority doesn't completely depend on numbers but also systemic power. Here's an analogy, 20 people with boxing gloves are still going to lose against 5 people with guns.\n\n Secondly i'm sorry that you aren't being represented, and that must be frustrating but you are a white male coming into a thread of a black male celebrating having more diversity in media and telling me that it representation doesn't matter.
