What now?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey guys :) So after a lot of hard work, practice and self-tilt prevention, I blasted my way out of bronze today. Not looking for upvotes or congrats, however I am super excited about it! But what I am looking for is advice. Higher tier silver/gold players, what would you guys say would be good to focus on to climb through silver? I played a ranked match once I hit silver and it seemed almost identical to my bronze matches (not that I expected a night and day difference). So without rambling on, I guess I am just looking for general pointers, advice, and your observations on your climb through silver and beyond. Hopefully it&#039;s onward to gold from here!","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-06-11T04:25:16.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um,\n\nsilvers tend to be decent in lane, ok farm (can still improve though) and harass but some real shit wave management, map awareness and are shit in ability to comeback or stay even in a losing lane.  Once lane is over then tend to group around mid, most of the time they can't rotate for shit and tend to be easily distracted by any objective (red/blue big waves) over more limited objectives (dragon/baron respawn).\n\nAlso their warding is usually shit, buy a pink at least every back.  Idc if you already have one, you can carry up to three (it will serve as a reminder to use it)\n\nSlowly Fix any of these above in any order you deem fit and you will climb further.  Focus on something every game, looking at minimap, farm, remembering enemy sums, ulti cds, basic cds eventually, getting dragons, keeping wards up, buying pinks etc.\n\nAlso buy health and defense when behind and focus on a small pool of champs so you eventually learn most every matchup.\n\nJust my two cents, there is probably lots more but those are all general enough.","replies":[]}]}
