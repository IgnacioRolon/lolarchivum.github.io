Ever since I bought the Team Fire icon and have had it up as my icon every time I kill an enemy there is a burst of fire. Now that isn&#039;t what I want to bring to light, because I know that&#039;s supposed to happen. However I don&#039;t think this part is: while the death timer is ticking for the enemy I killed for some reason a still image appears a few seconds after at the spot I killed them. And everyone else can see it too. It hasn&#039;t happened randomly, it happens every time the finisher goes off.\r\nI&#039;m not sure if it happens with the Team Ice icon or not since I only bought the Fire icon.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-01T22:45:17.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ChaosBlaze, \n\nIs [this](https://youtu.be/6LcmzqSChvY?t=19s) what you're seeing?","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosBlaze","date":"2015-12-02T17:27:39.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the finishers have been disabled so I hope it appears the bug I was talking about is being fixed.
