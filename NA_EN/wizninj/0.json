When in champion select, I chose one of my rune pages but in game, I get the stats of one other rune page.  So far this has only happened with choosing one specific rune page which is always switched with another one specific rune page in game.  Just those two.  I have checked their stats pre-game, in champion select, in-game, and on websites like lolnexus, so I am certain that the in-game stats are from the wrong page.  This is both on the legacy and new client.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-03T21:07:09.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm.....so it sounds like those two rune pages are, for some reason, always swapped with each other.
