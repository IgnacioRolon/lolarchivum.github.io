For example, I'll be standing still and then press on the ground.  I'll see the green arrow work, but my movement won't go through.  Sometimes I will finally walk after 1-3 seconds and sometimes it won't happen at all.  Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-21T05:21:02.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a common symptom of *Packet Loss*.
