About 15 minutes in, we got 4-man ganked again, and we got a 3 for 0 trade, and then 30 seconds later my PC crashed. I rebooted my PC and rejoined the game to be told that after I dc'd the game started to go downhill, my jungler {{champion:5}} and mid laner {{champion:45}}  had fed the enemy mid laner {{champion:203}} , so I buckled up and did my best to help my team from that point on.\n\nWe ended up winning, and despite being afk for 10 minutes I outdamaged both the enemy adc and support (we had completely shut them down), and despite this, after the victory, I got hit with a \"leaver\" and lost LP, while the 3/8 mid and 2/8 jungler both got a victory and won LP.\n\nMy ending score was 3/4/14, with a kill participating of about 50%, I contributed as much as I could to my team, had the highest vision score of everyone but the enemy support, most wards placed, did a decent amount of healing, and even did a decent amount of damage to turrets and objectives (for a Janna). \n\nhttps://gyazo.com/397d41d826ad6e197031294aaef32689 (a screenshot of the op.gg with only my score, so I dont post anyone elses' names)\n\nThe problem being, I don't believe it's very fair to punish me for reconnecting and doing my best and helping my team win, and it discourages to gain no rewards and still be penalized for it. \"If I'm going to be penalized anyway, why should I try to help my team win or reconnect in the first place\".\n\nWhile I was talking to a Live Chat member, they stated that this was to avoid people griefing, just to join at the last second and gain their LP even if their team won without them, which is understandable. So why not run a contribution score, even op.gg has their own scoring mechanism for how well a player did, so why doesn't Riot Games themselves create a scoring system to see whether a player contributed after re-joining. Even if you didnt gain the full amount of LP you should have for the game, it would reward you for showing back up to help your team, playing well, and being un-tilted by the DC in the first place. This could even help catch people who are griefing without \"actually\" going afk, you've seen them, afk farmers that refuse to help the team but they aren't punished for going afk because they never technically did. Even running in a circle every 10 seconds just so you can grief without being caught by the automatic bot.\n\nThat's just an example for something they COULD implement, I just believe that you should at least partially be rewarded for showing back up and doing your best to gain a win for your team after a computer crash/software crash/bugsplit error etc.\n\nThank you for hearing me out, and I apologize for the wall of text, I just feel like something should be done about this. If you have any ideas yourself about what they could do, I'd be happy to hear about them.\n\nEDIT: okay so some people have taken the whole \"reward\" thing wrong so I'm going to try to make that clearer.\nBy reward, I mean anything, not a bonus. If you show up late to work you are still \"rewarded\" for the work you actually did, but you aren't given a bonus at the end of the day.\nBy \"reward\" I mean to gain maybe even 50% of the LP you should have if you won normally, but not 50% extra. As it is now if you re-join and carry your team you still get -15 LP just for taking the \"loss\" despite winning, where what Im saying is \"if you were supposed to make 20 LP that game, make 10 instead, for at least coming back and trying\".\n\nI apologize for any misunderstandings from my original post.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-04-03T04:22:31.059+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too easy to abuse for trolls and leavers.

Not 30-40, not a \"bonus reward\", but not being penalized completely (-15 LP) for winning your team a game. I do apologize for the misunderstanding.\n\nBecause as I have said, you can show up and go 30/0/15 and win your team the entire game, but still get treated to an LP LOSS and 0 XP at all, because it counts the game as a loss in your favor","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-04-03T22:39:01.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah the contribution doesnt have to be 100% accurate.
