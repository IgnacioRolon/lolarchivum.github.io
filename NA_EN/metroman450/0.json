The reason why you see the popular champs get skins is because they are played a lot and if riot makes skins for popular champs then they will get more money. If kai'sa became the least popular champ and kalista became popular then riot would make more more skins for kalista. Stop blaming riot if that champ does not get that skin. Its the players who decide by playing a champ a lot. Hopefully this gets through your  uneducated brains.","replies":[]}
