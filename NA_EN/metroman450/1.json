He has a fcking shield which scales with ap. His Q and E takes more than half your health in the early game. His ult is literally a \"oh I messed up riot save me\". So are we gonna ignore the fact that he has a 13% pickrate which is actually huge and a 53% win rate which clearly indicates he's broken. So is riot gonna be nerfing him any time soon? I'm actually tired of him dominating every game tbh. He's too strong and needs tuning down. I really hate Ekko.","replies":[]}
