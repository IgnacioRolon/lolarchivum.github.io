It wouldn&#039;t change the mechanics of the item at all, just the way that this one champ abuses them, he is able to pump out way too much damage without room to do anything but back off and accept the fine screwing you get on the way out, really lame mechanic abuse, it is not even a demanding play, I don&#039;t understand why it is kept in.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-01-18T14:06:55.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could learn to counterplay... don't ask for a nerf just because you want to be lazy about thinking of ways to outplay. (aka destroy his turrents..not hard)","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Morde","date":"2016-01-18T14:41:31.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time I see Heimerdingers picked, I just pick Morgana and wreck him. Once you have rank 3 or so W, one spell kills his turrets while farming the caster minions too. This forces Heimerdingers to level something other than turrets or be useless to his team, which forces him to be even more useless in lane. It's a never ending cycle that ruins Heimerdinger to the point where he's almost guaranteed to be put on tilt and reported by his team.\n\nI mean, he's already practically trash for team fighting since he often robs his team of an engage, peel, or frontliner.

As far as the build goes: META. When something's the best even in diamond+ why mess with it? Also what does everyone midlane build? Fuck tons of damage heim's no different. \n\nTo more directly answer your question: Does Yorick's Ghouls Zhonya with him? No. Do your Lane minions Zhonya with you? No. Does the Rift monster from the Portal item Zhonya with its user? No. If they did that would be dumb. Same for the turrets. They're all separate. Also Kindred's wolf will attack even while lamb is zhonya'd if your within their w and you can't even target him to make him stop. Also every poison damage ever from the 5 champs that do that. And Illoai's Tentacles for a vessel. Also Ignite the Summoner spell. Damn I just keep thinking of other DOTs that if they stopped when you Zhonya'd there would be so many people bitching.\n\nIn closing as others have said: get good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Indorfin","date":"2016-01-18T11:50:36.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they all do the same play, you shouldn't keep falling for it. If you die because you didn't account for Zhonya's, you deserve to die, no matter how sure you felt that you had the kill.","replies":[]}]}
