But if one is smart, the proper way to play around them is click Yasuo to auto him, which procs the shield. Wait out the shield (which lasts for one second), and bait out the wall, which has an insanely long cooldown. It takes a bit for yasuo to regain his passive, and with his long cooldown on his w, the yasuo dash is his only other option to avoid getting ridiculously poked down in lane.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"J4 Ulted Mexico","date":"2016-07-22T22:37:18.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There might be some plans to nerf it, idk about pans though ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-07-23T01:14:10.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You won't see any changes to his E: his entire kit is designed around his E being exactly the way it is.
