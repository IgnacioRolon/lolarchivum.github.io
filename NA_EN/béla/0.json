Nothing. No drops, nothing. Straight up 30+ games with nothing. Then the next day I log in and I am happy to see that Riot was kind enough to give me 4 key shards for being sportsmanlike. I was pretty hyped. Then I go to the loot section to see that it's disabled. So I assumed that the 4 shards are to make up for that disturbance. But when its up again my shards are gone. Anyone else have this happen to them?","replies":[{"poster":"Navillus","date":"2017-08-06T18:43:58.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know that there was some hextec crafting buggs, so maybe try a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Béla","date":"2017-08-06T19:48:40.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I did that, a riot support member gave me back the shards.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-06T20:20:30.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is a biiiiit of a late reply, but it sounds like everything got sorted out in that ticket.
