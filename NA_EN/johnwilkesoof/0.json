When i targeted a team member with nami's heal, it did drastically less healing than it says its supposed to. No matter the situation, I dry cast it on my 100ish health sivir outside of a fight, making sure she wasnt struck with the weakened healing debuff and it still came out the same. However, if i cast it on a team memeber and it bounced to an enemy and then back to another team mate it did the full amount on the returned heal but not the initial. Or if i just dry cast it on an enemy and had it bounce back it healed for the proper amount. I havent played nami in 5s for some time, im about to go do it to test if its the same there, or if its just in Arams. regardless I think this is a bug, not a major one but a bug none the less.","replies":[{"poster":"Mandaari","date":"2015-02-08T23:27:47.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Healing others in ARAM is reduced by 50%.\n\nTry playing Sona.

See if it does the full healing to both you and the second target. Then start the heal on someone else so that both heals hit someone else. I'm guessing they'll either both be reduced, or only the first will be reduced. Then start the heal on someone else so that the second heal hits you. I'm guessing it'll heal you both for the reduced amount.\n\nEdit: I'm working off the hunch that the healing reduction is only applied if the initial target is not herself. If it is herself then it would do the full healing to everyone.","replies":[]}]}]}
