In this case, it looks like nobody in your team participated in the match so everyone on your team was marked as a leaver.  The system in that case applied a loss for the team.  I'm not sure that we can do anything about this because we have no way to adjust game stats or LP without breaking the system.  The system is also clear that anyone not participating would have been marked as a leaver.  The best preventative measure would have been for the team to continue playing while waiting to remake.\n\nI think this is an interesting case, though, and worth bringing up to our devs as /remake feedback.  I'll share this interesting match, but you may want to post about it on [gameplay ](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance)boards as well.  Sorry about that.  :(","replies":[]}]}
