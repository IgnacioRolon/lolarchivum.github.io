Odds are if you have two competent players on your team you increase your chances of winning.  Duo lane is good, but having a jungle mid duo will typically get you higher as you can roam mid to snow ball / save lanes and jungle can control the pace of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raise Dongrs","date":"2015-01-05T17:29:44.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Raise Dongrs","date":"2015-01-05T17:41:42.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"~~Git Gud~~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-01-06T22:57:25.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF you are winning your lane simply means you need to help the players that are struggling. If you are playing perfectly YOU would win games and climb you obviously are not, by that extension saying my team is losing me games is bullshit.

You probably frequently win lane by out CSing your opponent, but rarely snowball into big kill totals.\n\nI suspect a lot of your losses involve you winning lane marginally, and then either (1) one of your other laners feeds three or four kills and then a snowballing enemy team ravages around the map, or (2) all lanes go generally even, the game stays close, then your team does something stupid in team fighting and the enemy gets a big advantage and wins.\n\nBoth of these situations are REALLY FRUSTRATING and make it seem like there is nothing you could have done to change the outcome of the game.  Sometimes this is true.  For games in which one of your laners feeds Akali 4 kills by 10 minutes, you may just want to save yourself the stress and admit it's going to be tough to win.  In the latter situation, however, you can try to take control of the game and help your team focus on the objectives that matter, and make sure you have a strategy for how to win the game, rather than just focusing on how not to lose it.","replies":[]}]}
