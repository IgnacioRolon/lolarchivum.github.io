People want to openly tell you that you're not smart. \r\n\r\nThat behavior is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nI cannot stop if I start talking about this horrific mentality people have because, in so many cases and in so many details are they actually bullies, trouble-makers, arrogant, and seriously disrespectful. They come in all shapes and forms from males to females, kids to adults. \r\n\r\nOne of the people I've added to my friends list openly explained to me that he is not smart (which I don't believe) but on the contrary is one of the nicest people I've met from the League community and on the more unfortunate viewpoint, he had told me he was poor, too. \r\n\r\nI'm going to connect the two together because it's only interesting when you see it from this point of view.\r\n\r\nAre the more fortunate less-forgiving and increasingly aggressive? Are their rowdy behaviors stemmed from the blessings of luxury and fame? Where does the one-sided bias and cruelty begin from? Do people with luxury and fame, items the poor cannot have and culture the poor cannot have, evolve to behave this arrogantly?","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-27T19:38:37.922+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've had enough of being perma-banned for Negativity and Abusive Text, so anybody who is negative and abusive in chat will be reported post-game with a ticket submission.\n\nDude, perhaps you should reconsider what you do in your spare time.

Own the anger and channel it properly. Avoid negativity. Do so in a manner that the bot does not flag you and you win. There are right ways to use anger and express it. Sounds like you're moving toward one such way. We will be brothers in this regard.\n\nRegarding the question about economic status and mental capacity affecting kindness, there is some truth to it. This would be stereotyping at best, unjust discrimination at worst. There are selfish boys who have been given all they desire- foul princes who seek vagabond justice- but there are also generous young men who try to be the best they can be with the gifts they're given. It's the same for the unfortunate, those who blame others for their misfortune, etc. There are so many people, you can not imagine all the different ways they are- to the point that trying to categorize personalities is a nonsensical effort. You can categorize actions. Student. Player. Criminal. Investor. Etc.\n\nBut not \"good\" types. Nor \"kind\" or \"generous\" people with traits in common. The point, in other words, is that all kinds of people are kind, or good, or wicked.","replies":[]}]}
