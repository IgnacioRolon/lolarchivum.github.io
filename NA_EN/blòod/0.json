The system was designed this way to prevent any sort of corruption. The /Remake system marks anyone who is *Inactive* for 90+ seconds within the first 3 minutes of a match and will become available at 3:00 if anyone was marked. I recommend checking out our [Remake FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ) for more details on the system.\n\nI understand technical issues can be really frustrating when they cause you to lose progress you've made in reaching your ranked goals. If you have another issue with this or would like to take proactive steps to prevent this, please let me know more details regarding what error message or behavior you saw when this occurred.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
