I played for a month, stopped for like 4 and just came back) and I'm really enjoying it right now. I'm getting a new laptop soon for school purposes and I also want to be able to play league on it. This one above matches most if not all of the recommended specs, but it has an 11 inch screen. Would this ruin or hinder the whole league playing experience for me? And if not can you suggest a decent one with in a 200-370 price range?\r\n Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"kingrupert","date":"2015-02-05T14:47:10.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play on a laptop with similar specs. I run the game on medium graphics settings and keep it capped at 60fps. With the new rift I get some frame drops during large teamfights, but it runs the game well enough for the price. Honestly, If you can afford something more expensive look to get something with dedicated graphics. The intel HD chipset is great for integrated graphics, but from a gaming standpoint there will be a drastic improvement in the games you run on a laptop with some type of dedicated graphics","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-05T07:34:33.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any computer can run LOL, but I am afraid this one may only run it on low setting, and believe me, you don't want to run LOL on low settings. I would suggest an actual PC if you are serious because they offer much better performance for lower price than a laptop. If you insist on playing LOL on a laptop, I would suggest you start looking at the +500 price range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2015-02-05T05:04:27.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Arcan3ful!\n\nI won't be able to tell you too much regarding the computer your considering in regards to how well it will play LoL.  However, your computer will definitely be able to play League of Legends, but you may need to have the settings on the lower-end to play at a consistent high FPS.  Additionally, the screen may only be 11 inches, but it will be able to run at a native 1366x768 resolution -- this should be perfectly fine for running League of Legends.  \n\nI'm sorry I can't give more direct advice regarding your computer, but hopefully this helped somewhat!","replies":[]}]}
