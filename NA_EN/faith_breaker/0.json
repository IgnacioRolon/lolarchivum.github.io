I am given the option to either use my q to harass enemy champ or last hit a creep to stack SS. Ideally we wanna stack SS to unlock full potential of our ULT for late game. But what I see happening is my lane opponent just harasses and out lanes me. I can last hit under tower and that&#039;s fine but I&#039;m more or less NOT THERE. Its&#039; like I have no lane presence, outside of using his TbF passive to trade I must use my mana and my cool down&#039;s so I last hit creeps with q, to stack SS. \n\nBut by the time I upgrade my ult the first time, I feel weaker then I ever have with Gp, and my lane opponent comes back with equivilant if not superior items then me and is still ahead in terms of ability to engage in trades confidently in their favor. I feel like the playstyle of stacking his SS for full ult is a trap, as I have better performances playing Gangplank in situations where my q is mostly a Harass tool, using it to enable me to trade more often. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n\n***Edit*** \n\nThat title typo tho?","replies":[{"poster":"ponkzy","date":"2015-07-26T00:34:42.231+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":2,"body":"youre supposed to stack it using your barrels. if you last hit the barrel with your parrley and it kills all the creeps you can get up to 50 ss in one go","replies":[{"poster":"xl Kirito lx","date":"2015-07-26T05:02:04.536+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"Barrels aren't reliable thou.

Something else to consider is that you get stacks very slowly at the start until you get some AD going where your barrels can wipe an entire wave of minions (might take 1-2 melee autos on them to get them low enough before barrel depending at what point in the game) and then Q your barrel to get an entire wave of stacks at once. In general, using barrels which ignore 60% of armor and do good dmg and can be modified by Sheen/Crits are a good way to stack them and harass and if you are getting multiple SS from a single barrel parley this means more up-time for Q to focus on the enemy.\n\nAgain, I will note that in my experience GP does not farm SS very fast early. In fact, I can get the other 1000 SS in a much shorter period of time than I could the initial 500 and still have time to spare simply because you stack them so much faster later as you get more AD/Crits/Sheen/TF and more barrels are available regularly (CD, etc.).
