They have nearly identical stats (Banshee&#039;s has 50 more HP, Visage has 10% CDR), both cost the exact same, have nearly identical item recipes...the only differentiation is the passives. And honestly both passives are kind of lackluster, in that neither requires much thought or skill from the player to be used effectively. Basically, you buy one of BV/SV if you need to get tanky against magic damage, then if you&#039;re still not tanky enough you buy the other one. Compare that to armor itemization, which has four dedicated tank items and each fills a specific strategic niche. I know armor and MR itemization are two different animals by necessity, but there&#039;s no reason that buying a dedicated MR item can&#039;t feel as strategically satisfying as, say, buying Frozen Heart against an attack speed reliant team or buying Thornmail against a fed ADC. Are there any plans to give these two items their own separate space in the future?\r\n\r\nTL;DR please make Spirit Visage and Banshee&#039;s Veil more unique!","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Cal","date":"2015-06-06T01:11:48.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find them plenty unique. Banshee's is more general in my opinion and the spell shield makes it great for squishes. Spirit Visage gives the healing amplification which is great on sustain tanks (olaf, nasus, reksai).","replies":[]}]}
