I played earlier this morning without issue, but tonight every time I try to launch the game it pops up with the Logo and the little loading circle and then the computer completely freezes and I have to hold down the power button to turn it off. I have tried repairing it and reinstalling and neither helped the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Phated","date":"2017-02-06T00:27:24.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have an acer aspire vn7 laptop with a geforce gtx 860m. I updated to the latest drivers from nvidia (378.49), but I went back to the newest version on acer's website instead (353.54). This seems to have completely solved the problem, I've been playing with no problems since.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T17:36:30.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a strange case!  I'm really glad you were able to get this fixed up, though.  Just for my own awareness, can you tell me which driver, date of update, and card you're using?  I'd like to keep an eye out just in case!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phated","date":"2017-02-04T17:23:31.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. It was actually a video card problem, not the client. The computer was freezing with all games, but League was the only one I had tried at that point. Rolling back the driver seems to have fixed it, even though I'd been using the newest driver for a week with no issue until last night.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T17:13:13.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using any other applications to open League?  It sounds like the patcher is trying to launch but something is might be trying to load with it that's causing you to crash out.  This could also be in combination with a permissions problem that's not allowing your patcher to launch or scan files.  Double check any third party apps and also run through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to work towards a resolution.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
