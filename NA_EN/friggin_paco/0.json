I've been sat at my desk, mouthing the words as I listen to the music!  I can't get the last two lines to match up though - it may be that I'm putting the wrong stresses on the syllables?  Can you maybe help me out on how those two lines work?","replies":[{"poster":"MeÂªt","date":"2015-07-14T19:25:23.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, this Rioter is too small, gotta throw him back in.\n\n*Changes to Canadian Bacon*","replies":[{"poster":"iamdestinos","date":"2015-07-23T08:59:04.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm Canadian bacon... *slowly reaches out*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Friggin Paco","date":"2015-07-15T02:59:49.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the last two lines, since they kind of lend themselves to be the \"outro\", the part at at 1:30 has the tail end of the melody has a long note that slides down, that's the held \"Eh\" of Everything (But I see now, Eeeeevrything).\n\nAs for the last line, \"And I know I cant, get away\", split \"I can't\" into two smaller, faster, notes. Then, the last words should be following the humming as per usual.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tikail","date":"2015-07-13T05:55:28.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say honestly, why don't you try getting ahold of Falconshield on youtube and at least see it they'd entertain your idea?\nI was really disappointed that I didn't hear any lyrics when the update hit cause tunes in this style beg for a good lyric.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"patmax17","date":"2015-07-14T19:38:53.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is great :O","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grievous77","date":"2015-07-13T08:38:45.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest I was kind of doubting this lyric idea, because Tahm's tune was quite amazing already. However this is truly a work of art, and the lyrics just fit Tahm so well.
