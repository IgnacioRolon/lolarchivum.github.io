Skipping the fact that I can't see the main page for like 6 six months already, there is no session when I'm not being disconnected from the client (not the game) for at least as many matches as I choose to play. The information that client is trying to reconnect sometimes occurs randomly while using it. Unfortunately everytime I accept the match, I'm actually always last person to join the lobby. It shows up when there is like 2 secs to pick a champion I wanna play, but there again always appears \"trying to reconnect\" notification. It disappears after 3 secs and everything seems to be fine until the loading screen pops up. Sometimes I'm not even able to see the champion cards because \"I have been disconnected, try again\". But sometimes I can see those cards for like 10 secs and as soon as the game starts to load, LoL crashes and I'm able to reconnect ONLY after the match starts. There are no issues with my connection, everytime the problem occurs, every page, app, even Spotify and Twtich work perfectly. I found only one post with a problem similar to mine but you haven't responded for some reason. Thank you for your time and I hope you'll find the solution as soon as possible. If you need more information, I'm down to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-12T21:52:53.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I don't recommend queuing up for now until this gets fixed up otherwise you'll run into dodge penalties or lower priority queues.  Even though your internet seems okay, it seems your network still has issues reaching specific services like matchmaking and champion select.
