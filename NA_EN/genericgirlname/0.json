It is because of this that we don&#x27;t gift out Hextech Loot like we would for RP in specific instances.\n\nI agree with your/Riot's reasoning about why you won't give away free essence like you would RP.\n\nHowever, I still don't like Hextech Crafting. It taps into the same psychology as slot machines -- essentially, that people get addicted to actions with variable rewards -- to encourage people to spend more money. That feels manipulative to me; it's not something I expect or want to see from Riot.\n\n*Please note that I have nothing against spending money on League -- I've spent over $500 myself -- it's the manipulation that I feel is wrong.*\n\nSo, about Hextech...\n\nLet's put chests aside for the moment, since they're essentially a loot delivery mechanism. Nothing would change about the system mechanically if loot dropped directly after games and you could buy random loot with RP.\n\nSo here's the thing: I can grind for IP to buy champions, or I can shortcut that process with RP and buy the champ directly. I can grind for essence to upgrade a shard, or I can buy that skin with RP directly... or I can buy loot -> random amounts of essence -> upgrade the shard. Purchasing loot with RP is more akin to an IP boost than to unlocking a champion. \n\nExcept, an IP boost is a fixed reward, gated behind actually playing games. It's not something you can blow hundreds of dollars on, seeing the thrill of \"will I get something good this time?\"\n\nI'd prefer to see a system where you can only earn loot by playing games, but instead you can rent or upgrade shards for either essence or RP (renting would not consume the shard).\n\nCheers,\nThe only person who plays Ashe Jungle seriously","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Nephthys","date":"2016-05-28T01:43:53.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dArtagnan,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=VALWLIEZ,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-05-27T21:09:58.562+0000)\n>\n> Damn, that was a good meme.

Everyone knows we need another use for IP, and you mentioned about allowing players a chance to grind out games to get free content but if we can only get like 3-4 chest a month (assuming you can even get the 12 key fragments in that month) we'll never have the essence to even use any of the champion/skin shards since we get so little atm. If you were lucky and got a ultimate skin shard which cost like around 3k orange essence, it'll probably take you around 6-8+ months to even get all the essence to activate it since we can only get essence from a rare chance in a chest, or disenchanting unwanted shards.","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-05-28T02:43:29.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would very much like to be able to buy essence with IP.
