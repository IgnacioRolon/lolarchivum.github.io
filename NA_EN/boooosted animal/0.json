Usually if you AFK or get DC'd in a game it doesn't count. For the chat restriction at least.\n\nFor Hextech keys and loot; I don't think those rights are automatically given back once you receive a blemish on your account reputation and finish out the punishment time. I think the \"average\" (don't quote me  on that lol) is it takes 2-3 months of continuous positive play to get your hextech crafting privileges back. Even for a 10 game chat restriction. There is no set time when you'll get it back, but I think that's the estimated average it takes. Could be shorter or longer, it all depends on your attitude and how quickly you reformed.\n\n[More information:](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide)\n\n> **HOW DOES BEHAVIOR AFFECT LOOT ELIGIBILITY?**\n> If you've been punished recently for negative behavior, you'll be locked out of earning chests and keys from playing games for a duration of time.\n> \n> The length of time you're restricted from earning loot is relative to two things:\n> \n* Severity of punishment. You won't earn loot for the duration of your punishment, be it a temporary suspension or a chat restriction.\n* Signs of reform. Once your puinshment has ended, you'll continue to be restricted from earning loot until you're recognized to have made significant progress in amending your past behavior. \n\n>There isn't a specific timeframe for this--it all depends on your behavior.\n\n\nI hope that helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"BOOOOSTED ANIMAL","date":"2016-10-21T17:39:12.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!\n But 2-3 months thats a long time i was toxic for three games man i guess i´ll just not write anything but again Thank you a great help!","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-21T19:13:40.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BOOOOSTED ANIMAL,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LKEx7wtG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-10-21T17:39:12.929+0000)\n>\n> Thank you!\n>  But 2-3 months thats a long time i was toxic for three games man i guess i´ll just not write anything but again Thank you a great help!\n\nIt was probably more than 3 games, that is just the maximum number of games they show you so that they are from recent games instead of showing you something from a few days or a week ago.\n\nThe fact that you have three would lead one to believe that your punishment was due to consistent negative behavior rather than particularly offensive cases. I would suggest muting people you are about to have an argument with, as that is the case with a lot of similar instances.\n\nAlthough that isn't why you are here, so sorry if I am being overly presumptuous or overanalyzing, purely trying to help.

I was just stating the average it can take, but it's not a definite number. It all depends on you. \n\nAlso, the game audits more than just the 3 games you received on your reform card. It's just to give an example of what not to do that you've done, but it could have been other games in the past that you were toxic in as well that counted towards your restriction. \n\nI do recommend avoiding chat unless it's strictly for gameplay related purposes such as \"Let's get baron\" or \"we should ward more\". If you are prone to getting frustrated and typing in it chat it might help calm you down during games if you restrict yourself to neutral chat only :) Or even /mute all at the start of a match so you don't have to worry about others. \n\nEither way, I wish you luck! I hope you succeed in getting reformed and getting your Hextech Crafting back :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2016-10-22T19:20:31.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Read plz !!!!\n\nNo thx.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-10-21T17:39:03.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for 10 game chat restrict, 40 games or so? give or take 5 -10 games","replies":[]}]}
