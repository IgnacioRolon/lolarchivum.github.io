Your network definitely sounds like it's having problems having a strong connection to our game server, and causing your ping to stay high.  Try out the steps in our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to improve that and get back in game.  Test it out in customs to prevent penalties, though.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
