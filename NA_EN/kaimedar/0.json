Also something Else I have noticed over the past 2 days since the new patch has been released, The camera angle has changed when your character is locked on.  I know before when you were on the right side of the maps, it off centered your character more twards the top, but not its opposite.  now the character is locked more twards the ability bar, and its making it dificult to play at times.  Sonething to look into.","replies":[{"poster":"SkyAce","date":"2016-01-31T04:04:19.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they also know about this issue there is another post on it.","replies":[{"poster":"kaimedar","date":"2016-01-31T04:05:45.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh cool, I didn't see it.
