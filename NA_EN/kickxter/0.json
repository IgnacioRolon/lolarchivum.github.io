I know for a fact I won a game with two friends during the initial release of the game mode; I honestly don't think I once played it alone. I love this game mode and would hate to miss out on one of the awesome icons. Heck, I played it enough to get two pentakills (proof provided upon request :D). Just want to check and make sure I didn't get skipped over when you guys were going through accounts (side note: hella relieved for you guys that missions make that a shit load easier).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nA Concerned Support Main","replies":[{"poster":"kickxter","date":"2017-07-16T00:14:16.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's there!

It's a little strange that yours would be taking so long, but do me a favor and check for it really quickly! It should be tucked away in your list of icons now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"kickxter","date":"2017-07-16T00:50:07.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys are pathologically nice, I always end up just wanting to be your friend lol *~*","replies":[]}]}
