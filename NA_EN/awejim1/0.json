MOST icons aren't ever in the store. the championship jewels are still able to be purchased. I cant test anything for some reason. the only thing that ever comes up are a few icons, ward skins, skins, chromas, and champions. for example I cannot purchase arcade icons even though I really like them because they aren't in the shop. I also don't have any way of getting new skins because I got all of them but the victorious (I think we all know why). either way I still want to be able to test things. because all I can use are skins and champions really, I just play customs and try them. I usually don't give feedback and keep it to myself unless its a game changing bug like rengars w having infinite resets. this (somewhat) leads me into my suggestion that would make me and my friend(s) that have a pbe account very happy. before I have seen bots on the pbe. since there aren't enough players I played them in a custom game 1v5. I had a blast. it was a lot of fun with the right amount of challenge involved. I am sure a lot of people want this too. Please at least bring it back to pbe. thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-03T23:13:23.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We aren't always testing all content on the PBE and often the available content directly reflects what we're specifically wanting to test at the moment. If you're inclined to do so, I recommend leaving your PBE feedback on the [**Feedback Boards**](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback) specifically.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"awejim1","date":"2017-01-06T16:57:07.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. This clears up quite a bit. I also have been searching for the PBE boards but have had no success just like in my games HAHAHA. Okay I'm done there, but thank you for showing me the boards. I just recently posted something else that's not feedback but a whole new concept that Riot has tried once and didn't last long on the PBE which made me sad. I really loved having the bots on the Howling Abyss.  Other than what's posted on that one I don't have any questions. Again thank you for helping me out.","replies":[]}]}]}
