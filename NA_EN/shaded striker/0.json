The coding needs a complete overhaul.\n\nVault needs to be recoded to always position you back relative to the line from you to your target at initial casting & have nothing to do with what direction or angle you or they are facing.\n\nYou said you'd check-up on gameplay too, any word?

It seems to me that it shouldn't be, because this isn't really something that the player can control/take advantage of. I understand that there are interactions that are intended, such as being able to go bird form, vault, proc the ult execute, and then bounce back again, rewarding good timing by giving some safety. This isn't one of these cases.\n\nIf this was something that was consistent and able to be manipulated by the player, then I would understand the intent of the interaction, but given that it happens so randomly, infrequently, and uncontrollably, I don't understand why you would want that mechanic in place. IMHO, consistency with a champion is what makes them usable.\n\nImagine if using a Thresh hook leap put Thresh 400 units past the hooked target, but only .25% of the time. I imagine that Thresh players would have all sorts of adverse effects to their gameplay, such as unintentionally ending up under a tower or in the middle of the enemy team, or accidentally flying over walls that were past the hooked target.\n\nIt's just really frustrating being a Quinn player when you can never tell with absolute certainty what your ability will do. Any lack of consistency of an ability is detrimental to the champion. With Quinn in particular, her E interactions are only a small part of it. The Harrier passive has a ton of bugs with it that give Quinn no consistency in the game, and it just ends up being frustrating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enkidusmurf","date":"2015-03-12T04:02:22.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If safety is the goal, then the ability *has* to be reliable.
