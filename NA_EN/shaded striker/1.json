The range change was being tested internally as part of a set of changes that included a number of other things (much shorter ult CD late game, removal of ult damage etc). We'll probably explore some of that stuff again at some point, conclusion was that that wasn't an immediate clear win though and that we wanted to focus on the upcoming pre-season work instead right now.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2014-11-06T04:14:26.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So she isn't getting a range buff? {{item:3070}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3070}} \nI didn't care for the ult changes, but was getting really excited for the range increase","replies":[{"poster":"Robot Beat Rally","date":"2014-11-06T06:44:45.551+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Id rather have her blind pass through minions instead of stop on the first one it hits, so I can at least have better blinding positioning when I inevitably put myself right in the line of fire by vaulting.  That would be infinitely more useful to me than a tiny range increase.  I just hate how she gets punished so hard for using her passive and her vault, but its such a fun mechanic at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-11-06T06:58:56.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't like how they keep hinting they're gonna nerf her movement speed.  I won't feel any more at ease having a miniscule 25 extra range when I'm all-of-a-sudden easier to catch and have much more difficulty chasing.  Especially when you consider it's straight nerfs to Valor.  You start your ult farther away, you're melee so the extra range doesn't benefit you, rather without Vault it just hinders you and now you're slower to boot.\n\nI'm not sure where this misguided and illogical philosophy of transferring power newly came from, but why is it that only underpowered champions that need pure unadulterated buffs are victimized into being the labrats for it?  It hasn't worked once yet, it just keeps making champions weaker every time Riot tries it.

So many champions can make clean flash+gapcloser plays in this game(think Talon). With Quinn, if you've ever tried this, I think it's maybe even buggy?

Fix her AA so it's not so clunky... Give her better base stats or something... She's hurting pretty bad. I mean BRAUM literally beats her in every base stat... including AD. SERIOUSLY. I almost choked when I saw that Braum out-stats Quinn in every way, short of range.\n\nedit: I realize Braum is meant for support and he has huge cooldowns, etc... But that's besides the point.....

(An engage support helps in this case)\n\nEventually you'll make the cait scared from approaching either you or your support, so there will be less poke. Early game, stay away from cait, dodge those q's, poke q's back and e, aa. And pray that this cait isn't that aggressive as poking early game. If you fail on your first engage, try again, but if you start feeding, then try to dominate late game.\n\nI get BT later on, so I become poke immune. Of course this doesn't work with everyone, but I just prefer BT because I like burst damage with passive.

The key is that you have to play **extremely** aggressively from the very beginning (recommend Long Sword+3 health pot start), any time Caitlyn dares to try and harass, go ham on her, Caitlyn loses all-ins to almost every other ADC early game so she will almost assuredly try and disengage (usually w/ E one she has a few levels). You should be able to disengage quite easily having won the trade pretty hard, just be sure not to continue to pursuing if it would result in overcommitting.\n\nBest supports for this imo are Jarvan IV and Leona. I've been the J4 in ranked before w/ a Quinn against a Caitlyn+Zyra lane and we crushed them hard, also played w/ Leona as Quinn many times, and its usually VERY effective.","replies":[{"poster":"calforrai","date":"2014-11-29T17:07:49.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's true. don't know why the down votes lol.\njust have to be careful not eating too much harass level 1-3, then you can go somewhat ham on caitlyn.\nE briefly disables your target and you get your passive proc\nnow you won the trade and run off with W passive's bonus movement speed.\n\nbraum works quite well, you will start the aggression with E and braum use stand behind me.\nor janna shield you just as you vault back and get bonus AD on passive proc.\nwith both supports you can make sure you don't receive damage from counterattack\nand allow you to play aggressively but stil be very safe.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Toshihik0","date":"2014-11-06T17:22:23.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd just wait and see the full set of changes Riot makes to her, then watch as it makes her even worse, wait about a year when a good designer picks her up, makes her op and then she has her numbers nerfed to uselesness.
