If he should hate anybody, it should be rene for being Azir's father's enforcer... I don't get it","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-05-28T22:21:11.575+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus and Renekton were the ones who imprisoned him,thats why he hates nasus(he doesn't hate renekton,because he was able to bring renekton to his side).\n\nHe hates Azir most likely because Azir is now probably going to try to kill xerath for betraying him.\n\nAlso I think that the years of imprisonment were not good for xeraths mental health,so he is now probably somewhat crazy too.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-05-31T05:52:34.367+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think Xerath isn't too enamored with Renekton. I think Renekton is another facet of Shurima's past and power structure that Xerath despises. However, he saw an opportunity to make Renekton into something useful.\n\nHe detests Azir for a variety of reasons. Although Azir did finally release the people of Shurima, Xerath lived alongside the Emperor-to-be for years, and always as a servant, no matter how kindly he was treated. If things had ended differently, if Xerath could have walked away when Azir revealed his intent to free his people, perhaps Xerath could forgive. But, remember, he lived as a slave for most of his formative years. I think he's got a lot of reasons to bury Azir and the rest of Shurima's \"glorious\" past beneath the sands that revived them.\n\nThen again, you could also say that his hatred of Azir is partly because of Xerath's own guilt at how things turned out. Not that he'd admit that part of himself that's buried deep below a metric ton of vengeance, righteous indignation and bitterness. Xerath might blame Azir and his line for forcing him to take action, but Xerath guided Shurima's physical downfall just as surely as he feels Azir benefited from its moral corruption.","replies":[{"poster":"EverTokki","date":"2015-05-31T15:46:34.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jaredan,\nso I was reading these, and shouldnt what you are saying be implied at least a little bit in the lore itself, rather than you comeing to boards and making assumptions? I'm not trying to sound mean, but that 's what I believe so.

Make it so Azir is the only person who can touch him through his curse.  I also hope that you guys will make a new map, for a new game type, that takes place in the Void, perhaps something like neutral flag CTF?  Maybe even just another map that is perma 6v6 that plays like SR but has a separate playlist?  I just feel as if the game is slowly getting old, and HEARING about all the lore is torture without ever actually being able to see it.  I wanna see the void, I wanna see the sands of Shurima, I wanna see Zaun, Piltover, Noxus, Demacia.  I mean, cripes, you guys could make an MMO if you wanted to, I know even if it was literally a carbon copy of WoW I'd still play it, just because the story and lore of LoL is amazing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
