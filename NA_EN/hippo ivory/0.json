All the T's were dotted and the I's were crossed, and still the remake function won't work...  Our mid lane brand was dc'd from the very start. There were no kills before minute 3, and i entered /remake into the chat, thinking yup, it's alright that our brand is disconnected, but we can just get a remake... Boy was i wrong.  not only did the remake hit me with the \"you cannot remake unless an ally player is disconnected,\" but i kept spamming /remake for a while; from minutes 3-5. I got the same bloody irritating error.  This is the kicker.  Because i kept getting that ally has to be disconnected message, i figured that maybe brand was just trolling and sitting in base, pretending to be afk.  However, this theory was torn to shambles when min 6 roles around, and i hear the \"an ally has reconnected message.\" WHICH MEANS BRAND HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED THE WHOLE BLOODY TIME!  This means that there is a serious bug with some of the connection issues in this game.  I have a feeling that this remake issue is connected to the unstable loading screens that riot has right now, and unless it is repaired soon, things are only going to get more frustrating for the average league player.  Remake needs a rework, so that it can actually tell the difference between the loading screen issues and someone that's disconnected because this is getting ridiculous, i'm tired of losing hard fought LP because of this ridiculous bug.  BTW i don't understand the whole firstblood before 3 mins thing disabling the remake... First blood does not compensate for not having an entire bloody player on your team...  I know this is sort of turned into a rant, but i'm really just tired of this issue.  Please, rito please fix this loading screen issue that some players experience.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-26T23:25:04.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any *unstable loading screens* from our end.
