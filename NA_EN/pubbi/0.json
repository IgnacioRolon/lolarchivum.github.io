I get that you don&#039;t want LCS players to do the same thing every game and just pick meta champions for their ELO, so I figured that a solution should have had struck you guys a while ago. Why not just make the two separate? Just balance LCS for LCS, and balance your normal game for the playerbase.\r\n\r\n**PROS**\r\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/kaisa-reveal/es_AR/962ddda44ebe6f69c9103996d717a2ae0f1640c4/assets/img/global/accents/intro-divider-2.png\r\n* Your players will complain less about the arbitrary changes (removing tracker&#039;s knife for low-mid ELO just because it&#039;s busted AF in the LCS)\r\n* It gives you the potential to make items specifically for the LCS, therefore making it more interesting and based on skill\r\n* Off-Meta picks could be balanced into the LCS\r\n\r\n**POTENTIAL CONS**\r\nhttps://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/kaisa-reveal/es_AR/962ddda44ebe6f69c9103996d717a2ae0f1640c4/assets/img/global/accents/intro-divider-2.png\r\n\r\nThe only real con that I could think of, correct me if there are more, is that LCS teams would have to have their own client that is maintained just for them. A worthy sacrifice if you ask me.\r\n\r\nJust a thought {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-04-12T00:05:05.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot has stated this before, actually.\n\nTwice as much balance work = worse balance for everyone and slower reaction time.\n\nHaving different balance in pro play and normals will effectively create two games with different metas that will slowly drift apart, totally confusing people who watch pro play but play below pro.\n\nIt will also make the jump from normal to pro play incredibly hard, effectively learning a different metagame.\n\nPlayers would probably not enjoy being unable to use the same builds or strategies as pro players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-04-11T23:41:49.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cuz lcs are for us to learning and i think many people are playing something just because it was on lcs, and if they would make like 2 separate patches that would be like another game","replies":[{"poster":"f0tzepirat","date":"2019-01-05T14:25:52.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LCS already is like another game...","replies":[]}]}]}
