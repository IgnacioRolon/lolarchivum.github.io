Because different servers reside in different geolocations, you can have a good connection to one but not another. I strongly recommend ensuring your local network settings are compatible with our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) before we look into your routing.\n\nLet me know if you notice any changes after taking those steps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WingmanXxX","date":"2016-10-02T14:05:16.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also need help.
