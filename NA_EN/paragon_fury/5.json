People will even pick Champions like {{champion:127}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:76}}  over Champions like {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:12}}  because of the sheer difference in damage and initiation.\r\n\r\nSo, do League players just secretly like Heroes/DotA styled Supports and are just having a cognitive dissonance moment, or would they play other Champions if they could?","replies":[]}
