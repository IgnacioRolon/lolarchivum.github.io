What is Riot scared of?\r\n\r\n*Heroes of the Storm*\r\n\r\nSMITE, Dawngate, Infinite Crisis, those other MOBAs? Children splashing around, trying to make money in an arena League already had taken nearly complete control of.\r\n\r\nDotA, while clearly a cut above the rest of the competition,  had a real chance, being developed and run by a small team and they had money from Valve for excellent marketing and tournaments. Ultimately DotA's downfall is that it is simply too hard and too complicated for people to jump right into and have a large playerbase.\r\n\r\nBut now Blizzard, the developers whose game series Warcraft led to the development of the *ENTIRE MOBA GENRE* comes along and drops an absolute *nuclear bomb*on the MOBA scene.\r\n\r\nA MOBA developed by a multiple-Triple AAA series developer known all over the world for their quality games (even their \"crap\" games tend to be miles ahead of the fare of other developers) using characters pulled from a catalog containing the most famous names and faces from 3 *incredibly huge game series* from the years.\r\n\r\nA budget larger than even Riot can muster with their profits.\r\n\r\nThe technical support and know-how from the developer with 3 of the largest online games in existence.\r\n\r\nAnd right out of the gate, even in Alpha, Heroes was dropping things that League has been missing since it was conceived.\r\n\r\n- Play any Hero you want, no questions asked and no arguing\r\n- Stability on Alpha/Beta superior to release clients of League of Legends\r\n- Dedicated East and West Coast servers (as well as the rest of the world when it launches, like SCII and other games)\r\n- Working Replay System\r\n- Variety of maps\r\n- Easier to pick up and learn; a much more extensive tutorial\r\n\r\nEven their model for player rewards is better out of the gate. In League, you spend your 975RP/6300IP on a new Champion...and that is what you get. You still need Runes to even play that Champion, usually costing a total of ANOTHER 6300IP, repeating until you have decent runes for ALL kinds of Champions.\r\n\r\nYou spend your $10/10,000G on a Hero in Heroes? You get the Hero, 2 Hero Portraits AND *TWO ALTERNATE SKINS INCLUDED FOR JUST PLAYING THAT HERO*. And not cheap-ass skins either; they're skins that Riot would charge at least 520RP for. And most Heroes don't cost 10,000G; many of the great Heroes are only 2,000-7,000G. Lili (2), Tychus (4), ETC (7), Muradin (4), Malfurion (5) and Tyrande (7). Heck, they GIVE you Valla, one of the best Assassins (ADCs/Mages in LoL) in the game for FREE if you had add Reaper of Souls to your account within a certain time after it released. And she is cheap otherwise.\r\n\r\n*But you earn Gold so much more slowly in Heroes!*\r\n\r\nNo you don't. If you played only 1 hour per day - 2/3 games of Heroes; you would earn 220-320 Gold even if you lost every game (unless you have the \"Win X Games Daily, but that can be done in Co-Op vs. AI). Just to compare to LoL - you would have to play AND WIN to earn that much; a much harder feat; and then the returns diminish fairly quickly after that first win.\r\n\r\n*But why would Riot care about what Heroes does? Why would you assume that Riot is doing all of this just because of that game?*\r\n\r\nHere is a question for you; since when is Riot known for \"doing things\"? *Especially* at the rapid pace at which they have be seeming to do them lately?\r\n\r\nAnswer: Not for a very, very *long* time. You'd have to go all the way back to Beta/Season 1/MAYBE Season 2 for that. Not to mention so many of the things are things that Riot had never really shown any interest in until recently, but just so happened to be features that Heroes has that people are immensely fond of. \r\n\r\n- Champion Mastery\r\n- Preferred Champion Style\r\n- Formas\r\n- Party Bonuses\r\n\r\nJust saying...when there is smoke, the fire next door might have something to do with it.\r\n\r\n*Heroes is too scrubby and casual to be a big game*\r\n\r\nOne word: Hearthstone.\r\n\r\nLonger answer: DotA 2 made the same assumption. So did Counter-Strike players.\r\n\r\nAnd yet...here stands League of Legends; filling stadiums, being the most popular game on Twitch. While DotA 2 can barely garner attention except during MAJOR tournies and even then, not to the extent even minor tournaments do in League.\r\n\r\nCounter-Strike (and Quake and Unreal) players made the same assumptions about console shooters and games like Halo and Call of Duty. Yet here we are...and many people who play shooters now would probably wonder what kind of game Counter-Strike is, much less recognize it for the masterpiece shooter it was (and is).\r\n\r\nBut maybe I'm being too negative. Maybe having some competition will make Riot kick themselves into high gear, and actually try again.","replies":[]}
