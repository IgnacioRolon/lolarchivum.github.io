Bad teams? Trolls? Its easy to blame 100 things rather than just take it upon yourself. \r\nHere is my Tips and Tricks to improving ranked play.\r\n\r\n**Rule 1 of ranked:** Play to win but have fun to \r\nI know it seems rhetorical but its true, being negative ruins your own vibe and your teams vibe causing everyone to do more poorly\r\n\r\nTip 1: Chat; Ever just get sick of chat? the negativity, the trolling what ever it maybe... Sometimes its just best to ignore chat and not respond, why waste time getting frustrated with stupidity.  It wastes time responding to negativity and trolls when you could be CSing, pushing or something else productive.\r\n\r\nTip 2: Champions; Have 2 champions for EVERY lane your good at and be good at every lane, if you cant jungle DO NOT play ranked. Same with any other role be versatile\r\n\r\nTip 3: Losing streaks: ever go on a winning streak then suddenly you cant seem to win? after 2 losses in a row take a break, dont keep playing with negative feelings building up, trust me it helps\r\n\r\nTip 4: Solo Vs Dou: SOme prefer solo some prefer dou dont be afraid to mix it up find a good partner you know you can trust! \r\n\r\nTip 5: CS (creep score): This is my personal creep score i try to make by certain points of the game;\r\n5-10 minutes: 50-75 ; 11-20m: 100-150 ; 21-30m: 200-240 \r\n\r\nTip 6: Keep on top of dragons!: Not just the jungler but if bot lane is pushed or you know you're going to push out signal your jungler to meet you at dragon while the enemy bot lane is distracted! \r\n\r\nTip 7: Rhetorical statement but yeah... this season 1 lane CAN cost everyone the game and NO ONE likes to do bad; stop hassling the guy who is behind and is getting punished for it, Its common sense for the enemy to capitalize on weakness, They wont do better unless you help them and work as a team EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP SOMETHING IN YOUR LANE TO STOP THEM FROM DESTROYING EVERYTHING. 1 Objective Vs 2-3 towers everywhere which is more important?\r\n\r\nTip 8: Counter picks: Its smart to know who counters what before you play ranked, Being counter picked isn't entirely a guaranteed loss however about 75% of the time it does make it harder to win despite the skill match up\r\n\r\nTip 9: *Early ganking as jungler*: This is extremely important season 5 as a jungler and i am actually going to give away my biggest secret. Before the match starts plan out who you will go for early, top, mid or bot, LET THEM KNOW; DO NOT PUSH TO TOWER; And here my order in jungle depending who i am ganking for first and what side i am on;\r\nSmall minion for lvl 2(smited); Big Buff minion(red or blue); Run to the bettle in the river and Kill it for the gold,exp and speed buff fast!( THESE ARE EASY GOLD&EXP EARLY!!) Then gank your lane, \r\n***Killing them is ideal HOWEVER do not get greedy making them go home is just as good setting them back slightly less**\r\n\r\nTip 10: DO NOT just farm the jungle as jungler: I can promise you if you try to just farm til level 6 then gank 7/10 times you will fall behind 2 levels and you will become irrelevant, This season also requires that your jungle stays relevant Tip 11 will be your best friend\r\n\r\nTip 11: Jungler Lane Leeching(taxing): If you gank wether you get a kill or not it is smart to grab some exp from thier minions if its safe to do so, This is called taxing them for your assistance and helps keep you up to level and relevant. NEVER over stay your welcome though, it will cause thier jungle to counter gank and draw more attention to that lane. (some people may complain that your taking some of the CS and exp but explain to them when its safe its to keep you relevant )\r\n\r\nTip 12: Common jungler error: 1:) Going in waaaay to hard (to close to turret) Gauge your damage output when u go in as well as how much you take; sometimes its better to retreat for a short bit until your cooldowns are refreshed then go back into a fight: (Disengage/Re-engage)\r\nError 2:) So you gank a lane killing the enemy and you are certain no ones coming to get you, Try to help that lane push that turret fast before running off, this is a common mistake i see junglers do. If your top/mid gets first tower they can roam more often and help others get ahead to! its a WIN WIN for everyone making your life easier to. \r\n\r\nTip 13: ROAMING : If you have NOTHING to do as mid or top lane roam to another lane, that means take a trip down to another lane and gank for them, TEAMWORK wins games!!! Mid and Top roams get everyone head 9/10 times\r\n\r\nTip 14: Wards : NOT JUST a supports job to ward the map Support can only have 3 Vision wards and 1 pink ward.. The rift is a BIG map if you got a 100 gold extra when you go home and dont have a pink ward up BUY 1.  Buy vision wards as well and at level 9 Dont be afraid to exchange that warding totem for 250 gold for a free pink ward consistantly. \r\n\r\nTip 15: Map awareness and MIA: Missing enemies, If you kill them call Missing ping, If you DO NOT see your lane for WHAT EVER reason Call Missing even if for a second or 2. It makes a massive difference, ping the ~!~ to what ever lane you think theyre going to or both if your unsure\r\n\r\nThese are my personal tips and tricks hope you like them and they help~ GOOD LUCK ON THE RIFT","replies":[{"poster":"The Ellimiist","date":"2015-02-21T12:50:50.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh I would say your #1 is exactly what not to do. I think it's more important to play to learn than to play to win. Example being that I could just counterpick every game or I can spam a champ im learning for 200 games. I know a few Dota2 pro in person who have done this, literally played 200 games in a row with each champ in their position in order to master them (saying that playing different champs in between lowers your chance of retaining matchup knowledge or something).\n\nOfc this goes against playing to win, you may be even counterpicking yourself but even that is a matchup you must learn to deal with (and accept that you won't win lane but must also not lose it)","replies":[{"poster":"Infiny Mage","date":"2015-02-21T20:13:33.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think ranked is where you'd go play to learn.

But you don't go to ranked with your primary mentality to learn. Regardless you learn, but it shouldn't be most important thing in ranked.

Assuming you took 3 minions 2 melee one ranged and cannon, that is 21x2+19+cannon, that is about 100g you took from lane plus the experience. Now if you blow flash or force them from lane this is acceptable, however taxing because you said hi shouldn't be a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-02-21T17:16:13.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when im mid i dont always follow my lane opponent when they roam unless i know for a fact where they went, is that a bad thing?","replies":[]}]}
