I tried reinstalling and used both the standard AppImage and dx9 versions, but it just crashes with an error message as soon it tries to launch in game.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflinux/comments/dfdik3/crashing_ingame_on_patch_920_a_critical_error_has/","image":null},"up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"As mentioned on the r/leagueoflinux subreddit no games can launch under WINE as of 9.20. I know Linux isn't officially supported but there is a passionate group of players who only play on Linux, myself included. I was very pleased to see that League ran well under WINE and haven't had any issues playing all summer. I hope this bug can get resolved soon either by Riot, WINE, or the Lutris AppImage maintainers.\r\n\r\nI'm playing under Lutris but any WINE installation should work.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n1. Launch client under WINE\r\n2. Login\r\n3. Launch any game mode. In this case, try practice tool.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian Kûsh","date":"2019-10-10T21:04:16.657+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump - Any updates?

Did my ranked placements yesterday no problem.  Today I figure I'll try a few more ranked games but discover that the game is completely broken and unplayable.  To add insult to injury the system slaps a game loss penalty even though I could not get into the game due to a buggy patch.\n\nI remember 4 years ago it was a pain in the ass working around all the bugs in the client but it seems that things have only gotten worse.  From what I can tell the crashes seem to be due to some anti-cheating spaghetti code clobbered into the game.\n\nThe worse part is RIOT isn't working to resolve the problem, they won't even take the time to publicly achnowledge the current situation.  I get that RIOT management does not value the 1-2% of their income that comes from players who primarily use linux but it's not so hard to at least allow someone to test changes on linux ahead of time to see if a patch is completely broken.  Heck, that would provide them with better QA on their code for a more stable windows client.\n\nIf it's not fixed in the next week I will be moving on to other games.
