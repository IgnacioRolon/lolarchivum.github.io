He would be a tank. You would run Tank Jungler runes/masteries and probably start krugs. It really doesn't matter if he only has 2 damage sources. Its already irritating me that its the only thing anyone says. At lvl 1 its more than most junglers already and the Q adds a stun meaning easier jungler clears. Try chaining that stun in between the passive from Krugs and you are stunning them for a very long time. They won't have time to deal damage to you. \n\nHe can preset his shrines to heal and to move around while doing camps to keep up health and to move along. Clearly though he would act as a ganking jungler not a farming jungler.
