It was working fine yesterday, but for some reason I'm suddenly experiencing a lot of lagg in-game and in the client. I've tried looking at my fps/ms but those both seem to be fine. I'm not experiencing any lagg in any other games (I tried Rocket League and Csgo and both worked fine). \r\n\r\nThe lagg is the same as when my internet is actually being slow, aka delayed auto attacks and sometimes it skips animations and such. Does anybody know what could fix this? I've restarted my pc and my router several times but nothing changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-30T03:15:21.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Animation lags and delayed autos make it sound like your network might be having some problems with packet loss. Essentially that means that parts of your connection were getting damaged along to way to our servers, so then the servers couldn't read the info correctly. If you can grab the network logs from one of those oddly laggy games and let this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them, we should be able to get to the bottom of it. Grab a screenshot of what it shows to post here for me to see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Black Muffìn","date":"2017-10-29T21:53:39.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually have the same issue. However, it's kind of weird. I normally have 12 ms during the whole game, without any ups or downs. Now I'm playing with 15 ms standard ( so i know something is wrong ). \nIt appears my animations are kind of delayed. Also teamfights are absolute horrible as everything is delayed. \nI'm having my FPS capped at 144. ( GTX 1080 ) and MS is constant at 15. \nThe client is slow as a granny without her stick... This all happened since today....","replies":[{"poster":"MOOPOWER","date":"2017-10-29T22:58:26.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here, normally 10-14 ms.. now 16 ms < normally never have 16 ms and as you explained it.

Playing draven was so annoying, sometimes the axes dissapeared, skipped over movements. etc. \nOh yea another thing to add: When i open the client and log in, it seems harder then normally.
