Devourer nerf makes it not even that good despite having seemingly great synergy with them. Her scalings suck too bad for building lots of AD to be good. Armor pen would be good, but almost every armor pen item comes with CDR tacked on and her Q&#039;s reduced cooldown stays at 2 seconds regardless of your CDR. Their base damage sucks, so Trinity Force does like no damage. The best build I&#039;ve found so far is to build one or two AS items and then just go tank, because offensive scaling just flat out blows atm. For the jungle item I&#039;ve been getting blue smite with Warrior enchant. Without the blue smite her chasing potential sucks.","replies":[]}
