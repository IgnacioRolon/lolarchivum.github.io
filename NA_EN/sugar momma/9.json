Landing it is not rocket science, and many other champions are expected to be able to land skill shots of that nature without the assistance of a speed boost.\n\nPoint 3:  It's a design mechanic to prevent her from having a kit that is too highly stacked with mobility.   If she was a fire and run champion, her name would be Teemo, but she has a devastating form of CC that actually walks you into her entire team and several rapid fire abilities that she can unload during that duration.\n\nPoint 4: Hitting additional champions would refresh the duration of the movement speed buff up to the original value.  \n\nPoint 5: If you hit the target, then it's not unreliable.  It's only clunky if you've gotten used to abusing the ability to escape from situations where otherwise you would have to be punished for blowing your ultimate.\n\nThe goal of balancing champions is to be balanced, not logical; and a champion that has three point and click dashes to use at will should have conditional qualifiers for any remaining mobility on her kit.  I personally don't think she needs her extra mobility considering her hard CC, her ability to do true damage and her sustain passive.  These high mobility champions force Riot to make all new AP Mids extra mobile in order to stay competitive; which will only further hurt AP mids struggling for a place in the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"PunisherJBY","date":"2016-02-18T06:06:13.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just pointing out by this logic then {{champion:429}} should only move when she hits a champ and not minions.

He has long range snipe potential, sure, but so do Ezreal, JInx, Gangplank, or Ashe. Does that mean they are assassins too? \n\nThe thing is that Xerath has *multiple* aspects of his kit that center around attacking from a range that one can't realistically do anything about unless they close in a good deal of distance. Same for Jhin with his W and R. Assassins are primarily known for their mobility, yes, but the main defining point that earns someone a primary or secondary tag as an assassin seems to be based on one's ability to forgo counter-play altogether while taking out targets. Characters that can jump over walls, teleport, dash around at high speeds, cloak, and operate starting and ending from positions that give them clear advantages over others for both getting the first hit and not taking the last one tend to be the ones to get the assassin tag, primarily or secondarily.\n \n> Trist is a secondary assassin because (i think) her previous AP build, which had substantial burst and in-and-out potential. She really isnt an assassin anymore. Having mobility doesnt make the assassin (e.g. Kalista, Lucian). \n\nNo, she's secondarily an assassin from her ability to jump on opponents. It has nothing to do with her now removed ap build, especially since that build relied on DoT damage anyway, which isn't bursty at all. She's still a marksman, so she's primarily focused on doing sustained damage, but the secondary tag relates part of her kit to assassins, who love jumping on people and jumping out.\n \n> Yasuo is a primary fighter, secondary assassin. Is his playstyle or build at all similar to Pantheon, Fiora, Irelia, Jax, Vi, or Lee Sin, who all have the same designations? \n\nNot exactly, but those champs you mentioned all operate differently from themselves anyway, so what are you even getting at?\n\nSure, Yas builds crit while most fighters build a combo of defenses and damage, but GP is also a fighter that builds crit.\n\n> And some champions are just labeled Marksmen, like Graves. Others are labeled Marksmen/Fighter, like Quinn. Is Quinn more of a fighter than Graves? \n\nI'd say Quinn's more of a fighter than Graves given how she falls off like one. -_-\n\nKinda weird how that works, though. She's hella strong early, but unlike most adcs, she just falls off the face of the earth after that...and she coincidentally has that fighter tag.\n\n> Morde is also labeled Marksmen/Fighter. Is Morde in any way a marksman like Graves? \n\nMorde is solely a Fighter. Someone is fucking with the tags on the wiki page.\n \n> Edit - and apparently Diana isnt an assassin. She is a fighter/mage. Doesnt Diana fit a Assassin/fighter (or fighter/assassin) archetype? Is Xerath more of an assassin than Diana? \n\nFrom the champ spotlight, Diana's actually supposed to be a mix between 3 things: Fighter/Mage/Assassin. I guess the reason why the assassin tag is dropped off is because Diana can only assassinate properly if she lands a Q, so her mobility towards targeted champs is extremely limited. Her fat as fuck shield on a decently low cd + her passive also makes her a decent pick for more drawn out fights if need be, unlike assassins who don't even want to be in range of anyone unless their spell rotation is up.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-02-18T04:43:53.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long range is hardly assassin. Is Lux an assasin then? Corki? Ziggs? Velkoz? There are a ton of poke mages out there that rely on being out of range to attack, forgoing any counterplay that doesnt revolve around quickly closing the distance or dodging skillshots. If you arent going to label most of the poke/long range mages in the game as assasins, i dont know why Xerath is so special. To me, id rather say \"OK. Riot messed up in labels\" than try and force a label that just doesnt fit very well. \n\nI listed those champions like Vi, Lee Sin, and Pantheon because their build is generally one or two offensive items then defensive items. They synergize well with the mess of bruiser items that just came out, like Black Cleaver, Titanic Hydra, Deadmans plate, and Steraks. It allows them to frontline for their team for a bit, while still being able to 1v1 carries for the majority of the game. Yasuo does not fit this playstyle. His gameplay is more similar to a Yi (At least, old carry Yi not bruiser yi)- get in the fight, do a bunch of damage, and either blow up the enemy team or get blown up. Tanky yasuo just doesnt provide that much for this team. \n\nWhile Gangplank does build crit, he is either regulated to Barrel + Q poke with a full offensive build but can still function as a frontliner with a couple defensive items. It just so happens that his full offensive build is popular. Yasuo never really build any defensive items. It was either the Stattik + IE rush on release, Statik + BotRK for splitpush, Statik + Trinity, then now the Stattik + IE with the mastery changes again. I have not seen a Yasuo build defensive bruiser items like a Deadmans Plate or Titanic unless they got wreaked in lane. \n \nI still maintain that Trist is a secondary assassin from her old AP build. You have mobility to reset yourself in fights, but a Tristana isnt really jumping into the backline, killing a carry, then jumping out, right? Youre either jumping forward to clean up fights or jumping to reset your positioning. You dont have the \"dive the backline and kill them before they kill me\" playstyle that other assassins have. \n\nAnd Morde has been listed as Marksman/Fighter. Were you not here for the past 4 or so months? There were a ton of threads talking about it.

To me, she is more of a burst-ADC. And she doesnt really fall off - her build(s) do. If you build her as a top lane bruiser, of course she falls off - she is an ADC. Build any ADC with 2-3 bruiser items and their damage will fall off, just by the nature of balance. Build her like an ADC, and her damage stays extremely relevant - especially since she can chase as well as a Vayne can. Build any ADC with Ghostblade, Maw, and Steraks and their damage will fall off. \n\nAnd id say Quinn is less of a fighter than Graves. Graves has the playstyle of a fighter - go in, burst down a target while being semi-tanky, then wait for your rotations to come up again. There is no build on Graves that can take down tanks, towers, or objectives as quickly as other Marksmen. \n\nAnd other assassins have some drawbacks to their assassination as much as Diana does. Fizz, for example, needs the shark to land to assassinate until he gets 3 or so items. Kha requires isolated targets. Having a condition of assassination doesnt take anything away from her playstyle. Is she supposed to peel? Frontline? Take poke? Probably not - if you can dive the backline and assassinate a carry, that is probably your best option.","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2016-02-18T05:20:40.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaoticPinecone,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=rEqItqEl,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-02-18T04:43:53.198+0000)\n>\n> Long range is hardly assassin. Is Lux an assasin then? Corki? Ziggs? Velkoz? \n\nCorki, Ziggs, and Vel don't have the range Xerath or Jhin have. Xerath and Jhin can finish someone off from literally a lane's length away, if not more. How do you counter-play that distance? You don't. You just die. Assassins work by forgoing counter-play and landing kills. All those guys you mentioned can be reached by some champs assuming they have access to dashes/jumps/blinks/whatever. You aren't reaching Xerath or Jhin from the other side of a lane.\n\nAlso, these are \"secondary\" tags, meaning they're not defining parts of their play styles, but rather tags that better paint the picture of what their kits do.\n \n> I listed those champions like Vi, Lee Sin, and Pantheon because their build is generally one or two offensive items then defensive items. They synergize well with the mess of bruiser items that just came out, like Black Cleaver, Titanic Hydra, Deadmans plate, and Steraks. It allows them to frontline for their team for a bit, while still being able to 1v1 carries for the majority of the game. Yasuo does not fit this playstyle...\n\n1) Yasuo doesn't relate to Yi at all. Yi just autos. Yasuo uses a combination of skills to both defend himself, close in on opponents, set up his own combos, and take on enemies. He's as light as Yi, yes, but all Yi does is run in at high speeds with ult, cut people down, and run out hopefully before his ult ends.\n\n2) Fighters build a huge number of things. Sometimes they build one or two offensive items. Sometimes they have ad on almost everything they buy. The class is very broad as a whole, and you can't use something as flimsy as \"items some fighters build\" as a way to identify who's a fighter.\n \n> While Gangplank does build crit, he is either regulated to Barrel + Q poke with a full offensive build but can still function as a frontliner with a couple defensive items...\n\nDoesn't even fucking matter.\n\n> I still maintain that Trist is a secondary assassin from her old AP build. You have mobility to reset yourself in fights, but a Tristana isnt really jumping into the backline, killing a carry, then jumping out, right? \n\nAlright, with this said...\n\n> **You're either jumping forward to clean up fights** or jumping to reset your positioning. You dont have the \"dive the backline and kill them before they kill me\" playstyle that other assassins have.\n\nI have to ask if you're serious. It's a secondary tag. She isn't fucking Zed, but the tag indicates that she has the *potential* to jump in on stragglers, kill them and get the reset, and jump out. Just like how Vayne can enter a fight, speed up while running towards prime targets, ult, cloak herself with her Q, reappear and initiate her offensive with the upper-hand seeing how you can't outrun her due to her passives and you can't even target her first without a pink. They're secondary tags for a reason. They just round out the description. Don't be thick-headed.\n\n\n> And Morde has been listed as Marksman/Fighter. \n\nEither open your client and look at Morde's tags yourself or don't respond to me anymore from this point forward.\n\n> What does Quinn have that allows her to be a fighter? To me, she is more of a burst-ADC. And she doesnt really fall off\n\nStopped reading there.\n\n> And id say Quinn is less of a fighter than Graves. Graves has the playstyle of a fighter - go in, burst down a target while being semi-tanky, then wait for your rotations to come up again. There is no build on Graves that can take down tanks, towers, or objectives as quickly as other Marksmen. \n\nAnyone would be semi-tanky if they copied Graves's build verbatim, and the only reason why he builds it is because his shotgun makes him ridiculous while stacking ad, unlike other marksmen who sort of need crits. I imagine Quinn gets the tag because how her kit flows together between vaulting off of champs, which slows them, and forcing them into a prolonged engagement while being pretty short ranged herself makes her relate to fighters more. Graves has high damage, but he doesn't have tools to force people into fighting him. Even Illaoi holds your soul hostage, technically. But that's my best guess.\n \n> And other assassins have some drawbacks to their assassination as much as Diana does. Fizz, for example, needs the shark to land to assassinate until he gets 3 or so items. Kha requires isolated targets. Having a condition of assassination doesnt take anything away from her playstyle. Is she supposed to peel? Frontline? Take poke? Probably not - if you can dive the backline and assassinate a carry, that is probably your best option.\n\nFizz IS primarily an assassin, for starters, and even if he misses his shark, he can still be as mobile as he wants. Diana's mobility in general is absolute shit until she lands a Q...otherwise she puts herself in front of the enemy without a complete rotation. Still, Diana does have tools to force prolonged engagements between getting two casts of R and her E, which blocks all attempts at escape when used properly. So yea, Fighter/Mage that would be a fighter/mage/assassin if Riot used three tags.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2016-02-18T17:19:37.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny you think im \"thick headed\". Lets look at some numbers:\n\nXerath range on Q - 750-1400\nZIggs range on Q - 850-1400\n\nXerath Range on W - 1100\nZiggs Range on W - 1000\n\nXerath Range on E - 1050\nZiggs Range on E - 950 to center (1062.5 max range)\n\nXerath Range on Ult - 3200/4400/5600\nZigs Range on Ult - 5200\n\nFor most of the game ZIggs actually has more range than Xerath. Assassin then, right? Because he picks off targets from long range? If you look at the numbers, so does Lux. So Lux is also an assassin, because she picks off targets from long range. right? \n\nWhy is it so hard for you to believe that some of the champion designations are wrong? \n___________________________________\nMorde was labeled a marksmen after his rework until they allowed his W to proc off of minions. Then he was changed to just fighter. So let me ask you a question - when Morde could not use his W on minions he was classified as a Marksman, but when his W is allowed on minions he loses that designation. Why? What difference did using his W on minions make that made him lose his Marksmen status? \n________________\nGraves' build is a product of his kit, not the other way around. He has a shotgun mechanic that doesnt allow him to consistently autoattack from range - he has some downtime in his attacks. Plus, he has short range, and does more damage the closer he is to a target. Also, he cannot bypass a target with his attacks. And his E stacks indefinitely as long as you have a little attack speed, giving him a large amount of defensive bonuses by staying in the fray and fighting, not waiting for opportunities to auto. \n\nGraves does more damage building crit like other ADCs - but intead of \"critting\", it gives him more pellets per auto. So while a normal Auto gives 4 pellets (for a max of around 220% AD damage point blank) an IE Crit would give 10 pellets (for a max of around 440% AD damage point blank). His crit based damage is insane, but his required short range is what stops people from building full ADC. Its a similar reason to why people dont go full AD Darius - you can wipe out an entire team with as Q, but youll be blown up before you even get close. \n\nNot sure why \"having tools to force fights\" is necessary before labeling Graves a fighter. Garen doesnt have tools to force fights. Neither does Morde. And some ADCs have tools to force fights (Ashe, Varus, Vayne) but are not labeled fighters. \n________________________\nIgnoring an argument just means you have no response. \n______________________\nWhat makes Diana more of a Mage than an Assassin? Why is Ekko labeled an Assasin/Fighter but not a mage? Doesnt Diana rely on her Assasin playstyle as much as Ekko relies on his? Doesnt EKko rely on his Mage abilities as much as Diana relies on hers?\n\nWhy is it so hard to believe that Riot's categorization of champions isnt always right? Why are you insisting that the categorizations are 100% correct, even if they arent consistent across champions?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Whut Thuh ","date":"2016-02-18T03:22:41.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her ult is on such a low cd though. like you could roam to bot and get a kill and by the time your finished walking to top lane its back up","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2016-02-18T05:55:48.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux has a lower cooldown, Talon ult has a lower cooldown(not really good example though), fizz ult has a lower cooldown, leblanc ults cooldown is way lower and allows her much more damage.

It works on almost every other midlaner, except those with superior teamfight ults. Sure her ult is godly for roaming, but its so so easy to just ward, then back off. This meta favors the ADC's with mobility, so if you play a meta champ, you can easily just walk back. If you are shoved up to their turret, then it doesnt matter if its ahri, or anyone else, the gank will be succesful. If her botlane follows up with an engage, well then its the same situation. Its easy to deny her by playing like its any other midlaner, and warding bot lane. If your midlaner is pinging MIA then there isnt much you can do other than pay attention to all lanes at once.

Xerath Q is instant, goes through minons and has longer range, but thats not op. Ziggs as well. Its not a good arguement to say that ahris Q is op because it goes through minons, and its better because others don't. You basically have to land 2 skill shots to = one from another midlaner.
