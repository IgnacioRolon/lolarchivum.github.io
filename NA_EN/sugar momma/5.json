Why not allow us to queue for 3, 4, (or even 5?) individual roles instead of having to do a primary role + fill) I have to imagine it would reduce wait times too because more roles would end up getting filled. \n\nSo you&#039;d be required to do a primary + secondary role, but you could queue up to 5 different roles (queueing for 5 would be like fill, except you could order your preferences if you have any). \n\nI know for me personally, I play Support, ADC, and Mid all about equally and I would rather just be able to choose between those 3 every game.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-02-18T01:39:54.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just do what i do... CHOOSE FILL \n\nand if you get the one role you dont want ( for me its mid) just say hey team im autofilled does any one want MID ( or whatever role you got you dont want) and 90% of the time someone will swap ... if not play that one role for that one fukin game \n\nPROBLEM SOLVED","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-02-18T01:14:42.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would queue for anything except ADC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryanhks","date":"2017-02-18T01:12:45.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this idea. I like to play jg mid and top. And I don't mind support. But I am a huge  liability at adc, so if I could que for all except adc I'd like that.
