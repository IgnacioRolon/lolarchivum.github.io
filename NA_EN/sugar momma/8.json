Okay, I get that its active is powerful and it should be more expensive. But what if you&#039;re an AP champ who doesn&#039;t need the active but needs armor? With all the AD comps running around these days, the answer is: Too bad, gotta spend that cash.\n\nRiot, please, AD champs get {{item:3139}}  and {{item:3156}}  which are both very cost-efficient and have _very_ good actives/passives.

The problem is, all AD champs need at the core is AD and any amount they buy is going to be more cost-efficient than AP on it's own because AP absolutely need mana and/or mana regeneration and/or CDR.\n\nMost importantly, early first-back items that build into actual items for AP all need to be reworked and improved/merged. Sheen is offensive and supports mana but demands taking risks and doesn't help sustain. Catalyst is a decent sustain item but gives literally nothing offensively until it's often too late. Chalice gives enough mana to lane but is hardly more than a burden against AD champions. Codex may give CDR but doesn't help with mana/regen so you basically just run out faster. Aether Wisp gives mobility at the expense of everything else. Seeker's Armguard may help against AD champs but requires time to come into full power and is just not sufficient in terms of sustain or even protection with all the armor pen running around now.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, i say scrap Zhonyas and it's active so that people can stop saying 'But you have Zhonyas you don't need anything else!', and build us a pair of genuinely good anti-AD items for mages. You want to stop an AD's burst combo? A purely anti AD shield that functions similarly to Maw's anti-magic shield would do the job perfectly without having Zhonya's massive downsides.\n\nSomething could also be done to make fully stacking Archangel's Staff more rewarding.","replies":[{"poster":"KillerKell","date":"2016-02-24T03:22:03.265+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"Something could also be done to make fully stacking Archangel's Staff more rewarding.\"\n\nI don't understand.  MORE Rewarding?\n\nArchangel's Staff is the Highest AP Item IN THE GAME.  No item, on it's own, delivers more AP.  That INCLUDES Rabadon's Deathcap, giving itself the Passive.  So it gives a crap ton of Mana, I believe the most Mana in the Game (well, the AD Version I believe gives equal Mana since both derive from the Tear) and the most AP.\n\nWhat more, really, should it do?\n\nThe drawback is you have to wait for the power spike, you have to play for the Late Game... and in the current meta no one plays for a late game.\n\nThe main drawback to Archangel's Staff is that the primary item to compliment it ALSO requires a Ten Minute Wait once complete (Rod of Ages).  But this is off-set by Archangel's often being the ONLY Mana Item you need in your build... and it hitting harder than a Rabadon's on top of that is some serious icing on that AP Cake.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-23T18:58:54.156+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":50,"body":"{{item:3050}} is it not good enough because it's a support item?","replies":[{"poster":"Cherysse","date":"2016-02-23T19:17:44.221+0000","up_votes":46,"down_votes":1,"body":"because it requires a partner to be fully eficient, the AP is low, etc","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-23T19:18:28.661+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":32,"body":"Well it wouldn't be an early rush.","replies":[{"poster":"XeroKimo","date":"2016-02-23T19:21:44.364+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I think they kinda wanna look for an early rush since Zhonya's to be effective agianst ad mids you actually need the item itself compared to Maw or Mercs, QSS or hexdrinker is sufficient enough to have a winning chance against aps","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-02-23T19:23:25.849+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":29,"body":"The winning chance is late game as AP is a late game stat.

While the enemy assassin is finishing up their Maw you'll probably be farming up your last few hundred gold for a NLR, but it's not even easy to reach this point because you've been sitting on 1k gold while they've spent gold incrementally on their smooth build path item, meaning that you're at a gigantic item deficit while waiting on your NLR.
