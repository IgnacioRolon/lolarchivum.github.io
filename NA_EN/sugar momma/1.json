The team using it makes no choice/gameplay with it other than which lane and when to deploy it. They don't interact with it, control it, and it doesn't do anything for their team other than harass the enemy team. The team defending against it is forced to fight this monster that ignores them.\n\nIt definitely will have strategic value in terms of opening up rotations for macro play, but even for the high level of play where this even matters, it will still be seen more as something that's necessary than as something that's engaging or fun.  In lower elos it'll just be seen as annoying and/or useless.\n\nAnd ultimately, if it&#039;s any good it&#039;s going to be nerfed because of how un-interactive it is, so it&#039;ll end up being fairly useless and never taken, which leaves us where this change was supposed to fix in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-04-25T20:37:26.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... it almost reminds me of an item that exists already.

I think it's an ingenious solution to putting pressure on a single lane without making using it super awkward, or overpowered, which the buff system before did. What is 'engaging' or 'fun' about baron buff? or dragon buff? they just have strategic value, in stats mostly. Rift herald couldn't be that big, so they came up with this. I think you need to take another look at how the game currently works around objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2017-04-25T20:05:07.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how it works around objectives.

But seriously, The drake really only gives you a stat buff, and Baron gives you an aura that affects minions. You seriously think those buffs and auras, are more fun than the ability to summon a giant tower pushing threat?\n\nAlso, even if you don't control it directly, your always playing around it. It gives you a ton of strategic value, that leaves you with options. You can either defended it from attackers while it helps you push, you could also let it push on it's own, and answer elsewhere on the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MalrothDragonia","date":"2017-04-26T14:36:08.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again your comment focuses on just things that buff your champion and your ability to 'get kills' as other people have pointed out on this post, having pushing pressure that isn't a champion can open up other play styles and strategy. It makes top lane worth fighting over early instead of it just being an island. Seriously, you need to take a look at some fundamentals. Then you will understand why this herald update looks fairly promising.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-25T20:14:28.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR It will make bot stop being a party lane.","replies":[]}]}
