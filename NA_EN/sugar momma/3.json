I don't hate {{champion:53}} ( I actually think he's adorable).\r\n\r\nAs a support main, I hate talking about certain supports that need to be nerfed. I've played them all, and I love it when supports are powerful and impactful in the game.\r\n\r\nExcept when they are powerful at the expense of every other support/champion {{champion:53}} .\r\n\r\nThis is not a QQ thread. I just feel like people have a fear of talking about Blitz's power level because they feel like if they lost to Blitz it means THEY played badly. People say \"just learn to dodge hook noob.\" Alright, if it's that easy to beat Blitzcrank, how do you explain that his win rate in Platinum elo and higher is HIGHER than in lower divisions? \r\n\r\nNot only is his win rate the highest of all supports, but he has *no* losing matchups *at all*. \r\n\r\nNot a single ADC/support can consistently manage to have a win rate of 50 percent or higher against Blitz (Sivir and Leona are the only two that come close; *sometimes* they reach 50 percent). \r\n\r\nRiot, this really is an issue that needs to be addressed. Blitz is killing not only champion diversity (why pick {{champion:1}}  or {{champion:63}}  or {{champion:43}}  or {{champion:40}}  or {{champion:267}}  or {{champion:16}}  or {{champion:37}} or {{champion:26}} or {{champion:143}}  or {{champion:117}}  if Blitz is open? If you pick any of these supports you are going into lane at an automatic disadvantage if they pick blitz) but Blitz is killing STRATEGIC diversity bot lane as well. His presence automatically makes bot lane an all-or-nothing full kill lane situation, and it gets old *very* fast.\r\n\r\nI don't know precisely what about Blitzcrank should be nerfed. Perhaps make his grab travel time slightly longer? Make his W give less movement speed and/or attack speed? Make his ult do less damage? Nerf the CD on his passive? Have his passive actually consume mana? \r\n\r\nJust throwing ideas out there. Again, this is not a QQ thread, and I don't think {{champion:53}}  should get a {{champion:45}}  or {{champion:38}}  treatment, but please, Riot, reduce his power level a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"The5lacker","date":"2015-03-16T03:10:30.818+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":2,"body":"Blitz has an old, bad, all-or-nothing, one-trick-pony kit. All he can do is grab someone, fist them, and disable them for a solid three seconds.

My problem with Blitz is the 8 second 32% MS buff that makes chasing him to punish him for being out of position impossible. People always complain about dashes, but I'd much rather chase a Riven than a Blitz. At least a Riven will have to burn her dashes to damage you in the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2015-03-16T20:51:52.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"I agree with you, but also don't agree\n\nBlitz can do more than pull, grab and silence you in lane\n\nHe can also zone like a mother fucker just for being there, he can run in, knock up and then pull you as you try to escape\n\nHe isn't OP, nor is his Q too strong;  any number of supports can beat him, if played well.  {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:16}} etc\n\nits a player by player matchup.  if he comes to lane and asserts his dominance before you even hit level 2, then its your fault and you deserve to live in fear of the hand, but if you play smart, you can play around blitz strengths and weaknesses and punish him for his high mana costs and total lack of sustain.\n\nBlitz is a total pubstomper but is completely balanced in any league that is gold 5 and above","replies":[{"poster":"Ethri","date":"2015-03-16T21:19:16.873+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DeusVult,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Tt8dTPOo,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2015-03-16T20:51:52.920+0000)\n> He isn't OP, nor is his Q too strong;  any number of supports can beat him, if played well.  {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:16}} etc\n> \n> its a player by player matchup.  if he comes to lane and asserts his dominance before you even hit level 2, then its your fault and you deserve to live in fear of the hand, but if you play smart, you can play around blitz strengths and weaknesses and punish him for his high mana costs and total lack of sustain.\n> \n> Blitz is a total pubstomper but is completely balanced in any league that is gold 5 and above\n\nFirst off, I don't think lane phase is the best phase for Blitzcrank.  I have played against him plenty of times as Lulu and I can usually win the match up assuming there is no pressure bot.  However, having no pressure bot lane is very unrealistic and Blitzcrank is very good at saving his skills to assist with ganks.\n\nAfter lane phase (or roaming during lane phase), is when Blitzcrank shines.  His pick potential is insanely high.  Also, I think you missed the point where his highest win rate is actually ABOVE gold 5.  Hence he is not simply a pub stomper.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WolfChases","date":"2015-03-16T03:11:15.484+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate playing against Blitz...Especially if I my lane is pushed and he is in the bush that we can't ward because he'll pull us and than there's situation when:\n\n-Enemy ADC freezes the lane\n-Enemy Blitzkrank is waiting in the bush near our turret\n-If someone (me or my supp) tries to ward it, he'll get pulled and potentially killed\n \n= Enemy ADC gets the free fucking farm in that kind of situation which happens almost every single time I am playing against Blitz.","replies":[{"poster":"JC DarkOmen","date":"2015-03-16T19:45:45.057+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"then don't push in the first place, ward the river and stay on that side of the creep wave, and... wait, you can't ward a bush without getting in grab range? just walk into the minion wave and ward the very outside of the bush. the minion will get pulled and you can punish blitz for his mistake. i bait blitz pulls for fun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hell Week","date":"2015-03-16T02:21:35.908+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":45,"body":"just dodge his q","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2015-03-16T02:27:37.559+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":5,"body":"Easier said than done. \n\nHis win rate is 57 percent now in Platinum Elo and higher.

People say \"just learn to dodge hook noob.\" Alright, if it's that easy to beat Blitzcrank, how do you explain that his win rate in Platinum elo and higher is HIGHER than in lower divisions? \n> \n> Not only is his win rate the highest of all supports, but he has *no* losing matchups *at all*. \n> \n> Not a single ADC/support can consistently manage to have a win rate of 50 percent or higher against Blitz (Sivir and Leona are the only two that come close; *sometimes* they reach 50 percent). \n> \n> Riot, this really is an issue that needs to be addressed. Blitz is killing not only champion diversity (why pick {{champion:1}}  or {{champion:63}}  or {{champion:43}}  or {{champion:40}}  or {{champion:267}}  or {{champion:16}}  or {{champion:37}} or {{champion:26}} or {{champion:143}}  or {{champion:117}}  if Blitz is open? If you pick any of these supports you are going into lane at an automatic disadvantage if they pick blitz) but Blitz is killing STRATEGIC diversity bot lane as well. His presence automatically makes bot lane an all-or-nothing full kill lane situation, and it gets old *very* fast.\n> \n> I don't know precisely what about Blitzcrank should be nerfed. Perhaps make his grab travel time slightly longer? Make his W give less movement speed and/or attack speed? Make his ult do less damage? Nerf the CD on his passive? Have his passive actually consume mana? \n> \n> Just throwing ideas out there. Again, this is not a QQ thread, and I don't think {{champion:53}}  should get a {{champion:45}}  or {{champion:38}}  treatment, but please, Riot, reduce his power level a bit.\n\nI enjoy seeing Blitz MUCH more than Thresh. In my opinion Thresh is the death of diversity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"76Summers","date":"2015-03-16T16:11:58.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not blitzcrank... its the meta.... squishies everywhere...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Japan","date":"2015-03-16T07:40:41.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ey, I went against a sivir+Morgana lane as blitzcrank.

Blitz is a very old and toxic design not even because all his power belongs to the Q it's that he can out run you then knock you up, silence and grab you while dealing pretty decent damage on his own also. His Q simply just has too much power, one Q WILL decide a teamfight and can win you the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sugar Momma","date":"2015-03-16T02:31:05.818+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"He was balanced before; he can be balanced again.

Blitz started creeping up in win rate as Thresh, Braum and Morgana were nerfed very hard. All three of these are very good picks into Blitz and were the only three supports picked for a while.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Guineasaurus Rex","date":"2015-03-17T06:49:10.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"give his grab a little longer range but make it so it grabs allies too","replies":[{"poster":"FattyPainBringer","date":"2015-03-17T13:58:28.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actuly i would love to be able to grab allies with blitz's grab.

A good blitz player can easily land a hook no problem even if someone is good at dodging. As a bot lane main, i can confirm this. The only way to really 100% to play around blitz is to prevent him from getting into position. He adds a ton of pressure on a lane, especially without a morgana, sivir. \n\nHere is why. A good blitz will just run around the minion wave with w, get close, and q. The hit box is so wide on q that its almost impossible to dodge at that point unless the blitz just misses or the adc has a dash/flash up. The adc at that point has to just walk away from lane. in team fights, the ability to separate someone by a good distance from his/her team, knock them up, silence them, all while doing a ton of dmg if the build is right.\n\nI think the best way to change blitz in theshort-run is to lower his q width by a bit, make his w ramp up to speed instead of instant speed, and maybe reduce his ult dmg (but i would change his e to ap%, instead of %ad on hit). I would change his q and w first because those are the main problems, especially since his q has an insanely low cooldown for having a HUGE hit area. I would chang eit to be about halfway between what is is now and nidalee q width.","replies":[{"poster":"FattyPainBringer","date":"2015-03-17T13:43:31.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh oh oh please narrow the width so it will be eaiser to reach between minons and yank you out by your toes from behind the minon wave.

In lane make sure there is always a ward in the brushes and never venture far from your turret without any minions and take advantage of him if he misses his Q. I rather deal with Blitz than something like Annie or Tresh that has more utility and annoying factor than a Blitz who has next to none if he misses his Q","replies":[]}]}
