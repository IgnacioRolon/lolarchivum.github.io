And to be fair, I wouldn't want to see my own teammate with a Bard mid either.","replies":[{"poster":"bwop","date":"2018-02-05T21:35:30.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh I was trying to him support :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bruh im ok","date":"2018-02-06T01:35:43.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should know that bard is support\nvery obvious...... so common sense\nnot try to offense you but don't pretend to be dumb,\njust play seriously. they prevent trolls so that why maybe they ban him or they just have a bad experience with bard or against it","replies":[{"poster":"bwop","date":"2018-02-07T02:08:25.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No...

I'm not a fan of banning my temmate's picks personally, but it makes sens to me that somebody would do so. \n\nI know some high-level streamers occasionally wreck with him in solo lanes, but his passive loses a ton of luster if you're forced to farm with him, his heal won't do anything against many real mid lane champs, and he's really hard to get a solo kill with. I like the idea of being able to portal gank in either direction, but overall, meh.","replies":[{"poster":"bwop","date":"2018-02-05T21:34:26.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I was trying to play him support, the role he is supposed to be played in. I finally got to play him in ONE game and did fairly decent with a KDA of 2/3/13 with over 50 Chimes!!!
