I definitely deserved a punishment (though I'd argue mine was quite heavy handed, considering I haven't even received any warning or anything prior). After emailing into support, they were able to inform me of the game logs, but I assume the bug he's talking about is that many of us just never get them in an email, in the client or otherwise. I've heard of a lot of people just getting a standard disable without any details until they email into support.
