The fps randomly drops from game to game, with one game having 50-60 fps while another game right after having 10-14 fps. The client is closed during games so that isnt my problem. I have no problem in some games while its unplayable in other games. I would appreciate some feedback, thank you. Also, I have updated all my drivers to the latest.","replies":[{"poster":"EQ Fidgetspinner","date":"2017-06-01T00:16:07.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I literally dropped from ~180 to 10-20 since patch 7.5, it's ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-27T21:07:00.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like your pc is hitting some rough spots here and there, but there's a chance it's being caused by some damaged game files too.
