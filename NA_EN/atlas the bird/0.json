Well no, actually it was a rather slow, and annoying process to get there. Here, let me tell you a story. (TL;DR at bottom.)\r\n\r\nNot so long ago, I hit level 30, and after a few dozen practice games, I decided to try ranked. I went 6-4 in provisionals, and placed Mid Silver (2 or 3 I don’t remember.). Not bad I thought, so I decided to play a bit more. I was pretty excited at the time, I felt that’s where I belonged. Until I started playing more.\r\n\r\nI did hit a losing streak, about 4-6 games in a row. I played Hecarim Jungle primarily (Apparently that was my first problem.) and did okay, but ultimately I found myself decaying into Silver 4. From that point I stopped for a while, wanting to practice in non-ranked games with new champions, becoming proficient in every role, and in general trying to learn what works and what doesn’t. I learned a lot in that time, but that didn’t stop me from decaying. Once I realized how much LP decay hurts, I reluctantly started getting back into ranked, in which I did a little better, but still not fantastic. After ultimately losing more LP, I stopped playing ranked again, vowing not to touch it for a while. Then I just started playing more casually with my friends, again trying new champs, learning the game, techniques, etc. I was in Silver 5 now, 0 LP, and played almost exclusively casual.\r\n\r\nThen the LP Decay demon hit again, threatening to demote me if I didn’t play more. One of my friends reported to me that I couldn’t drop out of Silver 5 to Bronze from LP decay, although apparently he was wrong. After more than a month of inactivity, to my surprise, I was in Bronze 1.\r\n\r\nI honestly don’t know if I belong here, maybe I’m not good enough at the game, maybe I can and should carry myself out of Bronze. But I honestly tried. I want to get better at this game, I really do, and I’m open to any tips people may have. However with the ranked rewards dangling in front of my face, I really want out of Bronze this season. And so, if there are any kind souls willing to carry me out of Bronze 1 and into Silver at least, I would be most appreciative. \r\n\r\nTL;DR : Someone carry me out of Bronze 1, or at least give me tips on how to get better, thanks.\r\n\r\nPS: Rito, I really hate how you removed LP decay for Silver and Gold players AFTER I decay out of it.

Gank lanes, get some laners ahead. Then, you should win more than you lose.\n\nEDIT: Also, since everyone at every elo is trying hard to \"carry,\" there are often too few players just trying to set up plays for their teammates. So, it is often a good idea to play junglers that help your teammates make plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2014-10-15T08:04:04.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this is true and there is also the fact that champions that are good at setting up plays for allies are often always useful as long as they have some levels since they often have high amounts of crowd control which is useful even if you messed up or didn't farm very well and such","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EwokSoldier","date":"2014-10-15T03:21:04.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are interested in improving I hope I can be of some help =) If you are interested check out my [thread](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/RKAOgFWa-do-you-need-help-improving?)\n\nI do not duo to carry you out, but I can help you get better =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeroUS","date":"2014-10-15T02:29:29.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was placed in silver and fell all the way to b5.
