I feel the changing of these champions is going to drastically rise the levels of skill required by new players. After reworks many of the champions become very overpowered are picked constantly then drop out of the meta after repeated nerfs which also cause them to have extremely low win rates ie. Poppy(47% in best role still in a better place than before), and Fiora who despite her being \"OP\" has a 46% win rate. However there is the issue with ryze splashes, as the proud owner of Zombie and Pirate Ryze i feel that the need of a visual update is necessary. Additionally Ryze already received a small change in the middle of last season drastically nerfing his e while upping his reliance on his q and w. \n\nSaying this as a huge fan of the game who will continue to play the game completely regardless of this and will probably still play ryze too,\n\nDavidlikeseggs{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-04-20T23:51:58.507+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"While he is still in meta he is definitely hard to balance.

Lee Sin has to find someone out of position and kick them into his team, move around the battle field to deal damage without taking too much damage, if he has to fall back on a tank build to survive then his damage potential is weakened and he has to lean on utility.\n\nRyze runs at people and casts spells until they die. He does it in a way that's a major pain in the ass to perform, but strategically it's just 1: move forward 2: cast spells and either he has enough stats to make the enemy move back until he gets an objective, or he isn't farmed enough yet and the enemy fights back and kills him.\n\nAnd with other difficult to play champions, players understand that those champions are difficult to play, they realize why they can't just pick up Lee Sin, land skill shots, and perform perfect tower dives without just dying. Ryze however is often completely misidentified by players as easy to play. Before the rework that changed his Q to a skillshot, players thought he was one of the easiest champions in the game when statistics showed that he had one of the highest skill floors of any champion and was almost completely useless if your ping wasn't well below 100. That sentiment has lessened a lot since the change to Q, but I still see players from time to time see a Ryze game and say \"Oh that champion looks easy, you just spam all your spells and win\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ricky Spanish DC","date":"2016-04-23T01:49:18.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like his kit right now- maybe his ult could use a change, but otherwise he is good. Imo the problem is the numbers. All you need to do is buy a rod of ages and have a decent amount of cdr, and you have a 2 second easy to hit q spam with big damage. His scalings are a bit too high- maybe giving q a slight cast time or making the projectile slower/easier to dodge would give him more counterplay.
