{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2015-12-09T20:37:26.388+0000","title":"Skin Team Hard at Work","subforum":"Story, Art, & Sound","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"After noting a remark from someone protesting the lack of a new skin for Viktor, I decided to sit down and take a look at what all has been released in the past year.\n\nIf we include Legacy Skins from Harrowing/Snowdown/Worlds since September 1st, 2014... 108 of 128 champions have had a new skin. Personally, I don&#039;t like to include Legacy Skins because they are limited availability and essentially useless to anyone that starts up the game and takes a liking to a character. But even if we disregard Legacy skins, we still have 93 of 128 champions with new skins in the past sixteen months. That&#039;s a noteworthy accomplishment for Riot, even if some of the skins fell short of the expectations of those that main those champions.\n\nIt would be my guess that some of these long waiting champions will soon get a skin. Presenting the remaining 35 in the order in which they haven&#039;t had a non legacy skin we have: *{Indicates order if including Legacy}*\n\n1) Leblanc - Wicked November 2010 - Legacy Mistletoe December 2011 - Legacy Ravenborn October 2014 - I&#039;m a bit surprised she hasn&#039;t had any love for what I thought was the poster child of Assassin Mages. It might be a short wait as there are others that don&#039;t even have Legacy skins in their recent history.\n\n2) *[1]* Yorick - Pentakill June 2011 - I guess this guy is pending rework, so he might not see any skins in the near future.\n\n3) *[2]* Sion - Warmonger July 2011 - Rework has been over for a long time. I would think he would be a &quot;large&quot; candidate for the skin creation team.\n\n4) *[3]* Taric - Bloodstone August 2011 - Another champion on the rework block.\n\n5) Nunu - Demolisher August 2011 - Zombie November 2015 - I&#039;m sure those that did play Nunu appreciated the new skin, even if it was Legacy. If Leblanc is any indication, it may be a solid year before he sees a regular skin in his closet.\n\n6) Karthus - Pentakill August 2011 - Fnatic September 2014 - I don&#039;t believe this guy is on the table for rework, so possibly soon? Better get those community ideas out there for this guy.\n\n7) Malzahar - Overlord September 2011 - Snowday December 2014 - In the same boat as Leblanc.\n\n8) *[4]* Kennen - Arctic Ops December 2011 - Shocking to see him in the top ten.\n\n9) Wukong - Jade Dragon January 2012 - Underworld October 2014 - Another passenger on the S.S.Legacy.\n\n10) Talon - Dragonblade January 2012 - SSW May 2015 - Not really expecting to see this one soon with the somewhat recent Legacy skin release. \n\n11) *[5]* Poppy - Scarlet Hammer February 2012 - Fresh off rework so it might be a little while before we see something new on her.\n\n12) Orianna - Bladecraft February 2012 - TPA May 2013 - Winter Wonder December 2014 - I wonder if she qualifies as a passenger or cargo.\n\n13) *[6]* Urgot - Battlecast March 2012 - For some reason, Gentleman Urgot sounds like a hilarious idea.\n\n14) *[11]* Shen - Warlord April 2012 - TPA May 2013 - I guess this guy is going to be reworked after Taric. It could be a bit longer.\n\n15) *[7]* Swain - Tyrant May 2012 - I&#039;m surprised this guy hasn&#039;t been given any recent skins.\n\n16) Singed - Augmented July 2012 - Snow Day December 2013 - SSW May 2015 - Probably won&#039;t be any time soon with the recent Legacy addition.\n\n17) *[8]* Nocturne - Eternum December 2012 - This has to be on the drawing board.\n\n18) *[9]* Kayle - Aether Wing January 2013 - With her sister also in this list, perhaps we will see a theme that features them both in the next month or so.\n\n19) *[10]* Cassiopeia - Jade Fang February 2013 - I wonder how they will appease this dedicated fan base.\n\n20) Jarvan IV - Warring Kingdoms February 2013 - Fnatic September 2014 - Even his legacy barely made the cutoff for what I&#039;d label recent.\n\n21) Corki - Dragonwing February 2013 - Fnatic September 2014 - Identical resume to Jarvan.\n\n22) Shyvana - Ice Drake April 2013 - Championship October 2014 - Barely more recent than Jarvan.\n\n23) *[12]* Morgana - Ghostbride June 2013 - Victorious November 2014 - You can&#039;t even buy Victorious skins, so I&#039;m hoping this is on the horizon.\n\n24) Sejuani - Bear Cavalry August 2013 - Poro Rider December 2014 - Probably has a longer wait than any of the others with 2014 Legacy skins.\n\n25) Janna - Forecast September 2013 - Fnatic September 2014 - Apparently missed her September 2015 release.\n\n26) *[13]* Viktor - Creator October 2013 - I feel for that man. Several that made the list before Viktor technically had more recent Legacy skins, but even removing those... Viktor still didn&#039;t make the top ten.\n\n27) *[16]* Zyra - Haunted October 2013 - SKT May 2014 - Thankfully Harrowing wasn&#039;t Legacy that year or we would only have original release skins on her (see Yorick).\n\n28) *[14]* Diana - Lunar Goddess January 2014 - I&#039;m sure this will be soon.\n\n29) *[15]* Rumble - Super Galaxy April 2014 - With roughly 6 skins a month being released, we might see something by March or April next year.\n\n30) *[17]* Lissandra - Blade Queen May 2014 - Possibly on the heels of Rumble, depending on what themes will be coming out.\n\n31) Rengar - Night Hunter May 2014 - SSW May 2015 - Can we expect a non Legacy May 2016 release?\n\n32) Pantheon - Dragon Slayer May 2014 - Slayer November 2015 - Doubt we will see another skin from this guy any time soon but hopefully it won&#039;t be another &quot;Slayer&quot;.\n\n33) *[18]* Maokai - Goalkeeper June 2014 - See Rumble/Lissandra.\n\n34) *[19]* Heimerdinger - Hazmat July 2014 - Ditto.\n\n35) *[20]* Veigar - Final Boss August 2014 - It will be hard to top this, but it might be some time before they get to his next skin.\n\nIt&#039;s worth noting that Veigar barely makes the list with a late August release. Also I can&#039;t reasonably include the Victorious Morgana as a recent Skin since it was a Season Reward, hence her high *{}* ranking.\n\nIf I were a betting man, I would say we might have a Nefarious Themed 750 Skin Line that would include Swain/Urgot/Nocturne/LeBlanc/Zyra in our near future. Who knows?\n\nEdit: This topic was moved from another part of the board.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-12-10T07:06:47.818+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for making this post!

Sometimes skins, for a number of reasons, take a fairly long amount of time to be completed. Sometimes ideas come up that we really love that we think would work well at a certain time of the year.

You are definitely right in thinking that we are trying to make sure no champions are left behind when it comes to getting new skins, although like I said sometimes there are unforseen issues that come up which cause projects to be put on hold or cancelled (which is exactly why we can't talk about skins until they hit PBE).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nefas","date":"2015-12-11T12:08:08.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will most certainly argue the skin team is being negligent as long as any champ that isn't slated for a rework has gone 3+ years without any skins whatsoever like Swain and Kennen.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2015-12-11T15:28:21.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, there isn't a large list of champions that received multiple skins in this sixteen month time frame.

Maybe in two or three months we will have a better idea of where they are going (cycling champions not on this list).

It does not invalidate my statement that there are only two exceptions.\n\nThough I will agree that Nidalee did not seem a good choice for the Challenger Line. Nidalee was in a pretty good position when it came to skins, even if Warring Kingdoms was nearly a year ago. Don't think the community by large would have complained if she had gone another six to eight months without a new one. That said, don't know who I would have rather seen in the Challenger Line. I don't personally like the look of Challenger Ahri and this new Nidalee skin isn't one I would get (and I have 5 of her skins). It just isn't a series I find visually appealing, like the Marauders and Wardens.

Hell, your team managed to adapt the Project Fiora skin to her rework in less than two weeks, but it takes _15 months and counting_ to get a Sion skin released?\n\nFrankly, Riot does not have an impressive track record in showing any love to the champ or desire to do anything positive for Yorick fans since his launch:\n\n* Riot employees continually badmouth him and his fans on Reddit, on Twitter, on these boards and even on LCS broadcasts and to my face...\n* No free week rotation.\n* No new skins in 4.5 years.\n* No merch plans (confirmed multiple times).\n* The artwork on Pentakill Yorick's champion page obscures him behind his icon on purpose.\n* Yorick was barely featured in the Pentakill event last year\n* Yorick's rework constantly skipped for other, easier to fix champs, and so on).\n\nAlso, I keep hearing from the Skins team that Yorick is on a level of technical difficulty that surpasses champs like Elise, Zac and Zyra, making new skins for Yorick too much of a challenge to have bothered with (at least in the year and a half before reworks became a thing), much less in the future.\n\nMaybe things have changed, but I'll need to be shown that before any minds will be changed.  Unfortunately, we're going to have to wait a _full year_, minimum, for Yorick's rework to get done and no guarantee that anything will remain of the the hulking green ghoul we love will remain.\n\nThere's not much to respond to, I'll admit, but that's where I am with the Skins team (and to a greater extent the entirety of Riot Games) and their treatment of Yorick's fans.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2015-12-10T15:29:09.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=gW9Bk64n,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-10T07:06:47.818+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for making this post!
