He should be stuck on the analyst desk. The guy has such a hard-on for korea/china that even during the middle of games they're losing, he'll be praising them for the EXACT SAME THING he just called out a NA or EU team for doing badly. It really doesn't make any sense and drives me insane how biased he is. He has a lot of game knowledge, but during casting he's just so one sided I often turn off sound.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morpey","date":"2015-03-14T23:53:31.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't that ggDoA?

He doesn't have the best ingame knowledge or even the greatest concept of strategy. A color commentator's focus is to keep the audience enticed and to hype up activity. He does his job well, I like to think of him as the Korean (OGN) Rivington! :3","replies":[{"poster":"Circuit Bear","date":"2015-03-15T05:18:16.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rivington drives me crazy and I just accepted he is meant for a different audience. Half the time I can say he is wrong and explain why and sure enough the game proves me right.(There are a lot of fights he says are going one way or that a team should lose that they outright win and it happens five seconds later). And a lot of what Rivington says is gibberish at times that he makes up on the spot(like sort of like he comes up with names for scenarios and stuff that makes no sense.)","replies":[{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-16T14:44:45.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again, color commentator. They are there to hype things up. The analytic commentator (ggCMontecristo to counter ggDoa and Jatt to counter Rivington) are there to correct the Color Commentator and keep them in check. Which is why if you watch LCK, Doa will do play-by-play then Monte will go back and clarify/emphasize.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrPerson10","date":"2015-03-14T23:05:21.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He also corrected himself on the Vi =/= Zed\n\nThough the rammus/rumble slip was kinda derpy.

It's easy to simply say the wrong thing when something else is on your mind. He knows what he's talking about, he just had a slip of the tongue because what was on his mind. It happens to *everyone*.","replies":[]}]}
