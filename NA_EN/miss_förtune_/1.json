It&#039;s better but indeed still not fixed.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could tell, this was the only problem.\r\n&gt; Arcade MF uses the classic auto attack sound when making auto attacks that trigger Love Tap.\r\n\r\nAttacks on targets with Love Tap already applied used the proper Arcade AA sounds.\r\nI could not tell if it was using the proper double &quot;bwip bwoop&quot; sounds for alternating Love Tap applications. Couldn&#039;t hear over the top of the classic AA sounds.\r\nKateykhaos, you are breaking my heart. here is the bug on this video https://youtu.be/9GuzkKp7xqs  and the real love tap sounds is this https://youtu.be/DZ1el_4RwFI?t=1m10s","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-16T17:17:23.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nI'm following up with the team today. \n\nThe bug is logged and in the catalog, so no need to re-post the issue, although, I know you're pretty on top of tracking the status. :)\n\nI think I'd mentioned before that this was a lower priority issue than some other bugs that have come up, but it's not closed out as a won't fix bug.
