Paraphrasing: \"If I hate something, I destroy it. If I want something, I take it\". What if that thing she dislikes is someone's lifework, or the expensive tool they need to feed their kids? If she sees a man being arrested unjustly would she just kill the arresters to set the person free, even if they didn't know and were just doing their job? And if she likes something that someone else needs to survive, or if she likes... someone that doesn't like her back, let's put it that way. Would she just take it? Take... them because they're weaker or can't \"move\" and \"adapt\" fast enough? \nAnd in the minigame that served as her visuak debut, did the men come to her to be tested, or did she use the aftermath of the Black Mist to go around \"testing\" people in a way that to anyone else would seem like ritualistic homicide?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-26T16:08:01.882+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind she believes in reincarnation, and unlike our world has empirical evidence that it exists and that there is life after death. \n\nAs for taking other people's stuff, youre assuming that she would keep it.  She doesnt want you to value stuff..  The common prayer for nagakabouros involves taking some of your money (or stuff) and giving it to the sea.  Symbolically the gesture is saying, I wont hold onto things i dont need.  I will find a way to get more if need more.  \n\nHer god is storms, the sea, and life.  It assumes change will and must happen.   Also  life in the serpent isles is hard, you have to be strong and adaptable to survive.\n   \n\n\nMini game was preharrowing, that man was stagnating and thus st risk of becoming a ghost if he died.

That is the old one, the one that has died trying to stay around.\n\nReincarnation means born again into a new life.  You can't be born again if you haven't died off...FULLY.\n\nAlso, some believe that a ghost is the remnants of the previous life, not the soul itelf, but the aether of their mind.\n\n\nWhich means, while their soul has been reincarnated, a piece of that soul held onto the spark of the previous life and refuse to go on.  If that's the case in Runeterra, then a ghost could possibly meet their reincarnated self (though, with the way they present it, that seems unlikely.  Especially since the previous statement is based more on the seperation of mind body and soul.  The soul moves on, but the mind manifested as a spirit and still haunts places.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2016-01-26T18:19:46.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even once I've seen any evidence reincarnation is a thing in Runeterra.\n\nCare to elaborate on the subject?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoZfan03","date":"2016-01-26T17:32:39.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=E4X1aOHM,comment-id=000100020001,timestamp=2016-01-26T16:08:01.882+0000)\n> Keep in mind she believes in reincarnation, and unlike our world has empirical evidence that it exists and that there is life after death. \n\nWhaaaaat?

It seems like Tahm Kench should certainly have a taunt for Illaoi. Of course, he came out first, but if at the point you all were working on his VO, it was known that Illaoi would be a Bilgewater priestess, why not record a couple taunts for her that would be activated when (or if, in case of very late-stage iceboxing) Illaoi is released? Or for Gangplank's rework — surely he should have lines for someone as significant to him as Illaoi? Something similar would have been great for Azir, emperor of Shurima, and Rek'sai, the terror of regions formerly part of the empire.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-26T15:54:43.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadky its not that simple.
