My screen gets black and after around 10 seconds a message pops up which says \"can't connect to server. Please check your network connection...\". The funny thing is that i can connect to the loadingscreen on NA server, Japanese Server and Oceania Server, but not on EUW, EUNE and Turkey! \r\nI've already tried to reinstall League of Legends (5x) and i flushed my internet connection. I literally tried everything (even resetting my PC)!\r\nI hope some of you are able to help me, because this issue is so terrible and is basically preventing me from playing League of Legends{{item:3070}} \r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\nWinniPoo","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-20T03:19:31.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're only seeing this issue on certain Regions, your connection is probably running into issues along your network routing to those specific sets of servers.

I recommend running a traceroute log with [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) so we can determine where the issue is happening exactly. After loading up WinMTR, plug **185.40.65.1** into the host field and start the trace.

This brand has known to run firmware that can cause issues connecting to League. I recommend reaching out to your ISP and request they push a firmware update to your modem so we can make sure you're running the most updated firmware that is least likely to conflict with League.\n\nIf you encounter further issues after updating that firmware, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"iAmBiOFROST","date":"2017-03-21T15:17:42.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Targons Blade,\nSorry for not replying to you for like a month.\nIt might sound a bit weird, but today I tried to play a game of League of Legends and everything actually worked and I could play the game again.\nThank you for taking time for me and my issue to help me! :)\n\nkind regards,\nWinniPoo","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
