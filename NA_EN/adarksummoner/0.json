I was expecting to hold up their end of the bargain while I hold up mine, having to work on it. Unfortunately when I checked my account, not only had the ban not been un-lifted, but it still told me that today was the date I were unbanned. Any idea why? I have already submitted a ticket. \r\n\r\n\r\n(Fuck)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-15T22:32:17.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's set to Pacific time, and the same time the suspension was applied.  I looked into this for you and it is set to lift today but still a bit to go, about an hour more.  Hang tight!","replies":[]}]}
