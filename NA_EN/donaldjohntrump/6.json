If you couldn't carry them( it that it's easy), you didn't win, and you didn't earn the win. That's just how t works. You could have helped your team get on their feet, been supportive, there are many ways to win with less mechanically experienced teammates.\n\nYou will never get a loss prevention for anything excluding the server shooting itself in the foot and face. When it is 100% Riots fault. Not even from you getting DC'd, which is partially your fault. Only if it is unequivocally RIOTS. This is 100% NOT that.
