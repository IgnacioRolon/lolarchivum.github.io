Essentially, the amount of RAM your pc has means how much 'stuff' your pc can do at one time. Having more RAM means your pc can perform more actions smoothly, like being able to have multiple windows open or running a game at the same time as streaming a movie. \n\nOverall, having more RAM means your pc will have an easier time doing whatever it is that you're trying to do. If you just barely have enough to run League, then you maaaaay not be having a good time. Adding a little more RAM could help, but if you're having FPS issues it could be caused by something entirely different than how much RAM you have. \n\nIf you _are_ having some FPS issues, we can try troubleshooting with our [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting), but definitely let me know if you have any more info I could go off of or any other questions!","replies":[{"poster":"DonaldJohnTrump","date":"2017-04-19T21:28:08.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fps is roughly good...But I realised something strange, When I play on Very high I get like max 70 fps in teamfights and 100 when laning but when I switched to very low I was getting the same amount of FPS. How can that happen? Usually you must have wayyy more fps when you have low settings but for some odd reason that doesn't work to me. Can you give me useful explaination to that and how to fix it? Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-20T21:32:18.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK, if you have really high FPS with the highest settings then those frames probably won't go up very much on low-spec mode. Low-spec mode is designed to help lower end machines handle the game by reducing the workload on the pc. Since you're is running at about 100 fps when laning, running low-spec doesn't help since it's already doing pretty well.","replies":[{"poster":"DonaldJohnTrump","date":"2017-04-21T15:58:31.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok, i get it now, thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
