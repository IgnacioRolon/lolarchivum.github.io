If your team is full of squishies, sure, she just keeps spiking and spiking and becomes an unstoppable monster, but shame on you and the rest of your team for picking 5 squishies. She isn't a real plausible threat in teamfights if your frontline is even decent at their jobs. She's squishy as all hell and if she unloads her burst on you then your carry gets free rain of her team while she waits for cooldowns, or she has to juke around the tanks to get at the squishy, which sets her easy kill combo (q r w w) on cooldown while her w is down. again, while she's looking for an angle on your squishies she's doing nothing for her team and it's a 4v5 fight.\nAnd if she gets behind and can't even burst a squishy, it's game over for her.\nShe's mobile, yes, but using her double mobility also removes most of her burst damage, unless your team decided to clump up and get double distortioned. And other champions punish that grouping much harder than LB (Orianna, Malphite, Gnar, Viktor to name a few)\nLeBlanc is not overly overbearing, unless you try to get in her face as a squishy. \nTL;DR you guys don't realize that her insane burst combo can't be combined with her absurd mobility combo. She has to choose whether to reposition or 1 shot someone squishy, which plenty of other champions can do as well (You don't complain about Syndra's point and click \"I hate you, you're dead\"or Malzahar's \"Okay I'm going to ruin your day no matter how tanky you build\" playstyles.

Just because your squishies happened to not pick tanks doesn't mean you can't protect them. It's called 'zoning', something LB can't really deal with if she wants to explode that squishy. If you see LeBlanc coming toward your squishy teammates, then move yourself in between her and them and force her to deal with you first. \n\nLeBlanc has a team, you're right a couple posts ago, but so does your squishy. If you aren't willing to give him any teamplay, then why are we assuming LeBlanc is getting anything different? \"but what if almost everyone on my team is squishy?\" then you lost at champion select by making poor choices and expecting to not get bit on the ass for it. And as valuable as Banshee's is against LeBlanc, that's not her best item counter - GA is. Because now, yes, she maybe killed your squishy ass, but now her cooldowns are up, annnnd you're back to keep teamfighting while she accomplished pretty much fuck all if someone else her team can't stand on top of you and try to re-kill you. And that's if the Magic Resist on GA even let her kill you at all, especially if paired with Bloodthirster shield. \n\nTL;DR: LeBlanc is obnoxious, and she outright kills squishies that have no protection because that's her actual freaking job. Protect your squishies or don't be surprised when an assassin assassinates. Also, 1 dash in the late-game won't kill a whole wave. Not even with Luden's. The melee minions will survive pretty reliably. In addition, seeing her try to deal with a Bannered minion is goddamn hilarious. Especially if that bannered minion has baron buff.

YOu do realise her biggest damage output comes from aoe? YOu mean stunning her? Good luck. You see a lb can do her combo in about 1 sec easily. For someone to react it will take 0.3-0.4 seconds, that leaves 0.6 or so seconds to actually cast a skill, which is impposible, because no cc in this game is instant. Every cc has cast time/travel time or is a skillshot.\n\nAlso, becauise of lb not long cooldowns she will be able to just go back to safety because her damaging dash can also return her. And then repeat everything again. Also, losing your adc/apc even for 2 seconds or so can mean death for the team.\n\nDo you remember why assasin champs with silence were nerfed and many others? Because they had no counterplay.\n\nI agree with lb being able to burst down squishies, she is an assasin after all, but after doing all her damage she can safelly go back with no penalty? That is bullshit. When i play talon or rengar i have to constantly think how the fck am i going to get out. Lb? Jump, Jump, Jump back. Thats it.\n\n\n\nTL:DR. I dont care if leblanc has shitloads of damage, she is an assasin after all. But she is far too safe for her job. Even zed is not as safe as her and gives a bigger window of opportunity against her.

No, that's just her design being incredibly forgiving for bad plays. Any other assassin would have died.\n\nno thats you chasing a leblanc with your ult carrying you away from your team on a super evasive champ. thats being outplayed. you pressed one button during that entire process and are mad she got away using every escape she has plus summoners and a zhonyas.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mylon Requiem","date":"2015-05-25T17:21:28.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are a few champions in the current meta that excel at locking down LeBlanc with absolutely zero chance of escape: {{champion:1}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:412}} \n\nStop complaining about a champion and consider the fact that maybe it's your failure to understand what to do to shut down the champion, and not the champion itself. As a {{champion:7}} main, I assure you playing against {{champion:91}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:38}}{{champion:131}} {{champion:31}} is not fun nor easy, and if I win the matchup or get fed, it's because I'm skilled, not because the champion is broken and easy-mode. \n\nRecently I just shit on a {{champion:7}} as {{champion:76}} midlane, which is extremely hard to do assuming you're against a skilled opponent. The enemy LeBlanc never pressured me for CS nor did she trade or W-R to get free damage on me, so I just scaled, got one item, hit her with one spear, and all-in'd with {{summoner:14}}.
