Not that the opinions are invalid or that you're not allowed to have an opinion, or even that you should shut up now. Case in point, you of all people maybe should be talking even more, seeing as you are able to express your criticism (even if it is a tad agressive).\n\nBut the vast majority of peoples' main argument is still just that it's not the way it used to be, and that's not the least bit constructive. Until the percentage of arguments have dropped below a certain threshold it's difficult for Riot to assess how many people *actually* dislike it and why they dislike it.\nEspecially because the forums are **not** a random sample of players, and thus are **not** a good representation of the playerbase.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2015-07-22T08:12:20.398+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't particularly care for the lighting color choice, but I could live with it, but I think it needs to be toned down so you can actually see the window's design.
