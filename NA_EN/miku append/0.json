I love the concept of the game, but mother of God, is it a magnet for absolute assholes. Regardless of any game mode, Co-Op vs AI, ARAM, ARURF, etc, somehow we get these jerks. Now, I&#039;m pretty thick skinned, but it gets tiring after game after game of these punks. I honestly regret spending so much money on this game. I could have a super computer by now (GTX 1080 Ti, Intel i7/i9, etc) but instead my dumb little ass decided to spend so much on cosmetics because they&#039;re cute. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I really don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll play League much at all. I&#039;m not moving to Overwatch because the game jerks that left here went there and made it 100% worse.
