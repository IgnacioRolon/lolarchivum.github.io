You will need more champions later, but you can practice them in normals. At the moment I only play {{champion:75}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:37}} and {{champion:89}} in my ranked games. And probably 80% of my ranked games are with Nasus.\n\nThe mistake MOST lower Elo players make is they play too many roles and too many champions. They end up OK with a bunch of a champions, but not really good with any one champion.\n\nPantheon isn't countered by too much in the top lane so you should be OK. It will allow you to focus on other aspects of your game playing one champion, such as warding, map presence, CSing, because you will already be mechanically sound with your champion.\n\nThat being said, your win rate with Pantheon is probably too low to \"one trick\" with him at the elo you are in. You probably still need to polish you pantheon games if you want to climb with him. It should be over 52% if he is your main, so you probably just need to improve with him.\n\nYour CS is also pretty low per game with him for a single laner. Which either tells me you focus too much on kills or you stink at CSing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ban the Hand ","date":"2016-11-08T20:11:02.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya the 49/% stat is kinda eh.

I would say if you run TP, CS early and try to get that first tower. Once you hit level 6 you can ult into the bottom lane if you want and get that tower.\n\nThat way you can TP back to lane if it is an issue.\n\nIf you run ignite top it means you have to get that first kill AND you will likely use your ult to return to lane and you probably will have less CS on average. You will probably be a bigger threat early, but TP helps in your late game more.\n\nIn general, if you don't get a kill as pantheon early you are doing something wrong. He scales pretty poorly past the mid game and is just a stun bot after he uses his ultimate. \n\nAlso, in terms of preference I think thunder lords is worse than deathfire touch with pantheon. It depends though. If you want the \"best overall mastery\" for him then I suppose thunder is adequate. But if you want the best laning mastery against specific opponents it is deathfire (you spear poke is really good with it).\n\nI also see some run fervor and warlords, in general most of the masteries are pretty good on him but I think it is better to be in the offensive tree with him than down the cunning tree. Just a thought.\n\nAlso you don't build this {{item:3142}}, which should be in your builds or you go cleaver and ghostblade and full tank afterwards. \n\nYou should also be starting {{item:2033}} most of the time and skip the refillable potion. It does depend on the matchup, but almost every pantheon I play against goes corrupting because he has mana issues and health issues. Corrupting covers both those in early laning.\n\nYour CS should be around 160-180 if you have a single lane per game regardless if it is a win or a loss. Though if you take him into the jungle a lot then that explains a lower average.\n\nThe biggest problem I see with low elo {{champion:80}} players is that they focus SOOOO much on getting kills that they do not CS. Then they get out scaled and go \"how did I die I have 8 kills\". Well it is because pantheon scales like crap.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you have that kill focus problem, but you DO have a CS problem. It is simply too low.\n\nPantheon will probably become more and more popular in preseason with all the assassins coming out. As a bruiser he can still quickly kill an assassin with his burst. \n\nYou may also want to try to learn {{champion:58}} because they both have almost identical play styles and scaling. I would also suggest {{champion:122}} as a better late scaler if your comp is a late scaling comp.\n\nI just looked at the people you play with often and I will say that some of the champions they play don't really fit the pantheon comp. \n\n{{champion:67}} is a late game hyper carry (that will probably soon be banned A LOT with the stealth changes and her crit build) and pantheon is an early game champion. They don't really mesh because it requires YOU to put A LOT of early game pressure while Vayne scales. Which is probably why they direct you to places early and mid game. Meaning if you lose lane or you fall off without doing anything the teams mid game will probably be terrible.\n\nAnother one of your buddies appears to play a lot of {{champion:103}} and {{champion:85}}. These are team fight champions with decent scaling. Ahri would be better than Kennen but I can see you ulting to where kennen is ulting, stunning them and keeping them in the kennen ultimate.\n\nOne of your buddies plays {{champion:53}} and {{champion:89}} while another plays {{champion:105}} and {{champion:20}}. Nunu will probably be soon nerfed (probably why your buddy is playing him is because he is so strong).\n\nI guess how I see it if you are looking to consider comp so you can keep playing with your buddies, you probably want and early game pick comp. And not a late game scaling comp.\n\nA good comp would be {{champion:80}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:89}} or {{champion:53}} \n\nWhile a poor comp for pantheon would be {{champion:80}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:20}} and a different support that isn't about landing picks.\n\nBut I will say, in the elo you are playing at, comp doesn't matter at all. You simply should play the champions you are best with, but if you want to continue to 5 man or 4 man with this crew you should consider you comp questions more. As you play against better opponents the lack of synergy with your comp will be more noticeable. You probably wouldn't notice it until gold though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ban the Hand ","date":"2016-11-09T00:21:19.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow man thanks i read the whole thing.

One with a mixture of armor runes and damage for an AD top laner and then another with a mixture of MR runes for the AP top laner.\n\nMy suggestion of good runes would be AD reds, Flat armor or scaling health yellows and then CDR blues or MR blues. \n\nYour quints should be damage. You may want to go here http://na.op.gg/champion/pantheon/statistics/top to see what other pantheon's run.\n\nI will also suggest that you find runes that fit your style and adjust around that. I have seen several pantheons run 3 movement speed quints. I will say mana regen runes are pretty terrible in general. I run a few on some mages if I go mid, but they are noticeable in tandem with the doran's ring. \n\nI run three different rune pages for my main champion ({{champion:75}}) and they are largely based on my match-up. One of my pages for and AD top, one for an AP opponent, and one for when \"I don't know who it will be\" or it is Olaf. \n\nIf you play him enough you should have a similar set up of runes. You may also want to run high damage runes if you take ignite and more defensive runes when you take TP.\n\nI don't play pantheon, but as a top main and facing that champion so much, I understand the champion pretty well. I can immediately tell if the pantheon I am laning against is silver or gold. Wave management is really important in the top lane and making sure you ult when a wave is shoved under enemy tower is preferable.\n\nI think also pantheon is pretty flexible in that if you get behind you just build tank and if you get ahead you build more damage.\n\nPantheon is a lot about decision-making since his skill cap is pretty low. I will say that you should be making more of your own choices with that champion over being told what to do by people. It will take time though. If your friends are telling you how to play and where to be a lot, then your game sense is relatively low. But most of your friends look to be silver, so my guess is their game sense is about on par with yours. \n\nI would get in the habit just TPing when you think certain conditions are met. For example, I typically TP when this and this happen, but I never tp when this occurs. Just practice thinking about if your TP play is good or not.\n\nAs a top laner with a global ultimate you have a lot of agency in your decision making. It is also worth noting that if a bot laner is telling you to come bottom it is usually already too late if you are responding to them telling you to come. You should be reacting prior them saying to come.\n\nI run TP and **I typically only TP if I am 100% certain I can get an objective (like a tower or dragon) or I am 100% certain that it will stop a lot of teammate deaths**. I almost never TP just for kills only. The jungler can get the kills, me using a summoner only for kills with no dragon or tower gold is usually not seen as worth by me. You also typically give up a lot of CS for an ultimate or TP play. I will say though kills are a higher priority for pantheon than me as a nasus.\n\nIf you ult to bottom lane, you should also try to get a dragon off it along with kills. If you get nothing out of it then using tp to go to the top tower is a bit of a waste. \n\nI will say there are some thing about pantheon I really don't like. I think when he falls behind he is a really really bad champion almost like shaco. You don't \"come back\" after being behind with him, you just try to not be a liability for your team. You should practice other top laners just in case he is banned. I actually think {{champion:122}} does almost all the same things as pantheon, aside from the global ultimate, AND is just much better as the game progresses. He doesn't need kills to be strong like pantheon does.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bad arcade kitty","date":"2016-11-09T00:22:34.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ponies are cute~","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-11-08T19:50:00.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being a one-trick pony is fine. \n\nI wouldn't personally recommend it because:\n\n* It limits your options (i.e. team composition, counter-picking)\n* I find playing that much of any single champion boring\n* It doesn't help you understand how other roles play\n\nIf you enjoy it and find success with it, then go ahead.
