I have looked at old forums and wikis saying I should delete files, run league as an administrator, or redownload league, but none of these so called \"solutions\" have helped me. If you have any suggestions as to what to do, please comment. I have no clue what to do anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-03-13T03:30:45.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're able to get past the patcher, but nothing happens when you press launch, this is most likely caused by an unstable connection between your network and our game server. I wouldn't suggest deleting any game files, as that could cause corruption in other League assets. Let's go through our [Connection Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to get to the root of the problem.\n\nHit me up if you've got any other questions!","replies":[]}]}
