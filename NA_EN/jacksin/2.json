It wasn't a real weapon, it was just something he could beat you over the head with. Because he was just THAT good.\n\nThe whole point of the lamppost was that it was a random piece of junk he happened to pick up; the lamp itself didn't matter. Making the lamppost important for fighting the Void is a subtle change, but not as small as it initially seems. Yeah, it's still not a \"real\" weapon, technically, but it's absolutely *a* weapon now; one to be used against the Void.
