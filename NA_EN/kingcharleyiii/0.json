I saw those 6 or so panels about the summoners code, but that is not enough because I honestly felt I was following them. \r\n\r\nIt’s hard for me to find a balance between telling my teammates how to improve and what we should do and telling them that they are wrong. I can come off a little harsh when I tell them something that went wrong. I thought I was getting better at it, but I’m not. \r\n\r\nPlease I want to improve, I don’t want to end up banned. I’m not a bad person, just extremely competitive. \r\n\r\nThis is not a troll post so I was appreciate non-troll responses.","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2020-02-04T15:18:29.861+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are small micro things you can teach and people can apply in game easily, like how to abuse CDs, use defensive shields during specific clutch timings, lvl2 power spike all ins, or how to target in team fights, maybe even how to last hit under tower. \n\nDon't expect people to learn the more difficult things like zoning, wave control and macro rotation methods / reasoning in a heated game. You can try to float the concept around to see if they can learn it, but don't expect them to do so.\n\nIt's ok for people to be wrong, we aren't perfect. The next step is to plan and prepare against that set back you had, and you can improve by learning from the past mistakes or playing better in the future and how do you make the best of the current situation.\n\nBtw, it is possible that you can be at fault even though you thought your teammates were at fault. \n\nLet's say that Zilean is shoving your wave, and you disagree with that action. But dragon is up, your jgler is around and at decent health, you have a pretty decent wave and the enemy stuck at wave clearing. Shoving and getting dragon could have been the right call. If you didn't see that macro, it might be your fault instead, and yet you blame others for it. \n\nEitherway, there isn't one way to play the game. The game is fluid and is changing every second, people need to make decisions on the fly whether it's a macro or micro decision.\n\n> [](https://i.imgur.com/BkKEAyc.jp)\n\nSomeone who can be good in laning phase may suck at macro and vice versa. Some people panic when getting ganked and blow everything incorrectly while some can stay calm and defensively 1v3 under tower. Some might be great at landing skill shots but don't know how to zone. Some are great at leading, some are great followers. People in silver2 are bad in general, but they can be good at a few things. Your goal is to find what people are good at and play around that. \n\nIf you want comebacks, look for the person with the best macro in the mid game and play around that. Observe how they rotate and how they react to people's positioning (teammates or enemies) on the mini map.  People whom mindlessly push don't have the best macro, but if you see someone split pushing but then backing off (or even just hiding in a safe spot) when they don't know where all the enemies are at, then you know that person has good map awareness and good macro.\n\nYou don't always need to follow that good macro guy around. Providing if you can give him information on where the enemies are (or where the enemies are not), then he can make the macro decision on what to do. You can push a lane and have pressure elsewhere to keep him safe, you can blue trinket to give him vision (even better, blue trinket in an open field, so the enemy would hit the trinket while rotating and wasting time, giving your split pusher more time to back off). \n\n\n\nAnd yes, my strength is in my mid game macro, and I suck at the micro stuff like landing skill shots and team fights. Mid game macro is a fun game if you know what to look for. Don't go giving up just because laning phase didn't go well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Slaiyer","date":"2020-02-04T18:30:38.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"i suggest spam pinging them . talking can get u in trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2020-02-04T19:46:05.372+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Troll Slaiyer,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WaqGEW9h,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2020-02-04T18:30:38.776+0000)\n>\n> i suggest spam pinging them\n\nIf you're doing this to harass players for mistakes, that's not really encouraging them to do better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2020-02-04T15:17:32.796+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've given this advice on these boards before, but here's something that might work for you. It's going to sound strange, but think about it for a minute.\n\n**BE MORE SELFISH.**\n\nBefore you say or do things in game, weigh whether those words or actions are going to get you closer to a win or closer to a loss. Flaming, berating, or insulting teammates will never, ever, **EVER** get you closer to a win and will always push you closer to a loss. If you make a **FRIENDLY** suggestion to someone (\"Hey, maybe we should push bot tower now\") and they respond like an asshole, cease communication with that person. Nothing you say or do is going to get through to them. Be selfish. Think about your wins and your account.\n\nAdditionally, be accepting of losses. They are going to happen nearly 50% of the time, and it's rarely one single person's fault. Ultimately, if you lose it was because the enemy team was better (or less bad) than your team. You only need to win slightly over 50% of your games to climb, and if you find you're not climbing, you need to change what you're doing, not expect the same thing to work forever. That means new champions, builds, roles, and strategies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-02-04T15:00:53.510+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"when typing in chat, before you press enter to send it, ask yourself\n\ndoes this help my team win the game?\n\nif no, delete it\n\nif you try to give someone advice and they dont heed it, leave it be. \n\nsimple as that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-02-04T21:14:02.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not think the rules are a good code for overall good behavior. They're a code of League of Legends conduct, and it's made for League's benefit, not yours. Unfortunately, seeking advice on how to behave is like asking what seasoning to use to make wings better. There's all different kinds for different people, but what works for you requires that we know you. I suspect the brief self-analysis isn't entirely on point. Despite that, I'll toss what works for me: light hearted positivity. I also used to give unsolicited advice.\n\n* Pregame lobby, I'll try to be friendly. At the start of a match, I'll throw out a joke, usually making fun of an enemy champion (not the player). \n* Ask for the team or a team member to do something if you feel it's important; leave it at that, do not explain why, not even \"because Yasuo.\" \n* Don't argue with anyone, let alone disagree. Literally, don't even say \"no\". \n* Forget about helping people improve or giving advice, unless they specifically ask for it from you. On that, ask for advice. \n* Ask what the team should be doing, don't tell them. Don't EVER tell anyone what to do unless they ask. \n* That's what pings are for. Ping once or twice (or four for dragon) and if they don't respond to it, let it go.\n* Impose a 1 chat per 3 minute rule on yourself. Keep it to something useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperJoker429","date":"2020-02-04T18:04:48.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're already done with step one by identifying that you're \"toxic\". A lot of people don't play league or just quit after a while because of teammates not being super encouraging during match.\n\nI know. I was one of those who left.\n\nQuite literally just starting out in season 5 and people were screaming at me in bot matches. \n\nBut then I came back and while I found that there were still some toxic people, very few try to fix their ways. I applaud you for taking that extra step in trying to make the game more enjoyable for others. That already puts you above a certain percentile of LoL players.\n\nAll that I can say is this: Put yourself in the other person's shoes. \n\nWe can all relate when there's that annoying Aartox in top or a Shaco that you just cant skill shot and they get fed and kick your ass and get fed and kick your ass some more. While people are angrily typing about how trash the teammate is, that teammate is trying to come back for the team, whether they really want to win and to turn the fight around, or they try to make an effort to make some type of difference in order to prevent getting reported (as some people will report another player after just one bad game). Then you have those ones who just give up but those guys aren't good sports. \n\nYou'd have to take in consideration of some other factors. (I'm mainly speaking from experience bc I was faced with super super toxicity when I first started playing)\n\n1. They could've practiced with a certain champ in bots and go to PvP, expecting the fight to go one way, but end up getting beat by someone who has been maining a champ for years.\n\n2. They really don't know how runes work, or exactly what to buy in the store and what items work best with their champ.\n\n3. They don't know what certain things mean, i.e. pings, inting/feeding, kiting, ganking, alpha, wave rotation, etc.\n\n4. They didn't have a good \"teacher\" to teach them tactics on the game or watched pros play bc some think that you can just wing League.\n\nOverall, just be a good samaritan and rather than attacking people, tell them what they did wrong. \n\nI'm one of the players that teaches the game to new players and tell them what went wrong and how to improve. Try being a teacher, it might help curb your toxicity. This works out in your favor too because if you teach someone well, then that's someone that you can rely on and bring them into the rift as a teammate. \n\nAnother way is to join a discord community. People that play league together, no matter your rank or experience. \n\nBut, there is a big thing that you can't do while trying to fix your attitude toward league: If someone is being toxic and you notice it, ignore it or try to defuse it, but DO NOT EGG THE OTHER TOXIC PEOPLE, because that's a fast way to bring up old ways.\n\nAgain, as an inexperienced player who faced a ton of toxicity years ago, thank you for trying to change your attitude in consideration to new or unlucky players. \n\n\n**DEMACIA**\n\n{{sticker:garen-swing}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IVSakenz","date":"2020-02-04T15:14:30.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like it is about your headspace when going into a match...what I have had to do is basically expect someone on my team to be horrible..That way when it happens, it does not push my buttons as much.. \n\nand when I try to explain what the team should be doing..
