But yesterday evening I went to play (I had played a game in the morning) windows had a popup that said \"PVP.net patcher kernel has stopped working\" .  I thought it might have been my desktop link that was bad but when I went to the games files and clicked on the .exe the same thing happened.  I had looked up the error and found only help from 4+ years ago and it didn't work.  I found a way to start the program by launching the patcher application but I'm not sure why the patcher launches the game and not the intended .exe file.\r\n\r\n*I run a windows 8 laptop","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T16:29:35.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This kernel errors is usually due to a settings with your OS or something else that's blocking the patcher from launching or scanning game files.
