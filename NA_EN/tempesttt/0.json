My suggestion would be to reset your config in case of any corruption causing the keys to not respond.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nAlso, make sure that you're binding your keys in the game and not outside/through another software.  Your settings in-game are independent.  \n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Tempesttt","date":"2017-04-07T19:22:43.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solved my problem, thank you :D","replies":[{"poster":"TaskDagger","date":"2017-04-18T21:01:34.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CLG Nilonim","date":"2017-04-09T00:20:51.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried you solution, since i have the exact same problem but with a razer deathadder, but it didn't work.\n\nJust like Tempesttt i tried multiple things first, and none worked. my mouse also works fine out of the game (I.E to back in windows explorer or on a web page) and i tried to update my razer synapse driver.\n\nI also tried in another game, overwatch, to see if my driver was not somehow only blocking in game key binding, but it worked just fine, so the problem is solely tied to league.\n\nIf you have any other tips or steps you could suggest me, i'm all ears.\n\nthanks\n\nEdit: i just tried on the PBE client, same issue","replies":[]}]}]}
