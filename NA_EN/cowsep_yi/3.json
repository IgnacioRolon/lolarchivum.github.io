Im getting every week my chests but maybe Im not playing enough game to earn 3 key fragments a week so I can open the chest. Now I have 9 chests but I cant open none of them. I read that only 12 key fragments drop a month, or I can get 4 keys a month but I already have 9 chests. Does that mean that I will never open all my chests by earning key fragments?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-08T23:06:28.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The droprate for key fragments looks like a curve moreso than a line.
