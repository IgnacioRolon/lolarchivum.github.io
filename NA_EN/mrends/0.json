You've posted this in how many threads? Evelynn's entire kit revolves around E, not R. You face tanked her charm, and didn't use your kit right at all. If you had walked away for 2 seconds or E'd the wall, you would have lived, because she wouldn't have erased your MR.\n\nIf it wasn't off my recent game history I'd show you a game where I 1v1'd Evelynn with a friggin Nami After she had 20+ kills and full build.\n\nhttps://blitz.gg/lol/match/na1/Illabethe/3181669617\n\nThis is an Evelynn Specific trait, as ONE champion does need to counter tanks in the entire roster. Never mind the fact Evelynn is less mobile than Ornn.\n\nSounds like an entitled Ornn with the most Armor and Resist in the game feels he should autowin because he lasted beyond 20 minutes and upgraded people.\n\n(P.S. I play all the champions we're discussing, so it's not like I'm favoring Eve, or decrying Ornn. My point is, like every other champ in the game, you finally got punished for misplaying.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deνiruchi","date":"2019-11-04T16:22:31.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is the death timer bugged maybe?
