It's never a Supp missing a critical skillshot on a snared target (Had a Pyke earlier today who couldn't land a Q on my Xayah snared targets...) or the Supp being too far ahead or too far behind. I'm all for both sides seeing their faults, but when have you seen a post anywhere where a Supp admits to mistakes?
