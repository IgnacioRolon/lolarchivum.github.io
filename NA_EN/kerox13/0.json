Every time I alt-tab my computer completely freezes,nothing works,not even ctrl+alt+del. It happened 2-3 times in loading screen and 2 times in game(also got leave buster,but we won the match,why tf do you get lb if you win?!). After I restarted my PC and I got into the game,I pressed right click then my PC froze. I updated Windows 10 to Creator's Update this morning and my GPU driver too,so I don't know if one of them is causing this. Do you guys have any idea? I know uninstalling this game would be a great idea,but meh...\r\nEarlier I've tested in CS GO and I could alt+tab but in League shit happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-29T15:55:42.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious if updating to the Creator's version might be causing this.  Double check and make sure that the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is disabled, as it's been known to cause freezing issues like this.  They have a tendency to auto-enable after an update, so let me know if that's the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Kerox13","date":"2017-04-30T13:17:48.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game bar is disabled,it was from the beginning. Even in practice tool,instant freeze when I alt+tab. The fact is that it happens now in CS GO too,but in Far Cry or Assassin's Creed it doesn't. I don't know what could cause this after that update,it's weird. Maybe something auto enabled after,I used to disable some windows funcitons to speed up my computer,as I did with superfecth,after the update it enabled automatically but I disabled it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-02T15:47:59.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the details here, though that's pretty strange!
