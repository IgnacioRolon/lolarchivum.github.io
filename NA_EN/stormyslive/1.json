Had to play sivir going the more gold efficient route (static shiv first item), and used myself as bait to initiate bad teamfights on their end (since i was several levels behind, i wasnt focused on getting the kills, just baiting the enemy to do poorly).\n\nEverychance i get had to farm, and i end the game 4/6/15, and had the same amount of gold as our 8/3/14 anivia. we won too, barely.\n\ngoing to try and stream again later when everything isnt so buggy, Since i skipped to G3, everyone on the enemy roster was G2-Plat5, so i think i might skip again to G1 if i hit promos quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-05T19:37:31.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets do some 1 on 1s, adc/sup/jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-05T09:51:22.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just skipped G5 to G3, and ranked is disabled, so I'll do any 1 on 1s if anyone like, just add me in game","replies":[]},{"poster":"StOrmysLIVE","date":"2014-11-03T03:05:44.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to start in a bit.
