HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Summoners!\r\nHi!\r\nI think either my pc or the settings of LoL got an issue, since very often, when I right click on a mouse (I tried with 3 different mice) the game does not register it, not even the green vectors of movement appear. It is not a hardware issue, I experienced the same problem with a variety of mice.\r\nHas anyone else ever had this kind of problem?\r\nI shall be more specific.\r\nIt happens, let's say, once every 5-10 seconds. When it happens, for about 2 seconds, it doesn't matter how many times I right click, the game refuses to register it, while at the same time I can do anything else. Left click always works. Mouse movement is still fine, I just can't right click. My ping is stable, my fps are fine meanwhile. What could cause this madness? It is impossible to play properly like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-20T00:31:23.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, do you have Discord Overlays enabled?  It's been causing in-game issues like this, but disabling it should help.  Let me know if that's the case for you!","replies":[{"poster":"C3jZi","date":"2018-01-20T09:28:59.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No i have nothing on when i play lol only with my friends some times i turn discord on but it was never a problem since i created a smurf then when i played dthe problem occured","replies":[]}]}]}
