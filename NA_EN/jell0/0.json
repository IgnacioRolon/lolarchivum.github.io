Every single game.\n\nVideo is not mine, but looks exactly like what I'm experiencing. \n\nI usually get disconnected at loading screen. During the game I have periods of 1-2 minutes of huge delay, I have no control over anything and it looks like all champions are just aimlessly wandering the map. Then everything 'catches up' and I can play normally for a couple of seconds, until the cycle continues.\n\nMy ping and FPS during these games are completely fine. \n\nI played at my friends house this weekend and It worked great. No problems at all. So It's not my computer. My internet is working fine other than league. I have no idea what the problem is.\n\nWould appreciate any help, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-30T20:20:56.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be more the result of packet loss than fps issues.

This can be caused by various network issues, so please see below for a few common steps that can help reduce packet loss.\"\n\nResetting my router and modem didn't work. Don't have anything running that would be the cause. I guess It's just a problem with my ISP? I only started having this problem after the last update. I wonder If It's actually correlated or not.
