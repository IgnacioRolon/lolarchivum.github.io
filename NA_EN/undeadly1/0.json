One of my friends has been playing league for about a year now, and he asked me to play today, so I attempted to log in, but i was greeted by a message saying I was permanently banned for scripting, i tried to look into it by asking my friend to check if I've recently played any games, and there were two games which I never played, and my Icon was also changed. so I assume I was hacked because the only other person who knew my account information is my brother, and he has quit league for about 2 years now. i am not sure what my options are now, and I was wondering if there is any way to possibly get my account back.","replies":[{"poster":"Evangele","date":"2019-05-04T02:01:11.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:267}} Hey friend, \n\nYou'll need to follow the steps outlined here in order to recover a lost or hacked account: \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account","replies":[]}]}
