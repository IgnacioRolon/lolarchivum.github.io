Lenovo y700, 15 inch, ultra HD, nividia gtx960m, 16gb ram, ssd and i7. So the specs are good enough to play league.\r\n\r\nNvidia has recommended [2048 x 1152] settings instead of the LoL reccomended 3840x2180 (or whatever the highest setting is).  Anyhow, I have tried EVERY single one of the resolution settings and also increasing all of the interface sizes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the one thing that doesn't change is my cursor size. It stays so small that I often lose its position during fights (hell even fighting jungle camps) and I often miss my mark when I click. I just got the computer 3 days ago. Anyone know how to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotBok","date":"2016-05-16T22:33:20.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there's not currently any officially supported way of changing your mouse cursor.  I know there's 3rd party programs out there that adjust mouse settings, but we can't support the use of them or take responsibility for how it may affect League of Legends (e.g. causing conflicts and/or crashes for whatever reason).","replies":[{"poster":"BADxW0LF","date":"2016-05-17T13:10:47.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a feature that would be beneficial for a lot of players, especially those who may have some slight vision impairment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fk her RAWDOG ","date":"2016-05-17T04:57:49.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RiotBok,\n\nIs there no simple way to perhaps, go into the hidden installation files of LoL to simply change cursor size? Or would you guys be able to send out a patch for 4k resolutions? Sorry, I am not the most computer savvy player and my terminology may sound like that of a fools.
