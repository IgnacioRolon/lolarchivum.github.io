I've been a Riot customer and supporter since the beginning. As the Riot employees can see from my purchase history, I've spent over $300 on the game. My account \"cranzy\" is currently in Platinum and I'm a very competitive person. I've had chat restrictions in the past and my account was suspended for 2 weeks not long time ago due to raging at my teammates and cursing them. I fear that recently I might have offended a few people in the ranked games I've played. I'm really ashamed of what I've done and I don't know how can I change my behavior to better(no don't tell me to read the Tribunal FAQ and stuff, that's not going to help). Is there any way you can permanently restrict my chat instead of banning me permanently? I've really spent a lot of time on this account and I've created many friends over the years. Again, I apologize for being really harsh and aggressive towards my teammates. Happy New Year!","replies":[]}
