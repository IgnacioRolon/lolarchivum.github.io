You get the idea, we was just purely happy.  Soon on she moved in with me, I was the happiest person in the world and I still am remembering it in my memory.  League has always stressed me out, I never really had fun, but when she asked me to play with her I just couldn't refuse it, I wanted to do everything with her.  As months went on I started to get more stressed, unhappy, mean.  I quit League 3 months before I met her, because I knew it didn't make me happy, it caused me severe depression, it wasn't the game for me.  So in the end me and her had fights and fights.. But I still loved her uncontrollably.   Soon she left me and dumped me, but I still tried my best to be with her not understanding what went wrong..\r\n\r\nUntil I realized that League was my issue, it caused me to be horrible, every time I play League I become this way.  I wish I knew my issue while I was with her, she meant everything to me and I should of known League has always been this way for me, it never made me happy.  I can happily say I was in the wrong, but if any of you are like me and can't handle stress so easily, I would say quit it while you can, don't do the mistake I did.  She still means everything to me and she's always on my mind every second of the day.\r\n\r\n  I was a fool. I love you, Kelly.","replies":[{"poster":"Rahzon","date":"2016-12-14T16:12:21.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i fucking know that feel. so sorry m8....\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Mozarilla,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=c3YaUgGj,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-13T20:42:21.813+0000)\n> Until I realized that League was my issue, it caused me to be horrible, every time I play League I become this way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NightmareAmazoX","date":"2016-12-14T07:31:02.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:245}} If only you could rewind time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-14T16:17:21.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And my girlfriend just broke up with me this morning.
