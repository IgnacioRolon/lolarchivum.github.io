I've tried everything, repair files, fresh install, update drivers, bios, firewall, no new programs since then. My ping out of game is 10, in game 60. which isnt a big deal but obviously id like it to be better. The fps is where its weird. when the game starts as i sit in fountain not moving it stay at 115-160. as soon as my champ moves it drops to 75-85, then once minions or more champs are on my screen it drops so low i'll freeze momentarilly sometimes. Like 10-40 fps.
