Grats on all that good stuff.  :D  It looks like you did get your new player chest, but you don't have a key at the moment.  You used the extra key you had on the mastery chest you earned earlier instead of the new player chest.  You'll have to grab some key fragments or buy a key to open your chest.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Can I Sup Plz","date":"2017-06-30T16:16:46.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhhhhhhh I see.
