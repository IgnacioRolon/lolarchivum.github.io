This could have been a zero tolerance ban with supporting evidence given in the form of more than one game. All games are given because they are all supposed to be considered. If the first game never happened (which isn't shown) you would have not been punished without additional negative behavior. So you looking for 'punishable' evidence in games 2 and 3 does not make sense. You were punished directly after game 1, which you are not showing.\n\nGames 2 and 3 are good examples of games containing unsportsmanlike and negative attitude.\n\nThese games contain many instances of threatening to report people, which the community has determined is negative behavior.\n\nYou also left you ADC to lane solo and went elsewhere as a support in order to spite them.\n\nTelling the enemy to just push mid and end, when the team is not in agreement.\n\nCalling your teammates feeders and claiming they are intentionally feeding.\n\nI'd guess that if I looked at your report history I could find you reporting others for similar behavior and expecting them to be punished for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2016-07-06T18:35:44.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Surely a chat, ranked ban or even a 2week holiday from lol rather than an outright ban would be more appropriate?

Regardless of whether or not they're guilty, it doesn't matter because he's being just as much a dick back to them as they are to him, as far as we know.\nIn the second game, he calls Bard a feeder several times and harassed him the entire game. Again, regardless of Bard's chatlog, he was being just as nasty to him. \nThe OP was judged for his responses to these people, and it doesn't matter what they said, because his behavior to them was just as negative and unsportsmanlike. Additionally, the fact that he omits and edits his chat logs doesn't actually give him much credibility as presenting the entire truth. \nFinally, a ban is the final offense after a chat restriction and a 2 week ban. Clearly this guy has been in trouble before, and clearly the warnings meant nothing to him if he went and got himself reported. These three games were most likely not the only games that got him banned, since the system files many reported games before acting on the final report. If your behavior is such that it comes to having this much evidence against you, you probably knew and deserved the ban.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
