At least in assassin metas you can kill them, or any other metas.&quot;\r\n\r\nAssassin Meta: &quot;WOW I totally just got outplayed there right xD?! 100-0&#039;d in a second so much counterplay wow! Fuck this meta, I&#039;d rather have anything else!&quot;\r\n\r\nADC Meta: &quot;Well would you look at it again, Riot catering to ADCs as usual. God forbid we have anything else strong besides this right? Fuck Riot.&quot;\r\n\r\nMage Meta: &quot;&#039;Utility Mage&#039; is something that should have never been created, dear god. It&#039;s already bad that they 100-0 you, but now on top of that they have all this extra shit too. Stupid. Thank god assassins exist, fuck this meta.&quot;\r\n\r\nBruiser Meta: &quot;Well here we go again, Riot fucking over itemization and having nooo clue how to balance this game. Better have mobility or GGWP since you can&#039;t deal with these fucks any other way!&quot;\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s like, I get hating certain Champs, I do, but hating entire metas just seems dumb to me. Like I hate how some Champs are strong right now but hating a class just seems silly.","replies":[]}
