Countless hours of listening to Nickelback (don't judge), Dragonforce, and soothing music. With my current main roster being Sej, Amu, Naut, Vlad, Malza, Galio, Leona, and Shyvana, I've faced against the meta, just playing what I love, enjoy, and am naturally good at. Except Amumu I just abuse him for freelo. \r\n\r\nI've endured HUNDREDS of Ranked Games with AFK's, people rage quitting, dc'ing, etc, and I've felt like giving up on several occasions. \r\n\r\nI was seeded in Silver 5. I had never even been Gold before this Season; I joined in Season 2 and I've spent countless amounts of time researching this game inside and out to the point I'm almost an encyclopedia on it, but knowledge is not everything sadly, there's the actual game itself too. Last Season I ended Silver 1, clamped to the point I was gaining 2-3 LP.\r\n\r\nThis Season I wanted to give up, but I owe a GD'er a very special \"Thank You\". He inspired me to go further, to keep playing my best, and was kind enough to duo with me and help me out. If it was not for him, I may have made it, possibly... And I may have not. Morale is a very key factor in climbing, and he didn't just help me raise my LP; he helped me raise my morale and encouraged me to keep going.\r\n\r\nI had all these plans in the back of my mind of what I was going to do when and if I finally hit Plat, from explaining my journey to making some funny thread that had a misleading title to a lot of other things, but now that I'm here, I think I owe it to just say:\r\n\r\nThank you Arcane Ezreal for helping me out so much in the end of the Season. \r\n\r\nBest of luck to anyone else still climbing in these final end days. You can do it.","replies":[]}
