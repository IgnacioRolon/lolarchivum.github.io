I used to collect fossils, and I still want to just kinda ran out of the money to do so. I wanted to be a paleontologist at one point because they intrigued me so much, but I could never stay that far away from home. \r\n\r\nI also wanted at one point to be a counselor/therapist, because I know what it&#039;s like to struggle through emotional/mental abuse and struggle through illnesses, and I can relate and I wanted to really help others. However, the fear of my own getting in the way held me back and I decided despite probably having a positive net impact, it&#039;s probably best I stay away from it. \r\n\r\nI was once a Boy Scout. I didn&#039;t say in the group permanently because I felt sorta alienated, everyone treated me differently from my autism and it didn&#039;t feel good. While my Troop was heavily praised, I didn&#039;t like the style we took on hikes. We were expected to basically rush through them, and man, that doesnt feel right. Also, every hike was a massive struggle that left me incredibly hurt and weak for days or even a week, but I put up with it. Despite putting myself through a bit of harm to experience it, due to my disability, and despite it being really rough for me, my Troop was hardly understanding. I wasn&#039;t allowed to take the breaks I needed and it honestly felt like crap. Finally, I had to lie about my faith. I&#039;m a weird mixture of agnostic/atheist and yet we were told if you weren&#039;t religious you couldn&#039;t be a scout. Felt shitty lying about it honestly and I avoided the topic as much as possible, luckily, I wasn&#039;t really asked about it much. I left the group to pursue other things, as a Star Scout. And honestly? Star Scout is a pretty damned good achievement if you ask me.\r\n\r\nI was one a President of a club at my High School, and a co-founder of another. Neither were particularly successful but they did teach me valuable lessons that I appreciate to this day.\r\n\r\nIn High School, I started my Freshman year in a glass art class. I loved it so much, the second half of the year, I got my schedule changed from wood shop to Advanced. I then took Advanced in the glass art class 2-3 more times, forgot how many, throughout my Sophomore to Senior year, and took yet another class as a teacher&#039;s assistant. Felt great. \r\n\r\nWhile I&#039;ve been sort of a hopeless romantic for a while, and I guess to some degree always thirsty-- hell, I remember a crush I got in Kindergarten-- things didn&#039;t really get thirsty for me until after being catfished. Having been lied to for years and having a void in your heart kinda sucks, and there&#039;s an eternal desire to fill that void.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m straight but I honestly wish I was bi. There&#039;s some dudes I&#039;d date if I was, but there&#039;s just 0 attraction cuz you know, straight. Rip. \r\n\r\nMy cat, Onyx, means the world to me. She&#039;s not a pet, she&#039;s family. Okay and a pet, but mostly family. I also have another, sorta, that&#039;s my parents but decided he&#039;d rather live with me. I&#039;m also happy to have him around. I&#039;ve actually been around animals all my life-- from different dogs to cats to hermit crabs, hell, I once helped take care of my biology teacher&#039;s snakes. I was really scared about handling them at first, really creeped out, but came to like holding them and petting them.\r\n\r\nI have a massive fear of death. I dont want all of my achievements gone out of my mind, my memories, my feelings, my love for others. Most people say that they dont want to live forever because eventually it gets tiring. Nah, if I could, I really would. I&#039;d live to the day I&#039;d have to leave Earth, I&#039;d live through seeing my friends and family age and pass away, I&#039;d live for all eternity if I could. Fuck death.\r\n\r\nI hate water. I&#039;ll often go months without drinking it. It&#039;s bland as fuck.\r\n\r\nMy favorite foods are Chinese and Mexican, quickly  followed by Italian, then American. I hate seafood with a passion. I&#039;m actually a mildly picky eater.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s quite a few people I&#039;ve crushed on but never told because fear of rejection.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently really crazy for someone but she&#039;s taken. Still a good friend but eh. I selfishly want more despite knowing it won&#039;t go anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy favorite Pokemon is Toxicroak.\r\n\r\nMy favorite colors are cobalt blue, teal blue, metallic red, and onyx black.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m the only person in the world with my last name. \r\n\r\nI sing all the time to myself. I used to write a lot of poetry and I wish I could sing it but I always fear no one would want to hear it. Probably true. If you legitimately like my singing, I love you. \r\n\r\nPeople probably wonder how I became a furry. Honestly I had no idea what it was at all, until one day I was looking up pictures of Pokemon to draw when I was about 14. I found NSFW art that somehow bypassed Google&#039;s filter, and I had no idea what I was really looking at. I didn&#039;t know how to react but I ended up printing it out, out of curiosity. I had no idea where it&#039;d lead me but I ended up looking up more when no one knew just to figure out what it was all about and why. I still think most fursuits are weird, I really do. But I like the community. There&#039;s a lot of weird people, yeah. There&#039;s also a lot of pretty cool people too. \r\n\r\nI prefer typing like a girl in game and in light-hearted comments, unsure why really. But I get pretty serious in other topics so eh. To be honest, I kinda wish I was both genders combined, I think it&#039;d be pretty cool. \r\n\r\nAll but one piece of my art of my &#039;sona is SFW. The NSFW one was done by a friend. ... I liked her but she was taken, we&#039;d still talk for hours daily for a year. He left her, she went with someone else, then one day she just removed me out of nowhere. Eh. Shit happens, didnt feel good but at least the friendship was amazing for over a year. I still value it. But yeah honestly I prefer SFW art, not even kidding.\r\n\r\nMy mother means everything to me. Almost no mothers have gone through what she has. From helping me get into special ed, to helping me through counseling, to taking time off time and time and time again throughout all the years to make sure I&#039;m alright, to taking me to countless appointments, to making sure I was involved in social activities despite being socially awkward at a lot of times, to helping me through AP courses, through helping me after my surgeries ended, through helping me out the last couple years, over 10k spent (I owe it back) until I won my court case. Without her I&#039;d be very, very fucked up and I&#039;d be a very broken, fucked up person. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of surgeries, muscle biopsies are freaking weird. I had to get tested to confirm myopathy (well, moreso, to try to determine the type. Inconclusive on the very very specific kind but it is a mitochondrial myopathy, it&#039;s just that it gets even more specific than that. Kinda crazy.) They numb you up, while you&#039;re awake. Then they cut into you. They open up your skin. They literally freaking open up your skin all the way past all the layers until your muscle is exposed, while you&#039;re awake. Then they cut out a very small piece, very tiny. Then they sew you back up. They literally told me I could watch while they did it. Helllllllllll no. ... It didn&#039;t feel painful since I was so numb but man it felt... Very very weird. ... I felt so weak for weeks on end afterwards I couldnt even stand right or walk, had to hop around on one leg.\r\n\r\n21, never kissed.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve drank very little, found out even magaritas are too strong for me to handle. I liked amaretto sours though, and this one drink called a snow cone that had a tiny amount of vodka in it. Overall I&#039;m pretty dang intolerant of alcohol.\r\n\r\nI have a very highly addictive personality. \r\n\r\nI tend to be very, very shy and quiet around people that I don&#039;t know. Once I do get to know you, however, I won&#039;t ever shut the fuck up. Lol.\r\n\r\nI once had a crush on a Rioter, though I&#039;m not sharing who and you won&#039;t get it out of me, you probably won&#039;t guess it right anyhow. I&#039;ve only told a few people. Buutttttt it kinda faded anyhow so eh. It was just a mild one anyhow.\r\n\r\nIf my family didnt live close to judge me I&#039;d totally dress up emo. I honestly just think the style looks cool. Like, that&#039;s it. It just looks neat to me. \r\n\r\nI dont watch much TV. I seriously lack the attention span for it. Even when playing League, I very frequently alt tab to check forums and such. That being said I love shows like Family Guy and American Dad and South Park and such.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care about Anime. I&#039;m dead serious. \r\n\r\nThe thing I look for most in a girl -physically-, not on other levels, but on physical attraction, actually isnt the rear or chest or anything like that (though they definitely help). The &quot;make it or break it&quot; is honestly just a cute face to me. \r\n\r\nI live in NorCal. That&#039;s why I say &quot;like&quot; a lot, lol. \r\n\r\nWhile I never completed either, I&#039;ve studied art and computer science in college. \r\n\r\nUm. I think that&#039;s about it. What about you guys?","replies":[]}
