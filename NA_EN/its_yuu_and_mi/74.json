Well fear not Yasuo mains, I&#039;m gonna teach you to be the best Katarina the world&#039;s ever seen! Or at least how to get an S or S+ on your favorite Champion.\r\n\r\n**Rule One:** CS matters above all.\r\n\r\nSo Jungle your Champion. &quot;But Mounting Dread, I main Vladimir! This makes no sense!&quot; Well you see Timmy, no matter who you&#039;re playing, you need CS. That means you need to be able to farm a lane where pesky Junglers won&#039;t come in and steal your farm. Because you&#039;ll be doing that. Your lane recalls? Go steal his minions. You perform a gank? Who cares if you succeeded or not, steal his minions. Hell, do it right in front of the enemy laner to assert your dominance. The number one rule here though is to not die. So that means if the enemy Jungler shows up, bail. It&#039;s their turn to tax their laners.\r\n\r\n**Rule Two:** Don&#039;t die. Buy a GA.\r\n\r\nEvery death counts against you. So that means you need items to reduce your deaths, and, tell your enemies that you do not want to be killed. Nothing is more disheartening than realizing that you have to sit around through that stupid GA effect to kill your opponent. I mean in that time, you can get up, stretch, watch a clip from your favorite anime (then realize that you should probably not be watching anime), then come back and finally kill them. That&#039;s too much work. Buy a GA. \r\n\r\n**Rule Three:** Seriously, CS matters above all.\r\n\r\nSo don&#039;t be afraid to go out of your way to grab those wonderful minions. Playing Ziggs? Launch your ult right into your allies&#039; lanes. You don&#039;t need that shit to kill people. Playing Singed? Proxy farm. Any lane, if you start to lose your lane, go find a winning lane and steal that shit. Mastery Ranks don&#039;t give a fuck about teamwork or you being a nice guy, you just gotta make yourself the superstar. Which brings me to my next point.\r\n\r\n**Rule Four:** Mute your teammates.\r\n\r\nYou don&#039;t wanna hear those pesky teammates flaming you all game. The last thing you need is to cave into the threat of a report. Reports for sabotaging games by blowing Amumu Ults to CS faster don&#039;t hurt your S ranks, listening to them does. That being said, there is an exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n**Rule Five:** Make friends.\r\n\r\nWith anyone maining this Champion {{champion:26}}. This guy will make sure you never die, just what you need. You see him calling your best friend a n@#@$ f@%@$@ loser who should @%@  $^$#$@ @#$@#? Tell your friend you need some time to play alone, then invite him. Hell, join in and say the same things to your best friend. You can, and should, even let the Zilean player know that you&#039;re agreeing with him on your best friend in the Discord or Skype call that you&#039;re in. Try to form a relationship. Same gender? Straight? Who cares. Different gender? Gay? Doesn&#039;t matter. Catfish him or her. Tell him or her that they&#039;re the love of your life. Then, once you get enough S ranks, ditch &#039;em. You just need Zilean&#039;s ult.\r\n\r\n**Rule Six:** Winning games matters. Be prepared.\r\n\r\nBy having peace offerings. &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; says an ancient Indian proverb. Your allies are your true enemies; they&#039;re competing with you. Why do you think they&#039;re threatening to report you (because you forgot Rule Four) while the &quot;enemy team&quot; isn&#039;t? Tell them you have Riot Point cards just for them. Have a screenshot ready; Imgur that shit in All Chat. If that doesn&#039;t work, tell them you have hostages. Remember, be prepared. Have hostages ready, take a picture beforehand to prove you&#039;re serious. Note: I&#039;m not liable for any investigations performed on you, do this at your own risk. Keep in mind, people don&#039;t care about other people. You need cuter things. I suggest puppy or kitten hostages. \r\n\r\n**Rule Seven:** You need a good KDA. Secure kills.\r\n\r\nYou need to secure those kills any way possible. Take {{summoner:11}}  and {{summoner:14}} . Ignite anyone below 10% life. Try to find glitches in Riot&#039;s code. Remember back when Anivia wall was able to kill Heimerdinger? Try to reproduce it. Remember when the Summoner Spell hack was a thing? If it ever comes back, abuse it. If none of the these options are available, buy an elo boost, then queue snipe your high ranking friends. Tell them if they feed you, you won&#039;t reveal their darkest secrets in All Chat. Remember: If you ever get banned for this, you can always tell Riot support that you&#039;re keeping puppy or kitten hostages.\r\n\r\n**Rule Eight:** Getting S ranks is stressful. Take breaks.\r\n\r\nBut not when you have time to farm more. Do it when you&#039;re in a guaranteed lost match. Tell your team you have a life-threatening emergency, then take your leave. Remember Rule Six, be prepared. Have a forged doctor&#039;s note ready to prove it to anyone questioning it later. Then, take this time to relieve stress by  downvoting all posts made by the people you hate most. Especially any narcs who try to expose you on the Boards or Reddit. \r\n\r\n**Rule Nine:** Communication is important in a team-based game. \r\n\r\nYou&#039;ll need to untilt your allies. Learn how to type Korean for pre-game, post-game, and in-game chat. Type random nonsense, then when in game, only say a few key phrases in English. &quot;New Korean meta. New Korean build. Faker.&quot; This should inspire your team to not question your strategies when you blow your Draven Ult to CS their lanes, then follow it up by building a Hurricane. The only time you should break this rule is when you&#039;re following one of the others.\r\n\r\n**Rule Ten:** Sportsmanship matters.\r\n\r\nYou get restricted if you&#039;re chat banned. Be friendly. And by friendly, I mean use emotes. :) isn&#039;t enough. People perceive that as sarcastic sometimes. Learn more. ^_^ WP. n.n GJ. u.u We&#039;ll get them next time. ^-^ Keep it up. This goes along with Rule Nine and Rules Five through Seven for the only things you should say in chat. If anyone questions you for being able to speak English, say &quot;still learning.&quot; And above all else, do not ever say &quot;sb, sb.&quot;\r\n\r\nThat concludes our tutorial. Remember, I&#039;m not liable for anything happening from these; any risks you take are up to you.\r\n\r\n###### This is satire, mods and viewers alike, pls don&#039;t take this seriously, ty.","replies":[]}
