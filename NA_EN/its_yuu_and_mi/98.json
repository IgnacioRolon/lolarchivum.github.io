You can want a trip abroad, you can&#039;t want a trip to climb Everest. \r\n\r\n3) You have to be honest. If you&#039;re feeling shallow and wish for money to blow on stupid things instead of something judged better like &quot;just the love of my family&quot; then go for that-- it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s &quot;petty&quot; or &quot;amazing&quot;, what you want is what you want.\r\n\r\n4) If you celebrate another holiday, answer what you want for that (i.e. Hanukkah). If you celebrate no holidays, then just say something you want as a glorified New Year&#039;s gift (not a resolution).","replies":[]}
