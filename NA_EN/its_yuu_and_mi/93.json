I have for over a month. I literally cannot get one day without it, unless it's 2 the next day. Yesterday I lost 2 games to AFKs and had an intentional feeder in another, today I've already lost one.\r\n\r\nOh and you think because 4 others on my team and 5 on the enemy that i'll get some on them right? Ahah, no, stupidly rare.\r\n\r\nI'm literally not kidding when I mean, over a month, average one a day. It's amazing I even got to my Plat Promos in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut no, now I'm Gold 2, have to work my ass back up to Gold 1.\r\n\r\nIs this a rant thread?\r\n\r\nSorta, but getting somewhere.\r\n\r\nSee, people say all the time, \"Oh it must not be their fault, they shouldn't be punished.\" And you know what? I just don't give a shit. I don't care if it's not your fault, if you DC'ing cost others you should be punished, with the exception of a bugsplat. IDGAF if your service provider shafted you.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, if I got randomly dc'd for longer than 3 minutes in a game due to my ISP, I'd like to be punished too-- even if it's just one day of no Ranked play.\r\n\r\nSee Lyte keeps saying there will be this new system making it harder to DC in Ranked. And you know what? I've been iistening to that for a lonnnngg time now.\r\n\r\nBut I'm going to be denied my Platinum Season Rewards I should have rightfully earned because of this shit. I've suffered HUNDREDS of losses in Ranked to AFKs. I've won a small, small, small % of that to AFKs on the enemy team.\r\n\r\nAnyone saying 4v5's are winnable is delusional; they are in the most rare of circumstances. You have to be heavily ahead, and win by the 35 minute mark.\r\n\r\nI've invested over 2000$ into League (back when I had money), I've played over 6000 games in 2 years, and I've been on GD almost constantly, day and night, for a good year or so. I'm heavily invested into this game.\r\n\r\nThis is what will break me and make me leave. If this is not fixed by next Season, early next Season, I will be gone.\r\n\r\nThis is shit terrible. I hate that I'm not going to get Platinum rewards because of this crap. \"Oh but you can always play better!\" Sure, I can learn how to play at a D3+ level, that will be significant improvement. When duo'ing up I repeatedly held my own, if not beat out, Plat 3s and better, and even at times Plat 2s, and up to D5s.\r\n\r\nYet, I can't even just get Plat 5, because AFK's/Disconnects are so rampant. \r\n\r\nI don't care if you never DC in this game, and suddenly you do; if it costs us you should be punished. I would expect the same for myself, I am not a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nThis is ruining the game, and I hate it.\r\n\r\nI'll give myself maybe 4 months, and that's generous. If I still find myself averaging a loss a day to DC's, I'm gone. This is stupid.","replies":[]}
