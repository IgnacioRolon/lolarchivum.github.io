Guys!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":82,"down_votes":26,"body":"Okay so as many of you know, I&#039;m disabled.\n\nI have a muscular disability, myopathy. I&#039;m autistic (seriously not the time for jokes). I have two forms of depression. I have anxiety. A lot of this inhibits me.\n\nI applied for disability, and I got denied. So, I went into an appeal. \n\nIt&#039;s been 2 and a half years of a process. Two, and a half, years. No spare money. I have to rely on my parents for everything. At age 21, it&#039;s EMBARRASSING going into a grocery store with your mother at your side, because you can&#039;t provide for yourself. Well I got food stamps recently so I can at least pay for food but that&#039;s it. Still need help traveling and getting other supplies. My ATT bill? Other utilities? Family paid. All under the assumption I&#039;d owe them back. I&#039;m not gonna reveal total figures but let&#039;s just say after being taken care of for so long it&#039;s a lot I owe my family back.\n\nWell, I was just lying down. I have to shoutcast later today-- I have to start making sure the audio settings are good at around 4 (it&#039;s 7 am here right now), and get started at 5. I struggle to sleep so I was finally about to get some rest before so I can stay up during the tourney. \n\nI finished a few ARAMs with Rule 34 until my eyes were burning, ensuring I could get some rest. I turned off my light, set my alarm for 3:50 PM just in case I might oversleep hard, and closed my eyes.\n\nMy phone rang. Immediately I got tense. I get grouchy when I&#039;m tired, I don&#039;t like being disturbed by the loud ringing, and I wanted to sleep. \n\nI wondered who it was. My mother? But it&#039;s not a work day so why is she up this early? Why does she have to contact me today? A wrong number? Likely it.\n\nI went to pick up the phone. It was her. I said, pretty annoyed and honestly probably not in the kindest tone, &quot;Whaatttt...?&quot; \n\n&quot;We were checking your mail--&quot; (Aside here, I lost my keys recently like a dumbass and they&#039;re going to re-copy the main ones later this weekend, so they just went through the liberty of doing it for me real quick) &quot;-- Because it was starting to get a little full and we got a letter from the judge. You need to come over so we can talk about it.&quot;\n\nI live in a duplex. I live all on my own on my side and to be honest? It&#039;s pretty damn nice. I rent from my family who lives on the other side next door.\n\nI didn&#039;t feel good. I knew what was coming. I knew the bad news. 2 1/2 years. Counting on this so hard to make everything work. If I lost this... If I&#039;d lose this... I don&#039;t know. I don&#039;t know where I&#039;d go. It&#039;d be so, so bad for me.\n\n&quot;Coming over to talk about it&quot; doesn&#039;t seem good. That seemed bad, like an omen. That seems like they need to be there to comfort me through very bad words. I felt pretty grim as I walked over, and even though it was only a few steps, my emotions were already starting to dull, getting ready to soften the incoming bad news.\n\n&quot;Go ahead and read it, so that we can talk about it.&quot; I read it. Legal terminology, when you&#039;re half asleep, is hard to fully understand. If I was more awake I&#039;d be able to do a little more in comprehending it than I did. But, it was enough to understand the decision.\n\nI won. Fully, 100% disabled. \n\nTwo and a half years.\n\nWaiting, waiting miserably, praying that I&#039;ll finally win, that I&#039;ll finally be okay financially...\n\nAnd I won.\n\nI broke out into tears and hugged my mother as tightly as I could. \n\nThis is one of my best days of my life.\n\nUp to 60 days from now, within that time period, I&#039;ll finally get my backpay, and start getting what I need. \n\nI&#039;m so... Happy.\n\n**TL;DR:** 2 1/2 year long court case over disability income. I won, 100% disabled. ","replies":[]}
