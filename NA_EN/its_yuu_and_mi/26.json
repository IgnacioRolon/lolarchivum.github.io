Riven is Riven. Vayne has % HP true damage. Yasuo has his windwall. Syndra&#039;s ult 1-shots you. Annie&#039;s 1-shots your team. Maokai never dies. Nasus never gives a fuck. Even Brand has a 2 second stun starting at rank 1.\r\n\r\nSo what Champ do you think is a flawless design?\r\n\r\nMine goes for this guy {{champion:201}} :\r\n\r\nPassive: You have time to react to it, even with synergistic lanes like Lucian. There&#039;s room to outplay on both sides.\r\n\r\nQ: Skillshot actually makes this a good ability for both sides; it&#039;s not overbearing when it lands and it&#039;s not a major letdown when it misses.\r\n\r\nW: About the closest thing you can get to free stats while actually making it an interactive ability that meshes well with his kit\r\n\r\nE: While similar to Yasuo&#039;s, I feel it&#039;s more fitting on him, and since it can be planned around moreso in skirmishes and teamfights instead of duels, I think it&#039;s fine on him. It also doesnt get to be as wide. \r\n\r\nR: I see nothing wrong with it, just seems like a good ability.\r\n\r\nSo what about you guys? What&#039;s that one Champ that you think just has a good kit with nothing &quot;bs&quot; about it?","replies":[]}
