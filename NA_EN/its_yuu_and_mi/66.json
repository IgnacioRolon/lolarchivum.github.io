There&#039;s problems all around but I think both sides aren&#039;t fully realizing them.\r\n\r\nOn the mod&#039;s end, they&#039;re doing their best, but sometimes really stupid things happen.\r\n\r\nThings like &quot;kill me fam&quot; turning into &quot;This is a suicide joke enjoy a ban.&quot; I mean come on that&#039;s not as bad as making a joke like &quot;Go kys&quot; or something which I get might be a little more mature. Then there&#039;s stuff like the whole Honeycute incident (listing a name here because she brought it publicly herself so it should be fine and not &quot;naming&quot; or w/e)-- where a picture that&#039;s been up forever, and Keyru explicitly said those types were okay(I appealed one similar in the past and she apologized saying the mods messed up, it was a more revealing swim suit than that. Not by much.)\r\n\r\nHere just to show you the picture I posted in the past, and was removed only to be deemed okay when  I wrote a support ticket in:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mKxa0iY.jpg\r\n\r\nThe mods are making mistakes still and I get it. Nobody&#039;s perfect.\r\n\r\n**To be honest? I cannot fully blame them because it&#039;s not all their fault. **\r\n\r\nAs someone pointed out to me (Vamp I believe), they&#039;re not part of Riot which is an issue (obviously). The problem is this: No one&#039;s perfect, no one expects them to be. Mistakes will happen. I get it. \r\n\r\nTo be honest even though we don&#039;t all like his posts, I still am happy TheCurator is around because having a visible face is great. The faceless mods for years and years were terrible. Now even if we disagree, at least it&#039;s not done in the shadows. That&#039;s great. \r\n\r\nWe all make mistakes, we&#039;re human.\r\n\r\nThe problem is what then happens if a mistake is made. \r\n\r\nWe have to contact Riot support. Then they have to answer a ticket. Then they have to make a ruling. Then they have to go in and manually edit it. Then they have to go and talk to the mods about it. Then the mods have to learn from them. \r\n\r\nThe mods are interpreters. When interpreters are third parties who have limited capabilities this is an issue. \r\n\r\nSo, naturally, people have suggested Player Moderation. \r\n\r\nTo be honest?\r\n\r\nI think that&#039;d be terrible.\r\n\r\nPeople have suggested for me to become one. Here&#039;s the deal. I might post a bit harshly here and there, or a bit immature on the rare occasion, but I know how to post more professionally when I need to. I know how to be more serious when in such a position and I can change my tone and the way I write when needed easily. That&#039;s not a problem. The problem is my own interpreation of the rules has been incorrect before on multiple occasions and I&#039;d hate to fuck people over with that, or in some cases possibly  fuck over Riot&#039;s image. \r\n\r\nIf I ever became one I&#039;d do my best but to be honest I highly  doubt they&#039;d accept me. So who could even become one? I can think of three off the top of my head.\r\n\r\nKrizonar, Better Ban Sona, and Tundra Fizz. Mayybeee Ion Cannon Karthus as from what I can tell, he&#039;s good at changing his tone when put in a mod position and actually knows how to do it (from what I&#039;ve seen on the FEK Boards, he really surprised me there). Maybe.\r\n\r\nSo are 3-4 people enough to mod a forum with as much traffic as we get, checking every post?\r\n\r\nNo. \r\n\r\nSo what do you do to fix the issue? It&#039;s not all the current moderators&#039; fault but we can&#039;t rely on them enough. We can&#039;t use player mods because they&#039;re too likely to fuck up (yes the mods mostly play but there&#039;s a clear difference from what we consider to be &quot;player mods&quot; and them). \r\n\r\nIn my opinion Riot needs to hire their own mods instead of using a 3rd party. \r\n\r\n3rd party mods -are- fine, but not for these forums. These forums are too much of a community and not the, you know, &quot;stuck up professional keep everything to a strict point&quot; type of forums. They&#039;re okay for some but these are too community based.\r\n\r\nWe need Riot mods and here&#039;s why.\r\n\r\nWe need mods that when they make mistakes, there&#039;s an easier time relaying back and forth. What -should- happen is if you think there&#039;s a mistake, all there&#039;d have to be would be a button on your disciplinary message that would let you say you want the action appealed. You could write in the message box as well. If you abused it too much (appealing 50 different infractions you know) chances are you&#039;d probably be perma&#039;d anyways so that&#039;s not an issue. \r\n\r\nThat type of thing could be coded in a day or two easily, probably less than one. \r\n\r\n What this would do would be that it&#039;d forward your appeal to a higher up (say, someone like Keyru), so instead of having to make a ticket, then have the Rioter look at it, decide on it, answer, -then- have to talk with a third party team, -then- have to make sure they get it all down, all it&#039;d do would be to cut down on all of the steps. You press the button, leave a message, it gets sent off to to the higher up Rioter. They decide quickly, then it gets fixed or not and the mods are alerted. But the thing is you skip the player support ticket, you skip them having to talk with a 3rd party group which takes longer, you skip the 3rd party having to interpret things the best they can without being a part of Riot which sucks for them and limits their capabilities in all of this. \r\n\r\nBasically if Riot is paying 3rd party people why not just pay &quot;1st party&quot; people?\r\n\r\nThey say they&#039;ve trained them again. And again. And again. And again.\r\n\r\nOn the old forums? They were TERRIBLE. Porn posts left up for ages. But? Say you dont even like the mods, banned. Get banned for literally any random reason. It was stupid as shit.\r\n\r\nThey fixed at least a lot when they went to Boards but we were lied to in that they&#039;re still the same group. \r\n\r\nNow they&#039;ve been &quot;trained, retrained, retrained&quot;-- it&#039;s been years and this shit is still problematic. \r\n\r\nNo one is perfect. No one. But you know what&#039;d be easier? If instead of having to interpret the rules as a 3rd party, they&#039;d be part of the original party and team. \r\n\r\nI dunno. Thoughts?","replies":[]}
