Not all changed if I remember right just a lot/most (or maybe all, pretty sure it was most). \r\n\r\nThey&#039;ll happen again later too so if there&#039;s a nest you like you should probably get it now, but here&#039;s the thing-- here in Sac we don&#039;t really have many if any water types... Then Seels started showing up! But they&#039;re reported in spots most people don&#039;t know about I think, which is cool because while people on the Sac Poke&#039;GO reddit know about it, a lot of others don&#039;t, so you can run around with the cutest thing ever. \r\n\r\nIt was kinda funny too because I went out with family (we all play together) but we had to leave at a certain time, and I was one candy short of evolving. They stopped showing up for about 40 minutes and I got super scared, then I finally got the two that I needed to evolve-- the final one giving m the final candy just 5 minutes before we had to leave. \r\n\r\nAnd get this-- its IVs?\r\n\r\n11/15 att\r\n11/15 stamina\r\n15/15 defense.\r\n\r\n37/45 total.\r\n\r\nWhile 1100 may not seem insane, it caps out at 2145 but its stats for a 2145 are super good. So it&#039;s actually pretty well along the way instead of say, an Arcanine at 1100 (where it has a 2983 cap so you should probably have way way higher first). \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sooo happy GD, it&#039;s beautiful!","replies":[]}
