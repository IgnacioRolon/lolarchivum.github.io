I had one last night, before I stopped to play Normals, then I had one today after waking up.\r\n\r\nIt's been like this for over a month.\r\n\r\nIt's also almost never the enemy team. It's to the point I rejoice every time the enemy team gets a DC, because it's -finally- their turn... But it's almost never their turn.\r\n\r\nI'm not kidding when I say I average a DC a day, I mean it. I mean someone rage quits after bickering with another person, someone has poor internet, family issues, whatever. It's making Ranked impossible. Literally, every day a DC, if I don't, it's 2 DCs the next day. It's been like this for at least a month.\r\n\r\nI was Gold 1 90 LP, now I'm struggling to get Gold 1 again from Gold 2. I failed my series 5 times and a vast majority of those were to, you guessed it, AFKs.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's almost never the enemy team. And no, you can't just magically carry 4v5's, you can only in rare circumstances that almost never exist.\r\n\r\nI don't know why it's fair for this to happen to me, I don't know what I can say, I don't know what I can ask for, I just wish it would stop.\r\n\r\nOne week without having a DC on my team in Ranked would make me beyond happy...","replies":[]}
