Yes, you played really well that game. Not debating that. But unless you have a complete game, you're typically not getting an S.\n\nEdit#5: As for comparing to Vel, he had 100+ more cs than you, 18,000+ more damage than you, placed 6 more wards, killed 1 more ward, placed 1 more control ward, **had 1k+ more gold than you**, took 1 more tower, and took 1 more inhib than you. If you don't think all of that equals 4 kills, I don't know what to tell ya lol. His KDA was still over 5+, which is more than enough to get an S rating.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-03-03T13:49:10.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why you murder this poor soul?

It really comes down to that because that is what your score is compared to in the first place. It has not one damn thing to do with the other champs in the game. RIOT has stated this over and over and over and over yet people still think it has something to do with the other 9 people in the game.","replies":[]}]}
