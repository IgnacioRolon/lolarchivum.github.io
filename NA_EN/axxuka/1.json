I know it will happen. Its the melee version Bayonetta, but instead of joining smash she is joining league.

Bayonnetta combat could be similar but who knows. I expect swift ''Dancing style'' movement or else attacking with legs wouldn't fun to look at.\n\nWe saw all sort of weapons in league, but this one originality is worth the mention and I'm eager to know how the idea popped.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-11-18T15:14:49.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh god.
