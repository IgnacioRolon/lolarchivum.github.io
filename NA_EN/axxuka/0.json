It's more fun and light-hearted, and is really just champions in beach attire! \n\nFor other skins, we can create a stronger thematic with some story telling! More current skins have veered away from 'official lore' because skins are meant to portray an alternate fantasy, and something like an Arclight Morgana likely wouldn't fit in with her fallen angel lore. ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Axxuka","date":"2016-10-05T03:57:35.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh cool !

Not out of character for Jinx herself, they're appropriately insane for Jinx herself, but out of character with the persona Star Guardian Jinx is supposed to have according to the teaser website. They're so on-edge and insane, whereas Star Guardian Jinx isn't actually insane, she's more on-edge and rebellious, but still determined. I think Jinx's eyes in the teaser image where all 5 are falling down to the planet work really well - they give me this mixture of hot-headedness along with determination. \n\nI think appropriate eyes for her splash should be a bit more \"heh you're about to get blown up\" along with \"another one down\" rather than \"STARS GO BOOM EVERYWHERE\" Prestigious LB's eyes are the closest I can find just by randomly searching around. Something that looks slightly on-edge while looking confident/dominant and at the same time a little playful or teasing or flirtatious.\n\nObviously I haven't heard her voiceover yet so you're still better equipped to judge the accuracy of my critique, but that's the character impression I got from Jinx from the stuff we've been given so far, and it does not match up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2016-09-20T01:24:43.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're great\n\nI hope you guys do a jungler next time though we need like the full 5 man team effect!","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Ballad","date":"2016-09-20T04:01:34.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the lineup is\nTop - Lulu\nJg - Poppy\nMid - Lux\nAdc - Jinx\nSupport - Janna","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2016-09-20T01:01:12.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot KateyKhaos,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=ujlAxVAA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-09-20T00:21:01.033+0000)\n>\n> Ahhh, we&#x27;re so glad that you like the skins!
