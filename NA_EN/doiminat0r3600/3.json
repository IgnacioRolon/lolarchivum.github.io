This is one of the reasons why the system treats all disconnections equally and queue timers cannot be modified.\n\nIt sounds like your connection isn't completely stable, and there are a number reasons why this may be. I recommend [creating a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with our tech specialists so they can work with you to resolve this.\n\nTo expedite your ticket, you can run a set of logs using our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs) and attach them to your request.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2016-07-13T02:07:52.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen other people disconnect and reconnect to the lobby.

One is a disconnection from the platform called PVP.net, which allows you to chat and interact with other players. If you disconnect from this, it's possible to continue interacting with champ select. The other is a disconnection from the League servers entirely, which will typically not allow you to continue interacting with champ select.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion, please let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TSM Khal Drogo","date":"2016-07-10T02:15:35.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont play on wifi simple :p!","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2016-07-10T17:28:16.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your router goes down, your internet goes down.

I know 5ghz is shorter with stronger connection. We have an extention on the router so that network can reach across the house. I know networking enough to work a router properly.\n\nA long ethernet cable wouldnt even work. Imagine having a router directly above you but the way to get there is across 50ft there and back, through three doors, and having an incline of 20 ft. That's around 150ft of ethernet. Very bad decision for anything and anyone.\n\nIm saying that my router knows when the internet goes down. When the internet goes down, my router knows to stop broadcasting dead space to attempt to fix the issue by soft reset.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
