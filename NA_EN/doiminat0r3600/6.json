It was to encourage ADC's to leave the ward placement to the supports and grab oracle's to help clear the enemy wards. Since supports have the option to place wards AND grab oracle. ({{item:2045}} {{item:2049}} {{item:2301}} ), they wanted to encourage ADC's to do more then just place stealth wards as was the preferable method.\n\n Also, the XP is on last hit, same for minions and neutral monsters, that's Rito's preferred method for distributing xp and gold for kills.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2016-07-09T17:10:05.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also, the XP is on last hit, same for minions and neutral monsters, that's Rito's preferred method for distributing xp and gold for kills.\n\nit's shared for minions. That is supposed to be common knowledge. Gold is for last hit (unless you have mastery or items) and XP is shared in an area.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ast√¥lfo","date":"2016-07-09T16:13:51.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or lock it to people who have support items (the Frost Queen build or Targon's build or whatever such)?","replies":[]}]}
