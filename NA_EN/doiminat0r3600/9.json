The complaints should not stop, untill the issue is fixed.\n\nThis is a very exagerated comparsion but I feel i must make it.\n\nLets take the black equal rights movement in the MLK days\n\nOne can say\n\n\"we allready had a war for them, why are black people still complaining?\"\n\nYes we had a war, but problems still existed, so black people had to keep \"complaining\".\n\nIf black people stopped protesting after the war and simply settled for being \"free\", than the problems before them would still exist. The government knows the problem exists, but they would of done nothing to stop the problem for no one is \"complaining\".\n\nDo not stop complaining untill the problem is resolved.

They have said this a few times. People need to stop complaining about dynamic que when Riot knows.\n\nDon't trust Riot; that's how we got stuck with DQ in the first place. People looked at it, said it was bullshit, and Riot told us right to our faces that it's okay if DQ is a little broken for solo people because SoloQ would be coming back. Turns out, they were lying. What's worse, they knew they were lying. They never had any intention of releasing a SoloQ; since if they did it would be here after all this time. They blew smoke up our asses to get us to shut up and stop complaining.\n\nPlayers have short memories, but that particular burn is still _very_ fresh in their minds. Every complaint thread isn't just saying \"Dynamic Queue is trash\" it also says (metaphorically) \"We remember how you tricked us, it's not happening again\". Every time you complain about DQ, it keeps Riot honest by forcing them to confront the issue, even if they immediately click away from the discussion.\n\nDon't feel sorry for Riot when they're constantly haunted by their own dishonesty. They brought this on themselves, and they deserve every single topic that gets made reminding them of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HannahOfPiltover","date":"2016-05-11T21:40:57.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=doiminat0r3600,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kclYFTwI,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-11T21:08:47.307+0000)\n>\n> \n> **Stop complaining.**\n> \n\n\n*proceeds to make thread complaining about people complaining*","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2016-05-11T21:50:48.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm the only one tired of seeing this apparently.
