Why?\nHis passive should not be able to heal him for 50 HP per second every 2 minutes (in the early game). This leaves him an unstoppable killing machine (partnered with his abilities) at high levels unless you either burst him down or someone that does massive damage that is more than his regen. \n\nHe also shouldnt be able to heal like that in the middle of a fight. This adds a new focus of \"Dont focus the Tank\" to \"Focus Volibear because he can kill you and still escape with full health\" mentality inside of players.\n\nNot only is he Super tanky but he deals a Massive amount of DPS. His frenzy increases his attack speed by  8 / 11 / 14 / 17 / 20 % *passively* and when it reaches full stacks then you can choose to bite an enemy champion for 80 / 125 / 170 / 215 / 260 (+15% of bonus health) which is really strong. Not only does it deal 15% of your bonus health, it also doesnt consume the stacks of fury so you can lose most of your health in a matter of seconds. \n\nNot only is he Super tanky and Heals extremely fast and deals alot of damage but he simply out lives most ADC&#039;s in fights. {{champion:106}}&#039;s max lifesteal is the same as any ADC but even when he faces {{champion:77}} in a 1v1, {{champion:106}} can gain more life than {{champion:77}} even with his extra 55% lifesteal. Simply because his passive heals for so much so often. \n\nYou might be saying \"Oh but it has a cooldown\" but to that i say that it doesnt seem like much. If {{champion:106}} backs and gets all of his 3K Health back, that is atleast 30 seconds off the timer. Then when he runs back into the fight (depending on how close he is to nexus) it can take between 5 and  45 seconds. Then when he actually gets back into the fight and he gets down to the HP level that it activates (lets say about 30 seconds before the enemy team says \"Hey he is back, lets focus him\"), the cooldown is likely over. \n\n2 minutes = 120 seconds\n\n30 + 5 + 30 = 65 (Half the cooldown is gone)\n30 + 45 + 30 = 105 (almost all of the cooldown is gone)\n\nAlthough these are **ROUGH** estimations, i just thought i should bring them to people&#039;s attention considering nobody talks about how strong his passive can really be.\n\nEDIT: I know grievous wounds would cut down on his healing. But unless you take {{summoner:14}} (not likely if you are in top lane and take {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}}) then you have no option (especially if you are AD)","replies":[{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2015-05-24T16:53:37.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:14}} {{item:3165}} \n\nIf you see an enemy fiddlesticks, volibear, mordekaiser, vlad, akali, or soraka, Aat least one instance of each of these should be somewhere on the field to deal with the healing. bonus points for morellos on an AOE mage vs raka.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2015-05-25T02:06:04.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you're not AP?

But why isn't Mundo OP? Because he's an even bigger meat shield then Volibear. Volibear has quite a bit of health, but if he can't reach the carry, he's less effective HP wise then a Mundo is, and just as capable of contributing in damage as a Mundo: next to none.

With {{champion:106}}, its automatic.\n\nHe's really not well rounded, his glaring weakness is that its ridiculously easy to kite him with the proper peel, Vayne, Jinx, even Kog'Maw with the correct build and positioning for goodness sake can kite him effectively. I'm not gonna even mention Kalista since I think we can agree that bitch is a travesty. \n\nNot only that, while yes he's based off of health for the most part, he's heavily AA focused, meaning armor such as thornmail and frozen hearts will be the death of him. \n\nThat's exactly the point I'm making, Mundo provides much less damage per second then he does, but he provides significantly higher sustain and hp in return. The point I'm making is that Mundo is not considered to be overbearing specifically because his damage is not great. \n\nWith proper peel and kiting, Volibear can be rendered to be put in a position that is worse than Mundo's, unable to reach the carry, or do damage, all while having less health and sustain.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Elias1724,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lZAuoyNI,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2015-05-25T17:20:23.736+0000)\n>\n> I realize Volibear is classified as a fighter but I see most building full tank just because of that one health scaling bite.\n\nHis bite requires consistent AA before he can get it off. If he is capable of getting 3 AA off to perform that execute on your carry before you can peel him off or kill him, either he's stupidly fed, or the team is not properly peeling, or you got caught out in a 1v1, which, considering he has the kit for strong dueling, not at all surprising.
