If so, try the **ALT+ENTER** keystroke workaround once you see the loading screen pop up, as it will toggle you out of fullscreen mode and should serve as a workaround for now.\n\nIf you experience further issues with this or your framerate after using that workaround, or if you aren't experiencing that known issue, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2017-01-25T00:39:32.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think its the same issue because it only happens if I alt + Tab into the game/loading screen. If im tabbed out, the game doesnt launch and when I try to tab back in, I am met with a black screen, forcing me to close out the client or, more commonly, restart my system completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-25T21:53:14.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the issue still happen if you **don't** ALT+TAB during the loading screen?","replies":[{"poster":"doiminat0r3600","date":"2017-01-25T22:30:07.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think so.

The reason I ask is because Alt+Tabbing while your client is loading up assets, and trying to connect to our gameservers will often cause a lot of problems, including the issue you're having. I **strongly recommend** avoiding Alt+Tabbing during the loading screen (at least until you see all the splash arts and such show up) in the future.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
