I know for a fact it is enabled and I even downloaded firefox to be sure it wasn't just chrome. \nI don't get what the issue is. \nThis is troubling considering I'm not using a VPN or proxy and have always been on a WIFI network. \n\nEverything else appears to be in order. The DNS server is, and always has been 8.8.8.8 and the backup at 8.8.4.4.\n\nEdit: installed on my phone.\nCame back with \"Certain TCP protocols are blocked in outbound traffic\", \"Some DNS resolvers appear to be down\", and the only Major Abnormality is \"Your DNS resolver returns IP addresses for names that do not exist\" (This is because charter likes to use their own search engine suggesting advertisements relating to the thing that was searched, and I perceive it as normal)\n\nEdit 2:\nJust tested in a practice tool game.
