Please DO NOT join team builder solo queue as a support with a non-support champ (i.e. {{champion:105}} , {{champion:110}} , {{champion:238}} , {{champion:23}} , or {{champion:75}} ). The people who do this are sadistic assholes and don&#039;t deserve to play MMOs like this. Don&#039;t do it. Play {{champion:99}} , {{champion:1}} , or {{champion:53}}  instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Zydin","date":"2015-05-26T01:29:28.591+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"First...It's team builder, If someone wants to try one of those champs as a support and a team is willing to go along with it. There isn't a problem with it. If you don't like it there is no need for you to be an ass on the board, just don't accept them or if one gets on your team then leave that team for a different one. It's really very simple.","replies":[]},{"poster":"rampaging poet","date":"2015-05-27T03:58:27.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no problem with people taking off-supports bot lane as long as they make a good-faith effort to actually support or otherwise explain their strategy and the reason their choice could work.  If they're not a fit for your team, KICK THEM.  It's that simple.\n\nThe bigger problem IMO is people queuing as typical supports and then just taking all the CS and trying to carry.  Fake supports that only queued as support so they could get a game faster, then ruin the game for their team by running a completely different strategy than they said they would.  Most people will accept them onto the team and there's no way to detect that behaviour before the game actually starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kawaiian Pizzas","date":"2015-05-25T23:45:45.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"jesus dude, calm the fuck down... at least it's not ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"warpenguin555","date":"2015-05-26T01:35:39.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hows anivia?","replies":[{"poster":"DstryrOFwrldz","date":"2015-05-29T17:25:33.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she has some CC, so I would be happy to have her support","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gym Leader Yaki","date":"2015-05-27T13:05:28.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't like it, then you can kick them out of the team.
