When i re-log in, there is nothing left. My match history is left untouched, still at  50 LP at the time, and i cannot reconnect to any games. I check lolskill.net to check to see if i am still active in my game, which it reads as a yes. when i enter play, and go into ranked flex queue again, it lets me play. i am in champ select, and again recheck to see if my match history has updated, which it hadn't and lolskill still said i was in a game with Mordekaiser. i end finishing the champ select and enter that game that i had just queued up. When checking other Lolskill again, i was still in the first game as Mordekaiser, and in op.gg it said i was in the Teemo game. So what exactly happened? when i finished the Teemo game my LP reflected one loss from the Teemo game, but the other game had 0 impact on my LP. it is not showing up in my match history at all? Is there anyone who can care to explain/help me find the results?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-10T21:38:13.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did this occur?  I can see this happening if you were playing around the time of maintenance when the platform was either going down or back up.  In this case, it's possible that the match never made it to our servers.  If it's not showing up at all, it's likely a case of a disappearing game that won't make it on unfortunately.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Carcus80","date":"2017-05-10T21:54:11.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles, exact same thing happened to me last night, the game was started about 8:40\n\nThis might help you find it.\n\nspectator.oc1.lol.riotgames.com:8088 1E6k1nKGF6rygg2mJm7RC3dkoHBrAWgd 173210909 OC1\n\nThis loads up to the character screen, but no further.

It's likely that our matchmaking server failed to pickup the match.  Make sure to check the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce) page just in case, to stay up to date on maintenance or live issues.

So i am unsure of any patching or maintenance occurring. I remember the game was about to end in my favor, but since i relax when i play flex queue, it is no big deal. thank you for clarifying what occurred ^.^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AlenAngi","date":"2017-07-18T19:11:43.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just happened to me, on EUW.
