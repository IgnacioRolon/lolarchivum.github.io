This is true however mages are that but worse in every way, they do more damage take into account Lux marked ult, if i&#039;m Zed into Lux with standard runes at lvl 11 it does about 1000 dmg assuming we both have 2 completed items being morelos and ludens on Lux, and Zed having Maw and Youmuu&#039;s and with that i have like 200 hp left its just not fair, this all being done at a very long range. Zed will then do his combo and kill one person which is sad, but Lux then uses her E then her R and every member of the other team dies because its aoe. Look at Viktor his E and R are aoe that do INSANE amounts of dmg. Xerath, W, Q, R tons of aoe dmg. Brand W, E, R once again way to much aoe. So they just do what assassins do but aoe","replies":[{"poster":"Odd Gnome","date":"2016-11-01T01:13:27.031+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Whew...It's almost like Assassins are getting an update soon. \n\nIn other news it's pretty easy to avoid burst from Lux, Xerath, Viktor and Brand considering they all use skillshots. While Zed's ult is strangely enough...a point and click.","replies":[{"poster":"Pieeatsme1","date":"2016-11-01T05:27:21.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your point about Assassins getting a rework has no point in this comment, and I would like to see you dodge the ult and e from a decent Viktor player, Lux somewhat fair but her e will zone you unless you want to take free damage. Brand his e and ult are strangely enough.... a point and click and Brands others abilities will hit if they are a decent brand player. With Xerath you have a fair point but Xerath still has insane damage and so much range, he is easy to dodge but he is at such a safe distance that you won't be able to touch him even if you dodge all his damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-01T01:18:18.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lux ult never does 1000 damage under any normal conditions, _late_ game.\nAnd you can dodge it. Zed can dodge it especially easily, unless you wasted all your energy CSing with shurikens, which is your fault.","replies":[{"poster":"Pieeatsme1","date":"2016-11-01T05:29:18.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I find it hard to believe you have never been 100-0'd by a Lux (Keep in mind i am including her passive which is so easy for her to hit with her E)...

If she misses the snare she dies or blows flash because that's all her options left, if she hits it she'll deal like 200 damage and no lux would be bad enough to follow up against zed for the auto proc.","replies":[{"poster":"Pieeatsme1","date":"2016-11-01T07:03:49.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her E is very easy to land, a decent Lux will hit it and it does slow. Being that a lot of Lux players max E first, with morelos thats 20%  cdr, her E is now  45% slow and and a 8 second cooldown. Now most zed players max shadow last. With youmuus thats 10% cdr, his W his now a 19.8 second cooldown and with youmuus active if hit by Lux E he is currently down 25% movement speed (total), the odds are she will hit her ult at the point without you using your shadow, and if she is smart she will burn your shadow with her Q which lets her hit her ult for free, and if she wants she can wait to use her E again since the much shorter cooldown than your shadow and your youmuus for the full slow which will guarantee the ult landing(or Q which at the state I'm saying is 11.7 second cooldown) (if it is a decent Lux player). So after that she can just repeat the process until you are down flash or ghost if you brought it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-11-01T17:52:29.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E is easy to land, but e>ult is not so easy because it comes with a pretty big delay and you won't be slowed right away due to e's travel time. If it really becomes impossible to deal with, force her to choose between poking you and waveclear. Besides, if she forces your shadow with her q, she loses her \"hard\" cc so you can just dive her.","replies":[{"poster":"Pieeatsme1","date":"2016-11-01T22:16:35.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can wait for the E to land before ulting.... For your point of she can just dive you well a smart Lux player brings exhaust or barrier against a Zed and will use that summoner to survive a tower dive and she can use her E thanks to its short cooldown on Zeds ult shadow to force him to take turret shots or get set up for the e>ult from Lux","replies":[{"poster":"Ratbert","date":"2016-11-02T02:24:47.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well in the same way she can bring exhaust, you can bring cleanse. \n\nWell if she waits for e to land, you can usually run out of it by the time her ult hits so she won't get the proc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Umbral Knight","date":"2016-11-01T02:38:56.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mages are more annoying but not because of damage. Its because they have more utility with the damage. Roots, stuns, Burns, slows, and the like are usually more available in Mage kits than Assassins and also more intense. Some assassins have slows but not at the same strength as many mages. I can't really think of any Assassins with roots or stuns. Fizz is probably the most utility based Assassin with his Playful Trickster. And AoE is a main stay of Katarina. \n\nMages allow for utility and require more mental planning where as Assassins usually just have to time their assault right or die.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Knight","date":"2016-11-01T02:39:49.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I forgot about Rengar having a root sometimes with his bolas.
