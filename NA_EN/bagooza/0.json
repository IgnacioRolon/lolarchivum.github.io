I just wanted to make a post to see if anyone out there has been sharing my pain. \r\nSo I am a Kindred main, I love the character so much.  Her design, her music, her voice, etc.  I&#039;ve mained her since she&#039;s been released.  I&#039;m mad though because, she has not had a new skin for 2 years.\r\nI know there was this whole thing with {{champion:7}} where she hadn&#039;t gotten a skin for 2 years as well, and when they finally release Program LeBlanc none of the LeBlanc mains like it.  However, unlike Kindred, she has more than 2 skins.  Kindred only has 2.  Don&#039;t get me wrong I love both of her skins. I just feel as though she deserves better.\r\nOkay that&#039;s all thanks for reading my little rant, peace.","replies":[]}
