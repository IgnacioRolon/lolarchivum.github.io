So for ranked its either you have a team of 5 (which would make riot some money from sponsorships and so on) or if you are a solo player then you get fucked with the matchmaking system. so much for the fair game play that they fucking promise, and i hope that idiot developer isn&#039;t getting paid for a shit job he did.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-29T03:19:40.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Write about aliens while you are at it, ok? \nThe system does not intentionally match you with bad players.

Like i'll have 5-8 match win streaks where I get 3.0+ KDA on all of them and carry most of them myself. And then suddenly I start getting teams that have no idea what they are doing, which make me question how they got to the same elo as me if I'm out there trying and they just seem like they are playing for the first time. I've thought this many times, that when you go o na good win streak you end up getting matched with bad teams. I have always just thought it was my MMR. Like if my MMR skyrockets from a long win streak, then I get matched against better players on the enemy team which wreck my team and then make it too hard to carry, or I myself don't do well but cant rely on my team to carry because the other team is too good. But that isn't very consistent, why wouldn't my team have high MMR as well? Its definitely odd, long win streaks usually follow long lose streaks, and whenever I get to series I get at least 1 person whom is really bad at the game, and I have no idea how they got matched with me (not that I'm pro, but I seem to at least know what I'm doing). Like doesn't everyone grind to get to higher elo? so how is it some guy with B5 skills is playing on your team, or the enemy team for that matter, like how does that add up? Like I had grinded like a mother fvcker to get to gold, and just my last match (I just vented about it in a post) I had a swain on my team do 1/8 or so coming into mid game. Then he would just face check bushes and purposedly go into 3v1 fights and stuff. My support did the same, she would just wonder around unwarded areas like as if she's never realized that's a bad idea. also fed like crazy. So all this work I did to get to the elo I am now wasn't necessary for those players I guess, because they make mistakes I had to learn just to get out of bronze in mid season 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Bobslidel","date":"2016-09-29T16:49:22.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree, and have been wondering along the same lines. I went on a 5 game win streak, got promoted, then immediately went into a loss streak. 4 losses in a row, ended up back where I started in LP. This has happened on numerous occasions, with sometimes loss streaks lasting 5-10 games over several days (I normally take a break after two losses). \n\nOn this most recent repetition, every game went the same way. All lanes lost and when/ if I got ahead in lane i'd get camped. Valid strategy, if the other two lanes are winning, camp the lane that isn't. \n\nI'm far from pro, admittedly. It took me longer than I'd care to admit to climb out up from the division i've found myself in the last two season. But I see this with startling regularity in ranked.  Win streak with teams that seem to play well together, then lose streak with flamers/ feeders/ trolls or just people having really bad games (myself included). \n\nWorst of all, after said win streak, I got my secondary role 3 times in row with 3 losses. At one point this season, I had close to a 55% win rate, the best i've ever attained. Before this season I'd never had more wins than losses. However, due to loss streaks like the above, i'm now sititng at 51.5%. I will say, however that my winrate in my main role is closer to 60%. \n\nAll in all, if nothing else I'm glad to see i'm not alone in feeling this way. It may simply be RNG, extraordinary swings in fortune, or simply getting tilted and every game subsequent feeling hopeless. But game after game where the enemy team is 10+ kills ahead within the first 10-15 minutes  makes it hard to not get disheartened. \n\nProbably just time for another break from ranked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mojihito666","date":"2016-09-29T12:50:18.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats exactly the reason why i stopped playing.","replies":[]}]}
