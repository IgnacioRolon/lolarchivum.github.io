If I could find the artist or artists that created Kai&rsquo;Sa, I would love to pay for or some how earn a piece of artwork/concept art for her to frame in my office. \r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s a huge request, but something I NEED to complete my office! She&rsquo;s absolutely amazing, congrats and thank yous to the team involved in her design! \r\n\r\nLet me know, thank you!!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MEMEMEMEME","date":"2018-03-12T16:55:42.382+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dueos thank you for the kind words appreciate it :)\n\nAs for art stuff you can find The Bravo Ray's concept work of her here - https://the-bravo-ray.deviantart.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2018-03-12T17:00:28.169+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can also find FeralPony's work of her here -\n https://twitter.com/RiotTokkelossie/status/971855505378312192","replies":[{"poster":"Dueos","date":"2018-03-12T17:23:00.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There we go haha!
