Something I want to get out of the way quickly, which I feel like is a foundation to my reasoning. There is a lot of champions in league at the moment (and I&#039;m hoping that never stops) however, it is OK for some champions to always appeal to few players. Play-rate should almost rarely ever factor into reworking a champion. Game health, Unique Identity, Satisfaction, and Balance however should be the traits to be considered.\n1. First thing off the bat. Aurelion Sol is a very powerful champion. However as many have seen, he has very exploitable weakness. This is something that prevents other players from playing him, as they don&#039;t know how to cope with it or want to cope with it. However in my opinion (and many others) this is a great learning curve for players who do want to play Sol and part of this feeling it feels so successful to play him. \n2. Earlier I mentioned Satisfaction is a important reason of whether or not to rework a champion (regardless of whether it&#039;s small or large). A common mistake people who don&#039;t play Sol is that they say he feels unsatisfying to play. This is wrong. Remember: there is already a lot of champions in league; let those players who feel like that, play those champions. Since this is the case, and play-rate doesn&#039;t matter, we must instead seek the opinions of players who DO play Sol. Every single one of those players love the play-style and find it very satisfying. Whenever you see a good Sol play you just watch their screen in awe. His play-style when played well is really something special. I&#039;ve said it before and I&#039;ll say it again, there are already so many champions in league, let a few champions appeal to those players who love the play-style and understand it. Taking that away from them, is also taking a part from them as well. If you want a champion that feels more satisfying to play appeal to a great majority of players, just make a new champion (like Kayn for example, so see? No need to rework Sol).\n3. There is a final nail in the coffin on why reworking Sol is a terrible idea. He is one of the few champions I look at and say, &quot;this champion is a perfection of balance&quot;. He&#039;s just in such a good spot in the moment, which is why I was so shocked when a possible mini-rework was announced. His play-style and roaming potential was so well made, just game-wise he is extremely healthy. While he seems weak to other players (or unsatisfying) he is a monster in the right hands - and no it&#039;s like our buddy Azir {{champion:268}} . Unlike Azir, Sol was crafted so well that he has clear to see weaknesses; which is why I have been saying, and will continue to say, makes him a really healthy champion in our beloved game League of Legends.\n\nRinard, you have made a amazing champion. Don&#039;t think for a second he needs any kind of rework. Making a champion that special is something you should feel good about. It&#039;s a champion that will face the test of time I promise you. Don&#039;t worry about play-right, just feel great that the champion you made truly shines in the hands of the right players. \n\n\nSave Sol {{champion:136}} everyone please. I am begging you all. Up-vote this post, and feel free to add to what I&#039;ve posted. Riot it&#039;s okay to make mistakes, but this is one you have more than enough time to prevent; please do so. Keep Sol in the hearts of his summoners.\n\ntl;dr There is more than enough champions that appeal to a majority of players, and it should be fine for a few champions to appeal to only specific champions. Instead of basing a rework off of the feedback from those players who don't play him, understand he feels great to play for those that do play him. Sol is a very balanced champion, who feels like a powerful champion to play in the right hands, but unlike Azir; still has very clear weaknesses that the player must learn to cope with. Sol is a great champion who doesn't need a rework, and probably will stand the test of time.\n\n EDIT: As summoner Danielpezglobo has pointed out, it seems Riot has already done some tests and have concluded that it might not be the best to change his abilities much after all. They still might do some tweaks but as for a rework nothing is planned at the moment. Which is a huge relief! Here is the link Danielpezglobo posted: https://www.reddit.com/r/Aurelion_Sol_mains/comments/5smzm7/minirework_no_longer_planned_riot_might_settle/","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2017-07-01T05:01:50.047+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, thank you for taking the time to really put your heart out here on the boards and defend one of your favorite champions. It goes a long way when someone writes more than a couple of inflammatory sentences denouncing an upcoming change/nerf/buff.\n\nEverything you said has a lot of merit and I want to impress upon you that I agree almost completely. There are a couple of things with the current iteration of Aurelion Sol that I want to bring to light that is probably one of the core reasons he will more than likely receive a core rework:\n\n1. Aurelion Sol is the only champion in League of Legends with what I call an 'absolute weakness.' What this means is that there is a condition in which Aurelion is completely powerless to perform without using a summoner spell or burning his ultimate to distance opponents. The concept of maintaining a range of influence is a very novel one that I think can be and has been implemented to great effect, but having to rely on your ultimate to function against certain kinds of opponents (gap-closing assassins) or lose almost every single time is too extreme for League of Legend's schema. If anyone breaches your inner circle of influence, only your ultimate can inflict any meaningful damage and cc to them. With such a long cooldown on a truly underwhelming ability for an ultimate worthy of this star dragon, his kit offers too many avenues to punish the champion and not enough power as compensation. To exemplify this: he relies wholly on a Rylais Crystal Sceptre to function effectively. A champion should never NEED to purchase a particular item to function at a marginal level.\n\n2. While I agree that a low play rate does not mean a champion needs to be reworked, I get the feeling that Aurelion Sol missed the mark for what Riot (and by extension the community) had envisioned. I spent a lot of time early on during his release learning to play him. I personally think I've gotten pretty good with him and can do reasonably well in most cases, but he has arguably one of the highest skill caps in the game, and by that same token arguably the highest skill floor. Riot has expressed an interest in lowering that skill floor without altering the skill ceiling so that more players can see Aurelion Sol as a viable pick, rather than a daunting time sink.\n\nHe is an amazing concept and can be a truly great champion (just watch Huhi play him when he is allowed). There are just too many criteria that must be met for him to excel, many of which are dependent on full team cooperation. Ultimately Riot just wants Aurelion Sol to appeal to a larger audience of players, and I can understand that.","replies":[{"poster":"Mamacrow","date":"2017-07-01T17:07:38.227+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make lots of good points, and thank you for reading it all and responding with enough words to see where your coming from.

He isn't a strategic champion, nor is he a high skill champion. He's pretty binary. He additionally doesn't really incorporate anything that makes him a dragon. We could have literally taken ekko's model and given him the same skills. Actually we could have taken almost any model and gave them Aurelion's skills.\n\n\nAdditionally, as much of a plea you make to allow Aurelion Sol to be limited to a few players, did anybody care when Akali players wanted that? Or Karma? Or old Sion? Nobody gave a damn when they had their champions gutted and reworked and changed because not many people played them.","replies":[{"poster":"SteelMankind","date":"2017-07-01T04:30:20.128+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"What makes him binary? I agree that he's not a particularly high skill or strategic champion, but I don't see how that means Sol is binary.\n\nAs for the whole \"isn't really a dragon\" thing - I assume you mean he's not all fire and rage and destruction? Keep in mind we already have Shyvana as a champion, so the traditional dragon is already accounted for. Way back when Sol started as Ao Shin, Riot wanted to him to be a mage, which doesn't fit well with the fantasy you'd associate with typical dragons. Aurelion doesn't kill with claws and teeth - he's more refined, and uses magic. Likewise, rather than having a breath of fire, he has a voice of light. \n\nAnd just imagining Ekko using Sol ult or E, or Sol anything, really... lol. You could give Quinn or Anivia Sol E and it wouldnt look out of place. Everything else is so core to the star dragon that it would be weird.\n\nThe difference between few people playing Sol, or Taric, or Illaoi, or any other unpopular recent release/rework and old Sion/Karma/Poppy, is that the former have rewarding, cohesive, modern designs that concievably could be balanced, whereas the latter were objectively unhealthy and would always be kept weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2017-07-01T10:32:28.630+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem is that Aurelion Sol's lore is all about how he is this all powerful being so far above everyone else in LoL and how he can create and crush stars at will.

Aurelion Sol definitely isn't a god but since he created stars and most of what those humans see on the night's sky, at the very creation of the said Universe, you can bet your ass that he can wipe out a simple planet without sweat.\n\nThe only reason he's doing menial \"tasks\" and even does the bidding of humans is because Targonians (Ascended residents of Mount Targon that aren't specific to the planet Runeterra is a continent of) tricked him into wearing a specific crown that was supposed to be a gift to his greatness. In fact, that crown forces his obedience as every time he goes against the will of his masters, it's when Targonians destroy one of his creations (his stars). Of course, Aurelion Sol is fed up and annoyed that the Targonians had the audacity to chain him like this and he wants to erase their existence because of it. This is happening at the time where Targonian presence in his crown is waning (Targonians are losing their control over him slowly) and this is where Aurelion Sol sees an opportunity to show them what happens when the mere mortal arrogance crosses paths with a celestial being as old as time itself.\n\nYou really ought to read his lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2017-07-01T13:44:39.142+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did read his role though, in the role he literally created and threw a star on the spot to wipe out all the void creatures in the area, closed the portal and killed a huge amount of Targorians including their Pantheon which is supposedly also a deity.\n\nHe does that in game and it deals 100 damage max, and stuns for 1 second.

Furthermore It's about preserving the persona and reflect it via the gameplay. I think Riot has succeeded in this with ASol's kit. He's effortless, letting his passive take down his enemies and doesn't really care to much about this 'nonsense'.

Quite a few champs can handle him, you just need to know how.\n\nEven the 'simpler' kit champions are powerful if put into hands that really know how to use them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mamacrow","date":"2017-07-01T16:51:32.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This!

I lost count of how many times I will totally destroy him in lane, but that does little due to how easy he can clear waves and leave lane. Whats that? I am a 5/0 Ziggs or Malz and Sol is 0/5? Sol will pop the wave faster than me and just roam bot vastly faster than I can ever keep up with and get a double kill or 2 assists.\n\nI get he is a roaming champ, but cmon, if he is behind he shouldn't be able to easily clear waves though. And I thought Ziggs or Yasuo were monsters at popping waves. Sol does it quicker and can just E to another lane and just rekt.\n\nAlso as others have said, he is pretty binary, he literally either perma slows you in his stars or you jump in his face and casually kill him since he has nothing he can do to stop you, all he has is his ult which you can then either walk away from him or run into his face again.\n\n\nI would like his playstyle to be the same but I would like if either his stars had falloff damage or he had to charge his E on how far it goes. It just feels unfair facing him in lane since he can just so casually push wave and roam.","replies":[{"poster":"CasterGilgamesh","date":"2017-07-01T06:07:42.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fact that he is a glorified minion the second anyone gets in his zone should be why he is allowed to has such a power like what else besides roaming and wave clear would you pick him.Also Ziggs deletes towers Yasuo is perma banned for just existing they are clearly stronger then sol.","replies":[]}]}]}
