I used to be ridiculously toxic, and received two two week bans, and very quickly after I received a permaban. In retrospect it was VERY WELL DESERVED. I'm not questioning whether or not it was deserved. My two year BANniversary is coming up, and I really feel reformed. I was wondering if I could have the account reinstated since I'm reformed, and have proved that I'm reformed by hitting honor 5.\r\n\r\nThank you for the read. Have a nice day. :D\r\n\r\n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-26T23:31:51.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once an account hits a permanent ban it's likely not getting lifted since usually it goes through several warnings and suspensions. The goal with those is to give time to reflect and reform before a permanent ban is necessary. You're always welcome to reach out to our account team in a ticket to see what's going on with your other account, but regardless of the outcome, I'm still glad to hear you finished the trek to Honor rank 5!","replies":[]}]}
