I play a lot of TT, and I agree that some changes needed to be made, but the distance between the two tier 1 turrets in both lanes in a tad rediculous no? I mean you can&#039;t do much in lane early other than cs cause if you play aggressive you&#039;re basically tower diving. On top of that, I feel that if you play a range or an early game champ, you can easily bully someone out of lane and make them lose a ton of cs... Since the turrets right there and will kill off multiple waves before the player can get back... Allo easy snowball!","replies":[{"poster":"poodoo","date":"2015-06-12T19:05:14.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The changes stink.","replies":[]}]}
