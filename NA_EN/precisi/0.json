It was a fun project, but I'm not planning on offering any for sale. However, I'm happy to share how I made it.\n\nThe hat itself is a pre-made fleece baby hat with ears. I found it on Amazon. (Search for 'green baby hat' and it should be one of the first results. It's by Zutano.) Then I went to the craft store and bought some felt (red and light blue), some black elastic and teal yarn. I cut two sets of rectangles for the goggles and rounded the corners off, then stitched them together. I cut slits on the sides to thread the elastic through, then stitched the goggles to the hat. I secured the elastic in the front, sides and back, which was really the trickiest part because I didn't want it to be too tight or too loose. Finally, I looked up how to make a tassel online and made one out of yarn, then stitched it onto the top. \n\nAnyway, here are a couple of pictures of the project sans baby.

Thanks for taking the time to post on the forums about it. I am sure that a lot of people are dying to try something like this out. Also, now I am wondering about which other champions we could take a few fashion pointers from. The hair on Diana's Lunar Goddess has me jealous, tbh. Watch out for my tutorial, guys! Now, I just have to spend ten years growing it out to her length...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yoella","date":"2015-01-08T06:56:17.676+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't set him down for too long, his passive might kick in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xtremey","date":"2015-01-08T00:12:51.344+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"so your friend is a satanist?\n\nIs dressing your child in satan-like garb a form of worship? i dont get it ","replies":[{"poster":"Nagirah","date":"2015-01-08T08:04:29.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In reality his friend just sacrifised this baby to Satan.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DrUnne","date":"2015-01-07T23:39:41.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beware what he drops!  \n\nAnd yes, D'awwww worthy by far!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-01-08T02:30:45.826+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If he picks up a straw im taking smite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avios1","date":"2015-01-09T15:41:23.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adorable, Just adorable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bixits","date":"2015-01-08T17:31:52.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's adorable ","replies":[]},{"poster":"BillDance","date":"2015-01-08T10:23:27.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is really adorable {{champion:17}}    now if riot made a teemo mushroom pacifier to go with haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"2mKP5UquH0","date":"2015-01-08T09:34:57.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So cute :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daughter of Nox","date":"2015-01-08T06:46:54.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That baby is adorable!
