They&#039;ve currently figured out what they want to do with it. So ignoring my distaste for it (since nothing that Riot has decided on gets changed or removed)\r\n\r\nThey&#039;ve also stated they have a system in place to promote doing more than one role, so that people shouldn&#039;t just spam mid games. What could this system be? Should this system exist? Is Team Builder Draft even a good idea?","replies":[{"poster":"ZeeDrakon","date":"2015-05-27T20:39:20.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive literally talked hours and hours about this with a friend of mine, and we came to following conclusion:\n\n-it will reduce overall toxicness\n-it will give toxic people the chance to get higher elo, since they dont have to be toxic when not getting their role anymore\n-it will greatly benefit one trick ponies/people that main one lane, and will be a huge \"nerf\" for allrounders\n-it will make climbing in low elo harder due to less trolls and less afks\n\nwe also concluded that we both dislike the change becaue we despise the thought of toxic people getting higher elo than now because communication and attitude will be less valuable, though we both wont be affected by it since we estimated that toxic players that are now in bronze or silver wont really get higher than gold","replies":[]}]}
