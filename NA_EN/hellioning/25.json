A champion can get nerfed a bunch of times and still be overpowered if each nerf was individually too little; likewise, a champion can be nerfed only one or two times, but can be much weaker than a champion who's been nerfed several times. A champion being 'nerfed' can mean anything from '5 less base damage on one of their abilities' to 'increased mana costs, decreased range, reduced movement speed, etc.', so I think we should focus more on what the nerfs actually are instead of the number of them.","replies":[]}
