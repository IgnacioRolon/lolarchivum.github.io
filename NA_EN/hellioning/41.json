She could be wearing a long tailed suit (she already has those 'tailfeather' things in her normal outfit) and Valor can have what he's wearing in the picture, AKA an adorable bowtie. Maybe even a tophat?\r\n\r\nI can think of any different spell effects, but that's what the 750 rp price tag is for, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Tesla Effect","date":"2015-03-12T01:33:32.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its called \"French Maids\".","replies":[]}]}
