Seriously, one can speak all he wants about databases and such, but if you care about delivering content you have ready you just ask someone to do a temporary webpage in which to manually input the content. The fact that we don't have such a thing nor any lore piece apart from Xerath's (in which the character's core got changed, but I'd digress) and Azir's on the board speaks about them not having any content ready. They pulled the retcon and the Shurima event with nothing concrete in their hands. What they had, probably earlier versions of Azir's and Xerath's stories, had to be worked again on too, because they realized they were not good enough. They projected a hell of a giant rework, involving pretty much everything in LoL's lore, and they didn't even have two good stories ready?\nI can't have a bright outlook on this, sorry. The most I can achieve is to know that they will do as they did after the closure of the JoJ: silence, sudden reveals, promises of communication, silence, sudden reveals, promises... in all this we'll get some good hyping marketing moments from time to time, the occasional rework in which they'll say that they may have messed, but have learnt and will do better next time and so on.\nThe only positive possibility is them launching LoL's story through another medium (new game, comics, books, whatever) and so finally giving it a bit of attention and regularity.\n\nI do know they stated they want to do something \"serial\" with the lore pages on the website, but if to just set a webpage they need more than a month...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MEMEME670","date":"2014-11-05T00:35:19.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't.

Forces on the Field of Justice were limited by what the Institute of War would allow.\n\nIn the process of the retcon they've opened the door of possibilities. They can do anything they want now with champion direction, map direction, etc.\n\nSo, while it might not have been necessary to retcon, I think it probably was the fastest way to rip off the bandaid (if you will) and now provides the opportunity to heal that wound with awesome content. I hope that they deliver.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-11-04T21:18:37.481+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lacked depth? Could you explain this?

Why should anyone know about the exiled Noxians who gave birth and harbour Annie? How could Sejuani interact with Lulu? What are Zac and Alistar supposed to be up to?\nA lot of champions just have the \"and then they joined the league\" leitmotiv replaced by \"and then they wandered Valoran / a part of Valoran\".\nLook at Rammus and Amumu, what are they supposed to do all alone roaming the deserts of Shurima?\nOnly champions with affiliations to big players like Demacia and Noxus have a reason to be engaged in some serious action and find themselves interacting on a global scale. Others, like Caitlyn who is a sheriff and a detective or Heimerdinger who is a scientist just get stuck in their city. They're not the military, even in case of war they're not automatically supposed to march into the fray.\n(Ok, Caitlyn wanders foreign places to follow C but... come on, if she's the sheriff she can't ditch her work everyday!)\n\nThe creation of content not adamantinely bound to gameplay didn't require the retcon as a necessary ingredient. You know, in season one we had that trailer (and bloopers) which was everything but gameplay accurate.\n\n> In any case, it's more a matter of freedom to outside of those restrictions than it is the inability to write within them.

The point is, a lot of people don't find those reasons compelling at all and thought-of counter arguments to those have been outright ignored by the narrative team.

Some may enjoy that kind of storytelling, but I do not and others too don't dig a story which is unreliable and subject to be erased and forked into an alternate universe with a different storyline.\nA lot of people who frequent this board and who are against the retcon just wanted the old storyline to be progressed, that's why it totally sucked for us to have it cut off while a different one takes its place as canon. Meanwhile beloved characters change significantly too and that hurts those who liked them.\nNo surprise there's a lot of disappointment in the air.\n \n> Just IMO.\n\nObviously this all is *my* most humble opinion, I hope I didn't come as blunt nor rude replying you =P","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2014-11-04T23:04:12.822+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I may add my opinion- even if all the things that were said about the IoW being true (limitations and such), that didn't necessitate the 100% removal of it.

If we look at the Kalamanda arc, we see a good story which makes use of this very \"restriction\" to deliver a rather intriguing plot arc in which we get the so craved character progression they aimed at being able to deliver with the retcon.\nI'm not saying the retconned lore is not apt to deliver what they want, I mean that the old lore could do that too and (here is a personal taste) was more original.\nThe IoW and its members were not omnipotent and the JoJ has many instances of this: they didn't know Malzahar and Kassadin would clash and didn't stop them but the second time they battled and only because they were doing it near their facilities; Jarvan IV was the target of an assassination attempt schemed and executed by Swain within the very IoW and High Councilor Vessaria Kolminye arrived when a pretty violent fight had already taken place; the IoW's higher-up involved in the Kalamanda conspiracy got his plot revealed and was apprehended before he could seek asylum in Noxus.\nThis is just to argue the IoW was not only a restriction, but a possible plot device. For instance, if they started where they left, there was \"outcry against the Institute of War in the streets of Demacia and Noxus\" and all this could have led to the IoW facing a difficult political moment, with city states withdrawing part of their support. All this could have led to a weakening of the IoW's hold on some dangerous beings, like Brand and Nocturne & co.\nI don't mean they should have gone with these stories, but it's a proof that plot could progress even with the IoW there. It was as much a restriction as the Ministry of Magic is a restriction for the Harry Potter saga.\n\nOf course with the retcon of everything they opened up possibilities, because basically there is no lore right now for a major part of the world and its characters. Now comes the problem: they announced a retcon when they had no material to ship. It's been more than a month since then and we've got two stories for two champions out of the multitude of those for whom the IoW was a core part of their background (see Jax, Fiddlesticks etc). It was all extremely bad timed and that is the biggest remark that's been done.\n\nThe IoW may have been born because they wanted an easy way to get story into the game, but as they built upon it for two years it was no bandaid anymore, it was actually the very core and pillar of the LoL's experience. We are called summoners for a reason, the Influence Points are called that way for the same reason, the only true stories seeing characters' progression developed for the game were in the JoJ and in a setting with the IoW. As others pointed out, Noxus waging war against Ionia made logistically sense because at the boundary between Noxus and Demacia there was the IoW; without it Noxus sent its resources on a far away island opening itself to Demacia's possible aggressions. Since, if pieces of lore not involving the IoW stay canon as they said, there were precedents involving Jarvan IV, Swain, Garen and Urgot taking part in battles and their consequences (like J4's avoided execution and the subsequent death of Urgot), there's no real reason for Demacia not wiping them out while they were focused elsewhere.\nBesides, without the IoW, how does Ionia come out of the Noxus occupation?\nThe point is: messing the timing on all this has made so that they opened a number of plot holes higher than the number of issues they wanted to fix.\n\nThis is what I meant by \"it was sufficient, not necessary\": they could have reached their goals with the old setting too, so it was not necessary to retcon, but surely retconning is a sufficient condition to achieve them because it gives you a blank state to work with. The cons being that, messing the timing, you have a game with no coherent and solid lore for a whole lot of time and if Riot's past lore deeds are to be kept in mind, then it could be *years* of such a state.\nThat's why a lot of people got pissed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
