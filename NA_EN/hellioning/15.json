I want more (which should be a good thing), but I can't tell if that's because the comic was pretty anemic in any actual lore or because it was purposely designed well to leave me curious for more. The comic just repeats the same ideas that his small blurb and his animation already tell us. The blurb is suppose to be a summary so that's forgiven but I don't feel like I'm learning anything new except that Ekko blames himself for his friends death. \n\nI can't help but compare this to other game comics like Dota 2's or Dawngate's and feel like they executed theirs much better to Riot's. We get much more world building, character interactions and personalty revealed through theirs than we got from this.

If Riot decides to make a series of comics (like the TF2 comics; those are awesome), I'd be ecstatic, but it seems like the lore we've been getting have been more like one-off experimentation/teasers on how they want to tell stories (Ekko's comic & teaser video, Bard's video and teasers, Amumu's song, Shurima event, Sion's rework reveal, etc.), instead of progression of a narrative","replies":[{"poster":"turkeyBACON","date":"2015-05-21T20:56:44.266+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.
