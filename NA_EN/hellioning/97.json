I&#039;m aware that those two skins have things that the other two do not have (recall animations) but why are those recall animations necessary to make the whole &#039;SSW fantasy&#039;? Like, why the recall on Twitch? Are SSW known for rolling around on the grass?\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s just me desiring the entire skin line to be even but it&#039;s still weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-29T07:15:11.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8VjQ-dxl8o&feature=youtu.be&t=530\n\nWatch that for a minute to see why Twitch does that. Unique recalls take more effort to make so are part of the higher tier of skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-29T07:23:36.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, that explains it. I don't pay much attention to pro play.\n\nStill, really weird to have 2 that are randomly better. I understand them wanting to make Twitch do that, but couldn't they come up with recall animations for the other 3 so they could match up?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-04-29T07:27:58.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know about it either, the link was in the article on the front page.\n\nThey have a goal of a certain percentage of each skin price tier. Making two of those the 1350 tier (which includes new recalls) might have simply fell into their time budget.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2015-04-29T07:20:39.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a bit ridiculous to just make two of the skins better.
