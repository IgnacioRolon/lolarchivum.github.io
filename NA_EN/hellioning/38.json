Either his power is nerfed, or the summoner's get super buffed.  Only other explanation is that he descended from the heavens, offering himself.  At that point \"Why?\"\n\nSame goes for Kindred.

You cant have mythology without characters and you cant have culture without some added mythology in it, otherwise its shallow and not realistic.\n\nThats how mythology works, to explain certain forces and fenomena in the world, you create characters to represent those things.

Death is not tied with the Shadow Isles, Death is actually shunned and feared in the Shadow Isles since most of its current residence are Undead, meaning those that shunned death. Kindred being split apart is a methaporical representation of death and the duality of life and death, emotions and knowledge, freedom and control, Yin and Yang.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Krizalid","date":"2015-09-20T09:02:04.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HUMAN CHARACTER with a LEGIT backstory WHEN?","replies":[]}]}
