I guess Darius&#039; new passive is just an extension of his current one, but Garen&#039;s is really weird. Skarner&#039;s passive is really stupid; it relies on his team to do anything, and his enemies get gold for preventing him from succeeding. And Morde...\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind the idea that Morde is a duo lane bruiser. Really, I don&#039;t, anything that makes Marksman not mandatory is a decent idea. But Riot&#039;s going in the exact opposite direction. They&#039;re not giving him options to go in the bot lane, they&#039;re FORCING him to go into the bot lane. Straight up preventing Creeping Death from doing damage unless both instances are touching a champion is going to murder his solo lane potential, and makes his support choice really weird (if I pick a tanky melee, it&#039;s a double melee lane and I can easily get bullied. If I pick a squishy ranged, I&#039;m asking Sona/Soraka/Janna to get into melee range with me. I guess my options are Thresh or Thresh!)  His extra passive is basically &#039;he gets his ult before you do, here&#039;s hoping you&#039;re playing a champion that can bully him before then!&#039;\r\n\r\nI guess the only one I&#039;m really upset about is Morde, but even the other three seem...lazy. Like, they decided &#039;ball of stat champions are bad; ball of passive champions are good!&#039; I do not understand this.","replies":[{"poster":"Laraso","date":"2015-08-04T20:15:13.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god I'm not the only one upset with the Morde changes.","replies":[]}]}
