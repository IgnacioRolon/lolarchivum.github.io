The worst thing about that is, you can do absolutely nothing about it. You know why? You can't leave. You can't kick them. You have literally 0 way of preventing yourself from ever encountering them again cause guess what, they are in the next game too and they are doing the very same thing.\n\nI'd rather have a DC than a troll.","replies":[{"poster":"Emmy Cha0s","date":"2014-08-13T00:37:23.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you catch it in champ select, looking at their history beforehand.
