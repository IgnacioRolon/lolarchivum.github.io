Constantly being in bird form, basically permament CC lockdown for some champs, constant skillshot wars, it can be  great.\r\n\r\nBut when you&#039;re losing, it feels terrible. You tp somewhere, immediately run into a Zed or something, and then promptly get destroyed, to wait for another half minute before you do it all again. And if you manage to win against that Zed, he can just dash away.\r\n\r\nI get why people like it, and it&#039;s great fun, but if this was permament no one would ever play it.","replies":[{"poster":"Balareon","date":"2015-04-02T00:28:38.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have fun even when losing. The one time i got mad was when my team surrendered one game. Were we losing? yah. Were we getting insta bursted by almost anyone on their team? yah. But it was a hell of a lot of fun anyway and i wanted to continue.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-02T00:32:26.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not losing that I have a problem with, it's stuff like laning against a Jayce, or trying to catch an Ezreal. Fun for a while, and I certainly don't have a problem with it's existence (though I kinda wanted to play a game or two of NURF) but I do not understand all the people clamoring for it to be permament.","replies":[{"poster":"Balareon","date":"2015-04-02T00:37:38.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I don't really want it permanently, well, I wouldn't mind playing it as a cool off game after a bad loss. If you can't catch ez go after someone else. Also, just play AP shaco, that's what i do, it's fun. Really, find a champion you love and play them in URF, then you will have fun no matter what because you enjoy the champion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dnsup","date":"2015-04-03T01:49:41.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I get why people like it, and it's great fun, but if this was permament no one would ever play it.\n\nSpeak for yourself. I would play this mode all the time, especially whenever there wasn't 60+ minutes to set aside for a normal game. ARAM is nice for that purpose, but ARAM is all one lane and usually really predictable.","replies":[]}]}
