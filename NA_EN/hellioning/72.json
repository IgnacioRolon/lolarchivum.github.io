I ulted him back with the rest of his team, but he managed to ult me, meaning that I pushed him back, then got dragged to his position, putting me into an even worse position than I was. Is this intentional? If so, can you please change it? I'd much prefer either his ult cancelled mine, or my ult cancels his, because that was annoying as all hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Roaranor","date":"2014-04-29T19:03:22.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is working as intended. The behavior happens quite frequently with Skarner and other champions. For example, if Skarner ults Vi as she ults another targets, he will freeze her and be able to move her around as he pleases, but as soon as his ult finishes Vi will continue on to the selected targets (which was funny to watch).","replies":[]}]}
