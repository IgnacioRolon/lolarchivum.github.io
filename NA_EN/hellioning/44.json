I can see the new posts, yes, but in order to see the context, I have to click another button, and in order to see the entire conversation of a post, I have to click another button, probably in another tab. I do not know if it is a result of my terrible computer, but this tends not to bring me to the actual comment I was looking for, forcing me to reload or go back to the 'new' tab and attempt to do it again.\r\n\r\n2) Related to 1), a post doesn't disappear from the 'new' tab unless I've seen it in the main thread. While it does not show up as 'x new posts', if I go into the tab, it still shows up, despite the fact I've already seen it in the 'new' tab. It doesn't mark as 'read' unless I see where it is in the main thread, which is annoying and takes a lot of time, especially considering how buggy this can be; a post has been in the 'new' tab for three times in a row, despite me seeing it in the main thread several times.\r\n\r\n3) Outgoing links to pictures occasional show as a link to the picture and occasionally as a thumbnail to the picture itself. I do not know why it is inconsistent. \r\n\r\n4) If said picture shows up as a link, and I right click it and select 'open link in new tab' as I usually do, it brings me right back to the thread. This is because you think I need to be told when I'm leaving this site and heading to another; if I left click on the link and right click and select 'open in new tab' on the 'I am aware this is an outside link, let me through' button, it works fine. This might work if I could turn that off, but the 'my profile' section of this site, where I presume that option would be, has been offline for every time I checked it.\r\n\r\n5) The red tracker is in the 'sub-communities' section is mostly fine, but the red-tracker in the thread is annoying. Some of my issues with it are due to my personal distaste for this system (click the left or right arrows only leads me to a truncated version of the post, and I have to click another button in order for me to see the full post, which brings me up or down the page depending on how upvoted that comment is, which is incredibly distracting) but it just occasionally doesn't work if I haven't loaded that comment yet. It just scrolls down a bit until it has to load and then stop.\r\n\r\n6) The first time I see a red post in the red tracker, it shows a full version of the post on the right side banner, which means that it tends to go off the screen. This changes back to normal if I click the arrows to show which red post is being shown, but if there's only one red post, it just takes up a bunch of my screen for no reason.\r\n\r\nThese are only the issues I have with the site's actual execution. I hate the concept of this site, but I doubt you're changing that.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir ArmaMalum","date":"2014-02-17T14:44:01.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Constructive feedback and opinions.
