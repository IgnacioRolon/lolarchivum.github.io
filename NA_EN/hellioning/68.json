But Viktor deliberately killing a whole bunch of people in order to make them perfect seems...too brutal. Viktor deciding, not only to attempt to fix humanity&#039;s bodies, but also their minds seems hypocritical. And Viktor not using robots to attack people just seems out of character.","replies":[{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2016-12-08T02:00:34.342+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/0/02/Here_we_go_again.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130218085354","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyToplaneGoat","date":"2016-12-08T02:40:45.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\nWanna have some popcorn?

On the other, it doesn't matter if Jayce is a lying liar who lies or Riot decided on just painting Viktor as a villain, there is going to be a ruckus.\n\nIn short, pass the popcorn and hold the butter.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"midnight oil24","date":"2016-12-08T01:40:36.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that it's just Jayce being the asshole that he is.

There is icons for both places and you can get the Piltover one at the piltover page. So zaun is going to be next and we will have to see Viktor's side of things. i dont quite think things are as clear cut as it seems. Either way i like how they portrayed Jayce as a bit of an asshole tho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-08T02:15:31.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought they were just bodies that he found","replies":[]}]}
