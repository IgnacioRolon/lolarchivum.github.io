Since, currently, the only ADC that Freljord has access too is Ashe, I decided to learn her.\r\n\r\nAshe has a fairly low pickrate in solo queue, but an average winrate, almost always hovering around 50%. I believe this is due to the strength of her ultimate, and it's a very good ultimate; it allows for pickoffs, a limited amount of self peel, and for chaining CC with your teammates. The problem with Ashe, I find, is that too much of her power is tied up in that ultimate. Her pre-6 is atrocious, with a starting 16 second cooldown on her only damaging skill, which is blocked by minions and doesn't do that much damage early. Her passive is still atrocious, considering it requires you to not attack in a meta that desperately wants you to hit 2 before your opponents or you're screwed. Also, fun fact, if her autoattack projectile is in the air but the target dies before it reaches it, it still uses up her passive. Her E is almost useless in a fight, and the passive is only really good at late game. \r\n\r\nEven in the late game, she's reliant on her ultimate to do anything. Her autoattack steroid is atrocious, and her W is blocked by minions. I distinctly remember getting destroyed by a Tristana, even though I had a level and gold advantage on her, because my ultimate wasn't up. Her permaslow on her Q is great in theory, but in practice? Go play her against Lucian, or Yi, or any Assassin and see how well that slow's gonna work for you in the land of blinks and jumps everywhere. Her range isn't great, and she simply doesn't do the damage that a late game hyper carry does. Without her ult, she's useless.\r\n\r\nI'd reccomend removing some of the power on her ult (lowering/reducing the damage, maybe?) in exchange for some usability buffs. Either give her a new passive or cause her current passive to refresh, either wholly or mostly, if she kills the target she's autoattacking.  Maybe let her slow stack into a stun or a root if she gets enough stacks on an enemy? I think most of her changes should be power neutral, considering her win rate, but she's really weird to play.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-09-27T02:53:28.714+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhm Ashe tends to be very misunderstood for some reason... I'll cut to the chase and just type it out, Ashe can reach late game power before any adc under certain conditions of course, namely, last hitting.\n\nYou say that her E passive is useless until late game, I say a gold advantage of 3 per minion is HUGE, it means that after 5 minions or so Ashe receives 1 cs for free. The thing being that when you play as Ashe you gotta learn to sit down and farm your ass out, because THAT'S her edge, when the enemy comes in lane with a vamp scepter and boots tier 1, you come back with a BF sword and a vamp scepter, you will ALWAYS have a gold advantage as long as you know how to farm. If you're jumped on just back off a bit and last hit under turret, it's worst for them if they push since a jungler gank + Ashe's permaslow is almost a guaranteed kil.\n\nAshe is one of the hardest and easiest champions at the same time, it's up to you to play with her strengths and weaknesses creatively. For example her passive, yes in lane it's useless, but your damage at lvl 1 is unrivaled, Ashe is AMAZING for invades and afterwards she can whittle down an enemy at the time she arrives to a fight and taking in account the fact that a good Ashe will have an IE before ANYONE can say hawkshot, that's crazy good damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-09-27T03:06:03.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I mean by 'her passive is useless until late game' is that it helps her get items by farming, but does nothing for her before she can CS. This means that she's relatively weak in a fight, and considering how often people fight in solo que, that can be a bit of an issue.\n\nTo be sure, I'm not great at her, but I find it's incredibly difficult to just stay back and farm against, say, a Lucian.","replies":[{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2014-09-27T16:13:27.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I see your point, people in solo Q can have a different strategy in their head, ideally your allies should try to provide Ashe with the ground for her to function properly but you know how that goes xD\n\nAs for Lucian, yeah he's strong at the moment, his mobility will be a painful to deal with but your best bet is to tag him with as many volleys as you can, in this case the enemy would ideally try to stay behind his minions, so supports like Blitz or Thresh won't work, but it's the ideal ground for Nami for example who can now aim her bubble better. Ultimately your safety against an aggressive enemy relies on your support and your ability to deal damage from the edge of your range, it's not easy but if you manage you'll see how good Ashe can be.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CmereCupcake","date":"2014-09-27T01:53:49.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"50% winrate is perfection, why change what isn't broken?","replies":[{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-09-27T02:19:24.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because winrate is a broken statistic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CmereCupcake","date":"2014-09-27T02:27:43.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She has a clear defined role.
