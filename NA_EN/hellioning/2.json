Nothing too surprising, but they did what they were supposed to do.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, did all three Targon champs REALLY need to have the same basic story? &#039;They were different from other people. Then they went up the mountain and became godlike.&#039; The only real difference is that Leona and Diana kept their personality, while Panth didn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nAlso: I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m a big fan of Leona becoming more vicious and Diana becoming less. I suppose it&#039;s one way of explaining that the sun might not be good and the moon might not be bad, but it&#039;s kinda at odds with their in game VO lines. Not that that stopped the Xerath changes, I suppose.\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;s just because all three of them are just more intro stories, but I wasn&#039;t too excited about these. \r\n\r\nThe Targon information itself was pretty cool. Actual worldbuilding! It&#039;s great.","replies":[{"poster":"Chaos689","date":"2016-03-12T01:07:15.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did anyone else read Aurelion Sol's bio ang go 'nah I aint gonna play pantheon ever again.\"?

Aatrox moreso appears out of nowhere, supporting the underdog side when their backs are against the wall .
