It was against presumably a five stack who all went support champs mid and surrendered.\r\n\r\n2) [This game](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1475251834/48546) was exactly as I feared. First thing that happened was that Leona hit E as soon as I went up to poke her, resulting in me losing 3/4 of my health from that and the ensuing Jinx autos. I basically never recovered from that, as it made me and Kog too low to fight back, though I did chase Leona way too far and got baited into the enemy Udyr at one point. Yeah, Trynd ragequit and Ori AFKed at fountain, but we were losing anyway.\r\n\r\n3) I got FB in [this game](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1475252938/48546) because Ashe guaranteed crit plus auto Q power chord hurts a bit at level 1. Didn't do badly in laning phase, but Ashe farmed terribly and rushed a BT, resulting in Draven completely owning us as soon as he and Morg hit six. Couldn't do much to help Ashe if she got caught, my shield wasn't strong enough to guard against Draven, and if I got caught, well, GG.  Yasuo got fed, too, and I had trouble dodging when I had to stay close to my ADC to be the most useful.\r\n\r\n4) I'm tempted to discount [this game](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1475254240/48546) because it got ridiculously laggy near the end (like, their Noct simply couldn't move, that laggy) but we were ahead before that so I'll count it. Laning phase was decent, though I gave up trying to poke them and just stuck to keeping Jinx alive. Ali's flash+pulverize+headbutt was more than I could deal with, and until I got Mikhael's so was Ashe ult. \r\n\r\nThe things common to all four games: Sona's too squishy. Like, I know I'm not blowing anyone's minds here, but Sona's far too squishy to be a poke mage and she doesn't heal enough to be a sustain mage. Teamfights were a mess; I stuck with my ADC and hoped that no AoE came our way. My Q-power chord didn't feel like it did anything anymore; I tried poking the enemy Leona and Alistar, but it just didn't seem like I did anything. I still kept running out of mana. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I don't know why this came off of the PBE. It doesn't seem done, and this is just as frustrating on live as it was on the PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Kynami","date":"2014-07-31T08:32:51.808+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"And pretty much meshes with what a lot of us were saying when we were reading what the adjustments were on the PBE.\n\nThey reduced her mobility, her early durability, and her resistances. And then for good measure hammered her damage combo potential if she dares to do it without at least one ally involved. I'm presuming that last one was to make it basically suicidal to attempt playing her someplace like mid-lane so that she *has* to be a good little support and be forced to stay firmly in bottom lane. And not trouble the Devs with being potentially better as a mid than support, you know where she could actually get enough AP to use her scaling to good effect.\n\nWhich is why Fearless if you read this... you have nice large swathes of the Sona population upset with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2014-07-31T08:39:13.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":19,"body":"he's already said he will ignore whatever \"feedback\" he wants and will do what he wants since hes one of the devs >.>","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2014-07-31T09:00:41.494+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"That's a little unfair.

I feel really impactful in later teamfights and there was more than one situation where my teammates actually realized that it was sona who saved them just right now (opposed to before where you had all that stats but noone would relize they just survived due to the massive resistance bonus).  \nI only have a minor complain, which is that with q+powerchord AA (+q amplification) + eventual ADC hits you have a really high damage potential on level one and sonas early level poke is just a bit too high. I had situations in which I would take about 40% of the adcs max hp with one q poke.\n\nSo overall I am really happy about the rework. Sona feels more impactful and it is more clear when she is actually performing, but she might need a little tweak on her early game poke (not so much for the later stages of the game).

Dota's design philosophy allows for passive auras so strong they are readily noticed. The general design of League doesn't allow for auras like this. \n\nAlso, I tried new Sona. She is fun as balls. The issue with what she did before is that it just wasn't noticeable (for most). Not noticeable for most people playing as sona (not sona mains, just everyone who tried her), and certainly not for the people she laned with. When I laned alongside sona I watched for her poke and saw the (weak) heal. The actual auras might as well have not been there.\n\nWorking alongside Sona, every time her auras activate I have an instantly noticeable difference be it the on hit of Q or the shield of W or the stronger boost of E.\n\nAlso, I tried her for freeweek. I found it so fun I'm strongly considering spending my Gnar IP on her. Every time I pushed a button I felt great. It was easier than playing as Janna or even Leona while at the same time very satisfying.\n\n**Even if Sona is objectively weaker than before her rework, she feels stronger and more satisfying to play as and play alongside and against. If shes weak she can be buffed, but Sona got nerfed a million times till her auras gave single digit stat bonuses and she STILL was good.**\nIf shes weak now she can be buffed, but she feels better for for many. I am among them. If shes IS weaker then its only getting better from here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sunfield","date":"2014-07-31T09:37:00.231+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Do you like misinformation?

I played the reworked Sona most of yesterday.  While I absolutely hate that her auras are much smaller, I do like the new shield on her W and how her E works now.  It actually isn't COMPLETELY terrible.  I find it to be rather nice.  I've been able to make some great plays with my team and the heal sustain actually seems better but the mana costs and cooldowns are crap.  I'm literally a useless floating target for 10-12 seconds early game.  Doubling her cooldown rate was unfair and unnecessary.  Janna's tornado is more game changing than 1 Q or W from Sona but yet... At max CDR Janna's Q is around 4 seconds while Sona's Q / W / E sit at around 6 seconds and only hit 1 target (damage/heal on Q/W).  Rushing CDR and Mana regen items is so much of a must that you can't even focus on getting health to live longer or anything.  It it really conflicting and I haven't really found a solid build for her yet.  I hope they'll loser the cooldowns (even if only a few seconds) soon.\n\nI do not like how they lessened her damage and I'm completely pissed that they half-assed her skins.  Seriously, I bought Silent Night Sona for a reason - Great detail, completely effing cute and holiday themed.  I own Muse, SIlent Night, and Pentakill Sona.  The reworked skins (with the exception of maybe Muse) have half or less than half of the detail of the original skins and that is unacceptable to me.\n\nAnyway, if you would like to see my match history:\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/50978517","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowGlaive213","date":"2014-07-31T21:58:21.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree about the textures.

I played my first 4 pvp games as new Sona yesterday (went solo queue). I went 3-1 win-lose, granted they were all team builder where people are encouraged to try new things so it was highly likely no one was playing the best they had to offer. I also felt my adc was better than the opposing adc for all of the games.\n\nI don't like the new Sona. I liked Sona because she could use a lot more of the space she is given. I enjoy playing ranged champs like Lux. I don't like playing bruisers. I like ranged champs because I like having more room to work with, but the decrease in Sona's range significantly decreased the amount of room I could work with. I noticed in lane I couldn't go to a lot of the positions I wanted because I'd be out of range to tag my adc in case there was a sudden need to (i.e. sudden engage). For the first time as a support I felt *leashed*, and it felt really REALLY bad.\n\nI could really feel the longer cooldowns too whenever a skirmish broke out because I would want to renew benefits but couldn't and it turned into an aa match with my puny support aa, and the fact that cooldowns are staggered makes it a lot harder than before to continuously chord properly. There wasn't a single skirmish during laning that both my adc and I were alive by the end of it iirc, and if I did survive the skirmish I'd have less than 100hp pretty much every time, while the surviving member on the other side would still be at least half health. I also felt less pokey because my positioning was so heavily constricted by that of my adc's as a result of the range decrease.\n\nWhile the new Sona encourages more and better teamwork, I felt a lot of my independence was taken away. Yes, a support is supposed to help their team, but that doesn't mean we have to be completely dependent on them. We can go clear wards or wander around placing them and be reasonably safe. But the balance in Sona's kit factors in so many things that have to do with her allies making use of them she really can't do anything on her own, where as Janna, Lulu, Soraka, Nami, can all use their abilities on themselves for huge benefits and be independent. Old Sona was okay because her auras were persistent, but alone new Sona's benefits don't last long enough for her to be alone. If old Sona was being chased she could give herself a persistent speed boost and spam e chords to kite. If new Sona is being chased as soon as her speed boost wears out she's pretty much dead since her long cds don't allow her to chord kite or renew her boost frequently enough to get her out.\n\nAlso, for one of my games a teammate was chasing after an enemy and I was on the other side of the tree line. I felt really sad and useless when before I could help them by speed boosting them over the tree line, but now because of the range decrease I couldn't do anything to help.\n\nWhile new Sona can still function and win games, I do feel the rework was a nerf, and I do feel this new Sona is not Sona, and conceptually she's been tarnished at the very least.\n\nSince a sample size of 4 isn't large enough I will be playing more. I will try to get some games outside of team builder as well, but she is definitely no longer my go-to support and I will highly likely be picking up a new support in her place. =[","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-08-02T06:14:11.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear Braum and Thresh are pretty good, they're probably worth giving a try.
