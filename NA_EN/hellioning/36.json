Top Skarner was becoming a thing, and a good thing.\n\nThey claimed he was causing issues, and his sticking power was \"a bit too much for his power in general\" and so on and so forth.\n\nHis rework was pretty decent after about 4-5 buffs. He was played in a single LCS game, and while it might be a coincidence, he was instantly added to the next patch (some of his changes completely skipped the PBE, because I have had a PBE account for a long while now).\n\nThe nerfs put him in a pretty bad place, and they haven't significantly touched him since.\n\nBasically the previous rework was poor, and it took Riot over a year to admit it without actually admitting it. \n\nI'm sorry but, reworking a champion (that didn't need a rework *coughs* Olaf *coughs*) then reworking them a second time, means the first time was bad.\n\n\nSo yeah <_< They just won't admit that his initial playstyle was actually good, and honestly the pre-rework Skarner would work well in the current meta and jungle. Sadly the currently Skarner does not, and is overshadowed by the likes of Rek'Sai and Shyvana for tanky, initiating, damage dealers. On the cusp of being tanks, but still being able to output damage.","replies":[{"poster":"BlkGolem","date":"2015-08-01T15:45:53.184+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"...Skarner is literally my freelo jungler, why does anyone think he is bad?","replies":[{"poster":"Silents429","date":"2015-08-01T16:21:47.247+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlkGolem,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9EgWzHqy,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-01T15:45:53.184+0000)\n>\n> ...Skarner is literally my freelo jungler, why does anyone think he is bad?\n\nIt doesn't work that way, a champion can be broken but still be usable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DanLikesBacon","date":"2015-08-01T22:45:21.698+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ikr?

Numerous pros were saying he was becoming a pretty good pick in top and were practicing him in scrims. \n\nHe needed some tweaks, but not a rework.\n\nIt is no where near as completely clueless as the Olaf rework. Olaf was being played, in the LCS rather regularly, and in solo queue....then he got a rework that made him significantly weaker for a very long time (I still say his pre rework version was much better). \n\nDid Olaf need nerfs? yes.
