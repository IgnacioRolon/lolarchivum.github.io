What are his strengths? He has some of the best damage in the game if left unmolested, and a pretty big range that he can do it in. What are his weaknesses? No mobility and he's squishy. So he's strong against immobile champions, and he's weak against champions with gapclosers.\r\n\r\n...Which are almost everything popular, and, in fact, includes every champion that takes  {{summoner:4}}  which is.. um, everyone but {{champion:2}} and MAYBE {{champion:78}}. I just played him as an AP mid in two games, and in both cases, I died repeatedly because I thought I was safe but the opponent had flash plus their own gapcloser, and his only defense is a slow.\r\n\r\nCan we do something about fixing the adorable deathmachine? 'Slow and immobile' is one of the biggest weaknesses you can have in this game. I know all about the 'protect the Kog' comps but that's almost never worth it, given there are siege mages and ADCs that have equal or better damage plus good mobility, like {{champion:115}} and {{champion:67}} . The Q change was a step in the right direction, but not nearly good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"AbiwonKenabi","date":"2014-04-23T13:27:55.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog'Maw suffers from metashiftitis, where the meta around him changes and he isn't as good as he once was (seriously, all he received since his relative popularity in S2 was a nerf to his slow and I *think *some slight W changes). Back then you could get away with a Kog'Maw lane because most times the enemy would bet on the late game as well. Now  lane phase and bot lane in particular are all about early aggression and that level 2 engage. Kog'Maw just can't keep up.\n\nI think this is a case where Kog's risk doesn't outweigh his reward right now. His kit is actually pretty decent, but you don't really get that super carry status he once had, even with a team built around him. (Does anyone remember how common it was to build resistances against Kog and be super tanky and *still* get shredded? >.<)","replies":[]}]}
