I used to be able to do fill secondary and get a role besides my primary like, 40% of the time, but now it seems like I'm getting filled more often. I don't have a problem filling, if I did I wouldn't be fill secondary, but it's making it difficult to finish my placements. I've queued for bottom/fill like 5 games now and I haven't gotten bottom in any of them.","replies":[]}
