But, speaking as someone who likes filling, I often find I have no real opinion on which champion I want to play, and if I&#039;m an early pick, I can&#039;t even counterpick. These are the situations that I really liked the random button in, and I still want it back.\r\n\r\nLyte has said that they were planning on adding the random button back into normal draft, but that hasn&#039;t happened, his ask.fm is dead, and he doesn&#039;t respond to my twitter. Am I alone in missing the random button?","replies":[{"poster":"Lushington","date":"2016-03-31T07:46:02.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya best to keep it away.
