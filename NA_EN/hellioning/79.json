I can see Jax (most of his skins are darker) and Alistar (kinda), but I thought the justification for Warden Sivir and Marauder Ashe was that the skins team wanted to do something &#039;new&#039; with those champs, IE a darker skin for Ashe and a lighter skin for Sivir.\r\n\r\nKarma&#039;s skins are generally light (order of the lotus, sun goddess) and Olaf&#039;s skins are darker (bar Brolaf). This seems like just another skin for those two.","replies":[{"poster":"Ionian StarChild","date":"2015-09-16T04:11:36.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it looks great. Karma always looks great in any \"light\" themed skins, heavy or cloth armor alike.
