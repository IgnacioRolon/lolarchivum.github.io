As far as the balancing thye can get more data in a week of pbe then they can in several months of internal testing.   Once they have the data it has to be collated and studied.   once that is done then the balancing can begin.   However how to balance a champion is a delicate procedure as you wan to keep their identity.   this has made several champions hard to balance......\n\nThe balancing can begin.   However once they determine a way to balance a champion they then have to test their changes.   And thus starts the whole mess all over again.    However expecting them to scrap a entire rework is beyond idiocy in most cases.   Pbe is not about the community shaping a champion it is about working out bugs and gathering data for balancing.\n\nNow keep in mind a week on live is like a month on pbe so balancing take a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"t0ad5","date":"2015-11-03T03:14:09.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the past year, this sounds healthy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Lincoln","date":"2015-11-03T03:11:59.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pbe is for early bugfixing and rough balance impressions\n\nriot doesnt care what the players think when it comes to gameplay itself","replies":[]}]}
