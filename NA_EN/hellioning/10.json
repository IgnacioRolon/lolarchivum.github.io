True, Ashe can apply her slow more often, but she&#039;s still SOL if she&#039;s trying to fight a Yi with Highlander on or anyone with a bunch of slow removing stuff. Is this an intentional weakness, something you look to fix, or something you don&#039;t really care about?","replies":[{"poster":"ItsStout","date":"2015-06-12T19:42:39.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False.

I think it should mostly come down to how skillfully you play your champion.  \nBut keep in mind that the immunity to her crits only applies during his ultimate.  So it's not that Ashe can't beat Master Yi at all...it's just that during the few seconds his ultimate is active, he (mostly) counters her.\n\nThat doesn't sound that game-breaking to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZileanUltJesusOP","date":"2015-06-12T17:42:03.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">implying that ashe should still crit champions immune to slow affects when her entire kit is based around the fact of criting slowed enemies.\nkek","replies":[]}]}
