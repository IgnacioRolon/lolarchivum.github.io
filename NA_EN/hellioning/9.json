In it, Tryndamere apologizes for the various communication problems facing Riot, and claims to want to do better. Strangely enough, we seem to be facing the exact same problems that Riot's been facing for years.\r\n\r\nSkin pricing confusing? They're working on that, remember that big post Hippalus made regarding about the various tiers that skins fall into and making this big thing about how they're sticking too it? Yeah, why is Dragonblade Riven 1350 when Lunar Goddess Diana is 975? I mean, besides 'Riven is more popular', but I'm sure they're working on making that more clear.\r\n\r\nAlternate game modes? Oh, we have tons of them! Temporary, sure, but that's to avoid splitting up the playerbase, so we don't have incredibly long queues for certain game modes! I'm sure everyone appreciates Riot working so hard at giving us such gems such as '1v1 in mid lane, something you can literally do in customs' and 'the bots are bull**** OP so just splitpush!' But if you don't like those, don't worry! Riot's working on it.\r\n\r\nAnd as for TT and Dominion? Riot's working on giving those modes the love they deserve! Why, they have the occasional champ balance change, and they have a whole two people dedicated to them! They don't have solo queue ranked yet, but don't worry, I'm sure Riot's working on that.\r\n\r\nReplays have been ready for a while, but unfortunately, Riot can't figure out how to launch them worldwide! Apparently, they code things differently in China, because figuring out how to put the replay function in different clients is hard. I'm sure Riot's working on that incredibly hard, though!\r\n\r\nAnd it's not like Riot's been lazy this whole time, they've launched tons of stuff! Like the Lucian balance changes, which was a ridiculous buffing, or the Sona rework, which no one apparently likes. And don't worry, guys, cause Riot is listening to all your complaints about the air client. Now we've got a new patcher in testing! Isn't that exciting?\r\n\r\nSeriously, does Riot have ADD or something? I get that I don't understand everything that goes into game design or the technical parts of the job, but does it really take years to figure out how to ship replays? Is the Chinese/Korean/LAN client THAT confusing?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, design debt and all that, but it's really frustrating to hear 'we're working on it' about things that have been problems for years. Bruisers have been an issue since Xin Zhao, and it took to Pre S3 to even look into fixing them. Which they figured out was harder then they thought because, hey, they took too long, so now we have to wait even longer.\r\n\r\nI like Riot's culture. I like how friendly the average Rioter can be. I understand they're working on it. But I kinda just want them to be done with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Luner Hunter","date":"2014-07-27T13:34:28.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you've made some good points however i expect a ton of hate comments and downvotes to come! >.<","replies":[]}]}
