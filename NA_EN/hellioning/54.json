It, to be blunt, is not a new thematic for Jinx. Sure, there&#039;s a &#039;zombie killer&#039; thing going on, but in comparison to Firecracker Jinx or Mafia Jinx, it&#039;s basically just &#039;diffferently colored Jinx&#039;. She&#039;s already kinda got the &#039;genius with spare parts&#039; thing going on. Compare this to Pantheon, whose Slayer skin is an entirely different thematic, Slayer Jinx is just kinda...expected.\r\n\r\nI have the same problem with Captain Fortune; it should, by all accounts, by her base skin with her VU. Or for that various Udyr skins; he has three, and the two most recent ones are basically just his base with better particles. At least Captain GP has a different VO in comparison to normal GP.","replies":[{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2015-10-19T21:24:42.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meanwhile {{champion:268}} has 1 skin while ekko just got a brand new one....
