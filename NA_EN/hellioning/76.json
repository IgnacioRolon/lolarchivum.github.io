It was on the list of things to clean up/balance in the rune refactor - but ultimately the cost was also pretty high on that front.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were told that the rune rework was delayed, but this post's use of 'was' indicates that this has changed.

Certain summoners have multiple rune pages, each already full. I am one, and though this happened before the announcement, it isn't fair to just remove the IP I spent on them. They might be trying a system that gives IP for each rune you own, and then reworking, but such a system would be a huge programming undertaking. I agree to them releasing more information, but at the same time, understand how it would take so long.","replies":[{"poster":"Necrachilles","date":"2014-02-26T23:27:11.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?p=44433899#44433899\n> we've stated before that if we decide to delete any runes, and owners of said runes would be refunded (similar to what we did with dodge runes).\n\nNot such a huge undertaking as they've done it before.
