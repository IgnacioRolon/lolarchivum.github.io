He hovers around a 50% win rate, and he's fairly popular, at around 10%, but he's not overbearing or anything. I am intellectually aware that Fizz takes a large amount of skill to play properly, as a melee character going against many ranged characters. I am intellectually aware that if a Fizz goes out of control and takes over the game, it's entirely my fault as a mid laner. I am aware that my frustrations with Fizz tend to be because I play a lot of not very mobile skillshot based squishy mages, champions Fizz is explicitly designed to do well against.\r\n\r\nI don't care.\r\n\r\nI don't feel like a Fizz player that kills me and escapes with very little health is skilled, I feel he is lucky and playing a stupid champion. I don't feel like he's balanced when he kills me in a DFG + Urchin Strike, a literal two shot. I don't feel that he's well designed or a good champion because he can prey off my mistakes, I feel he's a stupid champion because he can get out of bad situations really easily. I don't care that he's designed to kill my favorite kind of champion because Riot has said the game shouldn't be decided at champ select and I want to believe them, dammit.\r\n\r\nI hate assassins in general because they counter my favorite champions and that they're probably not balancable, but Fizz is the worst because he's so damn slippery. It's basically impossible to land a Cass ult on a Fizz. It's basically impossible to stun him with VIktor's gravity field. And he can just jump over Vel'Koz's slows and knockups.\r\n\r\nI am aware this is entirely an emotional response created because I am too invested in a video game, and I should probably calm down. I don't care. Fuck Fizz.","replies":[]}
