As it turns out, trying to jungle without smite is literally impossible.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m aware it was my fault, but why do your summoners revert if someone dodges?","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2016-02-18T14:12:36.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it's much worse than that. It's not only summoner spells, but Rune and Mastery pages too, and it's not only when dodging.\n\nI almost always check my settings before going into the game anyway, but sometimes in a new lobby, my Mastery page reverts to the one I used 2 matches ago, I don't know why... Pretty annoying when you play the same champ most of the time and just want to keep the same mastery page between 2 consecutive games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Sea Cow","date":"2016-02-17T06:01:10.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe something they should consider changing but why is it hard for people to pay attention to the game (right rune and mastery pages and summoner spells)?

Yes it's likely but not 100% then I think people will complain about that especially of first they get secondary role and then they get primary","replies":[]}]}]}]}
