Male Scarecrow? Fiddlesticks isn't even from the Shadow Isles. No one knows if Eve is actually from the Shadow Isles, if you actually read her lore, it says it is speculated that she is from there, but she never says. Elise is supposed to be seductive so she can sacrifice people to a giant spider. \n\nSo here are the champions that are from the shadow Isles.\n\n{{champion:60}} Elise - Sexy lady to lure in men and sacrifice them to Vilemaw.\n {{champion:28}} Evelynn - Speculated to be from the Shadow Isles, as of her old lore\n{{champion:120}} Hecarim \n {{champion:30}} Karthus\n {{champion:57}} Maokai\n{{champion:82}} Mordekaiser\n{{champion:412}} Thresh\n{{champion:83}} Yorick\n\nHere are the champions associated to the Shadow Isles, but not from there.\n\n{{champion:236}} Lucian - Thresh took his wife, Senna, so obviously he is connected to the Shadow Isles because Thresh has his wife's soul, vengeance shall be his, yada yada yada.\n{{champion:56}} Nocturne - Physically manifested in the Twisted Treeline according to the Wiki\n{{champion:19}} Warwick - Obtained Silver from the Shadow Isles also according to the Wiki.\n\nSo in conclusion, there are only two current women from the Shadow Isles, Elise, who seduces men and Evelynn, supposedly her place of Origin.\n\nSo I personally find Kalista emaciated and looks like a corpse.
