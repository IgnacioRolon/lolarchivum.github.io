I clicked the link on the left hand side of the screen. My URL is 'gameplay and balance' and there's a giant 'gameplay and balance' on the top of the screen. You will notice that most of the topics are not from gameplay and balance. This has happened twice to me so far, both on the gameplay and balance board. I'd like this to be fixed as soon as possible, please.","replies":[]}
