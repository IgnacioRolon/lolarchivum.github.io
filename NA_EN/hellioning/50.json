It's really annoying and you need to change that ASAP.\r\n\r\nAnyway, so I played three games. In terms of power, Cass seems okay (but, again, PBE, I might have simply been better than my opponent.) I won all three games and I can safely say I contributed somewhat in all three games (though the third game was a 4v5, so I don't really count that.) I ACTUALLY managed to bully someone out of lane (it was amazing, I watched them back with glee!), and I felt that I could go RQWE and do decently with the new passive on E. So if this came out on live, barring me not noticing something huge, I think I'd be fine...ish.\r\n\r\nMy big three pain points: One, you are constantly starved for mana. After a teamfight, I'm OOM. Trying to solo a buff camp before Rabadon's, OOM. Trying to take dragon/baron, OOM. I feel that Cass constantly needs blue buff or something (because all of the big mana regen items give large amounts of CDR, they're largely wasted stats, plus Chalice is pretty weak now as is.) because I was OOM way too much. Her mana is fine in lane, when she constantly has minions to last hit with E so she keeps her mana up, but in every other situation, I wished I had more mana. I got a RoA in the last game and I THINK that might have been enough, but I didn't do many objectives or teamfights, so I couldn't tell.\r\n\r\nSecondly...that passive. Did you know, when I couldn't see the number of stacks I had, I didn't notice it at all? Like, I occasionally saw the animation for reaching a new milestone, and the icon occasionally changed, but all of the buff things it offered were so small I didn't notice. Like, in the second game, I was suddenly clearing jungle camps in two or three E casts instead of 6 or 7 and I went 'well it appears I've turned on', probably because I got a Rabadon's at the same time, but before then, I might as well not have had a passive. Like, it didn't feel like chains or anything anymore, but I simply didn't feel like it mattered until suddenly it did.\r\n\r\nThird, I didn't have waveclear. Like, even in the games where I maxed Q first, I couldn't clear the casters in one Q cast, I had to E each individually, let alone the melee or cannon. In order to waveclear at any speed, I needed to cast far more spells than most other mages, and because of that, I had to use more mana which just tied into my mana woes.\r\n\r\nSo if I had to give two pieces of advice, it'd be to figure out a way for her to be able to clear jungle camps or waveclear without losing all of her mana, and work on her passive some more, because wow that's underwhelming. My personal idea is to have a new passive, where the amount of poison damage she deals to an enemy is proportional to the amount of mana she gets back if she lasts hits it with E, allows her to clear jungle camps for extra farm and not to constantly be draining mana when she tries to push a lane.\r\n\r\nAgain, three games on a PBE environment does not a good sample size make, but it's after midnight here and I'm tired. So this'll have to do for now. I think you're getting close, Stashu, but that passive is really being a drag, and I am having worse mana issues than Anivia.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-28T23:30:16.425+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"The problem, to me, with this sort of feedback is that it just continues to stoke the fire of Stashu's ego over Aspect of the Serpent / Twin Fangs. Even if the current kit with Aspect and the heavy E focus becomes balanced, playable and can contribute before 40 minutes (which will be extremely difficult to do) it will still **completely lack any connection to Cassiopeia's identity**.\n\nYour \"pain points\" are easily explained: \n\nFirst: Deadly Cadence's mana discount effect worked wonders on the type of play promoted for Cass **and** made her feel stronger the longer a fight went on instead of dragging out this feeling over an entire game as Aspect does. \n\nSecond: This is because Aspect isn't designed for Cassi's playstyle at all because it just takes on stat bonuses that would do the same thing to pretty much every single mage champion. Bonus AP and bonus CDR don't do anything *unique* for Cassiopeia and this is more painfully obvious in the rework because her cooldowns were extended and her AP ratios lowered to \"compensate\" for the passive bonuses. This problem isn't new to the current PBE form.\n\nThird: This problem is also not new, and stems from the power being completely sapped from Q and W to be given to E. Cassiopeia relied on her AoE poisons to clear minion waves with any consistency and without them all waveclear, but even Stashu's desired \"poison them and finish them off with E for the mana return\" intent, suffers.\n\nI see your point of feedback on the passive is \"get a new one\", which means ultimately - you're going to be ignored. So sorry for that. But Stashu has made it very clear that Aspect of the Serpent is more important to him than community feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-11-29T03:06:41.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For someone who appears to be agreeing with me, you're awfully aggressive. I get that you don't like how Stashu handled the rework (I sure as heck don't) but you don't need to get mad at him before he even shows up. That tends to discourage him from commenting further.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2014-11-29T03:19:44.216+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's too late for that.
