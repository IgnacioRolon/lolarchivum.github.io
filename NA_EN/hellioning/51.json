Blood moon Thresh's red particles can confuse some teammates who might think his abilities are a danger to them.

Pure resource allocation they only have so many people, so much time, so quality or quantity. \nAs for the 1350/975 I don't fully disagree with you but I would much rather they fully flesh out skins that they can rather than gimp an idea just to make a price point.\nSide thought though is if jhin was released as a cowboy and had a theatre themed skin.
