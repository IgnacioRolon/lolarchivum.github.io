I can't farm early on without him dashing into my face and chunking me for more health than I could respond, and I can't go in because he escapes too easily. I don't have much of a problem after 6, but in laning phase I'm usually 20-30 CS and several levels below him, if I don't just straight up die at levels one or two. Does anyone have any tips for this matchup?","replies":[{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2014-10-03T04:40:09.266+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lucian is OP.\n\nNo, seriously.\nStrongest passive compared to any other ADC\nMost mobile ult (despite being channeled the range is pretty stupid)\n\nEnemy adc backs away --> dash double tap laser double tap, oh they lost half their hp already.\n\n\nBut I'm bored and here is a mini guide.\n\nAshe is a farming champion. You get 3 more gold per last hit than any other ADC.\nShe lacks mobility, have a support that can speed you up - zilean\nor slow other players down \n\nVolley should be used to slow down minion waves (pre tower range)\nNot to shove the wave but to slow it down (there is a difference)\nSo randomly spamming volley = bad idea.\n\nJunglers and Lucian himself love to see an Ashe pushed pass river.\n\nSo your skill order should be\nw e q q q r\n\nThis way you are a great \"follow up\"\n\n\nThe build should be the most expensive. (for high burst)\nAttackspeed is cute on ashe, but not mandatory.\n\nSo IE -> SS -> BT -> Triforce -> LW\nUlt, auto crit, huge damage.\n\n\n\nSo last hits for ashe are extremely important.\nSo you can be \"behind\" on CS, but still good. I think 10-20% farm disatvantage is normal for ashe, but even farm cs is pretty much GG for ashe (you win)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snakethrower","date":"2014-10-04T18:05:59.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe has a harsh time against any AD champion.\nShe is incredibly outdated and can't compete with ANY AD carry in terms of DPS. \nHer utility has been significantly weakened as well, by nerfs and by the introduction of new masteries.\nShe is one of the oldest champions and instead of receiving some love she always received hate.\nI am still wondering why people say \"Better nerf Irelia\", it should \"Better nerf Ashe\".\n\n\nHer Q:\n1.) Used to have 42% slow.\n2.) New masteries were introduced  that further decrease the power of slows.\n3.) Her Q and W slow used to stack.\n\n\nHer 2:\n1.) Her Volley used to hit the same target multiple times.\n2.) Her Volley used to slow for more.\n3.) Her Volley used to have 1300 range.\n\n\nHer R:\n1.) Used to stun for up to 5 seconds.\n2.)

If you match up vs a lucian, just cry in a corner, you already lost the lane phase.  \n\nYou can try to wait for the jungler at level 6 and set up some crazy nasty ganks with your ulti, but other than this, you have no shot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasticatingGrill","date":"2014-10-09T06:03:06.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a Leona on him just after he dashes while CSing...?

However, I've played both champs and I play ashe sometimes.\n\nFor lucian I would suggest using her volley with the frost arrow so that when he dashes in on you he has to all in.  Remember that he only double shots after the dash and then the dash has a huge cooldown on it.  After level 6 if you want to kill him you should actually engage with your ultimate doing extra damage and rooting him long enough to kill him off.  You could also focus on items that give you lots of farming (statik or runans for example for hitting multiple enemies).\n\nSeriously though, beyond out playing him you need a really solid support.  A good ashe and braum combo gives you slows all day and braum blocks lucians double shots.  Anything that punishes him for diving you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daish√∏","date":"2014-10-03T02:34:45.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with ashe is that her kit is a little weird for an adc. She doesn't have an escape (such as vaynes q). instead she has a ability that allows her to see into the fog of war. this makes it hard for her to avoided skillshots, such as ALL of lucians skillshots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2014-10-03T02:21:47.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"coordinate with your support,  try to get someone who can heal you,  shield you,  pole him,  or help otherwise.","replies":[]}]}
