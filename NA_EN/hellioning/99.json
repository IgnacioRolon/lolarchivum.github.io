Last hitting and positioning are just as key in LoL as they are in Dota.\n\nLH are much harder in dota.  Almost no hero can use skills to farm creep waves at low lvls.  You actually have to right click down a creep.  If you are ranged you tend to have lower base dmg, allowing non ranged ppl to LH better.  The enemy team can deny you LH, so you are actually competing for LH not playing a farming game against the bot.\n\nAs for positioning, most ppl played unlocked cam, no free flash, not too many mobility kits, fog, invis, etc.  There are a lot more ways to die in dota, more lockdown and more ways to gank.  All of this makes positioning a lot harder since you get punished for being bad at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-30T18:11:18.541+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you played Dota 2?\nChampion/hero attacks speeds are comparatively incredibly slow. \nLast hitting with ranged heroes is like playing an Annie to a Soraka - with the mages last hitting like Soraka and the shooters \"ADC\" shooting slightly fast than Annie. \nIn other words, it's really fucking hard. It takes much more effort than in League.
