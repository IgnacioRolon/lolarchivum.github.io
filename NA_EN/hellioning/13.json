I'm not trying to start or get into a discussion about how strong mobility is or how strong mobile champs are, that's for another thread.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm wondering is why mobility seems to be more common in new champs. The last truly immobile champ I can think of is Vel'Koz. Yasuo has his one dash per minion, Kalista has a dash after every auto, Braum has one of the few ally only dashes, and now the new void chick has (possible global?) dashes to pre-ordained places on the map. Why is mobility so popular?\r\n\r\nDoes a champ need to be mobile to compete nowadays? Does Riot think people just like playing more mobile champs? DO people like playing more mobile champs? Do they think more mobile champs look better in the LCS? What is it about modern champ design that makes mobility so attractive?","replies":[{"poster":"Fed by Snu Snu","date":"2014-11-26T00:39:53.752+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Vel'Koz didn't sell well since he didn't have mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"CreationFlaw","date":"2014-11-26T01:01:19.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Because Vel'Koz didn't sell well since he didn't have mobility.\n\nThat's actually true, he has low play rates because his kit is challenging and always needs some degree of skill, while most mobility champions you learn a set principle of mechanics and perfect them, and there's very little fluctuating in the difficulty in performing those. Just my opinion, but I'd say a lot of people who play Zed or Yasuo/Vayne have to say that once you learn how to pull off the mechanics and other such things, it usually becomes pretty simple to execute.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SmokingPuffin","date":"2014-11-26T02:44:16.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mobility is fun.\n\nImmobile champs are rarely popular.  \n\nImmobile melee range champs are hard to make viable in the modern game.\n\nRiot is looking to create more differentiation between champions, and different conditional mobility mechanics are one of the best ways to do that.\n\nWe prebably have enough immobile champions already.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulric Greatsword","date":"2014-11-26T03:00:51.629+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would argue that *limited* mobility is fun--being able to dodge that one crucial spell or escaping by the skin of your teeth is where mobility really creates those memorable moments and the infamous LCSBIGPLAYS.

However, I want to also preserve champions like Mordekaiser and Xerath (who have different types of immobility).\nWe're up to our armpits in immobile champs, and I don't think we need to worry about more appearing on the scene, but the reason there are still so many is because that's what league was designed around back in the day. The trouble with introducing highly mobile champs to the mix is that the current mix of champions is simply unprepared for such a different idea. That's why so much controversy surrounds Rioters like CertainlyT--people don't like the fact that their favorite champs are becoming increasingly unsuited to  deal with the complexity and mobility that such new champs offer.

Mostly, I think that the various zone control patterns of these immobile mages have pretty much been done.  I think {{champion:268}} is a really interesting design, and a good example of how to grow League's mage pool in new and interesting directions.  Meanwhile, I think {{champion:161}} feels quite samey to other line skillshot mages, other than his parlor trick of offset Q shots.\n\n> The trouble with introducing highly mobile champs to the mix is that the current mix of champions is simply unprepared for such a different idea.

The difference here is that these old kits have lots of ways to play and can therefore react effectively when the other guy uses his mobility button.  When all you have is a gap closer, melee range cc, and a steroid, there's just not many ways to deal with the inevitable you gap close, they escape, you lose sequence.  You don't necessarily need a kit with mobility, but you do need a kit with more potential for counterplay and less reliance on having bigger stats.\n\ntl;dr We need the fighter project.","replies":[{"poster":"DestÃ­num","date":"2014-11-26T07:26:47.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are champions with reseted blinks (Kata and Yi), insane movement speed that grants slow immunity (Yi) and a targeted leap + a semi-global one (Pantheon) imobile?\n\nA lot of those champions also are super fast.

The thing is, there are zero immobile assassin champions.  Those three are arguably the least mobile examples of the class -- you could list {{champion:28}}, but her kit is quite different from her original kit so I chose to leave her off.\n\nIn any case, the point here was that many kits designed for the old mostly-immobile era still work well in the new world.\n\n> A lot of those champions also are super fast.

Nobody talks about an increase in movement speed buffs ruining the game, and hardly anyone speaks of {{champion:61}} or {{champion:119}} as mobile.\n\nIn related news, the fundamental reason why we got mobility creep is that movement speed buffs are easily countered by slows.\n\n> Also, Pantheon is a fighter, not an assassin.\n\nRiot lists him under the assassin tag.

One spellvamp quint solves his problem and lets him spam abilities as much as he wants.\n\nVel'Koz doesn't have \"incredible amounts of cc\" lol, what are you talking about?

Several of the ranged champions either have gap closers have either disengage abilities, Syndra for example has a stun and both Caitlyn and Ziggs have disengage. This causes champions without a gap closer or CC to have problems killing them, for example Mordekaiser could never chase any of the aforementioned, and Mordekaiser isn't great until late game, as several immobile champions are (Garen, Cho'gath, Ashe, Miss Fortune to name a few). However at this late game the mobile adcs (Vayne, Caitlyn, Tristana) can just kite them for days and there is almost nothing they can do.","replies":[]}]}
