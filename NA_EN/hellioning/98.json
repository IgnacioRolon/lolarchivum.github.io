They&#039;re boring. Apart from Dusk&#039;s tail, the colors are too muted for me to care about, except for the purple on Night, which is clashing horribly, especially on her hands. Her skin tones on Day and Night also suck; I think Riot was trying to make her look inhuman and unearthly, but she doesn&#039;t look cursed, she looks undead. Like, a vampire Cass skin would be pretty cool, but I don&#039;t think this is what Riot is going for.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am reminded of her skins with every skin. Day Cass is similar to Desperada, Dusk Cass is just Siren with a different skin tone, and Night is just Jade Fang&#039;s palette applied differently. After the incredibly different chromas that Fizz, Zac, and Nami got, this is rather disappointing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kotex","date":"2015-07-29T22:30:07.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i've still yet to be convinced that chromas in general are worth any time.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-07-29T22:49:24.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of chromas, though I'm probably not gonna buy any until they realize that only selling them in packs of three is a bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]}
