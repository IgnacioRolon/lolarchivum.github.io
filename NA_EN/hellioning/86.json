My team had both {{champion:113}} (me) and {{champion:22}}  while the other team had a {{champion:127}} . When I hit 16 (I checked, Liss was still 15 I think) the battle for Freljord event happened. However, there were two 'events' in the top right; one for Ashe killing Sejuani, and another for Sejuani killing Ashe. Confused, I continued on. We killed Lissandra, and both Ashe and I participated, so we both got our crown things and buffs that stated that we now rule the Freljord, but the 'Ashe must kill Sejuani' quest never left. Everyone on my team noticed this happened.\r\n\r\nI attempted to screenshot, but it didn't work for whatever reason, just gave me a blank screen.","replies":[]}
