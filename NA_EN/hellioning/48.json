This isn&#039;t really up for debate. She is currently rocking an abysmal winrate, worst amongst ADCs by a large margin. Why is she so bad, and what should Riot do to fix this? Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\nA) That base attack speed is abysmal. I get it, she has a free attack speed steroid. But her early CSing before she gets it is terrible, and the cooldown is so long it doesn&#039;t help nearly as much as you wish it would. And, because attack speed is scaled based on base attack speed, it&#039;s not nearly as strong as it looks.\r\n\r\nB) Trist suffers from the Ashe problem, in that in a bot lane that is currently dominated by a lot of champions with a good amount of burst (graves, draven, jinx maybe) she doesn&#039;t really have any. She does do a lot of damage, but it requires four autoattacks on the same target, something that she may not be able to afford. Unlike Ashe, she doesn&#039;t have a lot of utility to compensate. \r\n\r\nC) She has a kit that encourages the ADC to throw themselves bodily into the enemy team. This isn&#039;t neccesarily a problem, but people already use Valkyrie/arcane shift/whatever to go in so this is just going to encourage bad play. Hell, I do this myself.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d bump up her attack speed back to pre-rework levels, or at least 2% per level. I&#039;d either lower the amount of attacks needed for a full E to three or change the numbers so that a fully stacked E does the same amount of damage but a non-stacked E does more, so you don&#039;t feel bad opening up with E and having your opponent gapclose away for pitiful damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2015-04-28T05:07:36.168+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm honestly still annoyed that Riot nerfed her range.\n\nSuper long range auto-attacks was her *thing*.  She and Koggy were the go-to hyper-scalers before Jinx muscled into their territory.\n\nAnd pointing out that Trist has a bad win-rate doesn't give the situation justice.  Koggy, for example, has a pretty meh win-rate.  But if you only look at players with 100+ games of Kog experience, his win rate actually isn't that bad at all.  He's just difficult to use properly.\n\nWith Trist, though?  She just improves from 'total shit' to 'mostly shit' when taking only experienced players into account.  Riot *seriously* under-shot Trist's power level when they remade her.  The worst thing about it is that Riot is apparently totally okay with Jinx running rough-shod over the whole ADC roster, but Trist isn't allowed to be viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-04-28T07:30:05.898+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ya, honestly if your passive that takes the entire game to activate {{champion:18}}, it shouldn't be weaker than an ability that activates at level 8-9 {{champion:222}}.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-04-28T05:09:56.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"True; I did see that her winrate raises to 49% for people who have played 150% games on her, which is kinda sad in and of itself.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nilok","date":"2015-04-27T20:45:07.866+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wow, we just had an anti-Tristana crusader come through and down vote the whole thread and not even post anything.\n\nThis may be part of the problem with getting Tristana fixed or seen by Riot, there seems to be a small, but active enough group on the forums who don't want Tristana to be made balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"afmghost","date":"2015-04-27T21:40:37.224+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nilok,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=i5GHlzxT,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-27T20:45:07.866+0000)\n>\n> Wow, we just had an anti-Tristana crusader come through and down vote the whole thread and not even post anything.\n> \n> This may be part of the problem with getting Tristana fixed or seen by Riot, there seems to be a small, but active enough group on the forums who don't want Tristana to be made balanced.\n\nHere is my question:\nWhy is Tristy under attack without a case made against her?

Trist therefore needs to utilize a tactic often unheard of in yoloq: rotations. This allows for an extremely quick tower, and then she and her support rotates back to bot.
