Kat's art is the most obvious, but most of the new default splashes have this problem. I know, I know, it's supposed to look action-y and dramatic, but it really just seems sloppy and just not thought out very well. You're trying to sell people on your champions with splash art; it doesn't make much sense to have to make someone look at the splash for a couple of seconds before they can figure out what's even going on. 'Is that her knee? What the hell is going on with her legs?  Is this some sort of assassin?

There's WAY too much emphasis on depth and foreground, and it seriously ruins the image; that and the awful stretched look of her face; both her and the Tristana that's been bouncing back and forth on the PBE are areas where Riot has SERIOUSLY dropped the ball when it comes to splash art. They need to stop this mess with the hyper-cartoony super exolosions and move back into the smoky realistic art style like is on Garen and Ashe.\nHell, even some of the other newer looks have been great, like the cop Trundle/Volibear, thief Evelyn/Twitch, Hearseeker Varus, Sweetheart Annie, and the Marauder and Warden skins on the PBE. The latter 4 champions of Gnar, Azir, Kalista, and Rek'Sai, and Sion all look stunning and not overly crazy. But whoever their new artist is that's doing these newer works for the female splashes is just overdoing it and needs to have his/her work toned down.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-02-14T20:18:40.188+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:18}}'s current splash is one of the best, it has just the right amount of action and personality.\n\n{{champion:14}} 's splash is one of my favorites, the first-person helmet outline is AMAZING and really helps Sion come across as the teamfighting terror he is designed to be.\n\nI really love the Warring Kingdoms katarina splash, I thought they would do something similar for her base splash, boy was I hella wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2015-02-15T16:14:42.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL IKR, the Jinx intro in League looks so dumb, remember the Rek'sai and Orianna one?
