My opinion on her changes are the same as they were when I stated them on the PBE.  On one hand, Cass is actually kinda sorta balanced now! I still maintain she's underpowered, but no longer in the 'I'm not gonna play this champ and if an ally picks her I'm seriously gonna consider dodging' state that she was pre-patch. \r\n\r\nThat said, Cass is nowhere near done.  So I will admit that the vast majority of my complaints about Cass are things that I've said a million times, and am not gonna get a response on (hopefully because Stashu is makes those changes already, but probably because he decided that completely reworking the rework is a bad idea), so I'm just gonna stick to balance stuff.\r\n\r\n1) She guzzles mana like a mofo. This is fine, certainly, in laning phase, because you can last hit with E to keep your mana up. It's kinda a fun game of mana management; do I save my E for last hitting, or try to put some damage on my opponent? On the other hand, once laning phase ends and Cass doesn't have a good source of minions to chew on, her mana problems really show up. Trying to get baron/dragon down as fast as possible? OOM. Extended teamfight? OOM. Jungler keeps taking blue? OOM. This also runs into my secondary problem with her mana...\r\n\r\n2) Her itemization is weird. Basically, you're forced into some sort of mana item; you can't buy regen without wasting stats, especially considering how weird 25% CDR is to try an build around. All of the big mana regen items also have 20+ CDR on them, meaning you're wasting some sort of stats. This means that you have to build Seraph's or RoA, which is a problem, because it pushes her further into the 'you suck now, but wait for 20 minutes, then you'll be pretty good!' schtick that I so despise.\r\n\r\n3) You have no mobility and are punished for not having an enemy near you at all times. Ergo, you're probably not roaming, and just desperately hoping that your lanes don't feed. This isn't necessarily a problem, per se, but unlike most of the other hyper carries or mega-scalers, she has no real way to take on multiple opponents at once. She's squishy, has exactly one bit of hard CC and a slow that barely matters, and no gap closer; unlike Nasus' ridiculously tankiness or Vayne's high mobility, even if she gets huge, she needs some support in order to do her thing. That's not a bad thing, but a Cass pick requires you to pick your team around her; kinda like a protect the Kog teamcomp, except the protectee is AP and also shorter ranged. She's gonna be pretty bad in solo queue, is what I'm saying.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna get into my thematic problems with the rework since I have explained those several times. I'm just gonna end this by saying that Cass still has a long way to go, and I hope that Stashu is actually listening for what we say for 5.1.\r\n\r\n(Also no I did not mispost this in Skins and Champions Concepts, why do you ask?)","replies":[{"poster":"chumbler","date":"2014-12-11T09:13:06.992+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"The irony is that the correct solution to this debacle, reverting this trash rework and apologizing, would require basically no work at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Oleandervine","date":"2014-12-11T14:56:57.822+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=chumbler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=PMtYAsVq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-11T09:13:06.992+0000)\n> The irony is that the correct solution to this debacle, reverting this trash rework and apologizing, would require basically no work at all.\n\nExcept for, you know, having to reprogram an entire portion of the game, recode the model/GUI/animations with the programming, sending it to debugging to make sure it works again, and number tweaking the kit. Sure, no work at all.\n\nProgramming isn't f**king Microsoft Word where you can Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V the internet into a school paper. Programming requires a team of programmers, coders, and debuggers to make the stuff happen. It is never a simple process and your ignorance in thinking that it is shows how utterly clueless you are.\nI don't like the Cassiopeia rework just as much as the next guy, but I understand that despite our wailing, Stashu has his hands tied by corporate allocations of work teams. If Riot has deemed Cass to be \"usable\" and no longer requiring a team, they'll have moved that team on to someone else, leaving only Stashu behind to number tweak. He can't program by himself, so cut some slack and give it a little time for Cass to become a priority again. Keep persisting on the forums about your dislike, and eventually they will have to address the issue and allocate resources to Stashu to fix it. But until then, stop calling a complete program overall an easy thing.","replies":[{"poster":"nomercydx","date":"2014-12-11T15:47:34.145+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do know that they make backups off all updates right?\nThey will still have to send it do debugging but it still wont be as hard as fixing the current one to be honust","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"4death4","date":"2014-12-11T18:20:54.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Try her as a support now.
