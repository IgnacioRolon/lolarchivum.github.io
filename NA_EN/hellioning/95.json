I, for example, do not currently have PBE access, presumably because all I ever play is ARAM and therefore do not seem relevant to the current S4 changes. The problem is the fact that I wish to get on the PBE so that I can test the changes for support champions in how they relate to ARAM. I understand that ARAM is not a balance concern, but I'm worried this'll remove most of my the fun for ARAM for me.\r\n\r\nI also have an issue with the fact that I cannot post on the PBE forums without a PBE account. This means that I am forced to make posts in areas that might not be monitored by PBE people, or that might be out of topic, if I wish to comment on the changes; even if I can't play on the PBE, I can still read the patch notes.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how we can resolve this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2013-11-05T18:44:15.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The plan is for them to rotate in cycles, so eventually when they decide they'd like to test the Howling Abyss you may just happen to get into the cycle.  The current testing is around the preseason changes, so that doesn't necessarily apply to what you do.  I'd assume that's part of why you haven't been chosen.\n\nThe problem with allowing non-PBE accounts to use the PBE forums is that it'd cause a lot more spam and useless conversation than any benefit it might provide.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2013-11-05T19:13:49.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess I could get that, but it seems shortsighted that they're making wide sweeping changes like this and a certain percentage of players aren't allowed to see how it would affect them.\n\nAnd yeah, I get that. I just think that the general forums should have something like a PBE response section so that people who don't have PBE access can respond in an appropriate location.","replies":[{"poster":"Solan Stonewhip","date":"2013-11-05T20:40:16.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the fact that they are testing the system on PBE first is a sign that they are not short sighted. hell they've expanded the PBE base as it is. and they're going to rotate it to keep it fair. do i wish i could participate. yes indeed, particularly with team builder. \nbut they have a wide variety of players on their and i'm not narcissistic enough to believe that it's important that they get MY input. \n\nthey'll get a good spread with their current strategy. what more do they need? \n\nfurthermore, are you aware that they're coming out with more modes like aram and asam. and that they will likely be rotating them through on a cycle. i'm not sure what that will mean for aram. so they may not be thinking about aram at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
