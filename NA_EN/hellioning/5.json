His arm with the white armor is soooo coooooool, who thought it was a good idea NOT to add it on the other? Symmetri is beautyful.... Cyborgs does not have a weight problem and extra protection is always a good thing.\n\nSkins are a form of art, and I'm afraid Project Lucian got struck by the disease that is modern art....\n\nEDIT: He looks like a black guy dressing up as a cyborg for halloween -.-","replies":[]}]}
