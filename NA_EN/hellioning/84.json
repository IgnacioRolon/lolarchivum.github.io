He has no real sustain, and that's about it; he can engage well, disengage REALLY well, generally builds tanky, has enough damage to get him through to the early game, and has enough CC to remain relevant despite his lack of damage in the late game. He's certainly very popular because of it; according to LoLKing, he's the single most picked champion in the last month in ranked solo queue, even beating out perennial favorite Lee Sin.\r\n\r\nWith a kit that generalist, Riot has balanced Thresh by making his numbers relatively low, and it's not like he's ridiculously OP or anything; he's hovering at 48%, which is pretty damn good for someone that popular. However, he certainly feels ridiculously strong, no matter if you're playing with him, as him, or against him. He has very high high points; saving someone in the nick of time with lantern, or sniping that clutch hook at max range to bring the enemy ADC straight into the maws of your team. On the other hand, he is not very fun to play against, for the exact same reason; I know I, for one, have watched the ADC escape with just a sliver of health and think 'If his support was ANYONE ELSE, that would have worked. Fucking Thresh.'\r\n\r\nI generally feel that Riot should give Thresh a minor rework, or change his numbers a bit, to give him a clear weakness; perhaps remove the extra auto damage from flay and move it into the active, in order to encourage him to fight more and give him a weakness to poke, or maybe decrease the range that the lantern comes back to him, forcing him into danger if he wants to save an ally. Any thoughts?","replies":[]}
