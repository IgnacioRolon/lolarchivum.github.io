It doesn&#039;t provide any meaningful gameplay for most champions (except maybe for Mundo?) and is a product of a bygone era, where healing was more common and GW was on more things.\r\n\r\n(I also feel the same way about armor/mr pen, especially % armor/mr pen, but that&#039;s so ingrained in the game that it&#039;s gonna be impossible to remove barring massive changes.

The magic resist, health regen, and cdr is useful as well. If she gets warmogs with it (which some Sorakas do), she'll have a spammable, stronger heal that comes with some durability AP items don't always offer (Athenes comes to mind, but I think SV adds more to the healing overall if you're not going full AP). \n\nI'd say it's decent for a non-AP Soraka build, like {{item:3069}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3110}} boots","replies":[{"poster":"CrazedPorcupine","date":"2015-07-08T05:07:20.389+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"....
