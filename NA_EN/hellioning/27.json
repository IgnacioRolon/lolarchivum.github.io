Ryze has been a real problem champion basically forever, with issues the most recent rework failed to address. That meant that in his state pre 6.3, despite being extremely weak for new to average players, he was excessively strong when played well, to the extent we felt we had to limit his best case scenarios. We'll now look at where we can add power that benefits both new and experienced players, potentially starting with restoring the damage cut from his Q back in 5.14.","replies":[{"poster":"Wobly","date":"2016-02-13T07:42:36.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Key question: in the long-term, are you going to try to balance Ryze around this new limitation (the spell-cast cap)?

It doesn't lower his skill floor (like with alistar this patch), but decimates his skill cap harder than Darius will to Ryze this patch. \nI am bronze, but even I will know how hard this hits Ryze. Tell me what proof is there at all that Ryze is overpowered? His win rate isn't very good even in higher levels. The only basis is that it \"feels\" broken when he permaroots.\nIf he had cute furry ears and large breasts, this nonsense wouldn't have happened. The earlier nerfs aren't enough? He was fine 6.2, even a bit weak for anybody who isn't a korean challenger. Only because Faker used him at worlds, he's now considered broken. I recall he was considered garbage before.\nI do think it's good the Rogue Mage is being balanced, but the spell cap is terrible, and I suggest it be removed. This spell cap will screw him over in all leagues (worse on those higher up).\nI wonder if whoever decided this was a good idea in PBE actually plays the game, or at least understands how Ryze works.

Now that he can't build RoA or BV in his build it is perfectly legit. Also you'll never run into perma stacking because he can only go 2 full skill rotations before his ult cd gets in the way. This way you still have his machine gun approach but he is no longer tanky like previously, nor does he just insta gib you with a million spells at once.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eapenator","date":"2016-02-15T00:12:57.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Meddler, \n\nI tried a couple games of the new 5 spell rotation mechanic and it isn't that bad. I actually really like it and think it's much more balanced that it was before. \n\nBefore, you just got 4 stacks then you proceeded to 1 v 1 the enemy and kill them with an insane amount of spells if you are a veteran player, but now, you actually have to take trades and multiple passive activations before deciding when to all in the enemy. I think this mechanic is much better that the previous passive. \n\nThe only problem with this new change is that now his late game is extremely awkward. You are supposed to pick ryze for the late game, and the previous ryze late game allowed you to really hammer down on opponents with a flurry of spells, unbridled by nothing.\n\nNow however, the gaps between his passive really make it awkward in team fights where you are left just standing there waiting for cool downs, which feels very bad. The ultimate cool down change is very very good because it kinda because in late game team fights it become permanently on, which is really cool and thematic for a late game dps mage like ryze. I just feel like if he was able to just chain spells better late game (after level 16) ryze will be in a perfect spot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2016-02-13T16:29:11.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't see how he can be balanced without just jacking up his damage to stupid extents. His normal spells already hit decently hard; any changes to balance them under the assumption he can only cast five spells per passive proc would probably raise his poke to unbearable levels.\n\nAnd, to be frank, getting only five casts per combo simply makes him less fun.
