I understand that you prefer these boards and would much rather have discussion on them, but you have to understand that not everyone shares your views, and it seems incredibly rude of you to simply shut down a discussion before it even began by simply stating 'let's move this to a forum I'm more comfortable with' before it even began. \n\nI admit, I'm biased. I dislike these forums. Some of it can be excused by the fact it's a beta, for example, the fact that people's avatars/flairs/whatever can stay on the screen until you mouse over them again. Others are simply because of what I believe is going to happen: minority opinions, of which I share several, are going to be suppressed by the downvote system, while every thread descends into circle jerking over agreeing/disagreeing with the OP. There are, however, problems that I see on this site right now that I don't think will change.  I dislike how hard it is to find the new posts (the 'new' button gives you all the new posts, yes, but I don't know the context of those posts unless I specifically click another button to lead me to the context for that post, and I have to do that for every post.) I dislike how annoying the red tracker can be; me clicking the right arrow in GD's red tracker leads me either further down the current page or to a later page, while with the red tracker in the community beta, clicking the right arrow gives me a very truncated version of the message, and I have to click another button to zoom to it, which might make me move up or down the page, depending on how upvoted the comment they replied to was. \n\nI dislike using this forum, and holding a discussion hostage like you did gives me a bad taste in my mouth. And if parrot doesn't respond, well, take some site feedback.\n\nEDIT: Another issue I have, which is happened when I go to the 'new' button on the Caitlyn thread; it doesn't mark the new posts as 'unread' until I see them in the main thread. If I just check the 'new' button every few posts, I still see a bunch of posts I've already seen because they weren't marked as 'read', so even though it only says I have 2 new messages, I still see, like, 10.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-02-17T09:54:18.689+0000","up_votes":39,"down_votes":73,"body":"I hear you, but look at that thread now, you can see exactly why I didn't want to stick around, and I feel that any perceived disrespect you saw from me was met with a hyperbolic amount of disrespect from a number of posters. \n\nIf it left a bad taste in your mouth, I apologize, however I don't really have the energy to deal with the sort of lashing out which that thread is now full of. \n\nGive your feedback to the dev team and they'll have a look. As I've said, there are more features in the works to hopefully help with ease of navigation and consumption. We'll see.\n\nUntil then, depending on the topic, I may or may not move it over here if it's something I want to track a particular way. This is really just about players being able to get their feedback directly to us without certain obstacles such as ease of navigation, toxic behavior, or other aspects getting in the way.\n\nIt's really easy to vent over in GD, but it's sometimes impossible to have a conversation which results in feedback that's able to be parsed.","replies":[{"poster":"SlumlordThanatos","date":"2014-02-17T09:59:19.807+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":10,"body":">I hear you, but look at that thread now, you can see exactly why I didn't want to stick around, and I feel that any perceived disrespect you saw from me was met with a hyperbolic amount of disrespect from a number of posters.\n\nYou're the one who brought it about, though.\n\nSurely you have figured out by now how much people on GD (including myself) despises the Community site. Talking about how you want to move the discussion over here and then refusing to talk about it on GD is only going to make us angry. Hence, the \"hyperbolic amount of disrespect.\"\n\nAll you're doing to the discussion is annoying people who prefer GD, and moving the discussion to a platform where there can be less conversation about it. There may be less toxicity, but also fewer people who are willing to discuss it.\n\nThe uproar in the GD thread was your doing.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-02-17T10:17:20.877+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":62,"body":"I asked to move the conversation to a venue where I could more easily track it. \n\nThe first comment after I asked:\n\n\"Sorry, but if I wanted to go to Reddit, I'll just go to Reddit\n\nThanks though\"\n\nThe second:\n\n\"I'd rather she didn't if IronStylus were put in charge of it. I feel as though he'd ruin her.\"\n\nAfter I mentioned one of the above people would be missing out, and someone replying to the comment directly above:\n\n\"I agree.\n\nShe wants to make her more steampunk...\n\nGross.\"\n\nThis isn't productive, sorry, and it just keeps going. I said why this was a good venue, I stated that it was easier for me to track, and we just had a decent discussion about Sion on here anyway. \n\nI realize certain people don't like the new format. But I also realize a lot of people do like it, or at least want to try it, because the new Caitlyn thread has ~100 comments on it, all of which are actually perfectly polite and I can respond to every single one of them. \n\nI asked for a favor, for the discussion to move over here so I could follow it better and so players could suggest feedback that they could then collectively vote to the top.  That request was met with negativity. I was not aiming to exclude, there's a thread of 450,000 views about general relaunch info that's wrapping up in GD. I am not excluding anyone from the discussion, I'm asking that they help me out with giving me their feedback in a way that I can take action on and track properly. \n\nWhat's interesting, is this very thread, in this venue, has allowed me to keep up with this conversation very easily. This is all critical feedback you're giving me, but I'm still addressing it. You're not being rude, you're being sensible, and you therefore deserve to be treated likewise. That tone and consistency is very hard to maintain in GD.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2014-02-17T10:27:51.958+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":6,"body":"First off, I must note that you did not ask them to move the discussion to a venue in which it would be more easily tracked. You said that it would be a BETTER way to do this discussion, and then said you're working with the beta team. You also asked the OP to make that thread, something that they may or may not have wanted to do. It is very easy to take that as 'I don't like this format and will not discuss it unless you change it'. At the very least, that's how I took it. You didn't really explain yourself until the second to last post you made in that thread, as the second was your response that sounded like 'if you're not playing by my rules you're not getting anything' to me and the third and fourth were you defending yourself to trolls. By that point, it's too late.\n\nI should also point out that the thread was incredibly civil until you made that post. There was a bad post, the first response really, but that got downvoted swiftly. The rest were generally either ideas as to what the cait rework should be like, people expressing their opinion that cait was fine, a few people saying that several other champions has more pressing need of a VU than Cait (which might be off topic) and a healthy debate between Glados and AnonTwo as to whether Cait should have pants or not.\n\nFor example:\n'IronStylus would have a field day with caitlyn.\n\nAll I ask for, oh great parrot from the heavens, is that you keep her hat mostly in tact. The zoom coming down when she ults is so sexy, I love it. It's the most iconic thing about caitlyn.'\n\n'I'm honestly surprised IronStylus hasn't tackled her already. I mean, it's clear that Cait doesn't give off the vibe that she should. This is a great injustice.'\n\nI should point out that you shouldn't use the numbers on the Cait thread as a baseline as to what the community beta is. The only reason a lot of those people are on this forum is because you made it clear you would be responding there. I think the second highest post in this forum is that poro skin syndra thread, and that's only being made because the original poster was from EUNE and apparently Rioters never post there, so they want more recognition and traffic from this site.\n\nAnd again, you never made it clear that you wanted the discussion to come over here so you could track it properly. You made it sound like you wanted it to come over here because you just didn't like how traditional forums work.\n\nI feel the fact we're having this conversation civilly doesn't mean much. It isn't because we're on this site, it's because no one else is here to derail the conversation. When this becomes the new forums, it's going to go back to GD style asking you questions every time you show up, no matter how on-topic it is. If no one else was posting, we could have this exact conversation on GD. We might have it even better, because you can quote in multiple blocks on GD.","replies":[{"poster":"IronStylus","date":"2014-02-17T10:31:31.220+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":69,"body":"Welp, fair point I suppose, but I don't have a ton of time to revisit every single point of the whole thread.\n\nEither way, the way I'm tracking this discussion is through the \"my updates\" widget at the top, so no matter what, derailing or not, I'd be tracking this here with ease. \n\nIf this isn't valuable for you, sorry.

Bad attitudes on GD can wear a man out. Hell, it can make a man stop speaking to the community. Especially when its during his personal time.\n\nHere on this forum (that I still hate. I hate Reddit) we get to talk directly to the makers of the game we love, and they don't have to deal with people who seriously have bad attitudes that make them feel awful.

Why on earth do you think that toxic behavior is going to stop because of this new format? The downvoting system is not going to work once the GD crowd comes over here; see how many posts that you would consider 'toxic' are being upvoted in that thread because the prevailing opinion is that you suck.

Their voices are being drown out. And here we are, discussing it rationally. \n\nIn terms of optimism, I want to try something new and I'd like others to do the same. There is no way I can track the conversations that go on in GD as they currently stand. The way I go about finding the threads I want to address is insane. The constant refreshing, the upvoting and downvoting that really doesn't mean anything, the anger and the energy, it's a bit overwhelming. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, I just don't have the time to sort through GD anymore the way I used to. I don't have the energy to put up with negative behavior. I have a job to do on a day-to-day basis and it's only gotten more involved as Relaunch has spun up. I want to be able to serve players by taking feedback directly which is deemed valuable by the community. I can best do that in this venue. \n\nSo, beyond that particular thread, I want to be able to do my job and go beyond it. This system is the best way I can achieve that balance.

I know, I know, 'welcome to democracy' and all that, but just because something is popular doesn't mean that it's, you know, useful. During a server outage, I imagine a thread along the lines of 'riot fix your servers' would be incredibly upvoted, after all, but is that really useful? Presumably, your server people already know that, and the most they can do is post 'hey guys, we know about the issue and we are fixing it.' Does that help anyone, beside the occasional person who thinks that Riot genuinely either doesn't know or doesn't care that their servers are having issues?\n\nMore then that, though, it leads to unpopular opinions getting buried. For example, if I make a post about female champion diversity, that thread will probably get downvoted, because the community either doesn't see a problem with female champion diversity at present, doesn't care, or genuinely thinks that female champion diversity is a bad thing. Does this mean that I don't have a point worth responding to?

My assumption, from your actions previously, is that you would ignore the negative circlejerks, as they tend to slowly spiral into a point where whoever has the best insults gets the most upvotes, while spending time discussing and participating in the positive ones, leading you to assume things that aren't true.

Eventually the bulletin will make it around that such feedback, presented in such a way, will get a red's attention.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkna","date":"2014-02-17T17:02:49.976+0000","up_votes":58,"down_votes":4,"body":"1.

It's a convenience that makes popular ideas easy to see, but buries dissenting opinions. Let's say you rework Poppy. Players who main Poppy could have their entire opinion ignored just because there aren't as many Poppy players to contribute. And given Riot's history of satisfying players who have their main's reworked, this isn't something I really trust you on anyways.\n\nOh, and you told someone to remake his thread on the Community Beta, when GDer's already feel as though they are ignored in favor of Reddit. Then you flat at tell him he has to use the Community Beta to participate in further discussions.

I am not referring to the content, but the massive downvotes and upvotes being given.\n\nIronStylus has received a considerable amount of downvotes. Not because of the quality of his posts, but because people are disagreeing with him. If he were not a Red, his posts would have been buried. That is simply what happens when you give people upvote/downvote buttons. People vote based on their own personal opinions or for a message they want to send. That's not good or bad, that's just the way it is.\n\nIf this sort of system were implemented right now in GD, the trolls would still be overrunning the place. Don't believe me? Look at some of Morello's posts and see how many downvotes he gets or when someone makes a honest fact based post about how they don't believe LeBlanc or Leona are OP. Now look at someone bashing Morello or CertainlyT or the millions of posts on Yasuo and see how many upvotes they get. Now imagine if those votes in GD actually meant something.\n\nWhen it comes to voting on threads it gets even worse.
