In a game mode that&#039;s entirely random and focused on teamfighting and objectives, you want us to try and CS? Sure, if you have good waveclear you can just use that, but if you get a bad streak you&#039;ll get so many melee, non-waveclear champions that you&#039;ll take forever on this step.","replies":[{"poster":"MohawkBird","date":"2015-07-24T00:55:15.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not nearly as hard as it sounds.

When you play a ARAM game, some people don't even participate in team fights. It's making the game mode not that fun because you get stuck with teammates who only do the quest objectivies.
