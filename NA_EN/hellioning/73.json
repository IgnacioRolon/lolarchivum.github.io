Usualy I have games in normals go from 30-40 minutes with the occasional under 30 if our team is awesome. But with black markert its like 20-30 minute games. The brawlers make wave clear alot easier and harder. I mean nemisis was just like normals all they did was make it so you had to play weird comps.","replies":[{"poster":"Kinjishi","date":"2015-08-06T22:31:02.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.  The new minions/brawlers have been fun.  The lack of teamwork in lobby and IG happens regardless of mode.  Nemesis was interesting and a nice change of pace. : )","replies":[{"poster":"Radnar the bold","date":"2015-08-06T22:33:30.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly, these game modes or more for fun and to mess around in. If people dont like it then they should just go back to normals or ranked.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SoundChaosDebug","date":"2015-08-04T20:38:46.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it once, waited for every one to pick a champion and then to ban champions etc.\n\nI was the last in line to chose a champion and right before I could some one quit, so I just never played it again.\n\nI'd rather this game mode be tied into team builder some how, instead of every one spamming the roles they want like it's season 2 still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"G01fanThomas","date":"2015-08-05T13:59:19.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"AGREED MY MAN, Its So Boring LOL I Rather Play Blind Pick Than Black Market.
