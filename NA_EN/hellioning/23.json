Lulu is Darius&#039; theoretical counter, and we still managed to lose. Fairly handily, too; we were up in kills, but very down in towers, because they could just ignore us and auto the towers. Sure, we could kite them...but our range is so short that if we were in range to attack we were also probably in range to get Q, or apprehended. The fact that he has 20 more natural movespeed then we did didn&#039;t help.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not trying to use one for all as a balancing metric or something. It&#039;s going to be imbalanced by design, and I know that if we had a more damage-y champion it would have worked out better. But I just think it says something about the current state of Darius&#039; balance when he could go up against his theoretical counter and win fairly easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2015-10-15T22:06:05.979+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"lulu IS darius counter.\n\nif you got cushed thats seriously on you. and one for all is a terrible example. in an actual game you would have to deal with 1 darius who you alone could kite indefinitely until your carry takes him out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2015-10-15T22:09:37.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got outplayed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikari","date":"2015-10-15T21:16:13.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is that Bad? \nAnyone with hp and damage beats mages,simple outscaling. Counters don't mean shit either. If you want a counter,tanks counter mages. I find Lulu easy for Darius,even early game before his buffs. Only counter really affected is Garen vs Darius,Garen wins late game every time.","replies":[]}]}
