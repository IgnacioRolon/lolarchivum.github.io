Simple solution, don't kill minions. Complication, I play Sona.\n\nSolution I: go with a different gold income item. Bit of a cop-out as an answer, but if you want a steady, guaranteed income of gold, maybe {{item:3301}}  is more your speed.\n\nSolution II: What Letler said. Just watch the minions and avoid Q'ing when low minions are near.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2014-03-05T11:59:05.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if you still have problems with dying minions, rush {{item:3092}} .

The benefit is of course doing damage and making gold.\n\nThink about champions like Janna, Karma, Zyra, Lulu, and Annie. They bring a lot of utility and damage, some more than others. If the item had no cooldown or a short one there would be no reason to not just spam your ability all day, poking, getting free damage, and lots of gold. It would get oppressive for the enemy and less impactful for the player, you. The extra damage from the item is best felt on turrets and during your all ins. If you ult, attack and Q and happen to kill a minion you either got 2/3 of your bonus damage or all of it.\n\nMore damage when its time for plays\nMore risk when its more passive/harassing/farming.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kaine","date":"2014-03-04T16:37:21.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would just rush the item as fast as possible.
