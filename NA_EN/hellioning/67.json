So this will be the last Quinn-related question I&#039;ll address.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Quinn had assassination elements, but she could hardly be considered a good assassin. She relied on bullying in lane to get ahead, and had a notorious reputation for being useless when behind. With the exception of her blind, which she used to enable her bullying, she lacked a fallback pattern that wasn&#039;t becoming a suicide bomber. I think players liked bursting people as Valor, but I really don&#039;t agree that they were two dynamic sets. Thematics aside, Quinn and Valor were basically the same champion, one of which was a little faster, burstier, and riskier.\r\n\r\nRemember when Quinn used to be called &#039;Quinn and Valor&#039;? They stopped that because &#039;Quinn and Valor&#039; was too long for some of the things they needed to use champion names on, but I bring it up because I always felt like Quinn and Valor were supposed to be a double champion. Maybe not a pure form swapper like Jayce and Nid, but someone who was usually one champ, but had moments of power as another champ. This caused both champs to feel useful and important, even though you spent most of your time as one. Otherwise you get something like Kindred; Wolf is barely important, there are still loads of people who think Kindred is just Lamb. As such, I find the Quinn changes to be disappointing; I wanted a double champ, not Quinn and her transportation bird.\r\n\r\nAnd Repertoir is probably the best Rioter when it comes to communication, at least in the champion update team, so I don&#039;t want to get too upset at him, but I still don&#039;t like how it took several months to get an answer as to why we couldn&#039;t fight as Valor anymore. Please keep this in mind for future reworks: I, personally, get less angry if I have a clear reason as to why something is happening besides &#039;We like it.&#039;","replies":[{"poster":"Gehco","date":"2016-02-07T09:10:27.140+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Playing as Valor was really fun though.

It would take a much larger scale rework to actually make Valor work with Quinn during the valor mode for it, while with the rework valor literally helps Quinn in every single ability, sure it would be nice for Quinn to be able to help valor playing as valor as well, but that was beyond the scoop or scale of this especially when Valor's \"kit\" simply mirrored Quinns without any teamwork.

Assassination was not a role it was an option, you could not Rengar people as Valor unless your were significantly ahead, in an even environment it was more a way to engage a duel with someone by securing your blind and ability damage on them and finishing them off with Quinn.

After all it's just tankier AoE Shyvanna, right? The issue with that is the same issue Quinn has now, it ruins the fluidity of the champion's kit because their kit was made with that in mind. Quinn just simply doesn't feel as good to play, the bug fixes in many ways draw your attention away from what was lost to get them and it took a few patches for me to realise it myself but really Quinn relied a lot on the instant MS from Tag Team for a large number of things not least of which escaping.\n\nI appreciate everything Repertoir did for us during the update and we were lucky to have him but I still can't forgive the lack of communication prior, I know several of us made attempts to show Riot how we felt about Quinn with quite thought out threads and I know he read them because he commented in some yet seemingly none of that was taken into account until after the announcement when it was too late to make drastic changes. I understand that she's seeing competitive play and that her pick rate is up but I don't really think that it's going to be a long term thing, somewhere down the line a meta-shift or a nerf is going to put an end to that because that level of mobility will need curbing eventually(just ask Kassadin) and all of that will go away but not even her old playerbase will still play her. I really genuinely feel like he traded her theme and feel for viability and to me that's just unacceptable and I can't bring myself to be content with that outcome, she feels shallow and uninteresting by comparison to her previous state and I really sincerely wish they had just tried making the Harrier and Vault fixes happen in any of the 3 year period since her damn release so we could actually see if her old kit was fundamentally flawed or if it was just the myriad of technical problems holding her back.\n\n\nTo address more of what Repertoir has said: You can say that you don't think she was good at something, you are entitled to believe that but honestly can you say that the current form of the champion is healthy? Is she not still useless when behind? Is she not still a lane bully with token assassin elements who's only utility is a blind? If these were your problems with the old Quinn when why did you address none of them? Who did this rework serve, Repertoir? The way I see it more people than ever are extremely annoyed and frustrated when playing against Quinn and with her pick rate up they're feeling that in more games and a significant amount of her core playerbase enjoys playing her a lot less, so who benefited from this update? Competitive play maybe? I guess that's true but that's not going to be the case forever, she has a niche role that is meta dependant so when she's no longer picked there then who's enjoying playing her?\n\n\nUnfortunately we live in a world where this ult exists and isn't going away any time in the next year or two or maybe ever so if I may offer some actual feedback: You know me, I want more damage on Harrier and less on Q, the Q damage for the CC it provides is just plain stupid but when I say Harrier damage I mean scaling as in I feel that her Harriers should be scaling up to 75% of AD instead of 50% and if you could stop being misleading in the tooltip and including the damage from the auto in Harrier's damage so that it looks higher that'd be great too. Ult could seriously use some kind of CD because mana gating doesn't work past level 11 which is when her mobility becomes abusable and is usually the first time in the game pro players make use of it for things other then getting back to lane, so either her level 1 ult is terrible or... well actually paying a quarter mana for basically Strut does seem kind of bad(At level 6 ulting grants about 130 MS).\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I'm upset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HigeR","date":"2016-02-07T06:02:30.089+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My only concern for Quinn is that her ult looks so SO derpy :S I mean, we know valor is NOT that big, plus she's literally hanging, she looks as if a predator bird was about to take her away...

Either way, as per Repertoir, it seems like a  100% uptime on Valor would provide too much burst on demand--even with the loss of her execute considered, probably--so if he were to ever return as a playable character, he'd need a reason to be played besides burst, assuming the ultimate remains at zero cooldown. \n\n**Edit:** Honestly, I think turning him into a pure scout and sticky melee fighter would be enough, while reusing his old abilities, because even if it comes at the cost of losing Harrier damage, you can get a guaranteed Q off on your opponent if you E->Q successively. But I know that may be confusing and/or unrewarding gameplay for the Champion that could leave something else to be desired, especially if he doesn't retain the same burst as before and if Q is left as an ability that reduces sight to melee range, which wouldn't really help Valor at all. So if that's the case, then he'd just need a new kit; or at least, versions of Quinn's abilities that make sense for him.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Árchangel Avacyn","date":"2016-02-10T13:56:23.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not convinced to be honest, Valor's burst without Skystrike was extremely limited and unlike similar champions like Master Yi he didn't have untargetability, Meditate or Slow Immunity to survive retaliation so I don't think that it's really a viable argument to claim that Valor had too much burst inherently.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2016-02-08T16:54:12.994+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Anyone committed to their favorite Champion is going to be meticulous about an undesirable update to their character, especially if it removes a core aspect of their kit/theme.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Varnoc","date":"2016-02-07T20:03:55.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Firstly, your quotes are borken in the OP (dunno why this happens, but it happens to me too when I use quotes to Format) :P\n\nSecond, when it comes to Quinn's (and Valor's) old ultimate, we need to accept that there's a really good chance it's not coming back. We can debate if this was, or wasn't, the right decision at the time, or even now, but in the end, that's all for nothing. This in mind, we, as Quinn and Valor players, need to aim our feedback at improving what we have now.\n\nBuilding off what some others have discussed here a little, I'm going to mention Kindred for a second. While you play primarily as Lamb, a few things about the champion makes Wolf feel as much a part of Kindred as Lamb, these include: \n\n* Wolf's constant visual presence\n* Dialog between Wolf and Lamb reinforces the idea that they're partners.\n\nWhile it seems like a short list, this is really all that's needed to achieve the \"partnership\" feeling those two gain (though some could consider it a shallow relationship in Kindred's case, it's a step in the right direction in the end). \n\nSo how do we achieve this with Quinn and Valor? Firstly, we need Valor to be a constant visual presence on the map. Valor should be following Quinn along as she moves, swooping from perch to perch as he does so. Possibly add an energy bar to Valor to limit the number of actions he can perform within a certain amount of time (meaning the champion's cooldowns would be fairly low as a general rule, but Valor can tire quickly making management of his energy important). You can achieve some cool things with Quinn's abilities by doing this:\n\n* **Harrier (Passive)** - Valor swooping down to mark the \"vulnerable\" target, allowing both sides to predict the marking of targets, and making Valor more visually impactful part of the champion without actually increasing power level would be an interesting way to make him a real part of the champion.\n\n* **Aerial Assault (Q)** - Can be based on Valor's current location when cast, lending importance to Valor's current position for both player and opponent.\n\n* **Heightened Senses (W)** - Could be a channeled effect of sorts, causing Valor to circle around Quinn, revealing terrain he passes over (he'd probably grant vision passively, being a part of the champion, the spell would just move him around). Canceling the channel will have him roost on the nearest wall, allowing the player to have some control over Valor's position in the map without playing _as_ Valor directly. Possibly tie Valor's maximum energy, or energy regeneration rate, to this skill.\n\n* **Vault (E)** - While Valor doesn't directly participate in the functionality of the spell, he does mark Vault's target with Harrier, so Valor could, visually, swoop down and \"strike\" the target visually at the same moment Quinn does, further reinforcing their partnership through the extreme coordination required to pull such a thing off.\n\n* **Behind Enemy Lines (R)** - I don't think that Valor should be able to indefinitely carry Quinn, unless Demacian Eagles are deceptively powerful (which raises the question, among others, why did they go extinct?), it's physically not possible for Valor to carry Quinn for very long, if at all. The action should be the epitome of Quinn and Valor's coordination and partnership, everything must be perfectly done by both parties to make it work in a combat situation.\n - Under the limited duration system provided by Valor's energy limit, we can remove the \"channel\" time of the skill. Quinn can call to Valor for aid, run around a bit, and then jump into the air to be caught by Valor, and off they go. It shouldn't be true flight, but more a series of hops on Quinn's part, with Valor increasing the distance she's able to bound. By involving Quinn in this process, it becomes clear that Valor is not doing all the work, and thus not a tool, but a partner.\n - Activating Heightened Senses could allow Quinn and Valor to pass over walls while under this effect (accentuated by Quinn kicking off of said terrain to give Valor a hand), but costing a massive amount of Valor's energy to execute, so maintaining this effect for very long should be extremely taxing, allowing them to go over one wall easily, and two walls if timed extremely well. Ending the effect while over terrain could cause Quinn to perform a sort of sliding animation to the nearest side of the terrain.\n - There are more technical that could be explored here, however the last thing I want to touch on is Skystrike. The ability is really rather useless in most situations, and I personally use it more for wave-clear than anything else. If it's kept, I'd like to see it change a little, requiring Valor to have a certain amount of energy available, letting him pull Quinn to the height needed to perform Skystrike. \n\n\nSo the abilities are out of the way, providing Valor with a consistent presence within the game, what about voice lines? Quinn and Valor can't interact in the way that Wolf and Lamb do, as they have a language barrier of sorts. Instead, Valor needs to be able to give simple squawks of acknowledgement to Quinn's lines, and Quinn needs to react to Valor's actions as he moves around (Valor marks a target with harrier? \"Stick to the plan Val...\"). More interactions based on the actions of one character or the other reinforces the fascinating relationship the two share.","replies":[{"poster":"Árchangel Avacyn","date":"2016-02-07T21:18:58.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like a lot of these visuals would be there if she was released today but she really was a victim of her rushed development. Vault is almost there, he strikes the target at the same time it's just that he sorta....teleports, I think that Vault could use some love though it got a lot of nice consistency updates but with the mark it applies weaker and the nerf to the slow it feels much worse to use then it used to, Vault was a nice Risk vs Reward spell as it was your only gap opener and it put you in a vulnerable position something that could work could be enhancing it's effect when used at range. Vault works differently when cast close and when cast far, so it's not a big stretch to say that if you use it to close the gap that it could have a bit more punch possibly in the CC department?\n\nAll this talk of energy and the ultimate has reminded me on an idea I had and some way to improve on it. I talked once about giving it a short CD but making it function similar to Blitz ult, where the ult has a passive that is disabled when on CD. What this could become is that ranking the ult increases the effect Valor has on Quinn's basic abilities, stronger harriers, better slow on vault or whatever but when inside the ult you drain his energy and disable it as he has to recover from hauling her fat ass around the place. See Riot seems to want Quinn's ult to have no CD and that's annoying because it makes it a nightmare to balance but if we assume that's always going to be the compromise we could instead go with her ult can be used without CD but you only get the benefit of the passive if you don't use it for a certain time.\n\nThat's just an idea I had when I read this so don't dwell too heavily on it, I just feel like if all Quinn can be good at is mobility that eventually it's going to a problem if she's nerfed or a meta shift makes that less viable because she has nothing else going on in her kit. There needs to be a way that we can balance the mobility without hurting her power too much and I think that rewarding her for not using it could be a good way to do it, or even make it like Kassadin where consecutive casts 'wear out' Valor so it costs more, takes longer to channel, is slower, ect and reduce the penalties already in place.","replies":[{"poster":"Varnoc","date":"2016-02-08T03:00:23.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been extremely difficult to articulate my thoughts on the subject, and I'm wary to speak on balance in detail due to the highly speculative nature of the subject.\n\nI do not completely agree that investing skill points into the ultimate should improve the effectiveness of the other abilities, as it provides fairly irregular power spikes, and this effect can be achieved through regular scaling on her abilities. In the case of Vault, the slow could probably increase in strength as you level the skill up and still be acceptable without tying it to her Ultimate, and for Harrier a regular level scaling would be more consistent than ult rank based systems would be.\n\nIt would probably be more engaging for both the player and opponent if Valor's energy was a constant management challenge as well, rather than only being used during the ultimate, as giving it relevancy outside of her mobility is the whole idea behind the energy bar in the first place.\n\nI feel as though Quinn and Valor's focus should be mostly on Mobility and mostly front loaded Damage, as per her theme as a character, with a minor facet being her vision provision via W.\n\nGiving Valor an Energy resource to manage, on top of Quinn's existing Mana pool, is going to be the hardest sell for this idea. This has never been done in League before, a single \"champion\" managing both Energy and Mana at the same time, and while I think that Quinn and Valor would be perfect to try this out, I don't think many people would be excited to see their favorite champion be turned into a testing dummy for new ideas, and this will be the biggest hurtle to overcome with this idea. \n\nI do feel, however, that if done well, this system would accurately convey the feeling of two separate characters within the same Champion. \n\n---\n\nI feel the below is a relevant example of what I'm trying to get at, though I couldn't find a good place to wedge it into the primary topic\n\n> Valor has 300 total energy.\n> \n> * **Harrier **- Small but important cost to mark targets. Say 50 Energy.\n> * **Aerial Assault **- Small cost to cast on Valor's part, once again 50 Energy, however when combined with Harrier it costs 100 Energy. If you only have the 50 to cast this spell, all you get is the blinding effect on the primary target, and the AoE damage provided.\n> * **Heightened Senses **- Flat drain on energy each second. Have this energy drain per second reduce with rank, becoming largely sustainable in the later ranks, providing strong vision abilities later in the game to hone in on that scout fantasy the pair is centered on. It should be used as a tool to reposition Valor, allowing you all but full control over him as a character in the game.\n> * **Vault **- Small energy cost, if any, to Valor. This ability is mostly on Quinn, so it shouldn't really be on Valor to foot the bill for it. The only cost Valor needs to worry about is the Harrier mark. \n> * **Behind Enemy Lines** - Exponential energy cost that increases drastically with each passing second, reducing with rank, allowing Quinn to travel greater distances on the same amount of energy as the game progresses. Obviously, having Heightened Senses active during this will rapidly deplete your energy, but allowing you to pass over walls while both are active really focuses on the mobility they sport.\n\n\n---\n\nSorry if this is long, I fear that I ended up rambling a little when writing this up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Árchangel Avacyn","date":"2016-02-07T10:24:59.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something that I forgot to touch on was a lot of the changes to how Harrier functioned, while a lot of them were great improvements there are a few that still bother me: \n\n1. The crit scaling can go several ways, I don't like it but I do understand it. I just feel like it could scale with levels or CDR and literally be the same thing we have now and not feel like you're being severely punished for having to delay crit items because the enemy team requires a fast Maw/Sterak's/QSS because the damage deficit of not having that crit should be punishment in of itself.\n\n2. The cooldown starting on consumption not procs. This is the big one for me, in lane you can't just proc marks whenever you like, you need to CS, the enemy can play around it if it lands on them, ect. What this means is that on top of Harrier doing about 30-40% less damage it also has around a 10 second CD on average in lane when before it was at most 6 seconds if you failed to proc it at all, this is something I struggle with in every game I expect Harrier procs that never materialise because the cooldown is so damn long because of this mechanic, what was wrong with the 7/10 CD it had before?\n\n3. The mandatory CD after proc and ult. This allows you to maximise uptime on W without trying, that's cool I guess but it's also both unnecessary and frustrating, if someone wants to maximise uptime on W they can do that THEMSELVES without being forced to by the ability, all this really does is make it much harder to perform the role she's actually good at when fighting champions which is duelling. The CD after ult is only really an issue in that it means you are forced to open with either Q or E in order to have the speed to keep up with someone who tries to flee, this isn't too much of a problem but it does make using E as an open attractive which I believe is one of the biggest reasons for her huge average death rate.\n\n\nMaybe these only bother me, who knows but feedback is feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nagoh Shan","date":"2016-02-07T05:55:27.099+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I played the reworked Quinn I was floored that Valor was carrying Quinn, and not just there by himself.
