You want each new skin to be utterly fantastic, especially the ones that are 1820 or more. You want each new champion to have their own unique gameplay and lore niche and to be perfectly balanced. You want every new event to revolutionize the way the game works, if only for a little while. You want every new splash art to show great movement and emotion, to make you feel or the character. We get it, we really do.\r\n\r\nWe just want content. When you constantly put things off, or don't meet dates that people consider 'acceptable', it sets a bad precedent. No one believes you when you say a cool new feature is coming because they know that you've said that before. They know to add a couple of weeks to each tentative date that you guys bring up. They know not to expect Nidalee's new skin splashes anytime soon, because why would they? You haven't delivered on it before.\r\n\r\nYou know how close new skins/art/champions/whatever are to completion. We don't. We know that delays happen, but we don't know what kind of delays happen to cause the lunar revel to be so boring. All we know is that they are taking a while. And when that happens, maybe we get happy. Maybe we think 'wow, they're taking so long, they must be putting tons of effort into these new skins! They'll look amazing.' Meanwhile, a few less optimistic are thinking 'why are they taking so long? There is no reason to wait so long to release these skins!' But either way, there's no way that you're meeting the expectations of the first person. Instead we get mediocre skins for champions that have a bunch already. We don't know what happened to Lunar Goddess Karma that it was considered low quality, but I'd hate to see something more boring than Warring Kingdoms Tryndamere.\r\n\r\nI'm not defending the people that rage at Riot and complain incessantly about new features. But I can totally understand where they're coming from. Seriously, how long does it take to do a few splash arts? Is Nid THAT complicated? Have you thought about going back a couple of years, where you made skins that were less then 975, and you had splash arts that took around 8 hours to make, given the skin spotlights? I'd rather not have the champion release every 2 weeks, that was annoying and hell to balance, but I'd like more common balance updates. I think you're too worried about giving us bad content that you don't give us content at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Jethzk","date":"2014-02-18T10:33:50.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't want lower quality, they just want progress reports.
