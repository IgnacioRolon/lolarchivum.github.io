Yes it's kill able but if it lasts 3 minutes (not hard) or finds you an enemy warr to destory it suddenly has become more effective than what you had before. And as a support you weren't buying a sightstone? They sill have them and combined them with gold items to give you an extra useful item\n\nThink of before ward system saving you from early game ganks. Now it saves you AND sets you up for your own gank. Your jungler sees a pink he knows enemy doesn't see him.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-11-12T03:51:33.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was a midlaner. The enemy blitzcrank just kept roaming mid because my bot lane got so far behind he didn't need to stay there.\n\nAnd yes, pink wards only cost 75.The problem wasn't  having to constantly buy them, the problem was that every time I would buy them, he would show up, kill it, and I would be back in the same predicament again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GhastlyGhoulMan","date":"2015-11-12T03:40:20.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest the last few matches, the map has seemed even darker due to fog of war everywhere and no wards.
