Maybe it&#039;s just me, but I find the kind of action sequences you&#039;re writing about to be...distracting. I don&#039;t need to know that when Graves&#039; gun clicks, he needs to reload. It&#039;s unnecessary detail that just seems there to take up space and pad wordcount.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m also kinda irritated that you chose to introduce Miss Fortune by focusing on how beautiful she is, but meh, she&#039;ll get her chance to shine next act.\r\n\r\nAnd Gangplank is kinda...over the top, I&#039;d say. Him scrimshawing a living man&#039;s bones for betraying him? Okay, I guess, it shows that he&#039;s sadistic. This apparently being his common punishment for hurting him in some way?  Kinda just goes over the top.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-07-24T00:33:31.427+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune's big thing is that she is beautiful. Look up her lore\n\n\nAnd the intense description is just a matter of taste. I personally greatly enjoy a book or story with good description in it, and as it appears, so does the author/supervising editor of the Bilgewater stories. You don't, but as I said, it's all just a matter of taste.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-07-24T00:49:38.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering that we just got told that MF's isn't just going to be 'batting here eyelashes at the men' the fact the first thing she does in this story is look really pretty isn't a good sign.

As in, she's like that in front of most people, so they can have one opinion of her, that beautiful little girl who shakes her hips and knows how to have fun.  She is known for using her charm and looks to get things she wants, so what happened is reasonable.\n\nEspecially since it appeared that once one of her crew appeared, she left the tavern using htat \"smile\" of hers, then suddenly became very **VERY** serious.  Not only that, but TF felt like him and Graves were somehow set up during Act I.\n\nIt appears that Miss Fortune may have actually set that chain of events up herself.\n\nShe's BW's best bounty hunter.  She just got Graves, T.F., and GP all in one small area together.  All of them done a bunch of crimes and deeds to earn a high bounty upon each of their heads.\n\nSo, yeah. The first thing she did was \"look pretty\", but that's more for show like how GP's whole scrimshawing thing seems less like \"Hey, I'ma kill everybody because I'm a dark sadistic mofo\" and more because \"Well, this was how I was raised by me dad, this is the life I'm in.  Not doing it for the fun as much as to make sure things are done...'properly'.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-07-24T00:57:30.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm aware.
