It had the same issues that Acts 1 and 2 had (Graves being &#039;spent like an exhausted shotgun shell&#039;, for example, is more annoying than cute. I&#039;m not sure if it was a good idea to have MF&#039;s entire backstory explained in her section; it pulled me out of the story to have her go &#039;by the way, this is why I hate Gangplank&#039; at the time, probably not the best idea.) but I liked it just the same.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone actually think Riot&#039;s gonna keep GP dead? Either he managed to survive somehow, or he&#039;s going to get resurrected. They&#039;re not gonna give him a rework that drastic and then kill him off a week later. Personally, my money&#039;s on &#039;he shows up next harrowing has Spooky Gangplank&#039;, what does anyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-07-29T23:08:17.022+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That bastard is more hard that a tortoise that just ate an hard bastard.
