For example, in the comments to the Gnar announcements, it shows the entire text, as well as the formatting. This means I have to scroll down the entire Gnar post in order to see Phreak's comment. I also have noticed that occasionally the 'quote' section doesn't show the correct post, instead showing the original comment thread that the post was replying too.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2014-07-29T22:42:52.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1.  It's definitely an annoyance, but I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually!","replies":[]}]}
