No reason to play League my friends. I just spent $30 on skins and loot items, perma banned for cussing......\r\n\r\nWhy would you play a game that you have the chance to be perma banned for cussing a few times in one game that you happen to have majority of that game reporting you beause one kid says in /all chat \"Troll Ezreal, report him, he is toxic and sucks balls\". So riot will allow you be called an idiot, loser, stupid, r%%%%%ed, dumb shit and still be the one to be perma banned......??????\r\n\r\nI am not going to rant. I only want to post this to inform future or already playing summoners about how this game will put you down fater than you downloaded this games client. \r\n\r\nWhen you think you are getting better at the game and decide to charge that credit card for a cool new skin because you think you are good at a champion, some slick new god loving person starts the game and reports you for saying a cuss word that the god loving summoner decides to report for saying words that they CHOSE to un filter, gets you permabanned. Great. $30 dollars wasted because you said some words someone didnt want to hear but still MADE THE SELECTION IN THE OPTIONS TO NOT FILTER CUSS WORDS! Feels good right? Not really. Start a new account, get over it. You think you are doing fine and reformed (although you had to start a new account to prove yoruself) but nope, another god loving person doesnt like how you pinged them 10 tiems and said they need to get better, banned or maybe you get lucky and get warned! Great, ill tiptoe. Oh look, you got 10 deaths because your support is KSing and leaving you solo in lane againts 2 champs. So you get a little frustrated and ask your support to help \"F** you, you are bad\" says the support. You dont report because like you he is frustrated and you know its nothing to do with him being threatening or anything like that, besides, he is 1000miles away for all you know. Nope, that same kid reported you and screamed to all chat to report you, you respond trying to defend your character and yet another ban.  Will you continue to play this game and create another account. Of course, you like the gameplay and how it challenges you but, 200$ later you feel like your account is set, nothing can stop your climb. To be dissapointed by another god loving person who reports you for 2 bad words and there goes your $200 and months of playing. \r\n\r\nLook, all i am saying here is that no matter who you are and what you believe in, you will be reported for some minor crap that hurts one persons feelings and soon that will be your problem. So if you cant keep your fingers off the keyboard and play the most \"lack of communication\" game in the world, this isnt the game for you. It will only dissapioint you in the end. \r\n\r\nMy advise is to never spend a penny on this game. Work your way up by playing and getting S's and get everything you have from game play. That way when you get the innevitable ban, you wont be so dissapointed in the game you love so much and grow the balls to never play again, so  this company can realize the foreseen future, as all other games in the world have suffered, a fall from catering to the complacive gamer that will never be happy until they can be completely silent and report his way to the top. \r\n\r\nAll video games have suffered game progression for a hand full of complaining customers that more than likely never paid any money to play or be apart of the game they complain so much about. It is the computer game virus, disease, parasite of complaining MINORITY that rules your game and what it becomes.  Look at all games in the past, MMO-MOBA's, they all make changes based on what the most complaints are and that forces game companys to cater to those individuals to \"appeal to the majority\" but soon to realize that the changes made to keep those small numbers happy, left your most devoted and hard core players to abandon a so called \"respectable\" game.  Good luck Riot for this game will suffer the same fate of all games before it. People will force your game to be what they want and give them the feeling of power over the player base they play with. They will get your company to blindly give them the power to manipulate the game community and then run it to the ground with the same powers you have given to your community. You think that it helps to get rid of bad players but you soon will realize that this form of customer shunting is what will be your downfall and another games uprising.  Change is the worst thing any game can do, especially when it comes to player behavior. There is a fine line between awareness of the inevitable and accepting it.  Same goes for personal harassment. You know in real life that someone is being sarcastic, but this is not reality, nobody can tell how someone is being or projecting their feelings. Therefore your punishments are subjective and hold no true value as to what verbal messages are actually threatening or considered beyond normal behavior.\r\n\r\nREMOVE the ability to cuss period. No option to mute cussing or show astrics to cover up someone saying a \"bad word\" or better yet, just all around stop trying to control how people communicate, negative or positive. Give the power to the community to MUTE (oh you do but still ban players) or better yet just make any cussing messages never make it through the message system. Why is allowing people to type these messages allowed in game, period. Because you WANT to ban people. Because you want to cater to the individuals that feel \"hurt\" or being FORCED to see astrics or half finished cuss words so that they feel it is necessary, that they have an obligation to take matters in to thier own hands (i mind you, giving power to your player base to punish other players is distracting to the game play at hand and negates your games priorities and adds a new objective to the actual game play).\r\n\r\nDone. Get a grip on reality before you punish your Clients, Customers, Players, Summoners for trying to enjoy a game but also being indirectly forced to defend thier character while trying to also play the game at hand.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Hot Shoto","date":"2019-06-20T05:13:12.321+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't get banned for cussing. You can say fuck as many times as you fucking want and Riot doesn't give a giant fuck at fucking all. Fuck.\n\nWhat you can't do is swear at others. Going, \"fuck this Ezreal\" or \"fuck this stupid bitch\" will get you punished. So saying you got punished for swearing means you've been swearing at others and Riot punished you for it. And unless you used a ZT word/phrase, you've had at least one chat restriction and one 14 day ban before your perma. You knew a perma was up next, but still chose to ignore that warning.\n\nThrowing out how much money you spent doesn't do anything, by the way. Spending money doesn't make you look like a God or mean that you should be above the law. Break the rules, get punished. You broke the rules and got punished.","replies":[{"poster":"HliNtsev","date":"2019-06-20T06:05:54.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":15,"body":"Yeah your rant means nothing in this thread.

I have never once been chat restricted, and cursing is a fairly common part of my in-game language. The trick is that there's a *big* difference between \"Fuck, that was a close one. Shit could have been *bad* if you hadn't come in. Nice job!\" and \"Fuck you, you stupid piece of shit.\" The former will *never* get you punished, and the latter will *reliably* get you punished.\n\nThe filter also doesn't work to stop toxic behavior. You can call someone \"a nasty not-smart guy who should go lie in front of a train\" without using a *single*  filtered word, and that statement is a lot worse than \"Fuck, we almost had him there.\" The reason for the filter is just that there are some players who don't *like* seeing curse words, and this allows them to avoid that. The filter does not (and realistically *cannot*) be a tool to allow you to avoid toxicity, for reasons expressed above.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-20T04:26:39.878+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you had any other punishments?","replies":[{"poster":"HliNtsev","date":"2019-06-20T04:55:20.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":12,"body":"This post is not to signify whether the ban was righteous or justified.

It seems that most players that are introverts will have a higher success rate and players who are extroverts will experience more problems progressing because of their ability to attempt to communicate, negatively or positively.

You are a bigot and nobody in the world says those things indirectly....actually people do. If you never have been general with a strong word like the F word, then you are not human. All people use these words to express strong feelings toward an incident that happened but, it does not mean that it was directed toward an individual unless, it is signified by saying F you Riven. Only then can you justify punishment on an individual for being direct with his comment.  These things the tribunal and quite frankly all summoners do not put into consideration when reporting \"bad behavior\"...why? Because once again it can be a number of things. Report him because I am butt hurt.....Report him because I fed his lane and I have to have a counter report just in case riot reviews his report (just maybe, oh no, report back, report first)…..Report him because I don't like cuss words (yeah but my filter is off because I want to know when someone is spelling cuss words right so I know when to really report)…..the list can go on for ages with examples of how and why people report for small things like outbursts for their own mistakes ie: \"SHit! I made a mistake.
