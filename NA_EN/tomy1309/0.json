Somehow I still can forge keys and open chests but I can't advance my mastery level on a champion.

It might help me ID what's causing it. Also, a quick fix you could try that usually helps with Loot is a Client Repair from the Settings menu. Try that out, and if it's still a problem afterward hit me up with those screens. :)","replies":[{"poster":"tomy1309","date":"2017-08-06T20:32:54.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client repair from the settings menu that you suggested worked perfectly.
