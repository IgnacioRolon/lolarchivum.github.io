NA soloq is way too troll for me and I don&#039;t wanna play here anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know hispanic ppl generally have more pride so I am assuming they really try hard in ranked and never give up or troll pick in ranked. But this is all assumptions can someone who actually plays there tell me what its like?","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-06T23:52:12.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has no experience on any server except NA, but plenty of internet experience in general, i can safely assure you that any other server will probably be better than trolololNA.\n\nOn the occasions i have met groups of spanish-speaking (united states and mexican, i assume some other central american) players in online games, i have rarely seen them trolling, spamming shit in chat or generally being morons, but kids will always be kids, anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunslinger7x","date":"2016-11-07T04:10:10.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Screw it I always wanted to put my high school spanish to use and I want out of this shthole in NA. I dont care about losing I just get pissed off that ppl in NA troll in ranked way too much and give up so damn quick. Rarely have I ever found myself in a legit try hard match where we give it all we got till we lose. I love those types of games but when you have dumbfuks going ap soraka mid/ ad galios or the dreadful low elo yasuos who go 0-10 in the early game then rage quit it just makes it not even worth trying to play this game at all. Better to try another server.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-11-07T20:14:24.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speak not of the low elo yasuo.\n\nTBH i started having a lot more fun when i realized ranked is pointless, and just went back to playing normal games. Since then i have improved a lot and spent a lot less time rolling my face on my keyboard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
