Sure, riot implemented the whole \"leave buster\" system. Well, it works but what do the players who lose all that lp get? Nothing. Riot added the whole \"remake\" system. Alright, someone can just AFK literally five minutes into the game. Players who have to endure this bullshit should get some compensation and not lose 18-20 fucking LP because of a bunch of screw ups. Take this game for example, Morg went AFK. Kindred's solution, instead of actually TRYING, was to feed purposely. Brand was no help either, but he did not do it on purpose. If I get an A+ in a game like this, even a S+ or a S...I should get a reduction in LP loss. Climbing lower elos is already bad enough with dynamic queue. Now you have these people who leave a game after 1 death like this isnt silver elo. I dont care what anyone says, there was no possible way for one person to carry against this. Not trying to be negative I just dont want to win a game, get some LP then lose a game like this and lose MORE LP than I originally got. It's a fucking terrible system and riot knows it. Maybe I'm just tilted. {{item:3070}} {{champion:92}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Queen Crownguard","date":"2016-07-02T18:37:35.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's also this gem from today. http://imgur.com/Exv1Nvw\nDo I really have to lose 20 LP from this kind of shit????

Its possible, I've done it, but its hard. \n\nUnfortunately lp loss is part of the deal. People have been asking for something to reduce the loss of lp but most things people suggest I could figure out a way to abuse it within 30 seconds or it would significantly increase toxicity.  \n\nOn the flip side there are systems that could work that are hard to abuse but they usually are restricted by some aspect of the game.  Take the new /remake system.  Its limited to the first 3 min and no first blood just to make sure people can't abuse it.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPharmD","date":"2016-06-27T12:32:58.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make the AFK/his premade lose 100% of the lp for the team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dangerous Man","date":"2016-06-27T12:26:11.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if somebody goes 0/10 and AFKs you just remake a lost game regardless of if they were AFK or not.\nSo they can't do that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-06-27T06:26:14.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a fun game, Every game you play with an afk for the next month check down if the afk is on your team or the enemy's team and record the lp loss/win as well.
