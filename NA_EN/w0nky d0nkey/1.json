Since the server move I have lived in 2 places with 3 different ISP's. I lived in Anaheim (getting low 60's), then to the mountains in San Bernardino (getting mid/high 60's), changing my ISP to a newly added private Fiber company in the area didn't change my ping but this last week it just dropped to mid 50's. Super rad! But why? Was it something on Riot's end or should I be sending a gift basket to my ISP thanking them?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-31T21:46:11.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most likely your ISP figured out something wasn't working up to speed and fixed the issue. Haven't made any connection changes on our end recently AFAIK. It can also be pretty normal for your ping to fluctuate a bit like this. \n\nEither way, heck yea!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0nky d0nkey","date":"2017-11-04T07:08:04.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! It's a small ISP and the connection just got up and running a few months ago, so most likely they have been figuring stuff out. XD","replies":[]}]}]}
