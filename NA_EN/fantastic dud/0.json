AND I feel that mord beacus of his uniquness is one of the champions that u can   identnify league with.  so for the sake of {{champion:82}}  upvote this so that riot hears our voice.\r\nps: u can add a reason why u like/dont like the rework that he is having, and maybe an advice to keep mord&#039;s identity as a solo tanky mage","replies":[{"poster":"OperationDEEZ1","date":"2015-08-07T14:59:03.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the direction of the rework.\nFor those of you who aren't aware, CertainlyT did attempt to make a bot lane ADC replacement prior to this. {{champion:157}} .\nThis is essentially Round 2 for CertainlyT.

Alot of whats being tested helps make him feel more like a character i can identify with.
