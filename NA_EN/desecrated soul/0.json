All I want is a little more information than just \"We are aware of issues with Clubs, and are working on a fix.\" Why is Riot having such a hard time fixing this? I run a fairly large chat club at 36 members and growing. This club is invaluable in keeping us all connected and always providing a list of friends to play ranked with. It also consistently requires friendship, cooperation, and a non-toxic environment for all members.\r\n\r\nIt's been a week and chat clubs aren't fixed. Can you please give me some kind of status update on this. I've been playing League for almost 5 years, and you guys at Riot usually fix things pretty quickly. I'm just wondering.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-21T04:53:08.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't provide any additional information other than we actually are working on a fix and will deploy it as soon as it's ready. \n\nI hope that works as an answer for now.
