When I launch the client and log in, everything seems to be running normal. Tabbing between the Home/Profile/Collection/Loot/Store tabs goes relatively smoothly. The issue becomes when I actually want to get into a game. Pressing the Play button and selecting a game mode takes a few seconds to go to the next screen. Upon hitting Confirm and going to the Lobby to add team mates or just find a match, it takes roughly 10 seconds for my banner to show up. When a game has been found and the enter match button pops up, the timer is roughly 75% completed before I'm actually able to click the button. Now since I play ARAM most of the time, a champion is already pre selected so I don't have to worry about this as much, but in the 60 second time limit that you have to change summoner spells, masteries, runes, trade, or re-roll, it takes 40 seconds before I can actually interact with those options let alone even see what champion I ended up with. Once finally in game there are no issues to report. Game runs as smoothly as it did before with no changes to frames and ping.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T20:26:33.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be having a few issues with some of the suped up graphics on the updated client.

If you go into the client options there's a new feature called low-spec mode which should be able to help you make those adjustments and interact with the champion select screen a little easier.
