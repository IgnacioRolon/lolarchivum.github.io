So, even though E looks like an underwhelming skill, it kinda grants a whole sixth item of stats when GP is full build. Has this been considered while balancing the new GP? \n\nA last curiosity of mine is: while reworking him, do you aim at making him a viable pick (perhaps even in competitive play) or your primary concern is to keep his piratesque identity while giving his kit a more modern façade?\n\n{{champion:41}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eyrgos","date":"2015-05-31T21:45:05.219+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=VGttfp8P,comment-id=000400010000,timestamp=2015-05-31T07:57:02.736+0000)\n>\n> We're giving him a new E, rather than gutting the power from the current one.
