If you aren't a melee who can punish him by fighting for a long time you lost. Previously before his rework every melee used to lose. Now if you're {{champion:24}}  and darius pulls you, press E to dodge his potential W, Q if he tries to run to he doesn't give you one stack+50% more damage with Q.  He Can't slow your attack speed like before, if you baited his heal he will take 5 seconds to stack 5 stacks including his W reseting his AA. with 5 seconds you can dish out 1000 damage+ with jax and of course with items since you are a carry","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ladrac","date":"2015-09-23T17:59:07.258+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"True.

So, you gotta engage after he used his silence(on your or an minion while in lane) because his E won't deal too much damage, just if he build ad. The ability that a lot of people fear is his ult. Oh, so you're low hp and you still remain in lane after Garen hit lvl 6. Cry me more about his ult xD His ult is a finishing one, so when you're low just recall.\nDarius has weak cc too...just slow. He doesn't have an escape, so gank him early If you're going with 30% hp to gank Darius, then don't cry about another nerfs for him. In teamfight if he's building ad or bruiser he'll die fast.

It might suck to get pushed under turret but he's in a worse spot.\n\nIf you dodge the blade he only has his W to apply an extra bleed stack as an AA reset in between his mediocre attack speed autos. He will take at least 5-6 seconds to apply 5 stack this way. Yes his auto's are that slow, go into a custom game and try it.\n\n3 abilities that apply bleed?

Riot designed him for that... they want him to be a reasonable threat in teamfights since his dueling is gutted. He can get his passive easy in teamfights if he dunk on someone low that mistakenly stayed too in for too long. And if his opponents don't back off a bit so that his passive can wear off he can deal a lot of damage to them if he isn't kitted correctly. This is completely intended. \n\nJust because he is stronger with his passive up he doesn't mean he gain anymore movespeed or dashes he is still simple enough to kite in a teamfight as just throwing a semi heavy slow his way.

If Darius is trying to trade with you in lane, effing walk towards him, and if he walks further away then you just got a free card walking the other way and not taking any damage. If he goes towards you, woop de effing do you are in the half-damage range and he doesn't get the heal or even a stack of Hemmorhage. Let Darius keep his heal, 12% on a single target is nothing. I don't see anyone here complaining about Karma's Mantra W healing her for a good 20%, twice, with a scaling AP ratio, and snaring as well as dealing damage. Ya'll complain about Darius's Q in lane when you have to realize, it's far weaker than some other abilities out there.\n\nLet's do a bit of comparisons.\n\nAt level 1, it deals a nice 20 + 50% total ad. With no AD runes, OH NO 50 DAMAGE! (If you are smart, you will try your best to dodge the blade, and if you don't try to dodge the blade you literally lost all rights of complaint.) Not to mention you even end up with only a measly 100 damage at level 1. I can think of several skills taken by top laners that deal over 100 damage. Renekton's W (90 damage plus 140% total attack damage, even more when empowered oh and it stuns and Renekton has no mana), or how about Rumble's Flamespitter, that casually hits for 39 every second when it is empowered (ignoring it's AP ratio of 50% every second) all at rank 1. Darius's Q doesn't even scale well early game compared to the other two, first of all Renekton's W gains flat damage per hit and scales on total AD so his base damage is always making it that much more powerful, and Rumble's Q just increases and increases in power way more than most other normal abilities in the game. Do I think Renekton and Rumble are op? Not really but they are good comparisons. Darius's Q just simple grows in a small bit of raw damage, and then more percentage of his AD as damage.\n\nI'd type more here, as I have more points but I covered the largest thing people are complaining about, his Q. I'll leave a little TL;DR at the bottom for the exceptionally lazy.\n\nDo I think Darius needs a nerf? Not really. He's fine as he is and I never have troubles with him until teamfight phase happens and I realize my team has nothing to stop him (low cc mostly melee as people have pointed out before)\n\nTL;DR\nDarius's Q is not super op, other champions have over-all better abilities that aren't even avoidable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DogIsGod","date":"2015-09-23T19:11:00.520+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"LoLKiru","date":"2015-09-23T19:55:56.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DogIsGod,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HfeFjcgr,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-09-23T19:11:00.520+0000)\n>\n> Yes, please.\n\nTo be more accurate, he would probably be WORSE than pre-rework Darius (albeit with a better lategame, but no real way of taking advantage of it since he'd just die too quickly).\n\nMostly due to the things he gave up in exchange for becoming what he is now; most notably the loss of damage on his Q, the delay it now has, the fixed pull, a good chunk of his dueling potential, as well as having the 6th worst AS in the entire game (well, its the 4th ~ 6th lowest, Jinx, Bard, and Darius actually have equal AS stats, Jinx raises hers through building AS though, as well as the steroid on her minigun)\n\nTo actually still compete without a heal, he'd need some pretty sizable buffs, at the very least he'd probably need his AS reverted to pre-rework Darius levels (allowing him to stack his passive on you faster; which would allow his passive to remain good in duels without him having a heal), maybe a buff to Q's damage as well.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=DrNova,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HfeFjcgr,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-09-23T19:31:52.310+0000)\n>\n> I'm just saying cramming a random heal into a champ and calling him viable is shitty champ design.\n\nI mean to be honest, you kind of need sustain to be a good melee champ (unless you have another way to avoid damage; but even then most people who do build sustain anyway, notably people like Fiora, Yi, Yasuo*; mostly Melee carries)\n\nBear in mind Darius isn't actually tanky comparatively, He doesn't have anything to help him tank damage in his kit; all he has is damage, damage and more damage, so to survive later on, he needs sustain (if he actually had something in his kit to help him survive better, that might not be the case, but we may never know; in that case I'd imagine he'd just build sustain anyway to help him tank longer); good comparison is Garen honestly, while he doesn't have sustain (in combat anyway); he has a skill that allows him to take greatly reduced damage for a duration.\n\n\n*Note, Yasuo doesn't really prioritize sustain, but it is still built on him fairly often if the game goes on long enough.\n\nTL;DR: Unless you have another way of avoiding damage (Yasuo, Riven, Fiora, Yi), or your inherently tanky (E.g: Wukong, Garen, Malphite, etc) you basically NEED sustain to function as a melee, its just the fact that your going to take a ton of damage just from being in melee range that causes this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-09-25T12:19:39.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DogIsGod,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HfeFjcgr,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-09-23T19:11:00.520+0000)\n>\n> Yes, please.\n\npre rework darius used to win against every melee with his attack speed slow and insta Q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Old Man Teeto","date":"2015-09-25T12:29:21.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius has and always will be a \"Can't fight, avoid\" champion.\n\nWhen this variety works, we all cry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faded Lich","date":"2015-09-25T12:14:30.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No op..We don't hate him NOW, plenty of us have hated him since he was released because his kit is not a good kit and is completely frustrating to touch or go up against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenix Kotori ","date":"2015-09-24T19:10:57.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am fine with him having a heal.\n\nI am not fine with him having a heal at the current potency and frequency for said heal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Aishi","date":"2015-09-24T19:02:56.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just wish i could have pre rework darius back... \n\nhe used to be a sustainless splitpushing duelist and they turned him into a teamfighting draintank.... they completely destroyed his identity and did a 180 spin on his role in a teamcomp.
