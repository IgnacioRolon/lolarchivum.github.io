Jungle Sion might max other things first, but E was always best for laning.","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-18T23:11:11.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, just never max W, the only thing it does is increase the mana cost and give 10 more damage. It scales almost entirely off of HP, and getting early damage from either Q or E is a much better option.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Guy Fox Teemo","date":"2015-03-18T21:37:31.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"well they've buffed sion for almost every patch now for a while, he didn't really get nerfed just his power was shifted from his E to his Q, which is great, a tank really shouldn't have a 300 damage long skill shot that slows you just because you hit a minon with it.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-18T23:00:53.730+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except he lacks the mobility to threaten an all-in, so without poke, he loses lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-03-18T23:03:13.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair (and I play a *lot* of Sion), he needs a little bit of a love tap like they are giving him. He is REALLY strong if you practice with him, and most people don't realize just how much damage his E does, especially considering it shreds armor and makes it very hard to dodge his Q (which together means that his Q deals a lot more damage if you E first). As long as they don't touch its utility, it will be fine and Sion will not be weak. \n\nAdditionally, Sion jungle (where I play him most) is disgustingly strong right now (I'd say stronger than Sejuani, but that's personal bias talking) because his W in combination with Cinderhulk allows him to ramp up really, REALLY fast in the jungle now, since he gets 65 bonus health for every clear now (up from 52), not counting buffs or scuttle crab or lane tax. The way they buffed his Q and nerfed his E last patch also made jungle Sion even stronger, since you max Q in jungle, not E. I wouldn't be surprised if they made his Q cost 50 or 55 mana instead of 45 after this E nerf, because he basically never goes oom in the jungle even when spamming every ability on every camp.\n\nSion is *very* good right now and the little nerf they are giving him is warranted, and I am surprised their aren't more.\n\nThat said, I'm disappointed their are no Irelia nerfs this patch, because she is also really strong in top lane and has been for a while, where Sion is only just on the fringe of competitive until recently.","replies":[]}]}]}
