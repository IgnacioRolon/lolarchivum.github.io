With Black Cleaver, he's also really good at shredding the enemy's armor with judgement.\n\nOlaf has an issue with fast moving targets, and especially ranged targets, so his E doesn't come into play nearly as often as you'd expect.\n\nTrundle might do well because he's a stat thief and a pretty meaty bruiser besides. His ult steals at least 20% of the target's max HP and up to 40% of their armor and magic resist, and his Q (which comes up a LOT more often than Olaf's E) steals attack damage, procs on-hit effects, and hits pretty damn hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2015-01-20T03:24:13.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius? Lol no. He's a early game lane bully and thats about it. Terrible at team fights compared to more versatile tanks like Renekton, Nasus, and even Zac.\n\nOlaf? He can be but he is in need of a buff to his ult duration inorder to become relevant.","replies":[]}]}
