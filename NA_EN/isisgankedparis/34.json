Champions like Lee Sin, Zed, and Vayne also get brought up as champions who require a great deal of mechanical skill to use to full effect. \n\nYes,but for every single one of those said mechanical skill comes from the fact that your abilities simply need to be used fast,it's not artificial the way it is with riven,non of them has a mechanic which can be made automatic without removing decision making and options,riven does.\n\n> Why should anyone care about what you arbitrarily think belongs in League of Legends?\n\nBecause games are built with certain intentions,league is made to be focused on decision making and teamplay,mortal kombat is built on clicking keys in a certain order(and a lot of other things,but that's not the point)/\n\n> You're repeating yourself. What about mechanical skill bothers you so much?\n\nMechanical skill is fine,artifical mechanical skill,that which is there for no reason,that is something else entirely,hell,why do you think this game has an option to quick cast? why not test the abilities of players to click fast here too?\n\nit doesn't belong in the game,even dota added quick cast to it.\n\nOnce again,you can always just make the option of auto cancelling animations optional(like quick cast),so that people can still play mortal kombat riven if they want to,you just won't be forcing it on people who don't want to.\n\n> \"You\" lol.\n> \n> I'll let you in on a little secret: \n> \n> I main {{champion:122}}.\n> \n> I have played Riven in normals I think like seven times.

In lower elos however, >with lower skilled players, Riven would become an invincible pub stomper who made lower level players cry.\n\nfirst of all,that's a lot of guessing,this could very easily not happen,riven has other things increasing her skillcap aside from needing to mash keys in a certain way for extra power.\n\n> So why do you want to lower Riven's skill floor and buff her numbers?\n\nBecause skill floor/cap should not be artificial,if it doesn't create more decisions to be made,remove it,it does not belong in this game.\n\nA good comparison(which someone else made somewhere,I forgot) would be to reduce karthus ult damage by 25%,but make it deal 40% extra damage if he types \"Roit pls grant me more damages for this ult of mine\" while channeling,think what kind of support such a proposal will get. does it increase his skillcap? sure.\nIs it completely retarded? definitely,these sort of mechanics do not belong in this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2015-06-25T22:30:50.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I understand the difference between \"mechanical skill\" and \"artificially enforced mechanical skill\"?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2015-06-24T11:58:46.399+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":6,"body":"Biased \" If Riven could not combo, she'd be shit tier\" opinions are biased.\n\nHow many players knows how to cancel animation? 20-30% of Riven players?\nSo you say 70-80% that don't know this trick are trash tier?","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2015-06-24T13:19:46.501+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Animation cancelling is not hard at all, provided you have stable ping.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Feathermane","date":"2015-06-24T07:55:39.590+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would argue the opposite.
