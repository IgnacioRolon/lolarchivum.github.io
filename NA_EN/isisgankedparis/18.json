Seeing someone who has either never been picked before or not been picked in a long time.\n\nRemember when Swain was picked in LCS a while ago? Shit gave me goosebumps to FINALLY see a Swain in LCS and see how he played.\n\nPoppy was used in LCS and I lost my shit that she was being played in LCS.\n\nRemember when Darius was used in LCS? Season 2 early Season 3, hasn't been used in LCS since(to my knowledge) and I wish to see if he will be used top.\n\nRemember the resurgence of Kog'Maw along with Maokai and Alistar being used in LCS again? That was great to see those guys again.\n\nBut we don't want to see those guys spammed for the next 30 or so games because 70% of the roster isn't viable enough to be used in pro play.\n\nWhy can Dota 2 have almost every champ viable enough for pro play but league only has 30 at one time with 15 of them being always used no matter what?","replies":[{"poster":"Killer X 12","date":"2015-02-02T09:06:43.359+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":2,"body":"My issues with LCS (from someone who has been watching on and off since season 3)\n\nSame champs are picked all the time (within a certain meta)\n\nSame champs are banned every single game (hey, maybe there is an issue with these champs...)\n\nPro players are Good...so the games are boring.

DotA does have more heroes that get picked once or twice, but the DotA meta is just as much about the same picks every game as the LoL meta.\n\nRight now, I'm pretty unhappy with jungle diversity, especially since Riot made a big set of claims on that topic for the preseason.  The different playstyle enabling jungle items so far do nothing and we're seeing only bruiser/duelist/initiator junglers see picks.  Everywhere else I'm honestly quite comfortable; I don't really care to see random new stuff every day, and just want a healthy meta where a decent variety of playstyles can be seen.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Devout","date":"2015-02-02T15:58:35.905+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just need to wrap their mind with their bruiser/tank/fighter dilemma, otherwise we will always have 2 types of champion in the jungle: whoever is overloaded in the current patch, and LeeSin+Elise.\n\nIf tank items are too good, fighters become too good with just one tank item and offense.\nIf tank items aren't good enough, tank don't get picked at all because they can't soak enough damage (exceptions are champion who have %damage reduction, such as Alistar Mao'kai and Braum).\nI'd say they need a way to differentiate fighters from tanks, and to allow champions who want to focus disruption and crowd control to survive through at least half teamfight.\nOtherwise, teams who need cc will just pick whoever ranged mage can land some cc from  a safe range.","replies":[{"poster":"Subject 5","date":"2015-02-02T16:16:48.517+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://puu.sh/fnn2r/9224cd4d7a.png\n\nElise is not overloaded and never really has been considering she has two kits, unless if you want to consider everybody who has more than one kit overloaded which kind of throws out logic XD.
