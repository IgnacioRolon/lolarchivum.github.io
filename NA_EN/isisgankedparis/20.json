It's extremely unlikely, if not mathematically, *provably* impossible, for them to do the same against someone who has more than one Armor item.\n\nLet's just say, theoretically, that I had a person with 200 Armor along with this Ninja Tabi's 25% DR. Now, accounting for Last Whisper and the ArPen mastery, my effective armor is 122, giving me about 55% physical resistance. 55% scaled multiplicatively with 25% means I actually have a total effective resistance of 66.2%, which is effectively the same resistance as if I had 196 Armor.\n\nSo I've all but negated their ArPen.

This is like saying Doom and Call of Duty can't both be called First-Person Shooters, because they have entirely different mechanics (y'know, aside from the pretty central \"use gun on man\" bit).\n\nI will not be so blind as to ignore the differences that make them both entirely different games, but I also will not ignore the similarities.\n> there are no carries in lol actualy \n\n\"What are Late-game Champions?\" for $100\n\n1) Marksmen *tend to* have a weak early-game that requires the assistance of a second champion--usually a Support or Tank, although Mages aren't alien to the job--in order to safely spend the first 10 minutes or so of the match farming minion waves for gold and XP. There are maybe three Marksmen you could viably take in the top lane (not counting Teemo) without a support to keep them alive, depending on the match-up, but the increased vulnerability to jungle ganks still makes it less than preferable.\nAfter said 10-15 minute \"Laning Phase,\" they still need to follow a teammate to be safe, but they are a much more significant damage threat than most. By the time they hit the 40-minute/5-item mark, they (mostly) have the highest sustained damage potential, and if given 5 seconds on a target, will leave a larger dent than anyone else on their team.\n\n2) Not only are most (if not all) Marksmen strong by late-game, there are several Fighters, Mages, and even a couple Tanks with late-game strength. They don't have the damage output of Marksmen, but they usually have more utility or AoE as a replacement for pure single-target damage.\n\n3) Damage naturally out-scales defense potential, because *every defense build has 2 scalars to increase, while magic offense has 3 and physical offense has 4*\n\nAP-based champions have AP, CDR and Magic Pen.\nAD-based champions have AD, AS, Armor Pen and Crits.\nDefense, whether physical or magic, has Resistance and Health.\n\nLet me show this with a very simplified version of the math behind it. Let's say you have a total of 12 to distribute between these modifiers.\n\nPhysical offense has 1 x 1 x 1 x 1\nMagical offense has 1 x 1 x 1\nDefense has 1 x 1\n\nIf you distribute as evenly as possible, you get the following results;\n\n4 x 4 x 4 x 4 = 256\n5 x 5 x 5 = 125\n7 x 7 = 49\n\nNow, obviously, the math is a little more complex than that, *but the concept is that offense has more multipliers than defense. For this reason, offense will always, eventually out-scale defense.* Riot has defense values scaled such that early defense boosts are stronger than early offense boosts, but not so much that they have a chance to match or beat offense in strength.\n\n**I do agree that defense itemization needs some buffing.** Between the increase in anti-tank items *combined with* the nerfs to defense items, defense is falling behind a bit sooner than it should. Not by much, but enough that it needs just the slightest boost.\n\nStill, the fact that Offense > Defense in the late game is *by design,* not by accident.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight SoIaire ","date":"2014-12-26T20:50:42.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"What are Late-game Champions?\" for $100\n\ntell me that when you will get soloed by lvl 18 renekton \nhes sloppy but capable of that (assuming you dont pick one of those infinite kiting carries)\n\nour carries are much weaker than dota carries and the diference in roles or imporrtance of kiting for them makes things more even","replies":[{"poster":"JustMyBassCannon","date":"2014-12-26T21:10:24.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hagane No Arashi,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fMaAmH7E,comment-id=0003000000010000000000000000000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-26T20:50:42.889+0000)\n>\n> tell me that when you will get soloed by lvl 18 renekton\n\nRemind me when I let a level 18 Renekton solo me.\n\nI don't tend to play Marksmen, but when I do, it's usually Draven because he's actually fun for me.
