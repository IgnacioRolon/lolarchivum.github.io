I'm a Sup/Jg main so these changes do little to me, but even I can understand the reactions people are having.  \n\n\nThe ADC early game is so powerful currently that it is actually better to run 4ADC due to the CC boosts.  They get a ton of Lifesteal, CD by building crit and they solve mana issues all with 1 item, they take reduced damage, mallet is now cost effective for the perma ranged slow, 20% dmg taken is put into bleed which prevents them being taken down easily + a 12% damage reduction item. \n\nYes, you can experiment how this works with bruisers and if they can abuse it (despite having range disadvantage or all the new cc/kits adc got) But it still sits, that unless you can 100-0 an Adc (mages cant do this anymore mid-late due to increased costs on ap and all the MR items that are super viable for adc) an Adc will out duel you and kite you to death.   All it takes is frozen mallet for an adc to stop bruisers abusing the new items because they cant get in range + ranged champions get a movement speed boost when Orb walking and all flat % move is removed from most Ad items. \n\nSo unless they are going to remove item passives to rework half of them or increase gold cost of these items by 200-600 (for first 1-2 tiers, same cost at final item) to balance the gold efficiency so it's not OP first item against everyone, this change is just like Mord's.
