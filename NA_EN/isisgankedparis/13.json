I mean, are you saying that they ult the plants and not the people the plants are attacking? Why would she do that when she could just ult the enemies too? I don't get what the heck you're asking.\n\nZyra isn't overloaded. She does the exact same thing in the exact same way as any other utility mage. The only slightly unique things about her are the plants and the passive, and the plants tend to just do the exact same thing as standard nukes, and usually in the exact same way too. If she's overloaded, then I'm going to say that everyone else except Annie, Warwick and Galio is too.\n\nPeople circlejerk about the CertainlyT thing way too much.

If you just list kit elements, you can make almost anyone sounds overloaded or OP. I\n\nAnd seriously, if you are going to use that argument, pick someone other than Maokai. Maokai does most things well nowadays. He deals with all situations quite well. That's something I'd call overloaded much more readily than I would call Darius' kit overloaded.\n\nDarius nukes at close range, and is worthless outside of it. His close range prowess is not due to any specific mechanics. It is due to numbers. Numerically, no one can outtrade him. The only differentiating mechanics he has are the ult and the pull, and that is not enough for me to call him overloaded. He does 1-2 things well and fails at most other things. That lack of potential is not what being overloaded is. Thresh and Yasuo are overloaded because when they are strong, they are the best at almost everything. Darius has many things he is terrible at, no matter how strong he is. His weaknesses are not lowered or mediated by any part of his kit.\n\nZyra has skillshot nukes and some CC. It's the same as Lux, Ori, or any other utility mage. There is nothing significant differentiating her from any of them. The turrets mean pretty much nothing different from any standard nuke. You use them in exactly the same way and they do exactly the same thing as any other nuke. That's not overloaded, it's a different way of doing the exact same thing. Overloaded means you have more options, not the same option wearing a slightly different hat.\n\nCertainlyT has produced a few overloaded champions for sure.

He is in fact, one of the best champs to be able to outplay, or get outplayed.\n\nWhen you play against Darius you think, how can I bait out his hook, or his Q. Can I lead him into a careful jungle gank? I'm squishy. How much can I poke Darius before I have to dodge his grab. How much mana does Darius have left?\n\nCompare that to pre-nerf  Gnar.\n\nHmmm... I'm playing against Gnar. I cannot trade with him because his W is too strong. If I poke him down he'll just heal it back as Mega Gnar. I cannot set up a jungle gank because he'll bounce away. I can't all-in him because he can either bounce away, or just beat me anyways, because he does too much damage.\n\nI guess I'll just hang back and out CS him, while dodging his boomerang.

His passive allows him to recover from bad trades faster than his opponent.  Only one of his skills can \"miss\" (his spin), and even that is really easy to do well with.  Plus he can build tanky and still deal respectable damage.  And he had an execute.\nWhen he came out, he was overwhelmed by players who could suddenly do really well on him (because of how easy he was to play well), which often led to a lot of immature trash talking, misplaced ego, and so forth.\nOn top of that, as I mentioned, he had an execute.  And from what I've seen so far, champions with an execute style ability tend to attract players who play very selfishly.  These are the type of people that whine about \"he stole my kill\" in a team game.\n\nDarius arrived, and really was Garen Mk 2.  With incredibly strong trading potential, and massive snowballing, he was a shoe-in for unskilled players to do well on.  His bleed meant that against clueless opponents, you'd wind up steamrolling the lane, simply because they'd bleed a while, then trade again (and get stacks of bleed again), quickly leading them to be low health.
