Similar to WoW in the past.\n\nPeople left WoW because Ghostcrawler ruined the game balance in PvP and PvE, they changed the core of an MMORPG, they took the RP out of it when they made all classes the same, no more unique roles, they made leveling easier so the world became smaller, no longer a world you could get lost in, pair that with flying mounts and massive portals/teleports, dungeon finder, raid finder and many more problems. Vanilla and TBC were amazing, WOTLK was good, but it started the downfall of WoW. I quit after WotlK.\n\nI doubt this will happen to LoL, because its hard to change to core game play of LoL. LoL would die if they would take away items, or CS'ing, or jungling or brushes/wards, as long as the core stays the same, game will go on, WoW was destroyed because the core of the game was changed.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-07-29T14:58:03.153+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's so destroyed that it still has millions upon millions of players on it yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Arsames","date":"2015-07-29T15:10:36.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sp441,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Ow0Tuhzr,comment-id=00010003000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-29T14:58:03.153+0000)\n>\n> It's so destroyed that it still has millions upon millions of players on it yet.\n\nDropping frmo 13m+ to 5m is being destroyed, stay clueless.","replies":[{"poster":"sp441","date":"2015-07-29T15:26:54.616+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the balance changes of one man can drop over 8 million players from the game, it can't possibly be anything else.\n\nThough who am I kidding?
