It is a good buff, but Darius is WAY too bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"IsIsGankedParis","date":"2015-04-22T02:00:05.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buff isn't that noticeable till level 11 if he gets multiple dunks, or late game dunks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BluePolarizer","date":"2015-04-22T05:48:06.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All they need to make Darius viable is giving his E a shorter CD and letting it deal minor damage so it stacks his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-22T01:49:37.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Link?","replies":[{"poster":"IsIsGankedParis","date":"2015-04-22T01:51:58.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/\n\nWinrate\n\nChallenger\n\nLast month\n\nSolo Queue \n\nSummoners rift\n\nDarius is not on the list.","replies":[{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-22T05:45:23.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of champions not on that list.

The yorick syndrome is when no one knows shit about a champion, altough it's not that bad. No one picks that champion so no one knows how strong it is, they just assume that it's bad. Then some guy in competetive play picks him or starts playing him in challenger, and they realize, damn, that's kinda strong isn't it?\n\n(Of course, with Darius you need a lot of experience too, you need to know your damage numbers really well because of the ults, and you need to know how to land your e perfectly.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"qetzel","date":"2015-04-22T02:06:14.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GayBar PornStar,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=KiG62Pnr,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-04-22T01:51:58.992+0000)\n>\n> http://na.op.gg/statistics/champion/\n> \n> Winrate\n> \n> Challenger\n> \n> Last month\n> \n> Solo Queue \n> \n> Summoners rift\n> \n> Darius is not on the list.\n\n53 champions are on the list.\n\nMore than half are not. \n\nThis does not mean that Darius is as weak or underpowered as you appear to be claiming.

I understand the Riven hate ( BS shield, mobility, trading potential, AD steroid and ranged AoE execute vs Damage, more damage, a short range hook that deals no damage, armor pen that only scales later in lvls since you upgrade it later, ult that doesn't scale well and the base damage is kind of low )","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2015-04-22T01:45:16.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr?
