We have yet to hear about how the Darius rework is still going at this point and if it is going to come out this year. \n\nWhen I first started LoL my friend showed me Darius and I instantly fell in love with him. An axe, DUNKS, what more could I ask for. I joined around mid season 3 in April 2013 which is after his resets got nerfed. The problem I saw with Darius was not that he was strong, but he could be the most fed person in the entire game but his damage would still be sup-par because he has no natural tankiness or sustain so he could only really afford 1 damage item and go full on tank.\n\nWhen I first heard about Darius getting a rework I was really kinda happy. My favorite champion is getting reworked to be a team player and actually require a little more thinking(hopefully) to use. I just hope his issue of being a fed monster but falling off harder than a Renekton and getting SOME natural tankiness will be solved. \n\nScruffy, I know you got a lot of hate on the Skarner rework and some are calling you out on how Rengar rework was a failure in 1 part but a success in another part, but I have this feeling that Darius will be different. I just wish this rework will make him viable and I won't be called out in ranked games(he's my most used in ranked along with Nasus) as picking a troll champion or a champ that is not viable in todays meta due to NO mobility and being such a kser but not being able to use gold efficiently. \n\nSo please Scruffy, tell us he is at least still planned for this year, I, along with many other players, are very very anxious and excited on the Darius rework. If it's still not sure if he will be released this year because of other more important champions, that's fine, older champs like Sion deserve a rework before Darius. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.\n\nVarin Omega\n\nLink to Article: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/01...iscussion.html\n\nEdit: I tried posting this on GD but they told me that Rioters respond more frequently on the Beta but goodness does it take forever to load when you have awful connection in Iraq.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Scruffy","date":"2014-06-01T18:11:07.086+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"Darius is still being worked on by the Champion Update team, and we're still iterating on his gameplay. So no solid release date yet, but he is actively in progress. \n\nDirectionally, we are still working with the same goals Morello had mentioned in earlier posts: longer ramp up with a higher payoff. The goal is that the interesting gameplay moments come when the Darius player is fighting for \"just a little longer\" and the enemy is in more of a hit and run pattern to not let him build up too high.","replies":[{"poster":"a horse running","date":"2014-06-01T21:49:07.639+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please, god...not the rework where you have to get 8+ bleed stacks.

If they do go that direction, his laning will be considerably more boring (because his kit doesn't really favor extended trades). The kit change would have to be pretty drastic for that to be different.
