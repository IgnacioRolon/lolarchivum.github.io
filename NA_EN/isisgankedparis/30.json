That's an extra layer of mechanical skill that also has no real counterplay. Riven is no different; her power level is gated around a mechanic that I as her opponent cannot directly influence. I have counterplay against a good Lee Sin or Shaco because I know how they work and what they want to do; I have no counterplay against a Riven who can right click on me, press Q, right click on the ground, all repeated, until I'm dead. It's not like Riven would suddenly be a total faceroll champ if her Q animation canceling wasn't a thing. Her skill floor would be alot lower, sure, but the really good Rivens beat you because of great management of their CD's to avoid as much damage as possible, and they would still be able to do that. Balancing around a non-counterplay mechanic is stupid anyway, which is what they were forced to do with Sion until they reworked him and have been doing with Poppy until her rework is complete. Even if Riven is stronger in the hands of the average player with buffed numbers and no Q canceling, she's still better for the health of the game than she is now where she's ass on people who don't do it and oppressive on people that do.\n\nAlso, it's funny to me because when the bug came up on PBE a few months ago that made her Q canceling automatic, people argued against keeping it for the opposite reason.  \"Riven will become totally faceroll and get nerfed, hurting the good Riven players.\" Now it's \"Riven will become totally trash and have to be buffed, making her faceroll while still being weaker for good Riven players.\" I just want a Riven that doesn't have to be balanced around this needlessly difficult, no counterplay mechanic that requires no decision making and doesn't even make sense in a moba; make her Q canceling automatic or remove it entirely and balance her accordingly. I don't care which.","replies":[{"poster":"Hinagiku33","date":"2015-06-16T23:41:08.146+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"When Riot made Riven's animation canceling automatic, then reverted it, I'm pretty sure they made a few comments that the actual mechanic of animation canceling on Riven (while originally a bug) is basically now endorsed by Riot. \"But it's a bug\" is just no longer an issue. That is now an intentional mechanic that Riot has already done poking into.\n\nThat said, I feel I wasn't being clear:\n\n*I have no idea of the current Riven is \"balanced\" or \"healthy\" or whatever.*\n\nI'm just stating that Riven's kit currently requires her to at least have some mechanical skill and I feel that we should not just delete things that require players to actually be somewhat skillful to use properly. \n\nAlso this: **\"non-counterplay mechanic\"**\n\nDo you feel that all ranged basic attacks and targeted abilities are also stupid?

It is expected and she's been balanced around the animation cancelling for ages now. If they remove the one thing that makes her difficult, then her kit would be even HARDER to balance since she'd be incredibly slow, so they'd have to speed up her Q and reduced the cast time on her W so her enemies are stunned for longer than her cast time. Too many buffs would be needed to properly balance her with the removal of this, but it would make her far too easy and you'd see far more bitching about her. It's best to just use counterplay against Riven since she is balanced the way she is. Killing a squishy instantly is what big bursters like her do. Considering her only gap closers are her E and her Q, she'd be wasting her 1.5s shield to get 'near' you or she'd be wasting part of her burst to get near you. If she's on top of you, yes her animation cancelling will seem overwhelming. She's meant to be CC'd mid-combo or kept at a distance to begin with. That's why her main counters have hard CC. Garen and Renekton are two of her biggest counters and both are able to stop her combo mid-combo, which will screw up any Riven's combo. \n\nJust gotta counterplay Riven rather than trying to nerf her burst speed. She's not LB where she can do her damage at 700 range and she's not Zed who can press R and instantly be ontop of some one who's ways away from her. She has travel time and you can predict her movements, so just counterplay her. Stun her if she tries to combo so she can't combo.

If you don't have a tank jungler and/or your support is squishy, then... Good luck trying to win that game.\n\nThat's the problem: Vladimir can potentially win every other matchup because even if the enemy champion happens to give Vlad a hard laning phase, such as Xin Zhao, Fiddlesticks or Swain, Vladimir can outscale all of them. Problem with Riven is that Vladimir can't outscale her, only during the very late game that he will technically be stronger, but even then, he still has the same problem of not having the hard CC needed to stop her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-06-16T18:37:40.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"You're full of it and clearly have never seen a competent player using her.\n\nHere: [Box Box Unranked to Diamond in 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGUqhmtbOW6H37Vy3Ntlkg1qf86BKUtnO)","replies":[{"poster":"Goodest Gamer","date":"2015-06-16T18:59:14.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was there when he was doing the stream. \n1- he didnt get to diamond \n2- HE IS A CHALLENGER PLAYER\n3- THEY ARE FUCKING BRONZE-PLAT 1\n4. a good player can shit on others with poppy if he wants to. your point is invalid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rtbf221146393","date":"2015-06-16T01:38:06.850+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":7,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YumaS2Astral,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Wdq4hbod,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-06-15T23:15:14.566+0000)\n>\n> People that say that Riven is balanced probably never met one that knows how to \"animation cancel\" - This is the single thing that makes her broken because she can burst you down without giving you any opportunity to react, and allows her to build almost full damage while having the durability of a bruiser.\n> \n> I wouldn't even mind if they had to buff her damage if she lost her animation canceling.\n\nYou have no idea what you're talking about. why do low elo players try to talk about balance. you never met a riven who knows how to do the fast combo+animation cancel anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"YumaS2Astral","date":"2015-06-16T02:03:13.685+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"I am not a low elo player.

He's still gated as hard by cooldowns and mana as he is when he uses his skills more effectively to knock up an opponent and then reposition to knoeck them into his tower.\n\nRiven has no mana, and is only gated by Cooldowns which scales lower and lower as the game goes on and she builds more CDR and ranks up her W and E.\n\nShe is of course allowed to be resourceless and only lightly gated by cooldowns because her kit takes time to unload.\n\nYou wouldn't give a 4 sec CD AD scaling resourceless shield which empowers your next attack, to a bursty assassin, but on a sustained dps bruiser it fits well.\n\nExcept when she can use a secret trick to unload it in a 4th of the time it usually takes.\n\nRiven is two different champions depending on whether the player knows how to excecute a secret trick or not.\n\nA lot of other champions can be played differently, and can be made to fit drastically different roles. This is a good thing, but other champions do it with builds. Runes, masteries, skill orders items. And some champions can seem totally different in the hands of someone who knows the champion well, and has the right insight in how to use them to their full effect in some weird off-build.\n\nThey're played differently, and the opponent can react to whether you're going AP or AD or Blue Ezreal when they see what items you buy.\n\nYou can't react to Riven suddenly pressing all her burst into a short window with no penalty to her decision. (And again, while you can't react to Alistar's W suddenly ending with a Q, he at least gives up his knockback to do so, meaning he's shortened his CC on you and can't use it to peel or knock you back into his team/tower)\n\nAnd you can't know whether Riven's gonna swing at you for an extended period of time, using her mobility to jump around and simply outplay you, or if she's just gonna burst you before you can say \"flash or die\".\n\nBut IMO the worst part of it is that without almost digging up the info (or atleast catching on to the debate on the subject here on Boards/Reddit/whatever), you don't even know that you can use an exploit to severely alter the nature of the champion. I know I wouldn't have gotten Riven if I thought I had no chance to ever learn her properly.\n\n---\n\nI find it especially disconcerting that Riven is (IIRC) in the pre-6 rotation on at least EUNE.
