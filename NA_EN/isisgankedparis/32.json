The ult should be on a 6 second cooldown and be automatic, anyone and i mean anyone (yes even allies, minions, and neutral monsters) below 30% life should be auto-executed.

Specially when both Nid and Volibear have better executes, since they can use it like ten times before Garen can use his twice. It isnt even that good of an execute, so idk why its so long. It would be OP if they reduced it by 80 seconds but i think 30 or 40 seems reasonable enough. If its too much they can raise it again. People are worried about an OP Garen when he has no gap closer or CC other then a silence, honestly i doubt 40 seconds will bring him to Godtier.  \n\n**EDIT** New game mode idea, its like Doombots except its one vs five, The Mighty Garen vs your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IronChefBoyardee","date":"2015-01-16T20:42:35.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What are you talking about?

You don't have to touch them beforehand at all.\n\n\nI think that the way his ult should be fixed is that it: should have it's cooldown reduced. But instead of damage scaling based on a flat value of missing enemy health, it scales based on the flat value (NOT percent) of Garen's missing health. This is nice change because it encourages the player to build tank/stack health, it means that Garen has to engage the enemy (otherwise his preserverance passive will screw up the damage of his ult), and it makes sense thematically (The ultimate itself is called \"Demacian Justice\", justice for the injured demacian).\nAlthough such a change would weaken his current existing combo (I'm talking about the Q, E, R that was highlighted in his champion spotlight), it would fix the issue of his ult having such a high CD.","replies":[{"poster":"Erijian","date":"2015-01-17T16:23:40.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=flibitydoo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=qGt7agJE,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-01-17T05:23:27.221+0000)\n>This is nice change because it encourages the player to build tank/stack health\n\nGaren's not a Tank, people need to realize this. Just because he gains 20% bonus stats from the items he purchases, and regens at a hilariously high rate out-of-combat is not a reason to justify tank builds. That's a reason to justify more *offensive* builds as he needs less defensive items to achieve the defensive stats of actual tanks in certain scenarios, allowing him to opt for more damage as he gets enough free stats to manage without the extra defense.\n\nAnd the 30% Damage Reduction Active from Courage is extremely good and doesn't require a lot of Armor to be effective.

Its base damage is super low at rank 1. Personally, I would prefer giving it a higher early base damage and higher missing health scaling on later ranks, but a similarly long cool down. It has a super long early cool down to keep him from repeatedly executing a lane opponent if he gets ahead, and needs that gating. However, the damage it gives is not good enough to fully warrant having that long of a cool down. Basically, it needs more damage for viability, but long cool down to prevent excessively powerful 1 kill snowballing.\n\nLive works like this: 175/350/525 (+28.57/33.33/40% Missing HP), 160/120/80 second cool down.\n\nWhat I would suggest: 200/375/550 (+30/40/50% Missing HP), 150/120/90 second cool down.\n\nThis gives it a minimal power increase early (by +25 damage, +1.43% more missing health damage, and 10 second lower cool down). This allows for slightly increased reliability at gaining kills, and allows him to not be so weak for as long.\n\nLate game, it is significantly more powerful (+25 damage, +10% more missing health damage,), but also has a 10 longer cool down than live. This late game cool down trade off would allow his execute to pack more of a punch, but not be a constant (oppressive) threat.\n\nEDIT: I don't know why, but I felt compelled to do this just now. I did the math and with his passive, Spirit Visage and its passive, Warmog's out of combat passive, and the recovery, perseverance, and second wind masteries all active at once, Garen can surpass 820 HP5... that is over 164 health per second.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyssphere","date":"2015-01-17T00:20:33.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"140/110/80 sounds good to me, or 130/105/80.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKingDodo","date":"2015-01-17T00:09:43.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should just make his E and R scale with AP.
