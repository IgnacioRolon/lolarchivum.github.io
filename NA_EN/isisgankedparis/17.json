It's mostly in the early laning that it seems unbalanced - being able to ignore wards late game I think allows her core fantasy to play out - sneaking in and out of the enemy jungle, changing the odds of a well-warded small skirmish - without being overbearing, because at that stage of the game the impact one champion can have is a lot lower.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2015-03-30T18:12:07.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been up for awhile but yeah most people probably still haven't heard about it yet (as they may not pay attention to the PBE summaries and such)\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GTvaL0dYHXk/VRIGM3rskRI/AAAAAAAAmkw/QUO_9MDWOjo/s1600/nanbbn.jpg\n\nBut it will help early on for enemies being near by, plus it's cheap at 35 gold right now","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"C9 Midian","date":"2015-03-29T19:39:04.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=sV1NkVE5,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-29T19:22:40.976+0000)\n>\n> It's likely (though as with anything, never 100% certain of course) that Gangplank and Poppy will get their reworks this season.
