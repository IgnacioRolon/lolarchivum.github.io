The difference is that riven has mobility and a shield that scale with AD, so going full AD actually make sense, whereas darius has negative mobility and need to have a bunch of tank item or else he get kited and get destroyed late.

As i said, the big difference is that Riven has more mobility and a more interesting itemization since her survivability is basicly the strength of her shield + her mobility, and not dependant entierly on tank items. aside of that, yes you have 2 different champion, but they basicly have a similar role/utility, except riven does it better and with less risk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2014-12-27T00:23:05.233+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma, Ryze, Nidalee, Quinn, etc bully tops harder than Darius ever did.\n\nAt least you can beat Darius by farming early game and out-scalling.

However the main point I mean by late-game is that if you go any top that you listed, your team usually won't be a very good comp).
