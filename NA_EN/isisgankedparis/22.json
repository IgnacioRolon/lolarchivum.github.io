It is more personally impactful spell than exhaust. Exhaust would help the team as a whole reducing that champs damage by double and slowing them, where as smite would only help the individual. That would be my main guess, not a dev so I can't say for sure, but I imagine if you played against a Vayne and exhaust reduced true damage the vayne would basically be fucked damage wise, this way she can still be semi impactful and exhaust is still helpful for the enemy team to use","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2015-05-03T19:24:12.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well why shouldn't Vayne be fucked damage wise when all other ADC's are?","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-03T19:54:31.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point isn't just Vayne but the point of true damage as a whole, exhaust reducing the true damage would basically make it a mechanic that you can never take advantage of.
