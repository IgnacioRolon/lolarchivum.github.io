Who's gonna have the easiest time draining that extra health pool that champs will have for the first few levels? That's right, champs that aren't dependent on their abilities for direct damage (most of which won't scale up with these changes), and champs that can stay within their attack range most easily, I.E. ADcs. The benefit may only last til level 4 relative to right now, but we all know damn well how much low-level interaction matters in this game and you've decided to go and make it even more anti-melee.\n\nBut it's alright, because while you're at it you've also had it in your infinite wisdom to use this system to make the already-pitiful distinction between ranged and melee per-level growths even smaller at early levels, making the 'cost' of being a ranged champion even less significant until level 10. Good to know one of the few edges I had as a melee in laning just got weaker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kinky Rhydon","date":"2014-11-20T02:42:26.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xemeron","date":"2014-11-20T02:45:49.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nautilus 518...

Let me put it this way say you have champion x whose passive is affected by slows now you have champion Y whose passive is not affected by slows. Now champion X was given 500 attack range because her passive allows her to keep up with or outrun opponents. Meanwhile Champion Y who is newer can do the same thing with hers but doesn't have to worry about slows so she can be more consistent but was given 550 range. tell me that doesn't sound odd to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MotherChurch","date":"2014-11-20T16:27:50.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like poorly designed mobility creep champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yawnli","date":"2014-11-20T02:44:27.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't worry too much, when people get too good using Kalista she will get nerfed anyway, same as Yasuo; it all balances out in the end, in the meantime people are gonna feed so having a little bit more than a normal adc is fine in my opinion","replies":[]},{"poster":"disregardable","date":"2014-11-20T02:06:07.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not the base health but the regen that matters, as a bruiser.","replies":[{"poster":"IsIsGankedParis","date":"2014-11-20T02:18:35.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know having 8.25(+.95per/level) hp/5seconds was huge, heck at level 18 he has roughly 25.35 hp/5, that's not gonna do shit when ADC's have lifesteal out the ass and peel out the ass to take no damage, hell Darius is the only bruiser with no natural tankiness or sustain built into his kit.","replies":[]}]}]}
