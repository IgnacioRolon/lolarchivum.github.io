They rely somewhat on early-mid game snowball to overcome certain match-ups, but none of them are as strong in those phases as Darius. in exchange these champs do scale a lot better than Darius though. Darius's trade of for his early game that destroys every other melee champ in the game is his lack of scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"360D3GR3SS","date":"2015-06-12T02:57:13.059+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually no. Darius is one of the few champions where while in his danger zone, you usually don't escape.

Really? 100 damage means 350+ ad Darius. He needs to buy at least 3 defensive items. He can't really beat every melee match up 1v1 ({{champion:106}} (only with {{summoner:14}}  but you need to take {{summoner:12}} )  or {{champion:5}} ) He doesn't deal with campers tho.\n\n> In Season 2 he was the definition of \"the walking ultimate\".\n\nStill was the most balanced champion in the game.

For example 2 dmg items: {{item:3074}}  and {{item:3156}} provide him 250-280~ total damage. So he needs third ad item. Too much for him. (Geting too squshy) 300 damage = something around 890-900 true damage at max stack.
