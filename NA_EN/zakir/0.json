You want to main at most 2 champions in each role that are not highly contested and then play a high volume of games. The champions themselves do not have to be overly complex either as people will be making mistakes and capitalizing on those mistakes is fairly easy without the need to outplay your opponent at all.\n\nBelow are SOME champions and main general tips for each role. The other huge thing to keep in mind is that 15 cs = 1 kill. Focus on CSing well and not being so kill hungry like most low ELO players. Also getting those tower plates and objectives as well as ending the game before the enemy team has a chance to catch up will be a tremendous help to your win rate.\n\nTop lane: Always take teleport and split push like your life depends on it. You want to force the enemy team to at least send two people to stop you\n{{champion:24}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:83}} \n\nJungle: Gank gank gank then take a plate or turret. People will over-extend and not ward properly nor pay attention to the map. Special note for master yi and how much of a low ELO stomper he is.\n{{champion:11}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:120}} \n\nMid lane: Either play poke champions since enemy teams won't be great at initiating or play assassins that can roam. It's also not a bad idea to have a counter assassin in your pocket\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:101}} \n\nBot: Most ADCs will fit the role though you ideally want to pick one that isn't too team reliant. Having a more defensive ADC is also not a bad idea since a lot of times there will be no tanks on either team and therefore your damage doesn't need to be quite as high.\n{{champion:222}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:22}} \n\nSupport: You honestly want to avoid this role unfortunately as it's too team reliant. If you must play it however picking some naturally high damage supports or those that can create picks is always good\n{{champion:53}} {{champion:555}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:143}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2019-08-19T16:03:15.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trick to climb in low MMR is two-fold:\n\n1. Don't try to carry, just make sure you're consistent.\n2. Accept that you'll lose a lot of games anyway and don't tilt because of that.\n\nSeriously. A 60% winrate is huge and will let you climb relatively quickly. And yet, a 60% winrate still means you will lose 4 games for every 10 games you play. And yes, those losses will be due mostly to AFK and flamers. But if you let that tilt you, you will also lose the *other* games where you *don't* have trolls just because you are tilted.\n\nSo just relax, focus, and do your best. Take a bad team-mate as you would take a bad roll on what kind of drake you get. It's just RNG, it's out of your hands, and it doesn't matter anyway.\n\nAnd why \"don't try to carry\"? Well, because that's dangerous. If you feel like you have to carry, you'll take risk, you'll try to make things happen. And that's how you throw your lead, not how you win games. Take the safe and methodical route. Make sure YOU don't make mistakes, and just wait for the opponents to make one, and THEN punish them for it. Don't worry, in Bronze (and even in Silver and low Gold) they WILL make some mistakes. That's not a question. We all do. Just be patient and wait for them to make one first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clone Is Friend","date":"2019-08-20T06:04:37.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"take note of your own mistakes and try to improve. that is how i made it from silver to diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nøctμrne","date":"2019-08-20T05:14:25.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're in bronze, I would say to learn how to do macro and micro play, getting objectives, knowing where to position yourself, and when you should fight are all massively important in lower elo if I'm not mistaken. That is sometimes the reason people get stuck in low elo, is because they don't know when they should go for an objective.\n\nAnother way would be, after learning micro and macro play, is to abuse the lack of micro and macro play knowledge that people around your rank have. Play top lane champions whose only goal is to sit up top for most of the game and shove towers to provide pressure. (Tryndamere is a fairly simple but very effective champion to use for this).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DUDE BRO","date":"2019-08-20T04:23:01.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game where Kayle top went 2/13, fed the enemy Riven who went 28/8.

Focus a bit more on objective control (towers, drag, herald, baron) than on getting a bunch of kills","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dukues","date":"2019-08-19T18:39:51.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like others said you have to find a couple champs and a role you are consistent at and want to spam. Then it's honestly about improving. Not saying you have to 1v9 carry every game.... but you kinda do lol. But 1v9 isn't always just getting 30 kills smurfing on fools. There is more to it than that. You just need to be a consistent player that your team can rely on. Its hard to break down everything as you are newer so you still have a lot to learn. Its all about taking steps to improve and in time climbing gets easier until you hit your skill next skill ceiling. \n\nOne important note though is like..... if you watch LCS or play with higher ranked friends you will notice the game doesn't look the same in bronze/silver. People are just too inexperienced and do too much random shit and make so many mistakes that games feel more chaotic. So you first just kind of have to accept this and adjust your play style accordingly. Like..... if enemy team has a fed top they may group or go top or bot or whatever. But you will know that most likely they have nothing warded and will just keep overextending so if you are strong enough to 1v1 them or can get someone to follow you can go catch them out quick late in the game and then hopefully force an objective with your 4v5 advantage. Or like knowing players are going to chase for kills a lot which makes their pathing very predictable. That and most low silver/bronze players run in straight lines so hitting skill shots is insanely easy. Once you get better players mistakes just are way more obvious and then you can punish those mistakes a lot harder. \n\nSadly grouping up and doing ARAM is actually kind of effective these days since damage is so high and turrets/wave clear is weaker. So realize people love to group up especially in silver/bronze. So most likely if you see one person coming its probably going to be all of them. So you can really predict where enemy team is going to go and makes split pushing pretty easy. Plus their vision pretty shit and movements pretyt straight forward so you can generally always have an idea of where the enemy going to be. This obviously comes with experience but makes for easily getting Macro advantages and hitting blind skillshots from fog of war. That and people love to death match so expect there to always be fights around objectives. Silver players love fucking inting for dragon even if it is late into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"World peace plz","date":"2019-08-19T17:46:51.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 of the most importand i have learn on my way to diamond is that not to focus on how your team is doing.

Its just so bad and if others on your team flame you or sombody els mute that person so you can focus on the game.

That is the biggest issue for low elo players and it's not tilting.  Every game goes like this. \n..... 1 min into game \"First Blood\" \n..... \"GG\"\nRight? \n\nYou want to play your own game but don't forget that your teammates are trash!  Don't expect them to understand or do what YOU want them to do.  Also, don't ping 300 times.  If you die 1v4 or 2v4 at botlane etc don't ping the top tower over and over and over(All that will do is annoy and tilt your team).  \n\nTop/Jng/sup try to play champions that makes these items that much more effective/if you're a tank player/main. {{item:3800}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3193}}  these are honestly the last decent \"tank\" items in the game but they also help your team instead of just YOU. \n  That's really the biggest stepping stone about at least making it out of Bronze/Iron - and that's being what I call \" A babysitter\" you gotta around your team and build up THEIR ego to the point that THEY think they are carrying but it's really just YOU.  \nFor example: if you don't tilt and don't mind going 0-3-7 for your team and you are winning but your teammates/ADC is say 3-1-2 they will think the game can be won.  However, if YOU are 3-1-2 and they are 0-3-7 do you think they will feel the same way?  \n\n\nRemember, you gotta stay frosty, not tilt and literally be like Sam from \"Lord of the Rings\" and your team Frodo and literally carry them to \"Mount Elo\"!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ärchaon","date":"2019-08-19T16:35:41.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"play the best you can.
