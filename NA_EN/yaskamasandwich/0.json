Ever since Season 5 though people have been complaining about certain things, then complained about things to fix those things. For example people last season people complained about long que timers which used to last hours (quite literally hours if you weren&#039;t support), now people are complaining about Autofill that has actually reduced que timers, but all for the small price of enforcing people to play and learn a different role (Support) for just once every 3rd or 5th match or something. Dynamic Que was of course complained about and so Solo Que came back. Now some people complain that Solo Que isn&#039;t &quot;Solo Que&quot; enough, even though it is the exact same old Solo Que most of everyone loved. Really at this point you might as well call the Gameplay Boards the &quot;Rabble Rabble! Boards!&quot; And replace every word with &quot;Rabble Rabble!&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"DunkinNoobs","date":"2017-01-09T23:17:12.272+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nerf every champion except for mine, ty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GULAG 4 U","date":"2017-01-09T23:36:53.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they fucking don't lmao\n\nWhy do you think contradictory statements are constantly upvoted as long as they're supporting one opinion of bashing a champion they don't like?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-01-10T01:36:23.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of factors to this:\n\n1.

It just seems that all of Gameplay seems to act like you said a hive mind. It's just a lot of people with different opinions and there being more than one group. However it just still seems a little bit too I don't know ... Chaotic? It also seems to be getting worse by the season when it comes to the different opinions of one jump to the next.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2017-01-09T20:00:49.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"+10 base Movement speed for Mordekaiser","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brain ErrÃ¶r 404","date":"2017-01-09T20:15:33.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Does anyone know what they truly want in life? \n\nWants are a funny thing.
