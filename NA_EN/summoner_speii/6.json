Kled is dog shit into aatrox because a good aatrox can disable kled e with his q and any aatrox diamond and lower is not able to kill pressure correctly, and only a perfect aatrox can zone kled so hard early game that he has no chance to scale.  Riven can win against aatrox late game but still gets outclassed early game, but shes getting nerfed and that won't be a thing anymore because that small nerf is enough to shift her out of broken tier. the reason u list winrates is because many autofills pick aatrox based of how popular and broken he is to stonewall the lane, similar to karma top players, and it lowers his winrate by a great value. Players who are not aatrox mains that are above masters elo cannot bring out the skill of the champion. Even crazy good top laners like adrian seria and broken blade have a negative winrate on aatrox, which shows that you have to actually BE GOOD at aatrox to have a good winrate on him and you can't just play him because you are mechanically skilled, and players who play aatrox just to learn him and not main him are the causes for his low winrate. the rest of the champions you list are just doing well because the aatrox does not know how to kill pressure in laning phase, and jax, fiora are all down to recieve buffs next patch because of their weak class in top lane compared to other meta picks atm and you listing them shows that you don't understand the balancing of this game. i don't know where you are getting your morde vs aatrox winrate from, because on op gg it shows that https://na.op.gg/champion/aatrox/statistics/top aatrox has a positive winrate against morde, and that makes sense because morde can't get 3 abilities off aatrox unless the aatrox is really bad at the game, because his q hard outclasses all of morde's kit and he can dodge morde e with his e.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-08-14T00:23:13.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is good against Aatrox but you have to respect his level 1,2,and 3 because he is an early game champion and therefore he must be strong at that stage.\n\nKled has way more probabilities than getting Aatrox with his Q than Aatrox having such a perfect timing, be realistic.

Fiora is only good in specific match ups, and is a horrible first pick top because of how many counterpicks exist against fiora, and aatrox can always e the fiora stun. A good aatrox will pressure kled to the point where he cannot play the game and i've played this match up before, and it favors his side heavily in early game when he wins coinflip, to the point where i don't have a chance.  Sure. you can outscale aatrox as kled, but the time it takes to do that may have been the time needed to change the destiny of coinflip, and when your team is griefing and your playing against the most broken early game champion while getting camped it feels absolutely hopeless.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-08-15T00:14:48.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you played Aatrox you would understand why Aatrox is bad in close Combat generally and only goes close for Q3.

Not my fault.\"\n\nYasuo top a Joke?? Put a good Yasuo top against a good Aatrox and see how easily he avoids everything Aatrox throws at him just by Eing everywhere while outradding Aatrox everytime. By mid game he would be stomping Aatrox and by Late Game he would be destroying your whole team. What a good Joke, right?\n\nJax obviously won't be able to carry all games late game, this is just normal, it doesn't mean Jax is weak. In fact, his players say that he is strong and can carry a lot of games BECAUSE they know how to play him.  Jax can deal perfectly with Aatrox past 4 and he will destroy Aatrox Mid-Late game just by jumping on him, stunning him and AA him to death.\n\n\"Fiora is horrible first pick top\" As are most top laners. What did you expect from this top counterpick meta? Fiora has no stun and if you mean Fiora uses perfect timing with W on Aatrox Q, then no, Aatrox won't have enough time to use E to run away, he will already be stuned.\n\nAt the end, I ended searching and watched and Aatrox vs Kled matchup just because you didn't stop repeating that an Master Aatrox will autowin any matchup. Guess what? Something totally unexpected happened, the Kled (thought Aatrox clearly countered him) ended zoning Aatrox after killing him 2 times and a third one under turret.
