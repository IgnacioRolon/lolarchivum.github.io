Do you guys think that this should be punishable for normals? It kind of is riot's fault for releasing a mission that literally requires me to drag out a game till the 5th drag.","replies":[{"poster":"Ashe mage AD","date":"2019-12-17T06:47:09.682+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coop vs Ai games count towards those missions in case you're ok with that game mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-12-19T05:53:38.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When considering the slew of things that SHOULD be bannable offenses, this is at the bottom of the list if it even makes it on the list. I think, in normals, no.\n\nLast I checked, in normals, you get to play however you want to play, as long as you're not intentionally feeding. JG doesn't have to gank or get drags, support doesn't have to let ADC get CS or lane with them, etc. So in turn, no player has to push towers or directly contribute to taking down the nexus. Ranked games are the place to play if you are playing to win. Normals are the place to play however you want- and subsequently, however anyone else wants. As long as it's not inting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-17T12:21:27.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to work with your team in team games, missions aside. Additionally, can't all missions be completed eventually by just playing?
