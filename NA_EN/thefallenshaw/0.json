So I say nerf their late game. Players should not be rewarded for feeding till lategame. In vayne&#039;s instance I say buff her slightly early, and make it where if she plays bad she has no damage late. There are other champions like this, Vayne just happen to be the easyiest to explain my point with. I&#039;d just like to see playing well rewarded and playing bad punished in this way. Any champion thats behind 30 cs, and 4 kills shouldnt be able to 1v1 someone they fed lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Sintama","date":"2017-03-13T20:31:42.094+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had a talon AFK for the first 15 minutes.\nCame back with the items he had from passive gold, started steamrolling kills.\nHe didn't even need to lane.
