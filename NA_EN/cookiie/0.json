Oh and my problem you may be wondering is when i go to used an ability like my Q i would Click the letter Q then it would show were it would go for say i was Lucian and i clicked my Q it would highlight where i could Q as if it wasn't smart casted but in reality i have everything set as it is smart casted but this problem won't go away so what do Ido?","replies":[{"poster":"Elek","date":"2016-05-11T02:20:07.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your problem is with the quickcast with indicators option. Go to the hotkeys menu in game then where you see the \"Quickcast With Indicator\" list you should see the following: \"Replace quickcast with quickcast with indicator in the quickbind UI.\" Uncheck that and then you should be back to normal quickcast.","replies":[{"poster":"Cookiie","date":"2016-05-11T20:24:48.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Elek,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=bEUQKVQ3,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-11T02:20:07.770+0000)\n>\n> I think your problem is with the quickcast with indicators option.

When you click Q, do you want the spell to go off immediately?  Or do you want to see the range of the Q until you click to activate the ability?\n\nIf it is currently set as the latter and you want it set as the former, then you may have an issue with your settings properly saving.  To hopefully get this fixed, complete the following:\n\n1. Make sure that you are logged into the client\n2.  Go to your League installation:  C: -- Riot Games -- League of Legends -- Config\n3.  Delete the following 2 files:  Game.cfg and PersistedSettings.json\n4.  Go into the client and start a new Custom Game\n\nThis should force all of your in-game settings to default, but it should also resolve this issue.  Let me know if you are still experiencing issues!","replies":[]}]}
