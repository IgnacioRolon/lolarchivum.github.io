I&#039;m going in as an Undeclared Major, with thoughts of going into Mathematics Education, which is something my family, friends, and I have talked about at length. Everyone says I should declare my major and start my life as soon as possible. But I&#039;m kinda scared to do some, because, while being a High School Math Teacher is something I&#039;ve talked about doing for a long time, I can&#039;t get the thought of working on some sort of Lore/Narrative team for a video game company. I don&#039;t want to commit to something, but live to regret it for my entire life. The recent announcement of Kindred and all of the lore, the stories, and the mystery behind her has made me really start questioning my choices. I love how in &quot;A Good Death&quot; Lamb seems to be motherly, kind of keeping Wolf in his place while psuedo-protecting Magga. So, I&#039;ve come here, looking to just have a few questions answered by our lovely Red Overlords. \r\n1) What made you decide to pursue a career in writing for video games?\r\n2) What kind of degree (if any) do you have?\r\n3) Do you have any tips for getting into your business?\r\n4) Do you ever wish you had done something different instead of getting your job at Riot?\r\n5) What sort of things have you done at Riot?\r\n6) What are the teams currently at Riot (If you can even say so)\r\n7) Anything else you&#039;d like to add! \r\n\r\nThank you so much!{{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-09-27T05:11:29.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) What made you decide to pursue a career in writing for video games?\n\nI and most writers I know, pursued a career as \"writer.\"     I.e. the medium shouldn't really matter.\nIt's about liking characters and liking the process.        \n\n\n> 2) What kind of degree (if any) do you have?\n\nI have a BFA in Animation and Film (University of the Arts) and and MFA in screenwriting and directing  (USC)\n\n\n> 3) Do you have any tips for getting into your business?\n\nWrite.

In otherwise I mean is there anyone who doesn't like that champion they are working on? If there is, why do they work on them? If there is no and everyone has favorites, which one is your favorite?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-09-27T17:17:18.546+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do Narrative Team's members have favorites that cause them to like their job more?

If there is no and everyone has favorites, which one is your favorite?\n\nKinda hard to answer this one.   In reality I think most players have a major misconception of what we do on champion team.   We don't write for champions we didn't help create. The largest part of my job is coming up with the personality and theme for a character--  with the designer (gameplay), artist (visuals) and the rest of the pod.   So it would be hard for me not to love Tahm's personality-- it was my job to look at the direction art and gameplay were going (early on) and then find a way to build a personality off that.   I wrote a story capturing that personality then he jumped back into pod.  The story affects gameplay and art... and changes.   I then reacted to that.  This cycle goes round and round with everyone on the pod building on top of everyone else's work.    \n \nIts a lot of work, a lot of meeting, a lot of research, and a fair bit of writing.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-09-27T17:38:37.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably Fasmodey was asking more about when a writer has to deal with al already existing champion - like Burning Tides.\n\nLet's take for example Yorick. If you have to write something about him, let it be a story or a characterization guideline or anything else but the designed writer/ the avaiable writer just can' t manage to like him, what happens / how you react / how it affects the outcome?","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2015-09-27T17:59:09.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah.    Well,  in that case.   \n\nPart of a writer's job is finding what you like about a character.  We all have our favs, but sometimes your tasked with writing about\na champ you don't connect with.  The question, and research becomes-- finding out why people connect with this champ, finding something in the champ you can connect with, and finding a dramatic question that you and the fans could connect with.","replies":[{"poster":"Decrit","date":"2015-09-27T18:12:29.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, if the writer does not connect well with the champion, or connects but only partially, it looks for what is liked by other agents beyond him/her ( by looking at feedback from the fanbase, or by looking at the complaints of those that do not like the character in question ), comprends the whys/the whos/ the hows and uses them to proceed with the work?\n\nAlso thanks for your replies and time :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2015-09-27T17:20:54.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WAAARGHbobo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W46W0V2I,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-27T17:17:18.546+0000)\n>\n> Do Narrative Team's members have favorites that cause them to like their job more?
