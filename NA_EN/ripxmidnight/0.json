What motivates you to play top lane? Is it driven by your champion pool? Is there something about the role that calls out to you?\n\nTop lane feels like the most frustrating role on the map. It very rarely feels like the true 1v1 that it could be, but instead is dependent on pressure from jg/mid to secure kills or blow sums that will lead to kills later in the game. There's nothing worse than trying to farm under tower all game while your own jg seems to forget that top lane exists all together.\n\nI main jungle and always attempt a lvl 3 gank top lane if it looks even remotely possible that at the very least I can burn an enemy flash, because I understand how easy it is to snowball from the slightest advantage.\n\nSo Top Lane mains, I want to get inside your head. Why do you prefer that role?\n\nEDIT: Wow! Thanks everyone for the outpouring of response and insight. To think that this thread was being down-voted when I first made it.\n\nFollow-up question: Who are some safe Top Lane picks? Champions that won't fall off hard if they don't get ahead early or can safely farm/scale up even when facing a lot of enemy pressure?","replies":[{"poster":"HayRoss","date":"2016-02-18T03:43:11.417+0000","up_votes":101,"down_votes":3,"body":"Many reasons:\n\n1.

Mid is all about reaction time and direct outplay or die. Bot is annoying, dependent on some idiot you got paired with. Jungle is all about macro play, deciding each moment what the best move is. But top really feels like you're outplaying the opponent on a much broader strategic level instead of simple reaction times.\n\nMost champions in top lane are melee bruisers/tanks (if you play vayne/quinn/teemo top, go die in a fire). These champions have decent damage and good tankiness early, so they're not going to insta-kill each other early. As a result, you end up looking for little advantages constantly. Because it's an island, you usually have only yourself to rely on for winning the lane. It's a pure 1v1. Every little advantage you can eek out sticks because there's little else they can fall back on. In mid you play aggressive and dodge their skillshots. Because top has few of those flying around, it's all about positioning right to win every trade possible. Frequently in high elo, those trades never actually happen as both top laners know at all times who will win an trade in a given situation, and the losing party avoids it. In low elo, it's more fun because they don't actually avoid every fight possible.\n\nEssentially, top is about setting yourself up to win every 1v1 situation possible through tactical play and intelligent trading. Poke doesn't exist, you will almost always take damage back in any situation. It's just a matter of skill and tactics. That's fun to me, it's the purest lane, with heavier consequences due to lethal mistakes meaning you have to go back to lane still 1v1 with the enemy now really scary, but depending on your champion, rarely completely dooming the lane. You just have to be smarter. (as opposed to those midlaners who just have to dodge things to win trades. Maybe more mechanical skill, but less tactical skill).","replies":[{"poster":"WitchKing007","date":"2016-02-21T21:57:58.358+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Most champions in top lane are melee bruisers/tanks (if you play vayne/quinn/teemo top, go die in a fire)\"\n\nPreach!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shadow1712","date":"2016-02-20T20:53:31.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tactical decision summoner{{champion:99}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shadow Hazard","date":"2016-02-18T04:04:49.209+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"* Mid and bot are death zones\n* Champ pool is more favorable \n* I enjoy being more self reliant \n\nAlthough this current meta it is becoming much more stressful to be top lane, a lot of the top end champs are really annoying to deal with, becoming less outplay into pray for mistake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"weeaboomer","date":"2016-02-17T23:58:58.149+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only used to main it due to irelia.
