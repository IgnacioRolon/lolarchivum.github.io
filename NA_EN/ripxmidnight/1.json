League has cultivated a motivated and serious competitive playerbase. League has contributed to the rise of esports in the civilized world to the point where I have seen video game highlights on weekend ESPN. I've heard it said that North America has more unique League accounts than baseball players (from MLB all the way down through little league). League, as a game, is a huge success.\r\n\r\n**So then, why is there such motivation to change the winning formula?\r\n**\r\n\r\nFor almost five full years, there were very few major changes to the fundamentals of League of Legends. Yes, there were changes. Dodge chance didn't last very long, for example. Champions were tweaked and nerfed or buffed. Some items came and went. Artwork was updated. New champions were added. Nevertheless, these changes never felt like they changed the fundamental way that League of Legends was played. Even amidst the meta changes, It had always been the same game. That same game was, again, an undeniable and irrefutable success.\r\n\r\n**So then why change what has worked?\r\n**\r\n\r\nChange is necessary and natural and in many cases good. The fundamentals really changed first with the jungle: items/smite grew diverse, new camps/buffs were added. The S5 jungle changes were the first time it really felt like we needed to \"relearn\" how to play parts of the game. The echoes (pun intended) of that single fundamental change are still being felt; devourer has only recently been removed.\r\n\r\n**Think about how many other major changes have been introduced in the past calendar year:\r\n**\r\nJuggernauts\r\nADC reworks\r\nVision changes\r\nJungle timers\r\nDeath timers\r\nNew baron, dragon, herald buffs\r\nRanked queues\r\nChampion select\r\nNow, the Mage reworks\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are some others that are missing and others can correct me below. Every single one of these changes has affected the fundamental way that a League game is played. I've even seen the argument that Revive would be a valuable summoner spell, should it be reintroduced, because of the new death timers.\r\n\r\n**@Riot: Why are you so adamant about changing your game in major ways? What is the underlying motivation to change, rather than preserve, the formula that won you so much acclaim?**\r\n\r\nIt feels like you've spent half a decade creating the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. Sure, you've changed some things - an extra pinch of sugar, a slight adjustment of chips to dough ratio, the occasional nut or dark chocolate addition, but it's still a chocolate chip cookie and a damn good one at that. Season 6 though... it's like you're dumping in coconut and nutmeg and chili powder and caviar and all these new things. Meanwhile, you're telling us that your data supports your changes and that your product is going to be better because of it.\r\n\r\nAll I want is a goddamn chocolate chip cookie... and the fundamental League of Legends that got me here in the first place. It's the same shape as before, but it feels like a different game altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2016-05-09T21:05:16.611+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":7,"body":"Because winning formulas are often winning because they are innovative not stagnant.","replies":[{"poster":"RIPxMidnight","date":"2016-05-09T21:39:35.556+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":8,"body":"This is a great point and one with which I agree.\n\nLeague has always been innovative, but gradually.

If something goes wrong, you must minimize the damage done and focus on fixing the problem.\n\nAdding more changes for the sake of innovation before the previous changes have stabilised are going to lead to a disastrous situation where fixing anything will be nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nIn the end innovation is good, necessary even, but needs to be controlled and carefully planned.\n\nMy personal opinion is that too many changes have been pushed before stabilising the state of the game.

In league and those sports the win conditions haven't changed but the techniques(playstyles) have changed. When these sports started there were no \"Professionals\" there were just people who happened to be good and made a team. It wasn't a career before. That change was massive and changed what people expected from theses sports. If that change had never happened I don't think people would care nearly as much.\n\nA concrete example of other major changes would be curved blades on sticks in hockey. It used to be illegal to use a curved blade but that rule got changed, which literally changed how the game was played. It changed when people could pass, how far away they could shoot from, even how fast they could skate with the puck.

Aside from the enormous learning curve and the never ending introduction of new champions (which continually steepens the learning curve), there are WAY too many changes for it to ever be considered a traditional sport like baseball or soccer.  We've only had 5 seasons and the game has been changed and tweaked to oblivion.  It's drastically different from when it first began.  Can you imagine in 20 years, if league is even still around, what it would look like?  It probably wouldn't even look like League anymore.  You probably wouldn't even be able to recognize it.  And that's why it will never be adopted as or considered a traditional sport.  Just stop trying to make your pipe dream happen, Riot.  Stop balancing the game around the 0.1% of pro/competetive players and just go back to the way the game was years ago so it can maybe be fun again for the millions rather than the hundreds.","replies":[{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-05-10T19:02:00.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"implying that Riot hasn't balanced around diamond, challenger, and the pro season since the beginning of it...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-05-10T19:01:01.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"tell me again about the diverse champion pool in soccer, and the purchaseable items available to everyone that affect your stats. tell me about all the ways you can change the variables of the game as a player that aren't related to your skill.

If no other strategy was as effective as bunting all the time then the game would be boring because every player on every team would play the same. It would be fair but uninteresting to watch. League suffers greatly from oftentimes having a single winning strategy and the winners are the ones who can adapt and abuse that strategy best.

A lot of the stuff that we've gotten used to just kinda happened as a result of the meta or riot fixing abuse cases, so im glad to see them being more proactive as far as what the game looks like.\n\nFor example, the paper turrets were to stop lcs from being stallfests and we had to deal with that for ages. Now rito makes dragons and herald effective against towers explicitly or implicitly, creating a system that lets us have towers again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tubarao312","date":"2016-05-10T19:01:59.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because when I created my League account, Han Solo had not died yet...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pale Pirate","date":"2016-05-10T17:46:39.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought today's standard were \"there's always room for improvement\" and \"Innovation takes risk\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poske","date":"2016-05-10T17:24:38.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they want to improve it? \n\nThey do more good then bad \n\nWhile i consider mage rework to be overall bad\n\nI Think that Tower herald and dragon changes were fantastic","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-05-10T16:21:38.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta was actually super stale by 6.8, especially when watching pro games.

You can chance a ton of numbers, but some champions/mechanics/items will stay inherently toxic so that they have to either be very bad in 99% of the cases or abusable. Although I have often disagreed on details, I tend to like Riot's philosophy more than any other gaming company that I have experience with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Fidori","date":"2016-05-10T14:44:42.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\n\nBut when has is not been broke, according to some faction of players?

They now have a goal for the kind of game they want to make it into.  Since then they have been pushing towards this goal.  A second reason is that Riot is always trying to mix things up and keep them fresh and new and crazy.  Small changes only do so much to accomplish this.  With larger scale changes, you can keep things a lot fresher than with small changes.  One item that will help with this is the Rotating Game mode, if Riot could come out with more ideas like this that mixes up the formula on a regular basis, then they would be pretty heavily set for quite some time.","replies":[]}]}
