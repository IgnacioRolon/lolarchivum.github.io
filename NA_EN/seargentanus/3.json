When you stop thinking about winning individual games and rather improving your gameplay for the long term you'll realize it's in your best interest to focus on yourself individually and what you can do better rather than what your teammates are doing wrong.\n\n> Time and time again I've heard pro players say you can't control what teammates you get matched with or how well they play, the only thing you can control is how well you play personally.

The effective MMR of a premade is not just the average of the MMRs of the members.\n\nThe MMR might be wrong anyway, but it's not because Riot isn't taking premade-ness into account, but because that particular team is at a different point on the individual skill vs. team coordination spectrum compared to the average team.\n\nBeing skilled at League means more than one thing, or to put it another way, there's more than one skill that affects your chance of winning a game.  Individual mechanics are part of it, but coordinating with people you know well and coordinating with people you are playing with for the first time are both skills too (different from each other).\n\nThe real pain point that is affecting players like Scarra is the high cost of giving people role selection.

Op.gg the whole team, see who is best on what champs, figure out who is best where, then suggest a team composition that puts everyone in the best chance for success. You see this a lot from diamond+ players because its the most effective way to ensure maximum chance for success and a win. As you alluded to earlier, part of the problem with high level play is that Riot REMOVED this element of team coordination and cooperation from the lobby, discouraging teamwork in the process, and this hurts high elo players far more dramatically than low elo players. Most high elo players are willing to do what is required to give them the best chance to win, low level players with poor, selfish, attitudes never did this before and still aren't doing this now. It is a primary reason why they remain lower level players, its a team game and they refuse to act like a proper teammate.\n\nSo sure, it eliminated fighting over roles, but it also eliminated teamwork in the lobby, a key factor in succeeding and earning a W. This is obviously a net loss in a team game as the detrimental factor of eliminating the possibility of cooperative teamwork before the game even starts weighs heavier on the quality of game spectrum than players not cooperating out of selfishness or spite. Those types of players were never going to cooperate in the first place, were always going to degrade the quality of the games, and still do with the current system as it functions but now they are more difficult to identify and dodge. This has a negative impact on quality players with good team skills and completely invalidates what is usually the best skill they have: organizing an effective strategy with the team. Ultimately, we traded not fighting for roles (something high level players didn't usually do any ways) for lower quality games and pairings (something that effects high level players far more than low level players). In the end its a net loss and not much of an accomplishment since it contributes further flaws to an already severely flawed ranking system.

Things are not always cut and dry simple. Its not a lie just because it displeases you.\n\n\nNo, its a lie because its a lie... its literally that simple. When they told us in January on like the 28th that we would have solo q back in about 2 weeks as a solo only q and here we stand 5 months later and we now are told its not happening at all, that's a lie. Those were the words of Riot, straight from Riot. \"You will be getting a solo only q back in about 2 weeks\". That's quoted. We do not have it, and now are never getting it. Its pretty cut and dry, pretty simple. Its a lie. An out and out lie. Just like when they said we would get lol replay 5 years back. Or when we were promised skin prices would never go over 975 RP in the future 4 years back. Or like when we were told we would have sandbox mode last season. Those are things the company straight up told us we would get. And then recanted that later. That's called a lie.\n\nYou can continue to ignore that this company does this to its player base every single day. Or you can be observant and realize this company is doing this. The choice is yours really, and so is the choice to continue to play. But it doesn't change facts. Facts are facts. History is history. Those are things that have happened. Those are things that continue to happen. There are no two ways about it. Riot is a company that lies consistently to its playerbase about anything and everything. Why? Who honestly knows, but they make the decisions they make for one single reason. Every decision, every time, is made with the intention of improving the company revenue. There are no other factors involved. This is a for profit company, that's why they care about, profit. Its no different from any big business nor any of the smaller businesses that I run myself. I don't give a shit about the employees, I don't really care about my customers, I care only that I can earn enough to continue to feed, cloth, and house my family. That is the nature of business.","replies":[{"poster":"Gene Imori","date":"2016-06-01T03:20:19.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you're confusing Riot for our government.","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2016-06-01T04:02:18.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gene Imori,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wV9tAKA7,comment-id=0006000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-01T03:20:19.450+0000)\n>\n> I think you&#x27;re confusing Riot for our government.\n\nNah, they act about the same. Such is the nature of a laisssez faire economy in a Republic. That's just the natural way of things, corruption and greed become the primary driving forces in that environment as those two qualities offer the greatest return on the investment in terms of wealth and power. History of human societies proves this time and again, our own nation just being the latest in a long line of societal and governmental failures that ultimately bring our species closer to extinction.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"theDeblin","date":"2016-06-01T07:22:51.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have, in fact, worked in a comparable technical field.
