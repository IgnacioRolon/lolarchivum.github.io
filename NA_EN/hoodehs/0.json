I did notice, however, that Kindred's champion display page did show Shadowfire kindred as \"Unavailable.\" It's possible that the bug is limited to a display issue. In any case, the PBE Team may have more context on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"hoodehs","date":"2015-10-06T01:17:22.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, just checked and it was displayed on the Skin page in the store, which it wasn't before. Very unusual, no idea what could have caused this. And I should have guessed there was a PBE specific board, guess I just wasn't thinking. Hopefully this is just a one time issue on my side and nothing else :P","replies":[]}]}]}
