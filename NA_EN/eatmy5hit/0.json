That isn't to say that you can't succeed with him or he doesn't have his matchups - but in general I cringe when I see him picked on my team and grin when the enemy has him.\n\nHere is a random source to back up my anecdotal personal experience: http://champion.gg/statistics/#?roleSort=ADC&sortBy=general.winPercent&order=descend","replies":[]}]}
