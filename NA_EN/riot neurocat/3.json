As a forewarning, the changes below **are not shipping**.\n\nBy &ldquo;clothesline&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m referring to the pre-2013 rework Karma ability, where [her tether affected enemies and allies that passed through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l59mZOi0NBc&amp;t=60). This is a pretty unique mechanic in League, and we wanted to see if we could give Karma something unique gameplay-wise, so the direction seemed valuable. However, we did intentionally move away from it in 2013 - to quote us, &ldquo;Spirit Bond&rsquo;s &ldquo;clothesline&rdquo; gameplay is really cool, but it&rsquo;d work better on a tank champion that has an easier time jumping into the fray&rdquo;. We wanted to validate or invalidate this, since Karma&rsquo;s role and League in general has changed significantly over the last 5 years.\n&nbsp;\n\nFor the first iteration, we took the old clothesline and refined the spell to the most fun parts to play with. Karma&rsquo;s old W hasted allies and slowed enemies on contact - however, the gameplay around maneuvering it into enemies was much richer than the gameplay around your allies running through it, so we focused on versions that only clothesline&rsquo;d enemies to keep the spell clean. Additionally, the clothesline play is reasonably difficult to pull off, especially in an uncoordinated environment, so we attached a higher reward to successful plays - roots and stuns over slows. [Here&rsquo;s the first version in action.](https://imgur.com/QXNnrLs) \n\nThis version was fun, but had some issues. First, the level of attention that it required was high. If Karma put it on an ally, they would need to know what was happening and position themselves well to get the best effect, which can be difficult in a hectic teamfight. When thrown onto an enemy, they could easily misplay by running too close to an ally, accidentally stunning their friend. Karma, as a backline mage, didn&rsquo;t have a ton of control over the movement of the tether unless she was willing to put herself at significant risk or had the luck of a super well coordinated ally. \n&nbsp;\n\nIn the next iteration, we wanted to put a lot more control into the Karma player&rsquo;s hands. First, we removed the ability to attach it to enemies, and replaced that with a free target cast. If she didn&rsquo;t have an ally to attach to, she could separate her own spirit from her body (as a pet) and have it move towards a position, giving her some control around both ends of the clothesline. This however, would still put Karma in danger if she wanted full control over the play, so we made the mantra give her a fairly reliable amount of safety. On mantra cast, she would gain massive damage reduction and movespeed towards enemies for a few seconds, and she could recast the spell to &ldquo;spirit walk&rdquo; to the other end of her tether. [It looked something like this. ](https://imgur.com/QTaxTZb)\n\nThis version was quite cool, but still had some issues. Giving Karma safety on her Mantra was working as intended (folks made some really awesome Rakan-esque plays), but Karma players **didn&rsquo;t want** to dive into the backline to execute well on the spell. When Karma wasn&rsquo;t diving, the large ally coordination burden was still a pretty large issue in our tests. \n&nbsp;\n\nThe last large iteration we tested was different, trying to push the clothesline in an entirely new direction. Rather than having limited control over your spirit and full control over your own movement, we tried a version where on cast, Karma&rsquo;s inputs would control her spirit&rsquo;s movement while her own body was channeling (with the ability to cancel the channel if need be). In this way, she could remain on the backline while maneuvering the clothesline with less risk. A natural extension from this was the ability for her to &ldquo;proxy-cast&rdquo; from her spiritual projection, which we also prototyped. However, this mechanic ended up dominating the interaction (though was pretty fun to play), [as you can see in this gif.](https://imgur.com/wLvwB3A)\n\nAfter this, we realized we were veering pretty hard away from the core promise of the clothesline mechanic, and thus put it into the icebox to explore different directions on Karma. In the end, we aren&rsquo;t shipping the clothesline on Karma, but honestly, our playtesters had a ton of fun with it in the versions we tried. I could see this mechanic being really successful and fun with characters that have reliable ability to get into the backline, have flanking patterns, and/or have high mobility. \n&nbsp;\n\nHope this was an interesting look into our design process. I&rsquo;ll be around periodically if you have any questions.\n\n-NeuroCat","replies":[{"poster":"IxtaliKing","date":"2018-10-01T21:58:01.813+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"That last version looks like a pretty fun spell.

It is very interesting to see the spirit form versions. I had not thought of those ideas. The last implementation feels like it might work well on Morde of all things.\n\n Clothesline was the biggest part of old Karma that necessitated a rework. It's worth noting that it worked best with _melee_ champions in duo fights. Imagine a Xin or Irelia whose dashes put them into or past the enemy model. W procs immediately and off stuff they already want to do. A Garen just runs past with Q dash speed, procs, then Q Es on a slowed target because his Q (iirc) doesn't put him into the enemy model.\n\nIn contrast ranged champions with dashes had to put themselves greatly at risk to utilize the slow and damage of W. Something that could win a trade if they knew to do it (cause they'd also be close enough to shield bomb off of, so you'd get 2 extra damage spells in not just w). But as you said, burden of knowledge. They wouldn't and so old Karma support had a terrible time with terrible peel and only being able to use 40% of her kit.\n\nSo I do want to ask._ Did you test a handcuff shape?_ By that I mean, a tether between two targets and a small radius around both being the hit zone. And by small I mean small, like shorter then sunfire cape radius. There's a huge difference between having to run past an enemy (especially with champions being circles) and having to run _into_ an enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot NeuroCat","date":"2018-10-03T18:59:51.044+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, all of the iterations had this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ilandria","date":"2018-10-03T16:10:37.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"clothesline\" thing was great with ranged champions or divers, the only thing it wasn't the best on was any champion that liked to position in the middle of the fight between the two teams. Karma was durable enough that she could be in the front of her team but not in the middle of the enemy team. Using that positioning you could tether to anyone going all-in on your team to support them, or you could tether to one of the ranged champions on your team to help peel the enemies that were diving them. If you tethered anyone on or going to the outskirts of either team and positioned yourself centrally that gave you almost all of the control over the tether.\n\nEither situation made full use of her W clothesline, Q's heal/damage, and her passive due to having put herself in a position where she'll take damage but not have to tank 5 people at once. There's a weird misconception about how her old kit played and that it was 100% useless unless you had a prophetic melee diver on your team. At worst she was slightly more reliant on her team member's positioning than other supports were, but absolutely nothing anywhere near close to as bad as everyone seems to insist upon.\n\nIt's also worth considering the fact that most of the time if her team member wasted Karma's W, it was quite often because the enemy blinked/flashed/etc. away or the carry you were trying to peel for chased the threat off. Both of those things could often be accounted for by the Karma player by playing the fight ahead a few seconds in their mind before using the W. Sure, there are times it was wasted, but nothing anywhere close to the apocalyptic levels everyone wants to enforce on it.\n\nI legitimately think the old kit was only \"bad\" because in season 2 and before, everyone was still bad at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2018-10-04T00:57:01.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are correct. I do not mean to suggest she needed a melee diver. Just that melee divers didn't really need to know how Karma worked to prove useful for Karma. The main burden on a melee diver was knowing the rhythm of trades (Karma wanted to do a quick trade then back off for about 6 seconds for cooldowns, then re-initiate before enemies long cooldowns came back) and even that was something easier to work around for the Karma player in soloQ situations.\n\nI wished to put forth how large the gap _could_ be for old Karma. There was certainly some middle ground between the two extremes. Though in what experience I had with her, her Q range was a bit too short to safely utilize into two enemy ranged without getting heavily chunked.\n\nWhile I agree that people being \"bad\" was part of it in season 2. The itemization of the time is a major factor as well. During that period of time it was pretty plausible for a support to end a game with 0 AP. Now support can reliably get to 100-200 ap while technically getting support items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2018-10-02T04:58:20.624+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted to add some numbers.\n\nOld Karma's abilities and scalings are still on lol wiki under history tab - previous abilities.\n\nAt lvl 3 Karma had a pretty solid spike. You could have two mantra charges ready for hitting lvl 3 and attempt an all in with a duo partner. One point in Q, W, E.\n\nQ lvl 1 did 70 + .6 ap; W lvl 1 did 80 + .7 ap; E did 80 + .8 ap. Q was short range cone; W required clothesline; E required you to use mantra and was short ranged.\n\nNow that level 3 all in could be a burst of 230 damage + 2.1 ap _and_ an 80 + .8 health shield. You could also delay the Q to get it's \"scaling with missing health\" heal into the mix. Oh and that burst is totally AoE and can affect both enemies in an ideal case.\n\nIf an ally is ranged and stays at max range. You do not get mantra E to hit anything worthwhile. You also do not proc W. You get to waddle forward as the only target for two ranged to unload on for 70 + .6 ap damage. Or you hang back and only get the 80 health shield and a mantra Q in.\n\nSo that's the shape of level 3 fights for old Karma. Her best case scenario is over x3 as much done _numerically_ then her worse case scenario. 70 vs 230x2 damage. Not including how well she uses her passives ap or mantra q heal.\n\nIn team fights what mattered is if old Karma was able to scale into gold and levels.  As, primarily, a support during her time frame she didn't get either. Assuming 400 AP and lvl 18. She'd be entering fights applying a 135 + 13% targets missing health heal to her entire team while dealing 510 AoE dmg with a single mantra Q. She could burst a total of 1695 AoE including W proc and a mantra E. Contrast that with being way down in levels, not having enough gold for 2 items because of ward costs, and teammates not proccing her W.\n\nQuite a gap between best case and worst case. Entirely hinging on team mates providing her opportunities. While existing in a time before Riot allowed support to have gold generation and items.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kadexe","date":"2018-10-03T18:16:55.069+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"That last version is really cool and I'd love to see it on a champion in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2018-10-01T22:05:23.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just change W outright.

If I want a pure support I can go something like Soraka or Braum.\n\nLulu is similar in this position to Karma.\nWhy keep her passive?  Pix can be blocked by minions when she harasses enemy champions, only serving to push the lane.  It also encouraged people to try out on-hit builds even when whimsy gave AP rather than attack speed.\nWhy allow her shield to be cast on enemies?  It is almost always better to cast on allies anyway.\nWhy should Lulu get an attack speed buff and speed boost AND polymorph?  It only serves to give misclick opportunities and overloads her kit.\nHer ult being castable on herself also ruins her support role.

More like on someone who wants to dive into enemies and someone who is tanky enough. Old Karma WAS tanky because of her survivability and she could you it and dealt damage. Present Karma stands on backline but she is suppose to find harmony between being agressive and passive(like in her history :] ), so just standing on the backline to shields allies and poking enemies is fine as long as she needs to risk a bit sometimes. Her W is not that long, so she brings herself to danger now and this is good, but sometimes(especially when you are behind) W feels weak.  Maybe it's too much time to snear enemies jumping on you or your adc or when you want to snear them is really easy to kill Karma. Jumping to her W'd ghost is not something for enchating-poke mage. She doesn't want to dive.\n\nThird way:\nLooks cool, really. But Karma is not like pet-control mage. With that change it looks like Karmas would focus on their ghost to shot their Qs from longer safe distance or to get as close as they can to enemies' carry and shot Mantrad Q easy without taking too much risk than just use it to snear as much enemies as they can. It interesting playstyle, but I don't think it compares that good with Karma. Snearing more enemies with tether? Nice. Shooting Q from safe place? Nice, but just for Karma, not the enemies(as long as ghost doesn't have hp bar, but with being destroyable it seems a bit nonsense). Casting shields from ghost or Karma range? Or both? And one of the spells is just empowering her other spells. Idea of that ghost mechanic is nice but not so good at Karma's kit ;)\n\nFor me those changes are something I want to see \nI'd like to see actual passive being a Mantra's passive and Karma getting another one. When you have your Mantra there are no passive, but that passive is what makes her not to  require charges for Mantra. In late game you can have 2-3 or more Mantras at teamfight and this is something I really like. I'd give her a bit shorter cooldown on early levels(just a little bit shorter) or gives her passive additional 0,5 second on first levels.\n\nAnd something I would REALLY APPRECIATE to see:\nHealing herself AT START of W's animation not at the end of it. I really like you changed in 2013 from healing over time to instant at cast and the end of the spell, but as you said Karma needed it instantly. I had a lot of times where that W casting animation killed me, because it heals after animation. It's less than a second but still it has an impact. I would really, really appreciate if this change happens. Or make first 20% missing heal instantly and the second 20% over time of being tied to the enemy. \nIf there are no changes for W now, those things I'm speaking of I believe could give her just a little bit of power for now.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy you gave up on those changes but I like changing something in her W. Focused Resolve would be good candidate for changes but also moving her passive to Mantra and giving her something new would be okay.\n\nI believe you can make something really nice to my favourite champions. Thanks again for some information. \n\n\n{{champion:43}}  \"We have learned as much as we have suffered.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Harpie Lady","date":"2018-10-03T03:56:28.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really love that last reiteration.

It's basically an inverse version of Karma sending out her spirit, and it works because of Pyke's ridiculously good healing off gray health, which makes this super safe except against high burst or grievous wounds.\n\nDon't misunderstand, I think Pyke is great, and aside from some kind of nerf on his gray health, he offers a useful and exciting strategic niche that I was initially worried he'd share with Thresh.\n\nMy first point is the two of them take up a LOT of design space as far as catchers go, and it seems like the Pyke design team already solved the Karma tether problem.\n\nThat said, it seems like your goal is to make Karma an Enchanter. Tethersand clotheslines strike me as a clearly intrinsically Catcher ability; Pyke has his E, Morgana the Catcher/Mage has her R. Do you and Karma players really want her going down this route? Or is her identity an Enchanter more tied to buffing, debuffing, and zoning with the Q nuke?\n\nMy second point is these two directions seem at odds with one another. If she has Catcher abilities _AND_ buffs/shields, she runs the risks of an overloaded kit, and ending up here again in 12-18 months after a cascade of nerfs.\n\nThresh's shield is on his high CD ally escape tool, so you're punished for using it just for the shield. Morgana also has a restrictive CD, and it only shields magic damage and CC, so if you use it to follow up on every Q catch, you won't have it when you need to soak a jungler's or other support's CC. \n\nIf Karma gets some sort of clothesline, hook, or tether, it mandates any shield she has to be just as limited in application, or she'll end up back like she is now. Too limited, and she'll lack any kind of unique gameplay. I wonder how Karma players feel about dropping it entirely, so more power can be allocated elsewhere in her kit. Maybe the Q could get hard CC, or Inspire/Defiance makes the target Ghosted (move through units).","replies":[]},{"poster":"deadstinger1999","date":"2018-10-02T09:03:15.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like a really cool move but we have to consider the fact that she is already great in the game with her harass and all that.....As a Karma main I would love this change so much but pls don't over do it like u did with zoe RIOT !!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kiiroi Kensuke","date":"2018-10-02T08:32:30.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, this is such a great job, I’m pertty excited.

I was really hopeful for the clotheslining to return because it's  one of the most unique mechanic that Karma had and the only one left that doesn't exist in some kind of a form in the game, possessed by other champs.\n\n> For the first iteration, we took the old clothesline and refined the spell to the most fun parts to play with. Karma’s old W hasted allies and slowed enemies on contact - however, the gameplay around maneuvering it into enemies was much richer than the gameplay around your allies running through it, so we focused on versions that only clothesline’d enemies to keep the spell clean. Additionally, the clothesline play is reasonably difficult to pull off, especially in an uncoordinated environment, so we attached a higher reward to successful plays - roots and stuns over slows. Here’s the first version in action.\nThis version was fun, but had some issues. First, the level of attention that it required was high. If Karma put it on an ally, they would need to know what was happening and position themselves well to get the best effect, which can be difficult in a hectic teamfight. When thrown onto an enemy, they could easily misplay by running too close to an ally, accidentally stunning their friend. Karma, as a backline mage, didn’t have a ton of control over the movement of the tether unless she was willing to put herself at significant risk or had the luck of a super well coordinated ally.\n\nI can see why it would work better on tanks especially when your allies don't pay attention to the ability. Karma is probably too squishy to risk re-positioning closer to her enemies. But I personally never really looked at the clothesline mechanic as something easy to pull out. Considering how much team-fight potential it would have it would look unfair to be easy.\nI always thought that it's something that all players have to consider but never occupy their mind all the time. Yes, sometimes the enemies or allies would forget about it and it's totally fine. This is precisely why I think it should be hard...and risky. That is where the trade off is.\nBut I do understand at the same time why it would be unsatisfying especially considering how much lack of control it has. Way too hard in lower elos meanwhile way too overbearing in higher and competitive play.\n\n> In the next iteration, we wanted to put a lot more control into the Karma player’s hands. First, we removed the ability to attach it to enemies, and replaced that with a free target cast. If she didn’t have an ally to attach to, she could separate her own spirit from her body (as a pet) and have it move towards a position, giving her some control around both ends of the clothesline. This however, would still put Karma in danger if she wanted full control over the play, so we made the mantra give her a fairly reliable amount of safety. On mantra cast, she would gain massive damage reduction and movespeed towards enemies for a few seconds, and she could recast the spell to “spirit walk” to the other end of her tether. It looked something like this.\nThis version was quite cool, but still had some issues. Giving Karma safety on her Mantra was working as intended (folks made some really awesome Rakan-esque plays), but Karma players didn’t want to dive into the backline to execute well on the spell. When Karma wasn’t diving, the large ally coordination burden was still a pretty large issue in our tests.\n\nI find too much resemblance between this iteration and Pyke's E. I also agree that it isn't Karma's thing to dive the backline. It does look kinda interesting though not gonna lie.\n\n> The last large iteration we tested was different, trying to push the clothesline in an entirely new direction.

But you state some really fair reasons why it didn't work out. It makes her feel too much like a mixure of a backline and \"pet control\" mage.\n\n\n\nI also have a question for you NeuroCat. In your post you mention Karma a lot as a backline mage. For me a backline mage is an artillery mage or you can also interpret that, in Karma's case, as someone who stays behind and spams shields and bonds to her allies. I am pretty sure the community or at least majority of the people stated they were against it. I mean what else can you do except spam RQs or/and shields if you stay in the backline? It feels way too binary. Or am I interpreting it the wrong way? Could you clarify?\n\nAgain thank you so much for all the attempts to bring back something unique to the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadgerDrool","date":"2018-10-02T04:32:38.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Karma's passive and Mantra cooldown are the most frustrating parts of the kit for me. So I'm fairly hopeful about these other things you've tested and can't reveal yet.\n\nTo clarify, her passive doesn't exist when Mantra is off cooldown and encourages risky aggression when on cooldown. Its feast or famine based on how safely Karma can get auto attacks and Qs in. The famine part feels really bad on places like ARAM when the enemy team is all ranged.\n\nThis is also why I've played way less Karma since Ultimate Hats removal. It just felt so good to have Mantra with a good base cooldown earlier in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solidair3","date":"2018-10-01T23:11:24.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I feel like this is about what I expected from any look into the tether.
