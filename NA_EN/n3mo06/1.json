An 8-second cooldown on Q doesn't do that; situationally longer cooldown than Nidalee Pounce, but longer range, and I think quicker animation.

But Titanic and Black Cleaver grant an amount of AD that's rather similar to pure AD items, therefore if her scalings get buffed she'll be even stronger with her kit than before. Since AD means % health true damage (#healthyritomechanics) for Fiora, she doesn't need anything a melee carry would also need. That is critchance, armor pen (mostly flat to deal with squishies). Where people would rather buy Youmuu's for an assassin, Fiora doesn't care. She can get both AD and tankiness with an item that is perfectly balanced for other champions but stupid on Fiora due to her kit.\n\nBuffing scalings won't change anything. Tanky Fiora has insane amounts of AD lategame\n{{item:3047}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3072}} ?\nThat's rather bruisery, for what? 350,400 AD?\n\nBuffing her scalings will NOT work, people. Remove the %health true damage and change it to physical (with potentially some free arpen to be nice, but not too much).\nThat way she has to actually build some other stats than raw stupid AD to be a monster and be able to build bruisery with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoMNia","date":"2016-01-26T10:51:43.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=N3mO06,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=im5KFmMm,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-01-25T16:37:03.366+0000)\n>\n> Can someone explain to me why she has   345 base M.Speed  when She has a closegap every 2 sec (if it hits an enemy and  a little bit of CDR) m.speed extra from her passive and strong slow on her E and W?\n\nEasy: She's trash if she can't hit the vitals. She has to be able to literally run circles around her opponent, or the whole minigame of her passive is irrelevant and she becomes vastly less effective. Fiora, unlike Riven, doesn't have 4 rapid-fire untargeted dashes, and can only move that quickly in combat. \"Tank Fiora\" isn't a thing. She is a fighter. Fighters build defensively, but they are NOT tanks. Tank Ekko was a thing because he could build full tank and still contribute a large amount of utility and significant damage. Fiora building full tank is pretty much useless, as she has nowhere near Ekko's level of utility and only deals a lot of damage if she builds for it. She doesn't deal enormous damage at all stages of the game. Her early game, pre-item damage isn't very good at all, and she relies on hitting vitals to win trades before running away (because she won't win a sustained fight before her first back — at least not since her base stats were nerfed). So, not only is Tank Fiora not a problem, but it's not even a thing that happens.\n\nP.S.— Abusing the term \"overloaded\" does you no credit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UrPalAl","date":"2016-01-26T06:01:01.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just use the Ekko treatment:\n\nBuff ratios, nerf base","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sypher The Poro","date":"2016-01-26T02:23:18.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about {{champion:104}} top?
