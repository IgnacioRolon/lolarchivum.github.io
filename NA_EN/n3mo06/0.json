It&#039;s a bit early to base his general power  on these data but it&#039;s a bit early to call him broken too or ask for a nerf, without proper compensations.\n\nthe same reasoning should be applied to other rework.\n\nI know playing against this rengar is frustating and way too snowball, but  I&#039;m sure Riot will find a way to balance him in 1-3 patches, maybe even giving him an higher skill base. \nI&#039;m the first one who doesn&#039;t  love this rework, but I don&#039;t think all these &#039;trash-post&#039; about how broken Rengar is now, will help riot&#039;s team to find a way to balance him.\n\nSo Remember: always argued and make suggestions\nLet&#039;s be productive!","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-13T13:45:17.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is the largest feast or famine champ every conceived.

I like this playstyle a lot more than the previous one, but I don't like the new LeBlanc for example. People have to get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Draknar","date":"2016-11-14T00:57:34.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wondering, what do you like more about his playstyle?\nIn my opinion, they turned him into a mindless Q-press-instakill machine.\nAt least, before rework, you had to work your ass to pull out a lot of tricks.\n\nI got insane scores like in the range of triple-Q Rengar era, but all the fun is gone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Draknar","date":"2016-11-14T00:51:33.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are not the only one, bro.
