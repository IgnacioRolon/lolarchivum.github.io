It literally shows you where it is going, and has a very long cast time, and cooldown. And the slow really isn't too massive. Personally I think jinx was fine where she was, and didn't need a huge buff, but I doubt it will really affect winrate all that much.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-03-22T22:24:19.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget a really thin hitbox.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheHappyReaperz","date":"2017-03-22T20:57:04.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering you used Aatrox, a champion who when behind, is literally of the same use as an aggressive minion, it really diminishes the OP factor of the change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dunder kill","date":"2017-03-22T20:53:13.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's 2017 and you're still caving to shit clickbait YouTube videos","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolipopevelynn","date":"2017-03-22T22:46:50.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she would have done the same thing with rockets, and rockets are aoe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gl√Ætchy","date":"2017-03-22T22:28:14.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm hoping as part of this april fools, they delete {{champion:55}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:21}} and {{champion:105}} permanently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GankedByWindows","date":"2017-03-22T22:23:16.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at the video score dude.

Sure, it's a skillshot, but it's not even that hard to hit, even with a delay because of the deceptive hitbox. I can't fathom how anyone on the balance team would think that it would be reasonable to give a spell with a 140% AD ratio the ability to crit. It's literally going to be old Miss Fortune Q but even more broken if this buff goes through.","replies":[]}]}
