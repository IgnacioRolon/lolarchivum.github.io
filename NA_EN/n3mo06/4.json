So if one enemy dives you under your tower, you'd think you'd have a 2v1 advantage. But when two people dive you, it doesn't quite feel like a 2v2. In the 2 perso dive situation the tower feels like half a champion, so it's more like 1.5 vs 2. I'm thinking that towers should have an ability similar to Irelias passive that it gets stronger the more outnumbered it is, with a defending champion. So if you die under tower, it won't get weak until the aggro has been disconnected from enemy champions.

If they don't then it's better just to pick someone like Lee or Elise who can burst under tower and easily drop aggro, it already is better to pick these champs anyway, so this would just exasperate the problem.\n\nWhat towers need is more flat pen and more ramping damage. This would dissuade tanks somewhat, you wouldn't be able to just face tank 2 towers in the same way Naut did in that clip, but it would still allow tanks to tank out towers in dives.
