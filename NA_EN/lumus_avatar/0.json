This is a cosmetics bug as opposed to a functionality bug, but it seems important when paying for a skin.\n\nReproduction: I played an entire game on Summoner's Rift in custom mode with no enemy to test this as I had seen it posted by other users. I am confirming, here, their findings.\n\nGame date: 10-17-2014\nServer: NA\nChampion: Sona\nSkin: Arcade\nIssue: Particle effects around edge of auras not visible to controlling player\nPriority: Low (cosmetic)\nImpairs Functionality: No\nImpairs Clarity: No\n\nEDIT:\nI have recently had other players messaging me with reports that this bug exists beyond the NA server. At least one person from EUW has experienced it as well.\n\nI just assumed that all servers saw the same thing and so fixing it in one place would fix it everywhere, but that's just speculation on my part. Just doing what I can to help the playerbase at large by adding this section.\n\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-10-17T18:35:57.423+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
