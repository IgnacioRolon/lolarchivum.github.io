You guys perma banned it, but I'd definitely like to have the name back. It's the gamer tag I've used in all of my accounts on any games and would greatly like it back. Let me know what I can do about this because I thought I read somewhere that even though the account is permanently banned you guys don't have a way to give the name back.\r\n\r\nAlso you riot employees have told me at least a thousand times I'm not getting it back for \"hacks\" (which never existed salt salt), so I assume that could open up a possibility for giving the name at the very least to me? Again lemme know please. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-22T22:21:04.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish I had better news, but sadly there isn't any way I can release the name and let you have it for your new account.  I definitely understand that you associate with that name as your gamertag, but that gamertag is also associated with behavior that ruined the gaming experience of hundreds of players. When we permanently ban an account, we also lock the name as well. \n\nIf it was a level 30 account, you'll have to wait 2.5 years before it is released again to be taken.","replies":[{"poster":"NtHKrC5jPu","date":"2016-06-23T01:00:16.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh.
