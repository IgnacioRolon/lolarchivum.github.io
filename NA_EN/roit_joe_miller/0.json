How can my password for my other account be changed without sending a request email to my verified email address?

Since the password reset email never went to the email you registered the account to, it sounds like the email may have been changed as well.\n\nYour best bet would be to reach out to our account agents through our [Account Recovery Form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416).
