I tried to see the positives in this rework man, I really tried.\n\nFirst off, yes, I'm gonna cite statistics about post-rework Sona. Don't take my word for them, look for yourself http://www.lolking.net/champions/sona&region=all&map=sr&queue=1x1&league=diamond#statistics\n\n Here's my major take-away points about the rework:\n\n - After the dust has settled Sona's win % is significantly down from what it was before. Especially at higher-level play.\n - Every time a champion has a major change there's a massive spike in the amount of play that champions sees (as people test out the changes). In this case, however, the change-induced popularity died off *really* fast. To my mind this means that people tried out the rework and, in most cases, quickly decided they did not like new Sona.\n - Unless I've missed something (I may have, I don't follow esports very closely), Sona is still not seeing any play at all at a competitive level.\n\nOn some slightly less objective notes:\n\n - New Sona is *even more* team dependent than old Sona was, and causes a lot of awkward/frustrating situations where the Sona player is sitting there going \"we could be doing so much better if my ADC would just take *one* step closer to me!\"\nThis feels *terrible* for the Sona player--the outcome of most of his/her plays is more dependent on the skill of the rest of the team than on Sona's skill.\n - Some of Sona's skills are now really unclear/awkward on how to optimally use them:\n- Her heal/shield. A shield is generally best when put on early in an engagement (so it absorbs the max amount of damage) but her heal is clearly most beneficial when used late in an engagement (increased heal by missing hp %). But Sona always procs the heal *before* (or simultaneously) the shield. Thus you can never get the full benefit out of the skill.\n- Her speed boost. It seems like this would be good to use so you can \"tag\" others with auras more easily, but you can't easily use the other auras and the speed boost at the same time. Awkward.\n\nChanges I would suggest:\n\n - Buff her base move speed. This will make 'tagging' allies easier and generally make her less team-dependent.\n - Return at least some of her early damage.\n - I would be willing to give up the passive ability on her ult. It's a great skill without the passive. Right now she just feels like half a character pre-6.\n - Please, for the love of all that is cute and fuzzy, do NOT create 'tank Sona'\n\nNaturally not *everything* is bad, and not everyone dislikes it as much as I do. I'm still quite happy to see Sona's ult now has a graphic that actually matches the hitbox. I'm sure that if this topic generates discussion  we'll see at least one person weighing in to say they like new Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2014-09-04T05:23:14.407+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":15,"body":"Hey all, just wanted to hop in here and say that I have read this post and have been thinking about what next steps Sona needs or can support.

I can't commit to anything, but I did want to let everyone know that we've still been talking about Sona, and we do want to make sure she's satisfying, even if she's not in need of straight buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2014-09-04T22:26:39.163+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realize that since this \"rework\" she has not been picked a single time in pro play, right? Her win rates keep going down as time passes, not up. She's far too easy to counter and completely shut down which is why she wasn't picked a single time in pro play. Hell, in the last week she hasn't been played a single time in Challenger for obvious reasons.\n\nOld Sona was more successful since it wasn't this easy to make her irrelevant throughout the entire game. Not to mention her early game was not a joke.\n\nWhy did your team decide to rework a champion no one was asking to be reworked? She was very rarely picked at high level play but at least she had a niche which couldn't be 100% shut down with little effort.\n\nHow's that for justification for straight buffs? And a 49% win rate is not what I consider to be \"winning\", that's what it is this week at high Elo (minus Challenger because her pick rate is 0% as I said).\n\nOh and here's what 99% of us will tell you: IT FEELS HORRIBLE PLAYING AS SONA NOW!

It does the exact same things it did before, but with lower numbers and more frustration to the player and their team.

W always healed and reduced incoming damage, but now it heals less and mitigates a smaller portion of said damage.  E was always a speed boost, it's just a really bad one now.  Not to mention all of these abilities have had their range reduced to 1/3, so now Sona has to choose, does she play a bad game of tag or focus on her positioning?  She can't do both at once.\n\nThen there are other things like the blatant Staccato nerf, increased CDs, mana costs and a nerf to her early base stats.\n\nBasically, I'm saying she's exactly the same as before, but weaker.  **This was not a rework, this was a nerf.**  Plain and simple.\n\nIt would be like changing Vayne's Silver Bolts to a magic DoT and reducing its overall amount whilst still only applying every 3rd shot and calling it a \"rework.\"  Excuse me for failing to understand how slapping a new uglier coat of paint on something can be called a \"rework\" rather than just a blatant nerf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NotBurnage","date":"2014-09-04T22:52:09.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that explains it.

She still has a decent win rate in bronze, but in diamond she's been just above 48% this past week.\n\nIt also appears that many of her stats on LoLking are *still falling*.

The entire power of her kit (except her ult and powerchord burst) is locked away into allies getting into the aura zone and getting buffed.  Helping only one ally (for example in-lane) is Sona at 1/5 of her power, and it feels awful.  I say 1/5 because even though Sona always gives herself a buff, it's not really always relevant to the situation.  It doesn't matter if Sona gives herself a speedbuff or shield if your carry is the one who's in danger of being killed.\n\n\nI think the evidence of this is proven by the most popular pro picks: Nami, Braum, Lulu, Thresh. \n- Lulu: all single target buffs, single target STRONG CC (polymorph, 80% slow).  \n- Thresh - Amazing kit, incomparable to Sona. \n- Nami - Not exactly single target, but might as well be.  Bubble is a small focused aoe , single target on-hit damage buff, two target heal.  Passive speedboost.\n- Braum - Can easily facilitate strong CC (passive stun), single and self target resist boost, single direction massive damage reduction.\n\n\nSona is actually quite similar to Nami, and yet Nami feels far more impactful, despite Sona's theoretical potential numbers to be higher.  The power of the aoe is simply wasted.\n\n\nIt worked in the past because her OP invisible auras carried things through, but now that they're balanced her gameplay becomes too dependant on how many allies you affect.","replies":[{"poster":"Origami Kaiju","date":"2014-09-05T00:47:24.125+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">Sona is actually quite similar to Nami, and yet Nami feels far more impactful, despite Sona's theoretical potential numbers to be higher.

It's a fair middle ground between old and new Sona and the changes actually allow us to be more active with her. There would be few arguments that could be had against it if implemented and she would not only be viable again, but still fairly balanced.\n\nSona in her current form didn't go far enough to make being active effective or wise. Then you have to decide whether to rush Sightstone or Chalice in laning phase which isn't something I have to worry about with anyone else. I use Lulu, Braum, Morgana, (and Karma on occasion.) The buffs I recommend are a fair compromise between your vision and what we want I think. I'm not trying to speak for all Sona users here because some hate the rework too much to bother, but I'm trying to be fair here. Why treat buffs like they have cancer? She wouldn't become toxic.\n\nThen, say there are no buffs made, you'd have to rework her again and where can you really go from here? Opinions are mixed on the new Sona, but you can't deny there is a massive portion of Sona users who are unsatisfied with the changes.

Not that many of us would mind depending on what you did, but it seems like you've worked yourself into a wall with her. Klubhouse recommended a good idea with echoes, but numbers will inevitably have to be adjusted for most of us to be happy. That just solves one problem. The biggest problem you face I think is that most players view the rework as a buff or a nerf, not simply as a rework.

Sona's is automatically targeted as long as you are in range. 650 range is justified because you don't have to aim at all. You're also making unreasonable comparisons with champions that are generally intentionally designed to have wave clear because they are AP Mages (Syndra/Brand). Sona is a **support.**\n\nAs for the range discrepancy of Yasuo and Sona's ult (which by the way, has nothing to do with Sona's Q), Sona's ult doesn't have a prerequisite to its activation while Yasuo's ult requires a knock up. The duration of the knock up on the ulti is also 1 second (can also vary depending on when Yasuo presses R after the initial knock up) compared to Crescendo's stun being 1.5 seconds. \n\nI'm not saying Q is a good spell. In fact, I think it's rather weak and very unsatisfying. However, your reasoning as to adding splash damage to it doesn't fix her problem, you are just trying to make her Q like a Q of a support that already exists by giving her unnecessary wave clear.","replies":[{"poster":"Origami Kaiju","date":"2014-09-06T07:56:29.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that Sona should have a strong wave clearing ability, but I do think her ult should hit minions.

I was in a scenario recently where I was the only member of my team alive and I couldn't defend our inhib turret against a giant wave of minions with just q and aa's.

Consider Nami, she has generally poor wave clearing but Nami's aqua prison can clear a wave way faster than Sona ever could, and her ult (which is very comparable to Sona's) effects minons. I was in a scenario recently where I was the only member of my team alive and I couldn't defend our inhib turret against a giant wave of minions with just q and aa's. We lost that turret, but if I could have ulted them, I might have saved it. Nobody would go around using their sona ult to farm because that would be so wasteful, but it would be nice if it could be used in emergencies.\n\nWhile adding wave clear to Crescendo doesn't really fix her problems, I do agree with you. It doesn't really make sense that Braum/Leona/Nami/Janna/ etc have ults that affect minions, while Sona doesn't; it's a matter of inconsistency. (Thresh ult is fine because it would be really bad if minions could proc one of the walls instead of a champion)\n\n> I do think that Q needs an increase in range though.

Nami has similar harass/sustain in lane, grants movespeed as well, but she has an AoE stun on a basic ability, while Sona's Q falls off after laning phase. I think to make Sona a strong pick, yet uniquely different from Nami, something should be changed to her Power Chord, because despite having 3 options on Power Chord, they all feel somewhat lackluster for a spell that requires 3 other spell casts before use. \n\n• Power Chord Q got nerfed once again. \n• Power Chord W is barely ever noticeable (still strong in botlane trades, but not really useful outside of lane), even when used on large burst damage Assassins it's really hard to tell the difference; a 20% damage reduction is way weaker than a silence or something. However, I don't think replacing the damage reduction with a silence is the right way to go regardless, that's just copy pasting Lulu W basically. \n• Power Chord E is alright, but the slow only lasts 2 seconds and when enemies pick up tenacity this move feels very weak.\n\nIt also doesn't help her case that her basic abilities are on a higher CD, which indirectly increased the CD on Power Chord. This feels awful because being able to select Power Chords in team fights as often as possible is really important.","replies":[{"poster":"Origami Kaiju","date":"2014-09-06T19:46:32.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Actually, according to Riot Fearless, there was no change to Sona's Q range. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/NA0kHMhA-my-opinion-on-sona-and-a-few-questions-to-fearless-civil-discussion?comment=0000\n\nWow, I hadn't seen that before. Well the information regarding the q range is coming from the League of legends [Wikia page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sona/Background), which is about the only source for getting Sona's old spec's. It's highly possible that it could be wrong. But to be honest, I thought q's range was shorter before I even looked up the spec's, so I do wonder what's going on with that. I could definitely be making a mistake on that one. \n\n> I think the main reason why Sona is not viable is because Nami is pretty much a better Sona. \n\nThis is exactly true. Granted Nami's abilities can be a bit harder to land (mainly aqua prison), but it's true, she's a better Sona. \n\n> despite having 3 options on Power Chord, they all feel somewhat lackluster for a spell that requires 3 other spell casts before use.\n\nI agree. Q power chord is a bit weak right now. W power chord just doesn't feel like it's reducing any incoming damage. E power chord is okay, I actually use it a lot but it could definitely be stronger (maybe slightly increasing the duration or the initial strength?).\n\n> It also doesn't help her case that her basic abilities are on a higher CD, which indirectly increased the CD on Power Chord. This feels awful because being able to select Power Chords in team fights as often as possible is really important.\n\nIt feels like heal is always 1 or 2 seconds away from being available to save an ally. (not to mention the shield duration is just too short). The cd on Q is fine, but I think both W and E should be reduced by 2 seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kuhzoo","date":"2014-09-04T16:45:32.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something I think would be neat to get with Sona would be thin blue, green, and purple range indicators that show the range of her QWE abilities all the time, or at least while enemy units are around and the ability is off cooldown.

It doesn't increase Sona's decision making, its just bad design.  The heal is 1k range, but the aura is 350.  So you can heal someone at range, but you can't shield them.  On top of that, the shield effect is incredibly weak for a late-game spell; 150 health shield at level 18 for *1.5 seconds*  is laughably trivial.  The increased cooldown also hurts.\n\nE is also bad, and it was a massive nerf.  Yes they improved the early levels, but at what cost?  it used to be a 1k range speed buff, now its 350.  The cooldown was increased by a whopping 5 seconds, but the ability itself still only lasts 1.5 seconds.\n\nAdditionally, Sona is very fragile both in-game and thematically, so it is against her design to have only a 350 range effect.  A significant part of my frustration stems from the fact that many times when I was tagging allies for speed to run away or to give them a shield, the enemy decided to kill me first instead.  So I'm forced to build tanky on a non-tank champ.  \n\nAlso yes, her speed.  Tagging moving allies is stupid, so I'm usually forced to get the boots of swiftness with the alacrity upgrade.\n\nAfter seeing Riot ignore all the PBE feedback, plus the Live feedback thread, I don't even feel like suggesting anything just so Riot will ignore it.

I've read quite a bit of posts by players and lots of feedback regarding this rework and I see a common thread among them. The idea that the range on Sona's aura's puts her an awkward spot where she has to get too close to her teammates in order to contribute to a fight. Getting too close puts her in prime range for an assassin or to be bursted down seeing as how she's so squishy. (That I do know about Sona.)\n\nI have an idea, one that I encourage people to chew on. The concept of Echoes.\n\nShe's all sound based right? using her notes and songs to empower her teammates to fight harder in the battle? Why not enable her chords to \"Echo\" out? This would *dramatically* increase her aura range at the cost of diminishing returns over distance. Want to give a teammate a powerful buff? run right up to them and jam it out. Behind in the game and need to hang back? That's okay, you can't get off any powerful chords but you can still float around in the back line, letting the echoing chords still apply a buff (albeit, weaker)\n\nI feel that this would offer a nice risk/reward aspect to Sona. \n\nShe could risk running up to the front lines to try and tag her teammates with a powerful buff at close range. Or she could choose safety and let the echoes reach her teammates. Either way, it also solves another common problem that I see with the feedback: That Sona's feel utterly useless when the aura's don't land. Echoes would make landing aura's \"easy\" but landing them \"well\" would be a different story and allow skillful use of \"snuggle\" zones and \"Echo\" zones.\n\nfeedback is welcome, I'm not going to suggest specific numbers because I'm not qualified for that but I hope I got the imagination tanks flowing","replies":[{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-09-03T06:52:38.106+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a really cool concept, and it makes a lot a of sense.

I think sona could use several buffs - \n\n**Hymn of Valor** - It's still possible to do good damage with this spell early game, but the range was decreased from 700-650. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it actually is problematic for a few reasons. You have to get close to the enemy and therefor a lot closer to their minion wave. If you want to poke, you will almost surely have to follow q with a w just to negate the minion aggro. Also, it is a lot harder to get the Hymn of valor to hit both enemy champions.

The cooldown was increased by 1 second, which isn't that bad. \n\n**Aria of Preseverance** - The early heal was nerfed to 25 from 40, but it's supposed to be redeemed by the fact that the more wounded you or an ally are, the more it will heal.

The mana cost at rank 1 is 70, which is really high, considering the base heal is only 25 for you and an ally. The cooldown was increased from 7 to  10 seconds.
