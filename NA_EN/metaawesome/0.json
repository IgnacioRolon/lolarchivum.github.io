The official update says this:\n\n\"Over the next few days, we'll be rewarding positive League of Legends players with a **classic Mystery Gift** as thanks for being such an awesome part of our community.\"\n\nClassic Mystery Gifts have contained any skin as long as they are 520 and above and are not specific exclusions (e.g. discontinued skins like Rusty Blitzcrank or King Rammus or skins that have you meet requirements like the Victorious ranked skins). It wouldn't be a classic Mystery Gift without the chance of getting the Legendary Tier, Ultimate Tier or even Legacy skins.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
