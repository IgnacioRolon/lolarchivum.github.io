I used to be able to do an instant Q+E combo at face to face range and get a stun off. There seems to be a delay on her Q, making the combo clunkier at close range. The combo seems a lot slower to pull off. \n\nEdit: As if it would matter, the stun probably would not work anyways. Also, If it's such an infrequent bug like Shen's why has she yet to be disabled for LCS?","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2015-02-14T22:11:29.589+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"The patch that reduced the width of Syndra's Q+E stun also significantly reduced the radius of the initial check around a sphere that's been hit to see if there's a unit there that should be stunned before the sphere starts moving. We've got a change on the PBE at present that increases both that radius and the Q+E width as it travels. Assuming that change goes live I believe that will probably help out with the problem you're seeing - as far as I'm aware Q timing hasn't been changed at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-02-16T02:50:32.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about a fix Scatter the Weak failing to stun/knockback/deal damage/any combination of those?\n\nIt has been creeping it's way for the last season, becaming more and more frequent with each change to Scatter the Weak, QoL or otherwise, to the point using it after actual nerf is like playing Russian Roulette with 3 bullets instead of only 1.\nI used to be able to stop every LB player from dealing any damage to me, stop every Jarvan/Vi gank or stun every champion that was in my range, but now? There is no reward in playing Syndra over Ahri, LB, Xerath, you name it.\nEssentially Syndra has 3 spells right now - Q,W and R.\n\nWith all due respect, Meddler, but I can't possibly believe fixing one spell can take so long, unless nobody ever actually tried to lift a finger about it, but then people responsible for it should move their asses and actually work for the salary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fuaztin","date":"2015-02-15T00:28:09.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BixVK8q4,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-02-14T22:11:29.589+0000)\n>\n> The patch that reduced the width of Syndra's Q+E stun also significantly reduced the radius of the initial check around a sphere that's been hit to see if there's a unit there that should be stunned before the sphere starts moving.

She's hardly played and not landing the stun often means the difference between fending off a gank or not.  Not landing the stun at long range means you can't punish bad positioning.  If you're going to make the stun difficult then her other spells should have more range so that her strengths can be defined.\n\nAt the moment syndra is accepted to be a poor pick because of the wind up on her stun and ult combos.  Malz for example has her strength without as much wave clear.  Annie is defined by having her tools and with less range.  Why would syndra suddenly have her defensive tool more difficult to land when she is completely immobile in the current meta?  I would much prefer the stun to cause her to hold position longer than have her teamfight and defensive touched.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-02-14T22:56:54.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, thanks for the reply. I'll be testing the changes soon.\n\nEdit: Tested. She feels less clunkier and stuns are more consistent. It kinda fixed the point blank stuns but I guess I'm paranoid from the nerfs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Troy242621","date":"2015-02-14T16:51:43.378+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Alright, get ready to downvote me. Syndra is annoying conceptually for the same reason they nerfed Talon's silence. What's worse than being unable to cast abilities while being bursted down by a single combo? Being unable to do ANYTHING while being bursted down in a single combo while they do it from a safe distance.\n\nI'm not a fan of mixing huge burst and disables.","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-02-14T17:12:40.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"You make a good point but I'm mostly concerned over the fact that it was undocumented. There are 2 types of uses that the combo presents: agressive/poke or disengage/defense. It's an extra nerf that hinders her protective use of the combo. Knocking back an enemy with the stun included isn't even enough at times since she's an immobile mage. \n\nI'm not here to argue but I would never compare Syndra to Talon for the fact that Syndra needs more set up, positioning, and timing than any other mid laner imo to get a kill; usually taking advantage of the enemies own mistakes and bad positioning. Talon on the other hand relies on waiting on the enemy using up cool downs so he can get the opportunity to just go in and do a full spell rotation to burst 100-0. Syndra has to somewhat poke and make sure the enemy is somewhat in a exploitable position for a kill. Especially since DFG no longer exists the set up for a kill takes longer than usual, relying to much on the enemy to make a mistake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vistha Kai","date":"2015-02-16T02:59:48.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good that you never played aganist my AP Leona, then.

It would be a nice favor for us Syndra fans if some Rioter could double check this is still in place? \n\nThanks ðŸ˜„","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-02-14T20:50:42.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shes not going to be played in the lcs why would riot waste her time disabling her","replies":[{"poster":"Mansana","date":"2015-02-14T21:21:47.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more like inconsistency. She was still being played in EU and LPL during patch 5.1 during her initial nerfs. Whether or not she is played in the LCS should not matter, but it's only in recent patches that pros realize that Syndra is not worth the time to continue to practice especially when inconsistencies with stun have appeared more frequently than usual. That and on top of her loss in lane presence since the nerfs pushed her out of viability similar to how Shen was nerfed during mid Season 3. Shen was considered not relatively strong for a good portion of late season 3 and all of season 4 yet Riot still disabled him due to an infrequent, yet game changing bug. Even now he's still not played despite his bug being fixed. I just want Riot to be consistent with how they approach things.","replies":[]}]}]}
