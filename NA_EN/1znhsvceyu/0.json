I'm posting here because about a month ago, I had to restore my computer to factory settings and thus had to re-install League. Prior to the restore, I had my mouse 4 and mouse 5 buttons hot-keyed to use item slots 1 &amp; 2 for my Sighstones/Potions/Active Items. It worked perfectly, no problems ever and didn't require any additional set-up. Fast forward to today and for the past month I have not been able to get these buttons to work again. They work in EVERY SINGLE other program/game except League and it's really starting to piss me off. I've tried doing custom profiles with my mouse's driver for League specifically by setting mouse 4/5 as keys 1/2, but it still doesn't work. Whenever I try to set the buttons in game, it just acts like I'm not pressing anything and doesn't change the keybinding in the pop-up window.\n\nWhat I don't get is why it worked before the restore and not after. At first I thought my mouse/driver had broken until I launched World of Warcraft and my keybinds worked fine. I'm using the SAME OS, the SAME mouse, the SAME driver, the SAME client. Literally nothing has changed about my set-up or the way I launch league. I even have \"Run as Admin\" checked and \"Run in Compatibility Mode for: Windows 8\" set, but neither of these solved the issue. Was there something Riot changed about the client that only affects new downloads and prevents them from using mouse keybinds?\n\nThe mouse I use: Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX - http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/anywhere-mouse-mx-p?crid=7&amp;WT.mc_id=AMR_DR_Q3_FY17_SERP&amp;WT.srch=&amp;cvosrc=ppc.google.%7Bkeyword%7D&amp;cvo_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;Matchtype=%7Bmatchtype%7D&amp;cvo_crid=%7Bcreative%7D&amp;partner=DR&amp;category=brand&amp;cvokID=%7Bprofile_id%7D%7C%7Baff_code%7D&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwqfvABRC6gJ3T_4mwspoBEiQAyoQPke65C5kvAzsd4fwe5Y_gxtKDr6uDdER17-80UdsGiKcaAmk_8P8HAQ\n\nThe driver I use: SetPoint Software Version 6.67.83 &amp; Driver Version 5.90.41 - http://support.logitech.com/en_ca/software/setpoint\n\nANY HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED! You have no idea how annoying this is after YEARS (started playing in 2009) of having my hotkeys set-up this way.","replies":[{"poster":"Gaesthy","date":"2017-04-01T22:38:40.324+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, i have the same problem as author of this topic.\nMy mouse Zowie FK1 (a4 tech bloody v7 also only mb4 and mb5 don't work ) after format my Win10 (to fresh creators update) both side buttons don't work.(only in league)\nEverywhere else, cs;go, opera etc., these buttons working fine.

As I said in my post the buttons are working just fine in any other program/game on my computer. ONLY League of Legends has a problem. I played on my friends computer and was able to hotkey his side buttons just fine, but when I try with my laptop it acts like I'm not pressing anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-18T22:22:28.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if you're not using the mouse software to set your keybindings, what exact method did you use to set the mouse buttons up for binding? Was this done through in-game hotkey settings or did you make manual modifications to your League files to attempt this?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
