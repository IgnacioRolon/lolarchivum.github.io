You guys do the stupid aggressive resets every season so if a plat doesn't bother with doing prov games until now they can end up in silver games very easily and with DQ easily end up stomping in a bronze players game. Not saying I hate DQ because I don't but your answer doesn't fully explain why large skill gap games and the answer is because of resets and smurfs.","replies":[]}]}]}
