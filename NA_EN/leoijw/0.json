Why the unnecessary repetition?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got 200+ of these arcade tokens and a handful of chests so I thought to myself: \"Hey lets craft some keys!\" How naive I was...\r\n\r\nWhy does it take me 10 minutes to unlock 5 chests because I have to not only scroll down the Arcade shop and buy 15 separate key fragments over and over again but then I have to ALSO craft each individual key afterwards? And don't even get me started on that BE conversion option at the very bottom, how long would it take someone to redeem however many tokens they have left after an event ends?\r\n\r\nHow hard could it possibly be to add a \"Craft many\" option? Hell you already have an \"Open X# of chests\" so you clearly have the technology available, so wtf?","replies":[{"poster":"Kanzler","date":"2019-07-11T00:56:40.190+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"You honestly expect a small indie company to have the resources for QoL stuff like that?","replies":[{"poster":"im bored cx","date":"2019-07-11T13:48:18.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hold up this \"small indie company\" is hosting eventa that can hold just as many people as the super bowl, how are they small?
