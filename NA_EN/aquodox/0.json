Players will lose ip if they bought some runes a small time before the announcement, but that is unavoidable. If we want to better the game for the currently and new players, sometimes existing players will get the short end of the stick. But it is not so bad because now everyone would be able to get the remaining runes that they do not have twice as fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ictus","date":"2015-08-15T01:46:13.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Coolxwdude,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=yrv48BON,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-15T01:44:29.423+0000)\n>\n> Would probably make the people that worked hard for their rune pages get upset like I mean really pissed.
