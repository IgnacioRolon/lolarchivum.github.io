Fiddlesticks - has an aura ult and can jump out of hiding with it.  W drain is channeled and will last longer since it will take enemies longer to get out of range. \n\n2. Katarina - channeled ability, does not rely on aa or crits, and has resets. \n\n3. Amumu - has an aura, and can double down with itemization like Cinderhulk.  Plus tank stats aren't nerfed, which should make them stronger relative to offensive stats.\n\n4. Morgana - Lots of CC, her pool will hit for longer against slowed movement enemies, ult will likely hit for full, resulting in a ton of damage, snare and a stun.\n\n5. Heimer - Dem turrets!\n\n6. Viegar - hard to dodge combo\n\n7. Nidalee - hard to dodge spears and resourceless cat form. \n\n8. Gailo - good base damage, hard to dodge aoe ult, move speed buff\n\n9. Akali - still bursty enough. \n\n10. Riven - resourceless, has a dash.\n\n11. Rumble - good luck getting out of that ult!\n\n12. Teemo - move speed buff and debuff and does magic damage over time... and we have all the time in the world. \n\n13.  Zyra - easy to land skill shots + plants you can't escape from = godly!!!\n\nHonerable mention:\n\n1. Swain - Channeled Ult that heals - healing is not nerfed which should make it stronger relative to offensive abilities.  But will 100% more mana cost be too much?\n\n2. Kalista - jump passive may be really good - but can she itemize attack speed while avoiding crit?\n\n3. Brand - will be much easier to land his full combo, which will kill many champs, but will the high mana costs and cool downs wreck him in team fights?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Love","date":"2015-03-30T17:42:07.018+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina is the obvious 100% must-pick or ban champion.\n\nNothing in the list hurts her as much as it hurts everyone else.\nshe doesn't build ad, she doesn't care about crits, she doesn't care if she's slow as long as you're slow too, she would gladly trade slightly longer cooldowns for completely gutting everyone else.\n\nKatarina is either going to start off banned or get there day 1. \n\n100% pick ban rate, guaranteed.","replies":[{"poster":"The Troll King","date":"2015-03-31T04:21:31.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah.

Not sure if minions and monsters attack slower-- if not, we can still heal by walking into a minion wave with Bulwark up.\n\n* The recently reduced cooldowns on his E means he's going to be one of the best for buffing his team's move speed, and I think small edges in move speed are going to be super valuable given the more stately pace of the game.\n\n* The most important thing, though, is that slower opponents means easier multi-person ults.

Landing her Q probably isn't as important since everyone is already really slow already.\n* Swain has a ton of mana issues also.\n* Kalista seldom builds crit; usually I see BotRK/Runaan's/BT, so she'll probably be fine\n\nMy predictions:\n\n* Riven will also probably be pretty strong, just with how she can AA reset and has more mobility than most (plus no resource)\n* Rek'Sai can set up tunnels to help her (permanently) get around easier; also has no resources\n* Mordekaiser generally struggles because of his immobility; now everyone is immobile; also his resource is health, which isn't getting 'nurfed'\n* Rumble, especially if you can manage your heat well. His ult will be tough to escape if you don't have a dash.\n* Shyvana has a way of speeding herself up, also her AA reset can probably dish a ton of damage.\n* Renekton has his double dash, also an AA reset\n* Garen has a spammable speed buff, plus it'll be difficult for people to escape his spin.
