I do have a suggestion that I think would make the mode more interesting.  My one gripe is that I get tired of playing with or against the perceived most OP champs.  While there are some games where people pick &quot;off meta&quot; champs, for the most part, it&#039;s a rotation of nearly the same bans and nearly the same picks.\r\n\r\nI propose a change that would force the all for one meta to frequently evolve:\r\n\r\nEvery day, add to the disabled list two champions, the most picked/banned and the highest win rate (given a certain % played threshold).\r\n\r\nThe upside is  an ever shrinking champion pool will force players onto different champions as the event goes on.  The downside though is it is possible if a player doesn&#039;t have an opportunity to play in the first couple days of the event he/she may miss the opportunity to play a particular champ.  In my opinion, the benefit is worth the cost.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-25T06:59:45.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Careful on that \"highest win rate disable\" suggestion.

Holy shit. Also, I never knew Cho'Gath did so well in that mode. I thought he'd be around 50% winrate.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-25T21:48:01.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I objected to someone's claim once that fighters were OfA broken, but when I arranged those win stats, and saw that the top 10 were pretty much fighters, I reconsidered my stance. It's a fact that tank fighters are the best champions at counterbuilding while maintaining high burst damage. Which is why they can overpower pretty much any squish champ: assassins, mages, adc's. There's a few OfA mages with indomitable cc chains (Syndra, ugh...) but in general, a team of all-squish is a team of no peel. Peel is the one thing holding fighters back from roflstomping glass cannons in regular queues. You take peel away and tank fighters can pretty much do whatever they want.\n\nThat does beg the question though: HOW THE HECK IS MISS FORTUNE AT 71%???

Though looking at that data, it would be hard to pin down a threshold.  Given those statistics though, it's apparent that simply disabling the most picked/banned would get the job done.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-10-25T21:02:24.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, ditto. I don't care about win rate. Win or loss, I don't need to play Bard OR Darius 10 times in a row.\n\nI'm not sure I like this idea of disabling champs for everyone though. Maybe someone wasn't around for a few days. Should he/she not get to play Heimerdinger, just because a bunch of noobs won't quit spamming him? No. But since OfA champ select ALREADY isn't about getting what you want, maybe make it sort of a random pick/vote hybrid. You don't get to pick champs in everyone's repertoire. Instead, you get to pick one of 5 champs randomly selected from the pool of all champions. That way you have a chance of getting ANY champ in a given day, but no champ can be spam-voted in every game.\n\nHonestly, I think the best option is just OfA teambuild. But if we're gonna scrap that for the \"surprise me\" elements of lottery pick, why not make it truly a \"surprise me\" experience, not \"OfA, Definition: A game where you get to play Yasuo... again\". If random pick works for ARAM, there should be enough people who will enjoy a similar randomness in OfA.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2015-10-25T08:46:27.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone suggested in the past to just have a ban rotation every X hours/days. The most picked champs from the past Y hours/days (where Y>X) would be banned. That way people will still have some opportunities to play the popular champs if they want, but less popular champs get a chance to show up too.","replies":[]}]}
