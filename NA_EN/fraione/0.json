Then you should combo like this: Key1 > very short pause > Key2,Key3. There are champions who can just spam the 3 keys after one another but if you are having issues you should do it the way I explained!  If not you risk cancelling half ur combo and even if it does fully fire you are killing your accuracy alot! Again correct way: Key1 > very short pause > Key2,Key3. NOT: Key1,Key2,Key3 very fast!**_\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n~~Pressing 3 keystrokes for ability combo&#039;s at a high tempo always ignores the 2nd keystroke of the order. No problem with 2 keystrokes for combo&#039;s. Applies to every single champion of this fashion.~~\n\n~~The player support team agreed that this might be a bug. I have submitted a bug report directly to the dev team 2 weeks ago but nothing has changed the issue still remains in the new patch.~~\n\n~~The first video shows clearly that this is a bug and has nothing to do with the player or his hardware etc. Nor is it specific champion/ability-related. Of the many champions i&#039;ve tested the issue is most clear with Zilean as you can see in the video how he magically works almost as intended when you turn on the instant cooldowns in the practice tool (besides the delay sometimes wich is part of this bug using instant cooldowns).~~\n\n~~Here is another video with Ezreal:~~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb15qt8P-eI\n~~It shows the bug in a more gameplay type fashion comparing the issue I described of high tempo 2-keystroke combo&#039;s (working) vs. the 3-keystroke combo&#039;s (bugged at high tempo)~~\n\n~~Let&#039;s bring some attention from the devs to this bug guys! This issue has been in the game for a long time. In a game named &quot;League of Legends&quot; we should indeed be able to play like a true legend and not as a game code slave! ~~\n\n~~Let me know in the poll if you have also ever encountered this issue! Or try it in-game yourself :D~~\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/xhN4C2vEuapCo/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"NichtHurz","date":"2018-10-15T15:14:34.162+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fucking hell, I thought I had some kind of dementia or whatever.

In a game where death happens in about 1 second, you need to be able to hit keys fast enough to react. I know hitting several keys too quickly shouldn't queue all of them for every champion, but as Malzahar this fucks him up too hard. He needs his E+W+R and it doesn't really matter what you hit first one of the first 2 doesn't come out.  \n\nThat is interesting for Vel'koz though. This also happens to Brand, if you hit them in a certain order the second ability won't come out.
