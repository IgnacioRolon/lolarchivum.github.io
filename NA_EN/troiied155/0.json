I was playing lol for years and this never happened to me. i opened my client and it poped out an update error. i tried a few things and nothing helped. so i wanted to reinstall the game. I uninstalled it and came to lol sites to download it again but the download link on the site doesnt for some reason work for me. My friend sent me the installer \"manually\". so i opened it an the same error poped out again. If anybody knows how to fix this let me know pls :D","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-13T18:14:31.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the error saying exactly?
