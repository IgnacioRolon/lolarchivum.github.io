You could have windows 10 up and running in a couple hours, 80-90% of that being download time.\n\nMac support for the rendering APIs used by games is trash and likely always will be, the client is poorly maintained and an uphill battle to keep it compatible with Apple's mess of proprietary software.\n\nIf you are using the touchpad.. Well, you need a mouse if you want to play anything besides bots, it will be cripplingly inaccurate and slow in PvP.

It took me a while but finally got it working. I installed leagues and played one game and it was pretty bad. The drivers provided by apple for windows are pretty terrible. The game had a lot of visual glitches although frame rate was better in windows compared to macOS.
