I played NA with about 160ms Ping, on the Japan server I play with about 20ms ping. But the Japan server doesn't offer English. Now, NA offers multiple languages. So reading updates, pings, things of that natures, I have to go out of my way to adjust. \nIs there any way to offer multiple languages on the Japan server or is it more of a supply/demand issue?\n\nEdit: I didn't mention the main issue, but it is things such as what runes am I using? I recognize what I have from NA but its all in Kanji. What if I wanted to make a new rune page? What if masteries update and I want to check in-game? These are all things I'm guessing at.","replies":[{"poster":"EU Jungle","date":"2016-05-03T08:11:18.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can make some adjustements in the folder of your LoL Client to change the language manually, just look up what code it is to do so","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-03T22:26:20.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While there are community driven ways to forcibly change the language on your client, there is no official way to do so.  Each region supports specific languages, and Japan only supports Japanese.  I wish I could provide better news!\n\nAwesome to hear that you are still able to get some League games in though :)  \n\nLastly, thank you for your service as well!","replies":[]}]}
