But i don't thank mine refreshed. I'm not complaining just wondering if its a bug or something. cause i realized that i have had 2 key fragments for sooooo long now. maybe worth looking into.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-05T23:11:46.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The drop rate resets roughly every 30 days after you get your first.

To add, as noted in the [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), obtaining fragments is more of a curve than a line so earning them can get slower.  Looking into this for you, I see that your account earned a considerable amount of fragment keys in June.  With a reset, you should see a similar rate as before.  If it feels like it's taking longer than you'd prefer, keys can also be obtained from the store.  Hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"TM87 Articuno","date":"2016-07-08T05:03:41.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY so much i was just wondering <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quepha","date":"2016-07-08T00:12:10.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Porocles,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=W4U3fo0E,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-07-08T00:00:41.271+0000)\n>\n> DTN has provided some good information here.
