I understand that im in B5 i understand that im not that good at this game. but when your playing ranked your top laner is 0/9/0 your mid laner is 0/5/0 your jungler is 0/9/1 and your support is 2/5/4 with me the adc who is the only one making plays on the team. then it just gets to the point where you realize no matter what you do you will forever be in B5 cause everyone is just to heavy. im not saying im too good for bronz but i know for a fact i should not be in B5 maybe 3 but not 5. when your support is complaining cause i wont let her last hit my cs and my top laner and support is yelling at me cause i dident let my support get a kill when im the only one positive in the game i have never heard a support say \"STOP KS-ING ME!\". V.V i should not be hear i play in riot funded tournaments i face diamonds and plats... in team ranked 5v5  and 3v3 im gold 1 and gold 5 but solo-duo no i cant do it i cant carry 4 people who need to be in wood division. I try to be a tam player i try not to rage but i was in b3 all last year then when it was time for me to re rank myself in 2 games it was a 3v5 in 3 games i had a intent feeder cause they didnt get the role they wanted and 1 game was a 4v5 which we came close to wining but i mean shit happens time Warner cable sucks i guess haha. part of me just wants to pay someone to boost me but at the same time what if even they cant get me out of this \"elo hell\" so to speak. i know its just a gme and it should not be taken so literally but i mean come on riot is it that hard to put in a mechanism that gives you a lost prevented when someone on your team wants to rage quit or just not connect. idk i just know that its not fair for some players and something should be done about it. im just but hurt cause i cant get out of bronze. well it just felt good to rant a little.\r\n{{item:3073}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Trash MammaI","date":"2015-01-31T11:19:52.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're matched with people around your skill level.
