In my opinion URF was the best game mode that RITO has ever made. I know that when URF came out RITO said that URF was \"The future of League of Legends\". what did they mean by that? I miss perma stunning with {{champion:412}}, making bushwack lanes with  {{champion:76}},and so on. anyway i want the community to tell me what they think and miss about URF, and if anyone knows anything regarding URF's comeback pleas do reply telling me what you know.\r\nTomoki Out!","replies":[{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2015-02-11T03:44:24.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"funniest thing i did in urf was probably turning the dragon pit into my lair as {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2015-02-10T21:29:28.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Urf just like all the other games modes that come out from time to time will probably never be permanent! its for a good reason that i can agree with! its going to get stale and repetitive! I enjoy URF, but after about a couple days with it, it got boring because you will only see the same champions because they were considered OP, and if you dared play a champion you liked that wasnt someone on that OP list you would get harassed and be the cause of your team losing! it was irritating. as a joke type of game mode everyone should be enjoying the mode with champions they like, but people were taking it way too serious and only playing it to win. thats one reason why i feel it shouldnt be live for too long. Granted with the new champions out. it would be nice to play them with this game mode! i think the last champion that was release during that time was Vel'koz! so i really want to try out champions like Braum!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-02-10T20:31:21.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overrated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-10T19:40:19.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fun for the first 5 - 10 games.\n\nThen it became cancerous and not fun at all, not to mention the repetitiveness it really gets after some time.\n\nUnless they skip all the leveling process, start the game also with level 18 and station the map in dominion with all items available then I guess it would be quite fun.","replies":[]}]}
