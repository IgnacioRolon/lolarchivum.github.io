When he says &quot;some kneel down in worship and others hide behind castle walls.&quot; i thought of how there are people who worship god and people believe that kings and queens are all that but are really just regular pawns hiding within there castle&#039;s. He is also a Celestial Being and within the video when they show him it appears as if he him self is made of a galaxy / condensed stars while creating a sun in his hand. and if he has the power to create a sun then does he have the power to create his own galaxy&#039;s and/or universe, planets, life excreta? also the wiki he is called *The Star Forger/Cosmic Overlord! A god wouldn&#039;t be far fetched from league of legends when we already have 4 demi gods maybe more. {{champion:75}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:101}} I don&#039;t know If anyone has more info pleas let me know! This new champ has really intrigued me! &lt;3 XD\n\n                                                                                                                                    sincerely: SoulEaterThresh","replies":[]}
