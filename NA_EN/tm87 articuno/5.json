I&#039;m not trying to be what the young people call a &quot;hater&quot; and sense i don&#039;t know how to put drawings on this post ill just tell you what i had in mind. I was thinking he should should have a deep sea tahm skin and or a meka skin where his tongue could be wire of some sort. but hey just cause i don&#039;t like shef tahm does not mean that everyone does its not a bad skin it just could have been better. \r\nAlso if your interested @Riot check out my game mode idea in maps &amp; modes called Definitely not summoner&#039;s rift! \r\n#Let_it_go#Frozen#Catfish#Tahm#Hashtag#yolo#deez_nuts_for_presedent \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                          Very Truly Yours: TheTomokiTower","replies":[]}
