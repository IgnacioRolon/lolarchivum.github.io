I know for certain that I did not leave or disband my Club. Naturally, I go to create another one only to see that the name of it was taken, so it must still exist. Right? Anyone else have this issue? Any Rioters seeing this, are you aware of this issue? \r\nIn-game name : SdotH\r\nClub Name: MajesticSqueeze\r\nClub Tag: Mjsqz","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-08T18:00:40.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it looks like your club wasn't sync'd up, so I gave it a boop.

What happens if you swap to the legacy version?\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nLet me know if it shows up on there, and if so then swap back to the updated version to see if it sticks.
