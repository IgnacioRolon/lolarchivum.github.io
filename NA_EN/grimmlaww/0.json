SIGN PETITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":"We need to get GrossGore Unbanned from Twitch, He gets harassed and he cant even defend himself without getting Banned.","url":"https://www.change.org/p/ali-larsen-unban-grossgore","image":"http://d22r54gnmuhwmk.cloudfront.net/photos/1/os/xl/NSOsxlRBlYRmKLi-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1461112998"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":39,"body":"Hey fellow summoners, was just wanting to discuss the GG (gross gore) and Krepo drama that has been happening lately. So im pretty sure that everyone knows whats happened but encase you don't ill go over it briefly. Basicly GG talked about a rumor that involved krepo. (Im not going to say what it was, you are all big boys and can find out what happened your self.) He made a video recently stating about how sorry he was and how he wants everyone to know that what he said was a lie. Twitch then decided that they would suspend all its activity........... permanently. He went on for like 10 mins about how he is sorry and that he has screwed up and he thanked all his fans for the support and the great run. I have been thinking about how this situation has been handled and i feel really bad for this guy. I mean this was his life, he has no education so their is little hopes in him becoming wealthy and middle high classed. So i searched online and found this petition stating that if it gets 50,000 signs it well go to twitch. Now im not sure what they well do if it is comleted but i mean cmon guys. theres more then 50,000 GG fans. IDK about u guys but ima miss ali's baby rages and the funniest donations ive ever read. This guys worked so hard and then to be just shut down, i mean cmon. We gotta help out our fellow brother guys. I dont want the GG revolution to end, this guy was one of the most entertaining streamer ever. Their was always something new about every stream that kept u coming back. whether it was him getting swatted or the NUNU DIAMOND POLICE {{champion:20}} . So lets get this guy rolling again, we gotta be the oxygen to his fire, the wheels to his hot rod, the H to his 20. And to krepo, we know you havent really done anything wrong, and we know that your career was put at the line. GG realized this and apologized for it in a video, now we know that and apology isn't going to fix much but man you gotta see the good in Ali. I bet u 100000000000000 dollars he cried after that video he made, and i bet you 10000000000000000 more dollars he feels like hes in a 20 foot hole and cant manage to reach the ladder at the top. But man it would be great if you could realize that while he was an asshole and was talking about things he had no idea about. He needs help, and you could be that person to stop this conflict and help him get back on his feet. I know your a great guy so if you could somehow share this or get the word out that Gross needs us to be the air beneath his wings, that could be the turning point of the game. I hope u guys read this and agree with me and want to help this man out. \r\n\r\nI left a link at the top to the petition but in case it dont work heres another.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.change.org/p/ali-larsen-unban-grossgore\r\n\r\nGood day summoners and good luck on the climb out of bronze (I know ill need it :D)","replies":[{"poster":"Powderkegg","date":"2016-04-27T01:56:59.174+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Slander is a pretty serious crime man, Twitch doesn't want that kind of attention.","replies":[{"poster":"GrimmLaww","date":"2016-04-27T02:05:11.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoeBomb,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=KeARE5qR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-04-27T01:56:59.174+0000)\n>\n> Slander is a pretty serious crime man, Twitch doesn&#x27;t want that kind of attention.\n\nOh it's a very serious crime, can ruin people lives. But you have to remember gg is human to. He made a very serious mistake and there is no doubt in my mind that he should pay for it. But he is also human, and humans tend to make very serious mistakes all the time. That's why I'm asking people to try their hardest to look past this incident. I know it's not easy. But if we could just give him another shot I don't think he would ever do something like this again!   This guy's future is potentially on the line and you and me both know that Ali can be a really good guy, or he can be a massive head case!

Gross Gore accused Krepo not only of trying to rape someone but also of having sex with a 15 year old girl.  And this wan't the first time he pulled this kind of crap.  He acted like he was invincible in that video.  He only apologized AFTER he was banned, not before.  He doesn't feel sorry for what he said about Krepo, he feels sorry that he got punished for it.  That's a huge difference.  Until he learns what is acceptable behavior I stand behind Twitch's decision to ban him.\n\nP.S. Twitch also has to take a very firm stance on this because they could be legally liable for any crimes that happen on their website.  So by Gross Gore slandering Krepo, Krepo could sue not only Gross Gore but Twitch as well.  That's the real reason why he got banned.  He committed a crime and could have cost Twitch millions of dollars in legal fees and fines.  Companies have declared bankruptcy for far less.  One person is not more important than the entire Twitch community.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadSpace3Winer","date":"2016-04-30T02:29:51.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":".....Ok so all of the other strikes were on twitch right?...Ok so twitch has authority over twitter as well now right?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Billy VoHagen","date":"2016-04-27T02:40:10.942+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Several Points I want to Bring up:\n1.
