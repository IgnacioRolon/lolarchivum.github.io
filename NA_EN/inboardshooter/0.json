I have constant lag that bounces between 200 and 1600ms.\nI also am unable to ping on the map and minimap. And I mean the blue circular ping, as well as showing my teammates my cooldown timers and even my network ping. Now what that button does is move the entire game/screen, even though I am in fullscreen mode. Am on a Mac.\nInternet connections are fine on my computer, phone, and roommate's computers, so I don't think it's our internet. I've done a reinstall, and a repair. Not sure what to do next.\n\n-----Edit-----\nOk a few updates:\n1.) The in-game ping (not network ping) problem. I do have hot corners disable, never had them enabled. I have it keybound to alt+MB1, and since I'm on a Mac it's the Option/alt button. This is an attempt to be able to get the blue circle ping on the map itself. When I try to use the alt button and the mouse, all I end up doing is moving the 'window' of the game, even though I am in fullscreen mode. I then have to try to re-center the 'window' on my screen. I currently have the blue-ping bound to the command+mb1, which does in fact work. So I can live with that. I just don't understand why I can't use the option+mb1, and why it moves my game 'window.' Literally the only thing that changed was the patch 7.2, I did not change a single setting on my computer. Related to this, I have the 'fallback' ping bound to my control+mb1 button, but it only works like half the time. The other times I try it, it does the other 3 types of pings (on my way, danger, and enemy missing). In short, it seems keybindings and pings are messed up.\n\n2.) According to the in-game network ping display, it appears that issue is resolved. It is back to normal numbers. However, my game itself seems to be having some lag issues. When I left-click to move, there are variable delays. Sometimes it takes half a second to move, others it takes probably only a third of a second.\n\n3.) Finally, and the weirdest one. I was playing as Twitch (ADC), and when I would click to attack a minion, he would walk up to the minion, like melee range, and attack. At first I thought maybe I just wasn't actually clicking the minions, but as the game went on and it kept happening, I can assure you I was in fact clicking the minions.\n\nI have tried repairs and re-install twice. Same symptoms.\nIn short, my game seems to just have a clusterfuck of problems and I don't know what to do other than wait to see if the next patch makes a difference. I don't want to deal with fixing this shit and I doubt anyone else does as well.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-27T22:43:43.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like instead of selecting your ping, you might be using your hot corners instead.  What happens if you try [disabling hot corners](http://osxdaily.com/2016/08/10/disable-hot-corners-mac/), and test it out in a custom game?  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"inboardshooter","date":"2017-01-28T19:29:59.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never had them on. I made an edit it my original post. I can guess you're going to tell me to create a support ticket, but I don't want to put some poor soul through trying to fix this. I may just wait until the next patch to see if anything changes.","replies":[]}]}]}
