In my first games my mouse was acting weird and lagging, then my fps started dropping from 120 to 80 to 60 and now all i see are pictures. Strange thing is that my fps counter says 120 fps and my ping is 50. League is now making my whole pc lag i cant even alt tab out of the game without it starting to crash. I turned off every single program that is not league but this didnt help. Ive never had such a horrible lag in league before even when i had an old potato pc! I had to leave a game cause i just couldnt do ANYTHING even pressing escape was taking 10 years to load! Help?
