Instead of being selfish and picking your favorite champion (good lord at the amount of yasuo's I've stomped top in past), pick things that can make it more difficult from completing his job.

Get an immobile one and you're dead most of time; Support: Braum, Thresh, Janna, Bard (legendary Bard mains only), Alistar, Lulu, Morgana (that can hit snares and black shield roots); Jungle: someone that ganks hard early, invades, or provides great cc (amumu, reksai, kindred, Grag come to mind)\n\nAlways stay with someone else. Never travel alone or in two's as support/adc in mid game. \n\nMost importantly buy pinks and ward his jungle if he's jungle rengar.

Though rengar is capable to delete ADC's in 1-4 seconds' time, there is so much delicate and complex combos at work. It took months, maybe even years for rengar mains throughout the world to craft builds, adapt every patch, and the one shot combo itself was created. You charge up your 5 fero Q, mid-air you cast your E (which riot made it tons harder to land mid air) and W-Hydra both at the same time to cancel the W animation. Though I agree with riot that rengar needs work, I just want them to know to not waste and throw away the 4-year long work of people who strived to make the champion better and even overpowered. Rework him, do not completely scrap his kit. Heck, if not for the dedicated rengar mains Dekar and Ryan Choi, almost no one would even play Rengar after his nerf since alot viewed the champion trash post-rework. I do not hold control and I am just stating my (biased?) opinion. I will continue to support Reng as a champ after the rework, as a true rengar main I will stick to him through all the good and the bad.\n\nTLDR: If riot rework rengar, do not completely scrap all of his abilities and possibly only leave his Q, and his brush passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-06-03T15:10:19.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see how the ferocity management, especially with the Q, is appealing. The problem is how several instant empowered attack-resets creates such massive and quick burst when the combo is executed; the input is great, the output is the issue. \n\nThere's no reason to remove the combo per say, but the way damage is dealt itself should be entirely changed, imho, such that it is dealt over a longer window. The AS component is a failed attempt at this, as it stands. \n\nEither way, do you think it would ruin the feeling of the ability by removing the attack-timer reset and making it an on-next-attack? I suspect it might.\nI don't think a DoT would be a good solution, because it's less visceral relative to it's power.\nSome other delayed damage might work; perhaps Q JUST giving attack speed, or Q applying a delayed mark that can be popped by an auto a second or two later. \n\nAlternatively, I could see it being more justified to have somewhat high burst if his initiation was less reliable. IDK.\n\nThat's the tough issue with assassins that have such reliable leaps; it's hard to make abilities that can be dodged or otherwise played against when the assassin reliably get right on top of someone. Even with a fractional second where you can flash away, it's really tough for him to miss E or W when Rengar is already right on top of someone.
