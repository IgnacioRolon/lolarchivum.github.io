No reply back as of now. wtf is this crap...?  you would think that keeping your customers happy would be top priority, if i knew customer service was this lousy i would of never sank over 500 bucks in this game for the last 5 years ive been playing... i know that somehow i probably got keylogged so it is my fault, but some sort of rapid response would be nice, especially since this ass clown is purchasing rp with my cards and god knows what he is actually doing to my account... going on +5days to resolve a hacked account is fucking ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}]}
