I really wouldn't care but I am experiencing mouse lag and intermittent game lag which makes it very difficult to CS and play the game. I have double checked all my in-game settings (all low), FPS is set to uncapped, and the anti-alysing and such is off, I have restarted the client and my computer several times, and I have performed a 'full-repair' without anything seeming to help.\n\nIs anyone else experiencing these issues and any thoughts on how to fix this? Again, patches 7.8 and prior everything was running perfectly and without issues.\n\n*UPDATE AS OF 640PM EASTERN TIME. I have found a TEMPORARY FIX for the lagging issues people might be experiencing on Mac/Apple products. It seems that the FULL SCREEN mode is causing the lag/sluggish gameplay since patch 7.9. When I switched to BORDERLESS window mode, my FPS was still stuck at 60 FPS, no matter what setting I left the FPS at, BUTTTT, any lag/sluggish gameplay was ELIMINATED. Therefore, if you do not mind playing in the borderless window mode, Mac/Apple users may once again resume playing at the high quality gameplay as was the case prior to patch 7.9. Will let you know if I find anything else out throughout the day/tomorrow.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-03T18:19:02.090+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">** Update 5/3/2017 @ 3:40 PM Pacfic**\n> \n> Thanks everyone!

I ran the hextech repair tool, and sent a ticket along with my logs yesterday night, still waiting on  a response. Glad to know this is widespread on not just me. It immediately happened after the 7.9 update. Before the update I was running leagues on medium-high settings, with vsync off getting steady 150+fps throughout games. It was beautiful, and know its hard-capped at 60 and drops randomly through-out games to where it stutters and freezes briefly in crucial moments. I have done 2 fresh Re-install's, tried changing settings all the way down to lowest, tried windowed and borderless modes, nothing. It stays hard capped at 60. Very frustrating, I hope they can fix this soon. \n\nJust wanted to add, aside from the fps drop, my league client has experienced some glitchy behavior. For example whenever i enter my password to log in, after it passes through, a quick image of what you see when you receive a key(for loot & crafting)  pops up, then disappears. Also whenever I am in champ select, the client glitches/blinks randomly; like a quick refresh glitch. tends to happen more when I have my masteries page up, the lol client flickers. \n\n2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz) with 6MB L3 cache\n8GB of 1600MHz DDR3 memory\nNVIDIA GeForce GT 650M with 1GB of GDDR5 memory","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Bora","date":"2017-05-04T23:01:16.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"INFeDeROOS","date":"2017-05-04T12:15:57.535+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"SAME PROBLEM HERE!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reuven","date":"2017-05-04T12:14:47.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"g00glechr0me","date":"2017-05-04T05:02:04.436+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also having the same problem after updating to 7.9.
