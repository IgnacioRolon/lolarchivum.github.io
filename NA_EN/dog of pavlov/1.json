I know its 100% because of competitive, because tanks are complete shit in solo Q. Just go look at their win-rates compared to fighters/assassins/anything else. Now you got crap like conqueror just cutting them to pieces in the top lane, too. And more true damage? \n\nThese changes are 100% for competitive because one look at solo Q stats shows you that tanks are actually complete crap. What are the \"best\" tanks right now? Singed? lol. Playing a tank in solo Q you are 100% putting the game in your team's hands, because there is probably going to be 1 or 2 champs in the game, you may even lane against one, that completely invalidates you with some kind of true damage or tank busting nowadays.\n\nBut, they are good in competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"HaIlMonitor","date":"2018-05-03T05:45:23.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If tanks are shit its because the player on them isnt getting carried...","replies":[{"poster":"DestructoDave","date":"2018-05-03T06:38:13.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HaIlMonitor,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=YajXAkvP,comment-id=0000000000020000,timestamp=2018-05-03T05:45:23.927+0000)\n>\n> If tanks are shit its because the player on them isnt getting carried...\n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/by-winrate\n\nLook at that. Tanks have some of the worst overall win-rates in the game. We can whine about assassins, fighters, ADCs, whatever. Tanks are some of the worst overall champs to pick if you care about winning. You got singed, who basically goes dmg, and then Sion all the way down at 23. Then what? Malphite at 40? Another damage building tank. Maokai falling in at 68. There are less tanks in the top 20 win-rates than any other role. Lol.\n\nGet my drift? Top lane tanks blow in solo Q.
