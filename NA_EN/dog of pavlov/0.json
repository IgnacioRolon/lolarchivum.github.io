Frustration from a Syndra player","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"BEFORE I BEGIN: I am merely trying to point out the flaws in Riot&#039;s logic when addressing Syndra by using Aurelion Sol as a counter point. This isn&#039;t me displaying my hatred towards Aurelion Sol, but more so that the treatment Syndra has received for a year/year and a half is quite frustrating. I actually don&#039;t mind playing against him, it&#039;s just that the Riot logic is what is messing with me when compared to a lot of other champions. For context, I play a lot of Syndra so that will be my comparison in this case.\r\n\r\n1. He has one of the highest win rates (54-55% across op.gg/champion.gg). Okay, but his play rate is low compared to other champions right? Not entirely true but it&#039;s still not very high: his playrate is 29/45 on op.gg and 22/39 on champion.gg, usually around 1.7-2.25%. \r\n2. Syndra has one of the lowest win rates (46.6-47.5% across op.gg/champion.gg). Her play rate is extremely low, even lower than Aurelion Sol, 30/45 on op.gg and 24/39 on champion.gg, usually around 1.5-2.05%.\r\n3. Aurelion Sol has one of the steepest learning curves in the game, meaning bad players should be weighing him down (even if the bad/inexperienced players are relatively a small number) OR this means that Syndra shouldn&#039;t have as low of a win rate because it&#039;s just mains playing her, as the low win rate suggests. Given the steep learning curve (which was released by Riot when Meddler showed the learning curve graphs), it seems that the best Aurelion Sol players are able to carry super hard because they have mastered a difficult champion. \r\n\r\nSo that leaves me with two questions: 1. Why is Aurelion Sol allowed to have such high of a win rate when he is one of the hardest champions to learn? 2. Why is it justifiable to leave champions like Syndra with a win rate nearly 8% worse in the current state without some major adjustments (like reverting some previous nerfs)?\r\n\r\nAnd this is just one example. The treatment for a TON of champions is inexcusable. I am not saying to constantly balance every champ every patch, but when you leave a champion with a low win rate and low play rate in the current state, and then buff champions who were already doing decently well (e.g. Lux), then that is quite appalling at the very least.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper5599","date":"2018-05-17T17:57:33.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not so sure about the whole Syndra Case, since I don't play/lane into her enough to give an answer with enough experience to back it up.\n\nHowever I CAN help with Sol as one of the few people who play him on occasion.\n\nSol's win rate is in accordance with his pick rate, he is a hard to play and master champion, but when you do, the reward shows.\n\nThe 2% (This was his play rate the last time i checked lolalytics) is a group of dedicated mains who have spent time and effort to learning him, and thus, they can dominate with him, hence why the win rate is so inflated.\n\nAlso If you look at elo's like bronze or silver, Aurelion's win rate tanks, it go's down to a range of 44-48% (Over the past 7 days), this is due to them just trying to pick him up on the fly, and failing miserably due to his hard to master nature.\n\nIf more people pick Aurelion up, his win rate would probably go down, but people don't try to as often since they tend to get stomped in the first few games (This happened to me), and just give up.\n\nI guess the only thing I can say for the Syndra issue is they don't want to go back to the time where she dominated the midlane, but still i don't know why she dosent get even some minor buffs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dog of Pavlov","date":"2018-05-17T18:17:32.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only people who play Syndra right now are dedicated mains. A lot of the Syndra mains started to abandon her until recently with the Q revert because Riot left her at trash tier and refused to do anything. Wish we could get some minor buffs, it's so sad to have to play her in the current state :/\n\nEven when you get down to Bronze, Aurelion Sol has nearly a 3% win rate higher. It just seems kinda strange that even for a champion like Syndra with dedicated mains, she isn't allowed to even have a 48% win rate in like the last year.","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper5599","date":"2018-05-18T12:00:32.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree Syndra needs some kindof help, but it can't be too massive, we don't want her back to the stupidly annoying unfun state she was in shortly after the mage update.\n\nIf they try to slowly tap her up over a patch or two she should be able to become somewhat decent.\n\nRiot is probably just hesitant to do it since a portion of the playerbase regards Syndra as a \"press r to win' champion, and buffing her could spark a bit of backlash.\n\nShe still should get some kindof help though (slightly lower cooldown or slightly lower mana costs are what she should get imo)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pika Fox","date":"2018-05-17T19:09:51.047+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sydras kit is such that if she is ever picked often, she is all you will see and she will decide an entire meta on her own. Same reason poppy got nerfed into the ground (although poppy still literally decides bot lane meta, as shes still an easy counterpick to certain teamcomps just by existing).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-05-17T17:41:09.190+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well Aurelion Sol and Syndra are fundamentally different mages and is a pretty poor comparison between the two.\n\nWhen Syndra is strong, that's pretty much all you see.  Also, when she is strong, there is incredible #FeelsBadMan on the boards because of the very few options to respond to her ult.  She's a lot easier to play than Aurelion Sol as well.  That's one reason why her win rate from mains is lower.  She's just weaker because if she gets stronger, it's a lot easier to pick her up.  Then everyone is playing her constantly and she crowds out champions.  Syndra's difficulty comes from managing the balls (which if I recall is not terribly difficult after a handful of games).  Even then, without that maximized ult, she is still pretty functional.\n\nAurelion Sol is \"allowed\" to have such a high win rate because just mains play her because he is not weak, nor OP.  However, it's not 54% win rate on mains is decent.  His kit isn't easy to pick up, so you have to main him to get that reward out of him.\n\nWin rate is just one piece of a pie.  However, it is not the entire piece of that pie either.  It's like looking at imaqtpie's history and asking \"Why is Varus allowed to have a 55% win rate????\"","replies":[{"poster":"Dog of Pavlov","date":"2018-05-17T18:14:17.178+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"So your argument for her being weak is that if she is strong then everyone plays her? Therefore she should remain weak? What kinda argument is that. At least the other person who commented gave actual analysis.\n\nAnd LOL OKAY surely you are bright enough to know that looking at win rates of a WHOLE CHAMPION not from ONE SUMMONER is very different. Looking at imaqtpie's history for one champion is like looking at a crumb of a tiny piece of pie. That is EXTREMELY different.","replies":[{"poster":"Hethalean","date":"2018-05-17T18:51:48.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the argument that Riot gives.  They don't like it when one champion crowds out all other options.\n\nAs for that last part, that was sort of the point of my saying it if you figure that out.  One person's win rate is not a good basis for analysis.  Neither is just looking at win rate a good basis for analysis.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Rouge","date":"2018-05-17T19:58:17.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot said that historically, she's almost always been sub 50% winrate, even when she was strong she was sub 50% winrate but with a much higher playrate. She's obviously one of the harder to play mages, even if she's easier to pick up than Aurelion Sol.\n\nBoth champions have around the same playrate right now; we assume that both are played mostly from mains. So, if she's not too hard to play as a champion like you say, it makes no sense to think she's fine at such a low winrate. You can't just say 54% vs 47% winrate is normal just because ''they're just different mages.'', especially when the one with the much higher winrate is the harder to play one. We can't just disregard winrates because we want to with no argument supporting her low winrate; nothing is justifying her low winrate for her playrate.\n\nRiot even said that they know she's still a bit weak even after the Q changes, and that they want to give her a little kick again, but are afraid to put her back to her strong state from s6/s7 (post MYMU, which is now reverted). The only other time she was strong was s4 before the nerfed her Q.\n\n**Note:** When she's both not doing well in soloq and not picked in competitive right now on a kinda generalist mage that has a history of being good in competitive, you know she's a bit weak, at least in this meta. Now that she's back to her pre-MYMU state, she should have a bit of room for help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-05-17T19:06:12.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like any tiny sample, his winrate is skewed by one-tricks making up a huge percentage of his games - the bad players dont stick around.","replies":[]}]}
