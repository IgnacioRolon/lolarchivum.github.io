This is the first survey in a multi-part study to better understand the frustrations that players face when playing League of Legends, and what factors of poor communication or misconceptions might contribute to that. Each survey is super short, I'd appreciate if you could help out! I'll be trying to post each survey 2 days apart, and I will be posting the results with my analysis once the study is complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Duke Anax","date":"2015-05-22T18:25:11.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok a couple things I noticed:\n\nThere should be a difference between RP pricing and IP pricing issues.\n\nYou have frontend client issues, but not ingame client issues.
