You must understand, my love for you Roit is eternal, but this is a new kind of passion, a fire deep inside.\r\n\r\nI must have him.\r\n\r\nSomeday, you will understand. For now, I ask only that you honor my one request of you. Here is a short poem so you will know the depth of my affection:\r\n\r\nHis mustache fierce, a beacon of security/ Would that he noticed me, drifting to obscurity/ My very Essence drawn to his gruff voice/ my heart's in Flux, I have no choice/ This Barrage of feelings, Unbreakable and true/ Don't let a Fissure come between me and you/ Stand Behind Me, be my companion/ Goodbye Taric, now Braum's my champion.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n-=Ezreal","replies":[{"poster":"LtRandolph","date":"2014-05-12T17:22:22.021+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTB Braum vs. Taric art...","replies":[{"poster":"Rew711","date":"2014-05-12T20:04:32.589+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taric needs an up-to-date look.
