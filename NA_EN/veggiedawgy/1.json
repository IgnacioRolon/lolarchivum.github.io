Sometimes I accidentally leave a video on before a game and I want to pause it but I can't because league is full screen. Is there a way to minimize league but not leave the game?\r\nFrom,\r\na {{champion:74}} main...","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-30T18:15:19.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DTN provided some great information here about adjusting your border that I'm glad has helped!  As some additional options, you can also adjust the resolution of your game screen while in a borderless mode.  This will allow you to move the screen around your monitor to a more convenient position.  I like to do this sometimes when I spectate games.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeggieDawgy","date":"2016-07-30T17:35:14.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY!

This will leave League filling your screen as if it was fullscreen, but switching your active window with **Alt+Tab** will leave it in the background instead of minimizing and it will be smooth and quick.\n\nIf you're on Mac, there is a similar hotkey but I don't know what it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeggieDawgy","date":"2016-07-30T16:46:14.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First xD","replies":[]}]}
