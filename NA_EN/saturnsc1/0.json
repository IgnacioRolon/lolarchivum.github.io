Vayne has absolutely spent time out of the meta in the past few years.\n\nADCs tend to cycle very quickly in the meta. Vayne has some terrible lane matchups. She tends to fall heavily out of favor when her lane counters are strong and popular. \n\nTargons/overheal was a free pass through the laning phase. She got heavy late game nerfs on top of nerfs to the item that was letting her coast through the early game. Let's wait to see where she falls out before calling for further nerfs.","replies":[]}]}
