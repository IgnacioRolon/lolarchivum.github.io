I feel like that&#039;s her biggest issue. She is the strongest duelist right now (bar maybe {{champion:13}} ).  I feel like most of that is due to the flat portion of Silver Bolts.  She can win early trades pretty easily, and make up for not building raw AD due to the steroid with her ultimate and Tumble.  Her biggest con was that she had a weak early game, but right now it doesn&#039;t seem to be the case.  Could you try removing the flat portion of her Silver Bolts? At least on the PBE (I have an account I use regularly), and if it guts her I&#039;d be the first to admit that&#039;s not where to hit her.  Its just very frustrating that the strongest duelist is the strongest tank-killer; shes just good at too many things. (Assassin, Duelist, Marksman, Hypercarry), and with the Frozen Heart nerf its that much harder to kill some of her damage.\n\nKind of how you&#039;re testing the waters with making Elise&#039;s Q a dot, could we try this similarly with Vayne?  Or perhaps, maybe not remove the flat true damage, but gradually add the flat damage in at rank 5.  \n\nI&#039;m not telling you how to do your job or anything, but I&#039;d love to see some more hardcore changes enter the PTR (what you&#039;re doing with the Juggernaut&#039;s is excellent as an example).  \n\nContinue doing what you're doing, everyone is loving it.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-12T04:53:22.726+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi GimmeYoPeaches, thanks for the thoughts/concerns about Vayne.\n\nSince I'm not a main contributor to the balance team, I can't promise any specific changes to any particular champion, but I do think you're on to something with Vayne.\n\n> Its just very frustrating that the strongest duelist is the strongest tank-killer.\n\nIt doesn't really seem like these two should things should be definitively true of the same champion, and for Vayne specifically, it definitely seems like they could be. This is, of course, unless it's because she's intended to be the latest of late game carries, in which case, come late game, maybe she just gets to kill everyone? Not sure, really.\n\nI will say I've seen a lot of posts and comments about Vayne's power level recently, so it doesn't seem like it's clear enough to players when/how you are supposed to be advantaged against her.","replies":[{"poster":"WalkingInACircle","date":"2015-08-12T04:57:35.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I will say I've seen a lot of posts and comments about Vayne's power level recently, so it doesn't seem like it's clear enough to players when/how you are supposed to be advantaged against her.\n\nWhat I'd say, is that I've seen several Vayne's get shut down even when they are good players doing well. But, the tools used to do so feel like they were part of the champion's kits that shut her down, and not through items or play. The proper long ranged attacks that can zone her and targetted CC/burst is mostly what does it. And the latter can be countered by QSS. So I feel like you can pick around Vayne, but if you don't have the champion to fight her in Blind Pick, you're stuck!","replies":[{"poster":"Muted Summoner","date":"2015-08-16T12:00:32.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WalkingInACircle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=bqZvs5tc,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-08-12T04:57:35.306+0000)\n>\n> The proper long ranged attacks that can zone her and targetted CC/burst is mostly what does it.\n\nthat honestly works for about any champion. But its easier said than done if those Assassins **can** get to her. She literally says don't pick tanks pick assassins to counter me.

Basically, Q shouldn't be up all day every day, and Silver Bolts should have to interact with Q or E.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/b2HrT7H3-vayne-rework-ideas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fadedpf","date":"2015-08-12T05:21:15.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is she is arguably the hardest to catch out of all the ADC's out there.

I want to say its Silver Bolts, and I have on occasion done so.  But she's had a rise to popularity after the introduction of {{item:3153}} .  It synergizes so well with her kit that its almost incomprehensible to not build it on Vayne in the meta today.  \n\nI think it might be the problem.  BotRK is another reason why Sated Devourer is extremely strong on certain junglers.  With the exception of Kayle and a lot of time Udyr, I would like to say that BotRK is built on every jungler that builds Sated Devourer.  The on-hit effect is extremely strong and its extremely cost efficient.  \n\nWhat do you think of an inderect nerf to Vayne by nerfing Blade of the Ruined King?  I want to say that Vayne wasn't nearly as strong as she is now a few seasons ago when BotRK didn't exist.  I feel it will also tone down the strength of the Sated Junglers as well, which is beginning to become an issue.  Most bans/picks include at one jungler that builds a devourer.  Perhaps reducing the on-hit to 5% physical damage?  I don't know, because BotRK has already had a lot of nerfs in the past, just throwing some ideas out tehre\n\nBack on the Vayne topic, I've seen an influx in Vayne's that stack attack speed, even going so far as to build two phantom dancers instead of another raw damage item.  What if you gave Silver Bolts the Fiora treatment and made it scale off her AD?  This way she still becomes a late game hypercarry that we all love and hate, but she won't be as oppressive in the early-mid game after her first few items?","replies":[]}]}]}
