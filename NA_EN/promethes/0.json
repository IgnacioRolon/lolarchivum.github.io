So Sure.\n\n{{champion:223}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:44}} \n\nThese I keep seperate because they are primarily played in support.  Other tanks have been played in support, but for the purpose of this discussion we'll use their intended roles of Top, mid, and jungle (Blitzcrank is an interesting case because he was actually originally built for top, but multiple seasons of supporting have thrust him into the support lane for what his kit offers). \n\n\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:154}} \n\nNow one thing you should notice about all of these champions is that tank is their **primary** role.  Their **secondary** role doesn't really matter much at all in classification (there are exceptions of course.  But exceptions are not the rule.  If that were the case, {{champion:101}} would be considered an assassin).  \n\nBut there is more to it than just that.  Each of these champions has some form of CC or built in peel mechanism.  {{champion:12}} has his headbutt and knock up.  {{champion:201}} has his slow, stun passive, and knock up ult.  {{champion:32}} has two stuns.  {{champion:57}} root and knock up.  {{champion:98}} and {{champion:3}} have taunts on top of effects that benefit allies defensively.  {{champion:78}} has a wall stun, an anti dash field, and a disengage ult that can be used offensively.\n\nI'm not going to describe every champions ability, that will make this more of a text wall.  \n\nNo I'll show you what shows up when you choose tanks in the shop rather than look at their primary search in the champions filter on your profile in the client (because the client still has some old functions and (as you pointed out) Riot has not actually input the new classes and subclasses into the client.  **This does not mean that they are not to be used.**).\n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:83}} \n\nNow these champions have tank as their **secondary**.  Meaning they have some aspects of a tank, but not enough to actually allow them to be a proper tank for a team.  Their are at best, meatshields that provide huge damage.  Because that is what their kits are built for, dealing damage and surviving fights. \n\nTank kits are not designed to deal fighter (which is what those champions primarily are) level damage.  Tanks can do damage, but only enough to make glass cannons afraid of them.  These fighters do not have the same level of utility as actual tanks.  Mundo just has a slow.  Darius has a hook with a short range.  Nasus has a slow, and it's a damn powerful one, but he can only hit one target, which is mainly so that when he's at a massive number of stacks, he can kill that target by preventing them to run away.  \n\nThere are obvious outliers, as Riot pointed out there would be in the subclasses.  {{champion:72}} for example was originally a juggernaut, but Riot plans on switching him to the vanguard class due to how his kit actually works.  \n\n{{champion:27}} is primarily a tank, but has such a weird kit that I can't imagine him really fitting into the role.  Especially how he's a primarily split push champion and tanks are more teamfight focused.  I guess you could call him a split push juggernaut.  \n\n{{champion:59}} is primarily a tank, but his numbers have been changed so much that he's either played as a full AD assassin or a form of bruiser.  So I'm not sure I can consider him to be one.  I'll be fine if I am wrong though.\n\nInteresting tidbit: Tanks can build like fighters and fighters can build like tanks.  They use very similar items (mainly the health part).  It's just that many tanks do not actually function as well as fighters when building like a fighter, and vice versa (though of course people will still call tanks broken if {{champion:86}} has no AD items yet one hit kills the villain with his ult while the villain is low).\n\n{{champion:79}} was an AP bruiser, but his utility has made him into more of a tank in the recent years and will probably be labeled as such.\n\n{{champion:421}} has become a knock up bot.  I don't know what Riot plans for her.\n\n{{champion:150}}: I personally don't think he's in his mega form enough to count as a tank, but that's what Riot calls him.\n\nThough if you didn't want to read all of this or still have doubts as to what Riot considers a tank.  Please read the following link.\n\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list\n\nNow, **Tanks** that can utilize Black Cleaver are as follows:\n\n{{champion:150}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:78}} and (if you consider him a tank) {{champion:59}}.\n\n**Tanks** that Black Cleaver is both core and very much viable on are as follows:\n{{champion:150}} and (again, if you consider him a tank) {{champion:59}}.\n\nPlease tell me what you consider a tank is and why.  And if you're reasoning is, \"because they are tanky\" then please know that I have heard that answer hundreds of times.  It is not what makes a tank a tank, not alone.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2016-09-11T22:37:48.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Tanks\n> \n> Vanguards\n> \n>     Malphite\n>     Amumu\n>     Leona\n>     Zac\n>     Gragas\n>     Rammus\n>     Mega Gnar\n>     Sejuani\n>     Rek’Sai\n>     Sion\n>     Nautilus\n>     Skarner\n> \n> Wardens\n> \n>     Braum\n>     Nunu\n>     Tahm Kench\n>     Maokai\n>     Shen\n>     Thresh\n>     Alistar\n>     Poppy\n>      Galio (hybrid Battle Mage) \n\nthat post right?\n\n{{champion:54}} HIs W does physical damage and is a basic attack boost. would work very well with {{item:3071}} \n{{champion:89}} Q is a basic attack buff and she's played support very often. {{item:3071}}'s rage would allow her to say in range for her other abilities without having to waste her grab and it would provide armor penetration for her marksman. in top lane she'd still benefit from the rage - the only other item with that being trinity force which buffs basic attacks immensely but requires spell weaving which leona cant do because of her higher cooldowns.\n{{champion:150}} can use it in both forms, but you already knew that.\n{{champion:113}} gets to apply more basic attacks which adds stacks and the rage movement speed buff grants her even greater speeds for keeping her flail in the air near her enemies.\n{{champion:421}} <confuses me as to why theyre on the list but her Q is an obvious one and her other abilities do physical damage. she's a fury basic attacker with true damage that is slow out of her burrow. rage can help with that and the 300 hp is nice.\n{{champion:14}} only benefit really with sion is his passive but it's still pretty effective if you brought cleanse so you can keep running after death instead of being CC'd to death. his Q and R do physical so they'd cleave the opponent.\n{{champion:72}} can use it very well. helps with his Q specifically and grants movement speed after using your R so you can get your enemies somewhere faster.\n{{champion:201}} his stacking system means that once you hit your opponent you're going to either want to hit them again or someone else will do it for you. since he's played support that's probably going to be your marksman. physical damage. very limited but braum's not really about dealing damage on his own. and if you do decide to stick around and use your basic attack 4 times to stack for the stun you'll have the movement speed needed to do so and do more damage overall.\n{{champion:20}} can use it when playing his with some attack speed since his W and passive support it. your marksman will thank you.\n{{champion:223}} rage. should be obvious. he's a support.\n{{champion:98}} after a taunt basic attack 1 time then run past them and block their escape then Q W. your team will finish them off and if not you have your Q ready to go. it still does physical damage in addition to the magic damage since it's a basic attack i think right? i might be wrong.\n{{champion:412}} is an on hit basic attack support. your ADC will thank you. especially if you use rage on a minion after throwing a latern to them and running away so they can dive. rage doesnt say anything about dealing physical damage to champions.\n{{champion:12}} use rage to keep up with your opponent. his abilities are all magic damage but his kit is lacking power since it's mostly about repositioning your opponent so someone else can damage them. cleave will help with that for every basic attack you perform. if you're playing alistar right you should be performing quite a bit of basic attacks. combine with wits end to increase the damage output of your entire team.\n{{champion:78}} her Q E and R do physical damage. that's 3 cleaves and  some movement speed. add in a basic attack and you have 4 cleaves. also it can be used to run away when things go poorly if you miss your E.\n\nthe rest i wouldnt build it on without changing their in game identity.\n\ni used the list riot made.\n\ni only consider tanks tanks if they are classified by the game as a tank. if i \"build tank\" that means im imitating a tank. i use the game's current definition system because it helps everyone know what im talking about. i dont use PBE terms or board jargon because it will confuse those who arent in the know. and a lot of players in my division arent in the know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2016-09-11T22:50:21.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have rarely seen any of those champions actually build {{item:3071}}.
