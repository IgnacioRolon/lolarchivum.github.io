This is pretty ridiculous, ive never had a problem with this game in the 3 years ive played it. Now all of the sudden, the game is running slower and laggy and choppy. My computer was smooth and had no interruption during high action 5v5 team fights, and now its choppy and i can barely make out anything. In game, my ping is 18-19 ms. When i do speed test on my comp, its 12 ms, I have a cable internet speed of 180 mbps, but drops to 90 when i play league. I live an hour from Chicago, which is where they moved servers. I have a windows 8 computer, 8 gigs of ram, 64 bit processor, AMD A8-5500 APU w/ Radeon HD graphics 3.20 GHz. Its not the best but i get by, and have gotten by before.\r\nIve uninstalled and reinstalled the game to no avail, i cleaned out any useless league folders, i close every other background app on my computer, Lower graphic settings and everything. Nothing helps. What is going on here?","replies":[{"poster":"PowerOfLegend","date":"2017-04-09T02:53:12.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue, but my network is fine and always has been but all of a sudden i used to get 300+ fps at base and ~200 fps in game (laning phase , ... ) but now, even in very high or very low i get around 120 fps and it sutters while in teamfights and even on lane... i have checked nvidia control panel , vsync off, ... it just started lagging..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-07T20:46:15.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're still seeing a lot of lag and choppiness even when your ping is that good, you might be having some issues with packet loss.
