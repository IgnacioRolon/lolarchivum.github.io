Thanks everyone for your patience.\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 3:01PM\n\n>Early word from network engineers is that the problem should be resolved.  Waiting a bit to call it just in case it's a false positive\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 2:46 PM\n\n>Still investigating.  Checked with team about chat issues, and they are likely a result of the same issue causing log ins to fail.  Gameplay shouldn't be impacted, but we're keeping an eye on things while we triage.\n\n------------------------------\n\n>#Update 2:21 PM\n\n>We're still investigating potential root cause, but at the moment this does seem to be limited to players on the east coast. \n\n------------------------------\n\nAt about 1:30 PM Pacific Time our tech team started to notice a decent spike in players getting stuck trying to authenticate or log in to the client. We&#039;re aware of the issue and are looking into what&#039;s gone wrong.
