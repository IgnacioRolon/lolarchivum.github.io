Thanks everyone for your patience.\n  \n______\n\n> Update 2:21 PM\n> We're still investigating potential root cause, but at the moment this does seem to be limited to players on the east coast.\n\nAt about 1:30 PM Pacific Time our tech team started to notice a decent spike in players getting stuck trying to authenticate or log in to the client. We're aware of the issue and are looking into what's gone wrong. In the meantime, most players have had success using a VPN to solve any authentication problems, but this should only be used as a temporary solution. We will continue updating this issue on the [**Live Incident Breakdown Post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/live-incident-breakdown-na/3EVNI0ag-1032017-stuck-at-authenticating-isssues)!\n\nEDIT: This issue shouldn't kick anyone out of games since this is only affecting authentication. If you were disconnected mid game, try some of the basic troubleshooting steps in our connection guide first and then we can dive deeper with you one on one!","replies":[{"poster":"Zialeska","date":"2017-10-03T20:50:44.292+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My entire day off  has been spent trying to fix my client because I cant log in...
