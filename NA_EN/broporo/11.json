{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-19T03:32:16.227+0000","title":"We're unable to log you in because you may be offline","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://i.gyazo.com/c3879b361cc57c0ab297312818cd81a9.png\nWe've noticed that a good number of players have been unable to login over the past 24 hours, even though they still have a solid internet connection. It seems like this might be happening due to something redirecting your connection so that it can never reach our servers. Some players have been able to use this workaround to finally get logged in:\n\n\nPC:\n- Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Open \"LeagueClientSettings.yaml\" with notepad\n- Find the line: gameflow-patcher-lock:\n- Delete this whole line\n- Save the file, restart your LoL Client - and you should be able to log in again.\n\nMAC:\n-  Start and log onto League of Legends\n-  Open Finder\n-  Go to Applications\n-  Right-click on League of Legends\n-  Select Show Package Contents\n-  Open Contents\n-  Open LoL\n-  Open Config\n-  Locate LeagueClientSettings.yaml\n-  Open it with a text editor and and find gameflow-patcher-lock\n-  Delete the whole line\n-  Save file and restart the client\n\nIf these steps don't seem to help at all, never fear! Our tech guys have another option up their sleeve that should help, but if this other option is done incorrectly it could have some bad results. Because of that, we'd like to guide you through those steps one on one in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"DE4D4LIFE","date":"2017-06-24T01:59:14.591+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your League continues to display \"you may be offline\", follow the steps in this link\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/36668374/how-do-i-solve-the-server-dns-address-could-not-be-found-error-on-windows-10\n\nHope it works for you guys :)","replies":[{"poster":"Taeiou","date":"2017-07-21T06:07:39.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This also is the fix that worked for me, and none others that I've tried.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mac Cheese","date":"2017-07-13T11:12:40.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"legend!!! \nsame for me, i tried every other 'solution' that didnt work for me, and this one worked!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nugamachi","date":"2017-07-11T19:25:40.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This worked for me too! thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Momoko","date":"2017-07-07T06:04:36.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tysm it worked I tried all the other solutions but they didnt work\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atim0667","date":"2017-09-23T09:46:26.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its worked.. thank you.\ncan i also ask if i should change it back to the default settings after  a period of time fearing that these settings might effect other areas..?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Will Schleicher","date":"2017-06-19T04:21:15.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I would like to add that many people have a modified hosts file in c:/windows/systems32/drivers/etc due to an easy connection error fix from a while back.
