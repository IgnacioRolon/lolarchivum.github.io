We've started to notice some issues with FPS drops whenever Swain is in a match. Engineers have been gathering info to alleviate this as quickly as possible, but it'd be really helpful if you all could pitch in to speed things up! \n\nThe steps we'll need you to do will involve making some manual changes to the game config files, but they won't impact your gameplay. These steps only change what happens with the log files generated after a match is finished.\n\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config and double-click the \"game.cfg\" file. \n- Press \"select a program\" and click OK. Uncheck the box at the bottom that says \"always use the selected...\". \n- Find Notepad and double-click it.In notepad add the following line to the [Performance] section. \"LiveProfile=1\" It should look similar to this:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/e3115344bb152eb0a6bc0aaded176fdb.png\n\n...make sure to save this file within Notepad. Once that's done you can play a custom game with swain to test your FPS. Test for at least a few minutes then quit the custom game. Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\Performance Logs. Attach the log files from here to your support ticket.\n\n[**Click Here to Submit a Ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ","replies":[{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2018-02-11T02:33:10.333+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have been fps issues since like 5 patches ago that haven't been fixed","replies":[{"poster":"MirirLightHammer","date":"2018-02-18T19:48:28.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could at least pin this posts so everyone sees them....","replies":[]},{"poster":"u3arigatou","date":"2018-02-16T14:53:12.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes this so true. there is an entire topic on it and no-one has even acknowledged it. not to mention the constant bug-splats in game that hasn't been addressed. riot plz!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-02-09T06:36:33.274+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad this is being talked about and pinned on the top of the boards","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoDragonsPlz","date":"2018-02-09T16:55:54.452+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd like to point out it's not just Swain causing this.
