There will also be a 50% discount active until Feb 6th @ 11AM PST! With the amount of transfers happening all at once, we do anticipate that they *may* take a little longer than usual to process. Please be patient with transfers when it first comes up!\n\nCouple things to point out to help alleviate any confusion:\n\n- If you have finished your placements before transferring, you will need to play one placement game to be placed on the new server\n- If you have not finished placements, you will likely need to start a new round of 10 placements\n\n\n_**UPDATE:**_ We got a little more info regarding when transfers will go live...\n\n> Please note that this won't be activated immediately, as we need all servers to be on the same patch before this can be enabled - as well as giving a little time for the \"patch dust\" to settle and keep an eye out for any critical issues - so don't panic if you don't see it immediately! ^_^","replies":[]}
