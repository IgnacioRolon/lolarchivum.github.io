We&#039;re working on getting those servers back up so that you&#039;ll be able to sign on once again, but if you&#039;re currently logged in you should not be affected. \n\nAs a method of loss prevention, **Ranked Play has been disabled**. If someone is disconnected from a ranked game while the login servers are down, they would not be able to get logged in and back in the match.\n\nBe sure to check out [**status page**](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) for updates, and we&#039;ll be sure to post updates here as well!\n\n> **EDIT:** As of 4:36 PST the login issues should be resolved!","replies":[]}
