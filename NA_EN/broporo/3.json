Or has it! WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!!\n\nIs what I'm sure all of you are thinking right about now. PBE Signups have officially launched again, but it looks like we underestimated the traffic of that page a wee bit. The \"Check Eligibility\" tool *is* working, it's just that so many of you guys are excited to try PBE that the tool is working a little slower than it should. \n\nPlease be patient with the PBE signups for now while it catches up with checking everyone's eligibility. If it hasn't worked for you yet, give it a couple hours and try again. \n\nBe sure to shoot your [**PBE feedback over here**](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-pbe-feedback/JtsFmpNI-pbe-sign-ups-are-open)!\n\n\nEDIT: We now have a [**status page up for PBE**](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe)!","replies":[{"poster":"DaenrysTargaryen","date":"2017-10-12T21:25:46.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am getting this error\nSomething went wrong.
