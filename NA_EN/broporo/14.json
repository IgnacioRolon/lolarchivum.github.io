By using a VPN, your connection can be routed in a way so that it avoids certain unreliable ISP nodes.\n\n\n\nWe've noticed our EU players have been having difficulty getting logged in on the client, getting a string of disconnections, or simply never seeing any champions in champ select. While these issues can sometimes stem from server problems or network issues, We're beginning to suspect that this might be centralized around specific ISP nodes based on player traceroutes. \n\nWe've seen that some players have had success getting logged back in by [**reconfiguring their DNS settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5). This isn't necessarily a 100% fix, but we'd like to give this a go if nothing else has worked for you. \n\nIf troubleshooting that DNS wasn't able to help, do us a favor and run a traceroute using [**WinMTR**](http://winmtr.net/) and the IP for your region below. Take that traceroute info and send it over to our tech guys in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that we can get a better idea of how to fix this issue up!\n\nIP for EUNE Traceroute: 31.186.224.42\n\nIP for EUW Traceroute:192.64.170.252","replies":[{"poster":"adasdfasdfasfasd","date":"2017-06-23T06:19:05.308+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also if this is our issue, how come we are able to perfecly use the NA client, and connect to the na server, without lags( ofc the 160 ping from the distance) but other than that, no lags picking a champ, no lags logging in, no lags stuck in auth or loading, how does that make sense? if our ISP providers fucks up how come we are still able to play in such a perfect condition in NA, someone please explain me that.","replies":[{"poster":"Follower 16","date":"2017-07-06T21:06:50.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Crazy thing is, I'm in NA and am having the same issue.
