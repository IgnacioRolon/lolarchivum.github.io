When we login after rewards are handed out, a small menu appears and asks us to choose a ward skin. If you're level 3 you'll only be able to choose the level 3 ward skin, but if you're level 5 you'll be able to pick any of them.\n\n-Give us all of the skins. If you're level 5 you get all three, but if you're level 3 you'll only get one. Hitting level 5 honour is really hard for some people, as they have to change their mindset in order to be nice and climb. Three ward skins are an appropriate price imo.\n\n-Change the structure of the ward. Level 3 and 5 honour flairs differ greatly in structure. You could make a different ward for each level and give it out as usual. Level 3 ward could be simple and only have 1 leaf. Level 4 could be like the one you already showed but with only 2 leaves, and level 5 could be similar too, but much bigger and flashier (like the honour 5 flair, which has those bright lines) , and with 3 leaves. Level 3 players will get the level 3 ward, level 4 will get level 4 ward and so on. Then, combine this with one of the two points mentioned above. Let us choose a colour or give us all three. This way, we can show off the honour level we got, but also use a ward colour that we like. Maybe people will still want the ward that a lower rank gets you (even though colour here is more important than structure so there will be less people complaining), but in that case, perhaps a support ticket may solve things.\n\n\n\n(Also, if you en up letting us choose, please make the honour 2 green colour available <3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodyVampir","date":"2017-10-07T18:51:45.180+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would also love to obtain all 3 ward skins since I love blue and green :/ I think we deserve to get all 3 skins since we passed through all 5 levels and so we should be able to pick our favourite one out of these 3.\nAnd could you also explain the chroma thing more?\nSo is there a chroma for 3v3 ranked, flex & soloQ and dependend where we get gold we get the correlated chroma?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lidia","date":"2017-10-08T07:29:10.590+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 Derank honor level 5 to level 3, I dont care, blue for the win {{sticker:sg-lux}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lunabel","date":"2017-10-07T18:47:06.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So wait are there 2 separate chroma's for TT and Flex queue?","replies":[{"poster":"Keyru","date":"2017-10-07T18:58:44.036+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep!
