It should have a number there.\n> - Change the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\n> - Save the file.\n> - Restart the client.\n> \n> **For Mac**\n1) Start and log onto League of Legends\n2) Open Finder\n3) Go to Applications\n4) Right-click on League of Legends\n5) Select Show Package Contents\n6) Open Contents\n7) Open LoL\n8) Open Config\n9) Locate LeagueClientSettings.yaml\n10) Open it with a text editor and and find gameflow-patcher-lock. It should have a number there.\n11)  Change the number to read \"null\" (without quotes)\n12) Save file and restart the client\n\n> Let us know if this helped you in the comments below!\n-Porocles\n\n---\n\nMany of our players have run into this strange issue where the client tells them that their username or password is incorrect, but they are still able to login to the support site without any issues.\n\nIt seems that this is being caused when the patcher doesn't realize that it needs to check for a patch, or that the patcher is still on the incorrect patch. Some players have been able to work around this by grabbing our [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and running a *Force Repatch*, while others have noticed that after waiting a bit their client will update and the issue resolves itself.\n\nIf that method doesn't seem to help, try switching your region to something different which should force a patch. After that patch, switch your region back to normal and try logging in.\n\nI appreciate any feedback about what may have worked or not worked for you guys, and if these steps aren't helping I encourage you to submit a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so that our tech team can help you troubleshoot this!","replies":[{"poster":"The1Fluffy","date":"2017-05-24T02:22:29.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would try this, but that line already reads null in my file.","replies":[{"poster":"Ahri Baka","date":"2017-05-24T22:37:05.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here xD","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T22:44:36.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update!
