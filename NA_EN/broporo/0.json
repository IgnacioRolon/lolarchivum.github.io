{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-10T20:45:38.908+0000","title":"Arcade Mode: Game Guide","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/WyKYjYO.jpg\n\n> #**Introducing the Battle Bosses!**\n\nStep aside Veigar and grab a seat Blitz, it&rsquo;s time to let the new Bosses run the show! Let the ARCADE event begin! \n\nWhat&rsquo;s that you said about Missions?\n\nEveryone will start out with the first mission &ldquo;Villain&rsquo;s Rule&rdquo; which unlocks the Starter Mission Icon. Keep this icon handy, as you&rsquo;ll need to have it equipped in order to proceed through the next mission lines! \n\nSpeaking of&hellip;..each player will have access to two different sets of missions after &ldquo;Villain&rsquo;s Rule&rdquo;: Game Start: Blitzcrank and Game Start: Veigar. Each has 4 missions to complete, so make sure you&rsquo;re prepared for the battles to come!\n\n***None of these missions will require you buy a pass***, but we suggest nabbing those Passes for the best loot drops!\n\n>#**Fancy Dungeon Pass?**\n\nAs with the Order vs Chaos Event, we&rsquo;ve got a couple special items in the shop to help you get the upper hand on these Bosses! \n\nFirst up we have the Mini-Dungeon Pass:\n\n * Purchasing this pass will instantly unlock the Arcade Poro Ward AND Daily Missions!\n  * Daily Missions will be a little more fluid this time around, with the first starting on Aug 10th at 11:00 PT. Each day they will expire at ***23:59 LOCAL TIME!*** This should help alleviate any confusion around when they will end in each time zone, as it will be based off your own time. Following this trend, new daily missions should be popping up right at midnight for your local time as well!\n\nFor those who have been prepping themselves for raid night, we&rsquo;ve got the Dungeon Pass:\n\n * The full Dungeon Pass includes access to 3 bonus mission lines modeled after the new Battle Bosses! \n * Along with access to extra missions, you&rsquo;ll also be getting everything from the Mini-Pass as well as some bonus items such as the Arcade Poro Icon, a gemstone, and who could forget dat sweet loot: 4 Great Orbs.\n\n>#**Sweet Loot you say?!**\n\nWe&rsquo;ll also be adding some new types of hextech items for this event as well: Good, Great, and Mega Orbs! Each orb will cost Tickets that you&rsquo;ll be acquiring from missions, and each has slightly different rewards. You can see what the RNGods can bless you with in each one by hovering over them in your Loot tab!\n\nOrbs can actually snowball; you have a chance of an Orb dropping another Orb of the same level, and then that one can open into another, and another! COMBO!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a00a35e893f245123e67b77c21d17bad.png\n\n\n\n>#**What the heck is this crazy new Summoner&rsquo;s Rift?!**\n\nWhile we did give SR a little upgrade for the Battle Boss Event, we do understand that some of you prefer the good ol&rsquo; days! We have included a way for you to disable all of the fancy Arcade assets on the new SR so that you can get back to basics.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/40ee4f659908eabd4208137e26b35778.png\n\n>#**How long do I have to use these tickets?**\n\nThis event officially ends on Aug 24th, but you&rsquo;ll be able to use any leftovers tickets up until Sept 11th. \n\n\n\n\n>#**A New Mythic Skin Approaches!**\n\nLancer Zero Hecarim charges onto the battlefield! \n\nThis skin will fall into the Mythic category; those that can be acquired by using 10 Gemstones. BUT WAIT, THERE&rsquo;S MORE! The new Mega-Orbs will also have a very small chance of dropping this new mythic skin as well!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/194e6a85a43ddb4945216b3d21c62507.png\n\n\n>#**FAQ**\n\n- Some players have been reporting that they haven't received their New Level Icon for completing the first mission. Thankfully, any of the 2015/2016 Arcade Icons should work towards missions completion, but feel free to comment below and we can get that icon sent out!\n\n- [**Check out the full post for more details**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/learn-more-arcade-boss-world-event)!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Ghostface","date":"2017-08-15T22:05:30.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"once youve completed the daily missions can you only do them once?\n\ni finished the missions and for the past two days i havent gotten the free missions back (daily missions)\n\nsome insight would be nice. thanks {{champion:41}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-16T01:32:21.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, there's only one Daily Mission for each day.
