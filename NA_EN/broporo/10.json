HELP!!!**\n \n -  The VS Event officially ended on 6/29/2017. The current iteration of missions were specifically set up for this special event, but this was only the first iteration of missions! We don't have details at this time, but be on the lookout for missions to roll around again sometime in the future!\n\n\n>  **What about all my leftover Orbs and Tokens?!?!**\n  \n  -  Never Fear! They won't be going anywhere until 07/24/2017. Until then, you can still craft those tokens into icons, keys, orbs, etc. You will also have the ability to disenchant any extra tokens into blue essence at a rate of 10 Tokens = 10 Blue Essence.\n\n\n> **I bought the Border Icon but I don't have the Legendary Skin associated with them, am I out of luck?**\n \n- The Dawnbringer Riven and Nightbringer Yasuo skins will be sticking around in the store, so as long as you got the border icon unlocked via tokens you can buy the associated skin at any time and have that border applied to that skin.\n\n> **What was the purpose of this event or that Victor's Emblem???**\n\n-  Now that the event has ended and the winner has been decided, you can visit our [**VS Event page**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/vs-2017) to read the conclusion of the comic to see who won. You can also now craft the special Victor's Emblem into an icon representing who won the battle.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLegëñd27","date":"2017-07-03T23:52:04.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does this mean missions are only going to be used for events and stuff?
