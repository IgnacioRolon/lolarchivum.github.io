If you plan on killing these characters canonically, you're just going to end up pissing people off. When Gangplank was \"dead\" everybody was annoyed because the character was disabled in game. These characters aren't just Gangplank though. They are fan favorites. Nobody's story has been elaborated on and it would be premature. On top of that,  I would assume that the League itself would not allow someone to murder other champions outside of the Fields. I know that you've said that the art is not 1-1 with lore, but I noticed on the q and a that the word \"yet\" was used in this regard. If this was a misunderstanding, I would appreciate a response to alleviate my fears.\n\nEdit: Sorry if that sounded a bit rude. I didn't mean it as such. Also, I am not opposed to using Zed and Shen for an event like that, but the other 3 really don't seem to have anything to do with this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foucz","date":"2016-01-16T21:21:50.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"Well this is silly you guys barely spend time to develop already existing champions and you use teaser's (that are usually the only thing we get like with jinx) to not trully showcase the character ?

Instead, I'd like to postulate that the connections he has with Zed and Sona might go a bit deeper.\n\nZed of course being the murderer of Shen's father and a former apprentice of his strikes a nerve for Jhin, since it's implied Shen's father was the one who got Jhin incarcerated, and so he resents Zed not just for_ being_ an apprentice of but also taking his life before Jhin could have a shot.\n\nFor Sona I'm going to throw out some thought I've had recently. Sona didn't leave Ionia until her teenage years, and she would've been exceptionally proficient with the etwahl by then. Jhin's taunts imply he is disgusted by Sona's way of making art, as he doesn't see the beauty in using music to bring peace and happiness. This is potentially exacerbated by the fact we know her etwahl has a capacity to cause destruction. Perhaps Jhin has met Sona before, and thinks of her as a true artistic rival, one who is flawed in not only her body (being mute) but also in her artistic pursuits. If that's got a hint of truth to it the last time these two would've probably met would've been when Sona was a teenager, and it likely would've ended up being during the course of the Noxian invasion, if we assume Sona's in her mid to late twenties at the moment. \n\nJust some things to think about. My head canon now is that Sona had a not to pleasant encounter or two with Jhin in her teen years and potentially even before that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phendrixx","date":"2016-02-04T19:06:57.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found out his connection with Sona!
