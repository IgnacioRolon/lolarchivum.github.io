Unfortunately, most error messages you experience while patching can be completely ambiguous, such as \"An unexpected error has occurred\".  \n\nHowever, most every single Error Message you encounter (at least at 33% and beyond), usually indicates an issue with downloading required installation files from our Servers.  Commonly, people experience issues downloading files when overzealous 3rd party security programs deem League of Legends a \"threat\", and cut off the connection to ensure no more files are downloaded to your computer.  This will either generate an error message, or just stop the download altogether.  To that end, make sure that you follow all of the steps in the following Knowledge Base Article in hopes of resolving this issue:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/22114820-Firewall-Configuration-for-League-of-Legends\n\nIf after completing all of the steps found there, and if you are still experiencing issues, then I strongly recommend that you submit a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to us here in Player Support and include the following logs to give us an idea of your Network Configuration:\n\n1) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list","replies":[{"poster":"DesertSpirit","date":"2014-02-04T19:07:28.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This didn't help.
