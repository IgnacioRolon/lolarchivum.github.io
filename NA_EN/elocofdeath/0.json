Instead of only flushing your DNS, make sure you're adjusting your DNS server settings using the steps in this screenshot....\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a51c6f92b35ca00e4fbab9fc088b93d7.png\n\nand also check out the other steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) while you're at it!

Go ahead and reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and make sure you send them some network logs you can generate using the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).
