That is sad as fck. 5 - 6 WEEKS, just stop the bs and say u not releasing transfers until next season because thats basically what u saying","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-23T03:55:36.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully those transfer are able to be fixed sooner than later, but be sure to check back in [**HollyMonster's post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/rlu6awv4-transfer-service-update) for the quickest updates.","replies":[{"poster":"AquaB0ii","date":"2017-11-23T17:53:15.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5-6 weeks = quickest updates lol.

That makes no sense 5-6 week you might aswell build a new game to play.  to be honest thats probably why the comments to that thread is locked cause even riot knows people are going to drill into them about the bs they just said. 5-6weeks..... tell me what takes that long... gotta fly to EUW?
