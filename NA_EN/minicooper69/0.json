Sometimes it happens twice a game depending how long the game goes. During that minute i can go and use the internet. So my internet is still working while this is happening. It also seems to happen more when im using curse talking to buddies but still happens when im playing solo. I have not been able to play ranked in months because of this issue. As you can imagine its very frustrating! If any one knows what the problem is and how to fix it that would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"56821429_DEL","date":"2016-09-26T02:38:57.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same problem and it just started yesterday.
