The reasons why my items were sooo messed up are because, near the end of the game, since I was no help to the team (damage wise) I tried tanking (which isn&#039;t the best idea on Azir ) I thought it might&#039;ve helped the team but it only helped me get banned. Not only that but, even though I told my team &quot;since im not doing shit im gonna tank&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m done with Azir&quot; meaning knew i was doing bad but,they still decided to report me for int&#039;ing. I even told them I was feeding on accident in early game and no ganks later im 2/14 and later ending the game with 2/27. Plus I&#039;ve spent so much money on League and im really disappointed that hundreds of dollar are down the drain.","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-15T00:54:40.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feeding is not an accident\nIf the opposing laner can kill you once , he can kill you twice .\nAzir is late game \n27 deaths in a single game is too much\nRiot won't ban you off of a single match , this must be routine","replies":[{"poster":"SrbLud","date":"2017-02-15T00:57:02.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MaeDoSan,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=numqIIWw,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-15T00:54:40.084+0000)\n>\n> Feeding is not an accident\n> If the opposing laner can kill you once , he can kill you twice .\n> Azir is late game \n> 27 deaths in a single game is too much\n> Riot won&#x27;t ban you off of a single match , this must be routine\n\nSurprisingly enough that is the only game he fed hard.\nI checked him on op.gg","replies":[{"poster":"MaeDoSan","date":"2017-02-15T00:59:30.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If 27 deaths is what you call fed hard , maybe he wasn't so bad but was still reported before because his team saw him as a reason for their loss","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-02-15T00:50:32.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe you were mistakenly banned you can submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and request they manually review your case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2017-02-18T00:45:55.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit lol 27?!
