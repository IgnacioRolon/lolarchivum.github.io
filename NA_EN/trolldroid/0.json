If you are unable to see content in the updated client's hextech screen, see if it shows up on the legacy client:\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tallentkz","date":"2016-11-26T17:19:34.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem i had 2 key fragments, last night now i changed my client, i played a few one for all and i checked my crafting stuff as i usually do before i log out and I see my fragments are missing whats that all about?","replies":[]}]}
