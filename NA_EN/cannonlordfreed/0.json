I can still see that I sent one through my email, but when I try and check it on the service page it says it doesn't exist anymore like it just got deleted. Anyone know what's going on?","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-16T22:11:39.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...tickets usually do not completely disappear.  What is the unique ticket number that you were given in your email?  I should be able to look into it a bit further!","replies":[{"poster":"CannonLordFreed","date":"2016-05-17T00:04:14.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Number apparently do things at the beginning 21690856. It's kind of extraneous circumstances so I understand why it would disappear. The issue is the e-mail and password to my account have been changed without my permission or doing so. Quite frankly I'm amazed I was even able to make a support ticket under this account or sign in to make this post here.

You should get a response from them in the near future and they should be able to work with you in order to get your account back.\n\nI hope this helps!  ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"CannonLordFreed","date":"2016-05-17T22:52:38.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, thank you for your time.
