From chiptune scores to the sweeping symphonies of expansive fantasy worlds,the relationship shared between games and music simultaneously elevates both art forms. Frequencies is a behind-the-scenes look at that harmony at Riot; the moment when creativity, collaboration, and passion collide to forge and reinforce story through music.","url":"http://frequencies.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/frequencies/#projects","image":"http://frequencies.na.leagueoflegends.com/assets/frequencies/img/rating_en_US.jpg"},"up_votes":25,"down_votes":0,"body":"I listen to the music of league of legends a lot, and I would greatly enjoy the opportunity to play this music without having to listen to listen to all the songs slowed down to write my music. I was wondering if Riot would sell scores of their music, as I believe that not only would it increase the profits of the company (due to the fact that the scores already exist and all that would be needed is to print them and design an additional merch page), but it would also bring happiness to me and many other members of the League of Legends community, many of whom are musicians.\r\n\r\nPlease up vote, and thank you for your time.\r\n-Salty","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2017-01-23T23:49:14.168+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted!","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyTheSummoner","date":"2017-01-25T02:15:25.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ed the Conqueror,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=BTQOG25r,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-23T23:49:14.168+0000)\n>\n> Upvoted!\n\nThanks a lot!
