Anyways, it seems like every game I do, people are just complete assholes. When one thing goes wrong, everyone points fingers at one person. I've seen it a lot in 4 man premade queues when I'm playing Solo Queue. It's so annoying. If I do one thing wrong, my entire team flames and reports me, even if I don't say anything. And keep in mind, this has been happening to me since BRONZE FUCKING 4. To anyone who is reading this that is higher elo, is it the same in Gold+? Is it worth it for me to keep climbing if all I'm going to do is encounter these toxic, feeding, trolls? Please let me know, because I'm debating whether or not I want to waste time climbing when I'm just going to be flamed. And by the way, Riot's report system isn't doing shit for me. I have been called many really bad things, whether it be general pejoratives or racial slurs. And this happens all game. I don't mute people because I need to actually communicate with my team, but ignoring it isn't very easy when they're spamming shit in chat because they macroed it to their keyboard.

Riot has a 0% tolerance policy. Also some things like asking for reports being harassment is silly, if Riot just straight up came out and massively reminded the community for a month that more than one report is not necessary that action would stop. Instead, it's a bannable offense because they expect players to know that more reports won't get their report seen faster. Some of their rules are high shooting and a lot of players get banned for minor mistakes. And you're right about it getting worse up OMG I've heard tales of people in Challenger throwing fits worse than a Bronze V player. Because they are good, and they think they're perfect because they're top 1%.","replies":[{"poster":"o Maui o","date":"2017-04-19T13:17:31.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Understandable\" is not the same thing as \"acceptable.\"","replies":[{"poster":"dYW7w6mjp1","date":"2017-04-19T13:59:00.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mars Ragnarok,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=mVITdeJf,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-19T13:17:31.955+0000)\n>\n> \"Understandable\" is not the same thing as \"acceptable.\"\n\nNot always. If you beat someone in self defense your punishment will be a lot lower than if you just beat someone. If you're passive aggressive instead of toxic to a toxic player it should be self defense. However, Riot does not see context like people in the real world, yes there are things you can't do that are unacceptable (like bombing a building, even if you have a reason). Actually in context that's okay as well, if you're a deconstruction worker you can blow up a building set to be deconstructed, because of context.

Especially in lower elos, below plat I mean, people just don't understand basic macro and don't understand snowball system of league. As if for instance you have Jax who plays vs Fiora and fiora gets 1 or 2 kills. In lower elos instead of giving up farm and keeping the tower alive this Jax will just feed harder and harder and lead to a situation in which you play 4 vs 6 because Jax is 3 levels behind Fiora. This is the most apparent reason why people especially in lower elo flame so hard because other players might even unconsciously ruin their game singlehandedly. I know it's a team game but it's not a game like R6 Siege or Counter Strike where rounds last for 3 to 4 minutes and every round you more or less have equal chances of winning. In league the game usually snowballs out of control in addition to existence of super hard carry champions like Yasuo, Master Yi or Kassadin which are best picks for smurfs because are the easiest to 1 vs 9 them the game.\n\nAnother very triggering thing is the amount of AFKs in low elo. When I was in Gold 2 I remember that I had a match where I was playing Fiora vs Gnar and my jungle and mid went simultaneously afk in 4 min of the game. We lost in 21 mins and I lost -25 lp because of that and even though everybody reported them, nothing happened they didn't get banned or anything. They received the same penalty as the people that actually played the game 3 vs 5 and lost.\n\nI get it that Riot can't just be permissive of not giving a penalty in lp when you lose a game but I personally believe that there is a huge amount of players who are just really good at the game and have their skill much higher than their elo suggests but because of the certain issues that Riot ranked system has they are hardstuck and as the time goes they become really frustrated and start flaming and may become oversensitive to other players feeding, not smiting well or just over that they play vs smurfs.\n\nNot to mention the fact that even though you might go 0/10 and be completely useless in a match you may still be promoted to higher tier because of luck that your team is carrying you or just that you duo with a Grandmaster tier friend who boosts you while playing in duo.\n\nAnother thing are winning streaks that can get you in 30 matches from Silver to Diamond. This is a big bullshit because nobody is that good that they win every match even though they might just crush their opponents in lane or gank extremely well cause how you gank when your 3 lanes are 0/5. \n\nIt's nearly impossible to make a perfect match making and ranked system but there are so many evident error in Riot's that it's no surprise that people that want to climb as the time goes on become tilted and start flaming, trolling, afking etc.\n\nIn my opinion competitive scene in LoL is really healthy and developing but the balance in the game and just the attitude of people makes the game in the longer run unenjoyable, stressful and tilting. Especially if your favourite champion doesn't get skin in 4 years and Yasuo, Zed and Lux get one every month or when you main Aurelion Sol that just gets destroyed by the rework comparing to newly reworked diana which is completely broken and in high elo has permabanned status.","replies":[{"poster":"Arammus","date":"2020-01-05T17:22:01.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NEKROOOO!!!\n\nwriting a wall of text in a 3 year old post that will now end up locked thanks to you lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Magical Poop","date":"2019-07-18T16:26:11.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"becouse they have no influence what you do and they're triggering becouse they think that one mistake can lead to lose","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonesybones","date":"2019-05-26T05:02:38.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It going to take effort and time to turn this community around.

Like a project that you build over a period of time, small mistakes accumulate to cause major consequences, and with it being a team game and all, people tend to get frustrated with the fact that they can't interfere, and basically what happens is that the inch of glass seperates you from the other player, basically to the point of objectification by champion. You don't ever see any reports asking to report a certain username, it's always the champion (except in one4all) that takes center stage. You wouldn't feel bad for screaming insults at a rock, or your pen, or that lamp in your room. However, try saying it to a stranger you just met. If you're fun, make jokes, or talk and connect with the people in your game, high chance is, they'll be nice and accepting of your mistakes, or at least won't tell you that you're a _degenerate pile of severed bull penises covered in shit_ I have been called those exact same words. They don't see you as a person unless you are going out of your way to be one. Everyone's focused on the game way too much. Nevertheless, it is subjective to the person and their experience. You might be the nicest person in the world, but we all have a boiling point. Could be working your ass off, having time for one game and having it be ruined by a troll or a flamer. Or it could be facing an extremely irritating ~~teemo~~ ~~zed~~ ~~darius~~ champion. But there's always the bad apple in the mix, who can't see his own error and only focuses on your tiniest of mistakes, and the toxic sludge. These are probably younger gamers, with bad judgement and a hotheaded attitude. Either that or they're sociopaths, either way, tell them to calm down and ignore them, but if they're really bad just mute them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheClicker","date":"2018-02-23T13:23:48.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had two games now where bot lane was 0.9.3 / 0.6.0 and 0.7.2 / 0.8.1 not a single kill between them in each game.

The problem with team games is individual effort does not matter if everyone else doesn't apply the same amount, and that too frustrates people.
