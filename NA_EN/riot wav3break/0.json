Ultimately this has not panned out exactly as intended. Thus we are moving their kit a bit more towards this direction in an attempt to better fulfill this design intent.\n* Current Kindred players are attached to their live play-style of snowballing and looking for smaller skirmishes to succeed. We don&rsquo;t want to remove this pattern of play from them, but we are looking to exchange some power here to let them access longer range on their attacks and abilities.\n* As a jungler, Kindred needs to be a threat in the early game or they will always fail to provide a baseline amount of pressure for their team to have a fair shot at winning. With this in mind, we are aiming to keep their early game power relatively similar/slightly stronger in exchange for a weaker mid game but stronger late game. \n\n**_Current Change List: _**\n\n**Q - Dance of Arrows**\n\n* No longer gains base damage per stack of Mark of the Kindred\n* Now grants Kindred 10/15/20/25/30% attack speed for 4 seconds on cast, increased by 5% per stack of **Mark of the Kindred**\n* AD Ratio :: Changed from 0.2 Total AD ratio &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.75 Bonus AD Ratio\n* Base Vault Speed :: increased from 400 &gt;&gt;&gt; 500\n\n**W - Wolf&rsquo;s Frenzy**\n\n* Can now direct Wolf to a position within 500 units of Lamb before creating the hunting territory. Wolf can go over walls while travelling in this way. This range does not scale with Mark Of the Kindred stacks. \n* Wolf now deals magic damage instead of physical damage\n* Wolf now deals an additional 1.5% of the target&rsquo;s current health per attack as base damage, increased by 0.5% per stack of **Mark of the Kindred**\n* AD Ratio :: 0.4 Total AD ratio &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.2 Bonus AD Ratio\n\n**E - Mounting Dread**\n\n* Damage Type of Wolf&rsquo;s Attack :: Changed from physical &gt;&gt;&gt; magic\n* Base damage :: Reduced from 40/75/110/145/180 &gt;&gt;&gt; 40/60/80/100/120\n* Missile Speed of Wolf&rsquo;s attack :: Increased from 1600 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2000\n* AD Ratio :: 0.2 Total AD ratio &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.8 Bonus AD Ratio\n* % Health Damage :: Changed from 5% max health damage &gt;&gt;&gt; 8% Missing Health damage, increased by 0.5% per stack of **Mark of the Kindred**\n* Jaws of Death :: Wolf&rsquo;s attack critically strikes targets below 15% health for 50% more damage. Critical Strike chance increases the % health threshold for this critical strike to occur by 0.5% per 1% crit chance. \n\n**Passive - Mark of The  Kindred**\n\n* No longer grants Lamb bonus % current health damage on her basic attacks\n* Now amplifies all of Kindred&rsquo;s basic abilities in the ways mentioned above\n* Every 4 marks increases Kindred&rsquo;s basic attack, Dance of Arrows and Mounting Dread&rsquo;s cast range. The first 4 marks increase their ranges by 75, while every 4 marks after increase their ranges by 25. \n\nEverything listed is subject to change from your feedback and testing so candid feedback is most appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-05-16T06:14:55.745+0000","up_votes":109,"down_votes":5,"body":"A Kindred rework?

This makes them a ton less feast of famine because we can start being a normal jungler and scale with gold/items instead of blindly following marks to be relevant in the later stages in the game.\n\n**W - Wolf’s Frenzy**\n\n_* Can now send Wolf to a position within 500 units of Lamb before creating the hunting territory. Wolf can go over walls.\n* Wolf now deals magic damage instead of physical damage\n* Wolf now deals an additional 1.5% of the target’s current health per attack as base damage, increased by 0.5% per stack of Mark of the Kindred\n* AD Ratio :: 0.4 Total AD ratio >>> 0.2 Bonus AD Ratio_\n\nAmazing change, makes Kindred more tactical and W will be more useful for scouting, for example at baron and dragon fights (it's possible to send wolf over walls now as well but it's really hard to do and risky if enemy is on the other side).\nThe magic damage change will make it so Kindred will be really hard to itemize against when ahead and I guess that also makes their clear a little bit better? Will have to check. The %current health damage also makes them a pretty good toplaner, especially with other changes that decrease the value of marks (like the total AD -> bonus AD)\nI really like those changes and they should definitely stay (numbers can be adjusted)\n\n**E - Mounting Dread**\n\n_* Damage Type of Wolf’s Attack :: Changed from physical >>> magic\n* Base damage :: Reduced from 40/75/110/145/180 >>> 40/60/80/100/120\n* Missile Speed of Wolf’s attack :: Increased from 1600 >>> 2000\n* AD Ratio :: 0.2 Total AD ratio >>> 0.8 Bonus AD Ratio\n* % Health Damage :: Changed from 5% max health damage >>> 8% Missing Health damage, increased by 0.5% per stack of Mark of the Kindred\n* Jaws of Death :: Wolf’s attack critically strikes targets below 15% health for 50% more damage. Critical Strike chance increases the % health threshold for this critical strike to occur by 0.5% per 1% crit chance._\n\nReally love the fact that it's finally changed to a finisher move since Kindred were so good at starting fights but had nothing to finish them. Again the change from physical to magic makes Kindred harder to itemize against. This will have amazing synergy with Kindred's ultimate because it means that Wolf will always crit even after the heal, which is a guaranteed kill. Good change but might be too strong combined with everything else\n\n**Passive - Mark of The Kindred**\n\n_* No longer grants Lamb bonus % current health damage on her basic attacks\n* Now amplifies all of Kindred’s basic abilities per stack as outlined above\n* Every 4 marks increases Kindred’s basic attack, Dance of Arrows and Mounting Dread’s cast range. The first 4 marks increase their ranges by 75, while every 4 marks after increase their ranges by 25._\n\nLove this change. Please keep. The only thing I would do differently is to rather increase their range more often, for example 25 range per 2 marks, so we get bonus 100 range at 8 marks. 75 range for 4 marks is just too much, this will be ridiculous in late because Kindred can get even up to 16 marks in competetive games. It would be impossible to kill an ADC with a saving ultimate that also has 800 AA range and a dash on a 2 second cooldown.\n\n**Overall feedback:**\n\nI really like the changes, even though it's basically a small rework at this point. I can already see they will be overtuned at first but after adjusting the numbers this will work really well.\nIf anything, I would do something to make marks from champion kills more valuable than marks from monster kills or just make marks even less important because this makes Kindred really hard to balance.\n\nThose changes solve all the Kindred problems in the current season and I am really looking forward to testing them out live.\nGreat work with this rework, I knew I could count on you guys.\nThanks again!","replies":[{"poster":"Destínum","date":"2017-05-16T09:37:42.607+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only the first 4 stacks that grant 75 range.

While overall I like the changes, I have a few questions and concerns to raise.\n\n1. Are you concerned about Kindred having an unpredictable amount of attack speed? It seems weird not knowing what levels of attack speed you will be working with later in the game, and late game you might even have to sell attack speed items just to avoid overcapping. It might not be a huge issue outside of rare games with really high mark counts (I have reached 25 in a real game before), but late game I can range from 8-15+ marks depending on how the game is going, excluding outlier games with really low or high counts.\n2. The W wording is a little strange, do you \"place\" the zone, similar to how Akali's old shroud worked?\n3. E execute is amazing and a change I have wanted for a long time, but the 15% threshold seems a little arbitrary and binary. Would it be possible to ramp the damage up from 25%-10% or something thereabout, similar to how Veigars ult damage scaling works? Obviously this range would change as your crit chance increases too.\n4. Having your range increase at breakpoints seems a little weird, but I suppose it never felt bad with Tristana, even with her old passive with higher numbers, so it might not be an issue.\n5. As your range increases, your W becomes increasingly awkward to position. It needs to be placed in such a way that Wolf can reach the enemy target, and you can remain in it while keeping maximum distance from the target. If that maximum distance becomes bigger, the actually area you have to move around in seems like it would be fairly small. This might not be an issue if you have more control over the placement now, but if it does become an issue could increasing the W radius as your range increases be a consideration?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-05-16T20:06:31.433+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. In short, yes but not too much. We are still figuring out the proper tuning/mechanic for Q's new effect.

Will update wording. Lamb can direct wolf to a target location within 500 range of herself before he creates the W zone. \n\n3. 15% was chosen as a number that mostly secured kills on enemies that were probably already going to die in the early game to ensure her early ganking wasn't buffed too hard. The lower starting threshold affords every % of crit chance to feel more meaningful when it scales. \n\n4. Granular range increase per stack felt a bit unrewarding since its pretty hard to feel minor changes to your ranges. Went with this tier model instead so that Kindred could feel good about reaching clear thresholds of power instead of having that satisfaction obfuscated over each stack. We are still tuning this number though! It's highly possible we go with something like 50 range at the first 4 stacks as opposed to 75 as listed for instance. \n\n5.

That said, if you want her to be strong both early and late, yet weaker mid game...good luck....that's going to be very difficult to make happen because power curves are typically a function strength of base stats and kit, plus scaling with itemization. So a champion that is balanced is either going to be strong early and, by necessity, not scale too well, or strong late, and by necessity weak early, or they will be between those extremes and will have average early game, and late game (these are the so-called mid-game champs). There's no natural mechanism to make a champion bad at mid-game and good at both early and late game.\n\nJunglers by nature have to have at least decent early game or they are too easily invaded and shutdown by actual early game junglers (ex: the ever popular {{champion:64}}, also, {{champion:77}} is great at this too). I think her kiting potential is already pretty good w/ Q+W interaction, but maybe outside of that her Q is on too long of a CD? I personally miss her old passive heal because it made her viable as an actual bot laner (and a counterpick to poke lanes), but I can see where that may have been TOO good.\n\nSomething that may be good for her is some kind of mechanic that helps her deal with being dove by single enemy champions, an ability that debuffs their dmg output significantly for a short time (long CD basic ability) may be great for both her jungle security as well as skirmishing play pattern, and would make her less of a teamfight oriented marksman (which would make her preferable to pick in splitpush/pick/dueling-type team compositions). That said, having a marksman that is inherently hard to assassinate could be problematic, though she would still be vulnerable as any other marksman to getting gangbanged...well, maybe not with her current ult...which might actually be something that has to go if she is to truly have good late game scaling, because it's an obscenely good tool for protecting your backline from divers.\n\nThe proposed changes....hard to judge, would need to actually play her with those changes a bit to get a feel for them before I can comment on whether it feels right or not. I could see her really feeling bad early game if her numbers are undertuned, or worse, being fine early but perhaps scaling too well, especially with how much range it appears she can gain from her marks: 8 marks is +100, so if she's still a 550 marksman, that's 650 range basics, same as {{champion:51}}. 8 marks is doable by late game, but very hard to get before 25mins in an actual game. At 4 marks you'd have 625 range, which is 25 more than {{champion:22}}, but 25 less than {{champion:51}}, which is already pretty nice and that's achievable by midgame fairly reliably.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fisherman Fizz","date":"2017-05-16T06:16:17.131+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"These changes look pretty neat. Should we expect these or similar changes to be on PBE this week?\n\n\nOne thing that I'm largely concerned with is that in Kindred's current Live iteration, Wolf feels like a really minor part of the kit compared to Lamb. It's hard to tell from only reading the changes here, but it looks like the passive on-hit's power is being taken away and moved into the abilities that more directly involve Wolf, which I think would help out some. I also think it's interesting that Wolf seems to be doing entirely magic damage while Lamb's is entirely physical.\n\nThe W changes look really interesting. Currently when I play Kindred, having to cast the W as a PBAoE feels a bit awkward, and I hate the fact that whenever I'm about to leave the circle my Q is always still on CD so I can't get one last jump outside the circle and get the CD reduction.\n\nThese changes also look like they'll significantly change Kindred's item build. What are you expecting that Kindred players will build with these changes?

I think it happens because people are maxing the wrong ability first. \n\nTo my surprise people are maxing E first (I expected Q), which is imo the worst one to max first. It scales terribly with additional skill points, though it's really strong at the first skill point, which is why it's worth getting at level 1. Q max has the highest win rate according to (http://champion.gg/champion/Tristana/ADC?), but it's barely over 100 games versus 9500 w/ E max, so the sample is really small and possibly unreliable as a result. What I actually like to do is the old W-max first strategy (and max Q 2nd). It's a riskier style, but if you play it right, it's really strong, and actually scales well into mid-game the base damage on rank 5 W is quite strong, and she was given the ability to reset it without getting a kill if she fully stacks her E on someone, so you can potentially W someone for damage twice in an all-in, plus ult them, and ofc your E damage, which is strong for a rank 1 ability, that's a lot damage on top your basic attack DPS w/ AS steroid from Q. Both W and Q max seem good to me, but for different styles of play, W is more high-risk, high-reward and favors all-in lane strat, Q max favors trading/dueling style laning, itemization also changes slightly, Q max favors IE rush, but W max doesn't mind going with a more balanced AD v AS build path, like BF+zeal into IE+Runaan's.","replies":[{"poster":"Jebron","date":"2017-05-16T09:26:20.653+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't max E your laning is more terrible than it already is, and you get shoved in extremely hard.\n\nI don't think you understand the thought process behind maxing E first.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wild Geese","date":"2017-05-16T07:05:15.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":10,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Redesignated","date":"2017-05-16T07:29:38.997+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"She gets bonus attack range every 4 marks, not every mark.

I need more explanations on how the W's damage will be.\n\n* E, ~~DOES THIS MEANS I WILL BE ABLE TO FINALLY LAND E BEFORE THE AUTOATTACK HAS LANDED FIRST SO IT DOESN'T PROC THE FIRST STACK?~~\nThe missile speed changes are nice, kindred is a swift champion and shouldn't feel clunky as the tristana's jump when i'm trying to pull off plays, so as long as i'm not stunlocked in my own E animation it's fine.\nSpeaking of damage, the execute damage is surely fine since i will finally be able to secure a kill without seeing the enemy laner run away with 1 hp or other fiestish situations that might happen, also it's a good way to give kindred early pressure and letting it scale \"riot's standard\" troughout the game.\n\n>Jaws of Death :: Wolf’s attack critically strikes targets below 15% health for 50% more damage. Critical Strike chance increases the % health threshold for this critical strike to occur by 0.5% per 1% crit chance.\n\nThis is really interesting, but it takes in account the crit stat that it's very hard and slow to fit in a jungler's build, i feel like it will be somehow unreliable damage since it supposes the teamfight is already won since i'm noticing all the tankyness of tanks is shifted towards the beginning of a fight so if you manage to pierce trough it it means you have basically already won and you don't need to overkill to secure the victory unless it's an extremely even fight, this change MIGHT be nice but it should also take in account the passive which follows\n\n* P, The % damage should stay, it feels so weird to have your damage tied to your spells as an adc and also creates windows of \"i'm a god/i'm a caster minion\", i think you guys should find a way to keep the % damage without making it overstack with the spells as you need it as a reliable source of damage and also it would feel wrong with the build path and the spells availability \n\n\nI'm telling you, competitive will hate this as they play junglers on low economy and this supposes that kindred will be able to afk farm/score a lot of successful ganks to afford the late game build, also they sneak in cheap items such as hexdrinker which don't fit at all with this kit as it forces kindred to build like i showed up there, also i feel like kindred should go warlords for the early game sustain and ganking mobility in order to be a hard to reach target with the laner that can play interesting tricks \"hit me, oooh you don't hit me!\" with the skirmish going on, and the kit as it is right now (in the changes) pretty much forces you to go fervor if you want to deal actual visible damage.\n\nSo far i'm linking what i read, the only thing that i don't like is the passive % damage removal, despite feeling inconsistent as fuck depending on how many marks you manage to collect is the only reliable way you have to do damage and farm properly during the early/mid game.\nOh, last but not least, it screws over the runaan/blade/cleaver stacks/lifesteal interaction which is the nicest thing about kindred if you ask me","replies":[]},{"poster":"ACatIsFineToo","date":"2017-05-16T07:00:41.254+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred was one of the coolest characters theme wise you guys (RIOT) ever came up with, the way it all flowed together in a very harmonic, poetic way was amazing.
