We are still very early on into the process, but I wanted to communicate what our main goals are and the different paths we are considering to achieve those goals. \n \n**Goals:**\n\n* Increase opponent play options when playing against Azir\n* Increase Azir&rsquo;s live ranked performance (buff)\n* Preserve his core play pattern of summoning Sand Soldiers and using them as his auto attacks\n\nEach following direction seeks to increase options when playing against Azir, but makes its own trade offs.\n\n**Two Major Directions:**\n\n1) Reduce Azir&rsquo;s soldier command range, exposing him to more opponent damage/cc opportunities when he is dealing damage.\n\n* Ranges would still be decently long, shorter by roughly 15~% is what we'd likely aim for\n* Affords his mobility profile remaining similar to live\n* Might mean he needs more on-demand survivability \n* Is the direction that reduces the most pressure on us to dramatically change functionality on his current spells (might still require some decent changes depending on what we discover though)\n\n2) Keep Azir&rsquo;s live soldier command range, but reduce his mobility profile so he is more easily killed when you do have the tools to close the gap on him.\n\n * Affords soldiers lasting longer than they currently do\n * Most likely means we remove his ability to drift or dash to his soldiers\n * Is the direction that restricts Azir to be even more of a back-liner\n \nRegardless of our choice in direction, we will most likely be buffing Azir&rsquo;s Sand Soldier stab damage and overall DPS potential. At the same time, we will also be looking for ways to ensure his laning phase is less oppressive when his numbers are tuned up. \n\nA decently successful mechanic we have tested a bit so far is reducing his Soldier&rsquo;s AoE damage early game and scaling it back up to 100% by champion level. This means Azir can still have threatening single target damage throughout the match, but less wave control early game. \n\nAgain, we are still very early on into this project, but feedback around these two directions and what you like about the current Azir are all very helpful to us during this stage of development! At the end of the day, we want to deliver an Azir that is exciting to his current players (and potential new ones)  that doesn&rsquo;t warp the meta-game around himself when he is fairly tuned for the average player. I will try to be here often to answer some questions throughout this week as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Veraska","date":"2017-06-20T05:46:11.679+0000","up_votes":136,"down_votes":51,"body":"i REALLY much prefer the latter (reducing mobility) over the former (nerfing range) for thematic reasons, Azir is the emperor, the commander, the king, he doesn't do the dirty work, he points and his soldiers kill whoever he wills them too, he's a much more interesting champion as a back line DPS champion then a pseudo innitiator, and it makes curbing his strengths and high elo performance much easier","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-06-20T05:50:14.393+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":13,"body":"Idea for range reduction isn't to make him not a back line champion, just reduce his range so its not such a pronounced strength.

(an 400k Azir main)\n\nFirst of all i want to tell you about begining of my journey with Azir. In 2014 when Riot implemented the Ascension mode and 5 days later when Riot implemented Azir i wasn't thinking about him like about my favourite champion and the main reason why do i play this game. I think in that season i was an Ahri/TF/Zed main. I don't really remeber to be honest. I was too lazy to play Ascension mode to get icons and i got only 2 of them. When i saw Azir players i was like: this champion is too hard for me (i was in silver i think) and sth like: wow we have such a good player in our team. Yeah, that's what i thought because Azir is a hard if not the harderst champion in the game right? After long break with league (two years) i decided to go back to league. After 2 months of playing League there was an Azir in the free champion rotation. I decided to play him. First game: S+. I was so excited to play him even more and more. Friend told me: Hey why wouldn't you become a hard main Azir ? And i was like hmm let's try, why not. In league like in life i want to be original right ? i like hard champions that nobody plays. Why ? It's all about my personality but i haven't came here to talk about myself. After couple of games i've started to understand him more and more, keep learning the champion and game in the midlane. I've started to making some drifts but they weren't that good as i make them now because of practise of course. In past my goal was to get 100k Mastery points on Azir. After i got 5th on him ( it was max lvl you could get in past on each champion ) i realised that i've started to enjoy his lore, his voice, his drift mechanics, his champion model - shortly - all this good stuff. I've started to play him after few nerfs like Riot removed knock up from his E whenever he hits a champion during it, after passive rework and sruff like this. I still remember when he had 5/6/7 s wall and it was giving you and your allies additional 25 movement speed for 2 seconds. I was okay with this nerfs like decrease Azir's wall duration, removing an additional movement speed from his wall. It was okay for me. After Rylai nerf it was okay and in this moment Azir was the weakest midlaner right ? I didn't really care if he was strong or weak. I enjoyed playing him. After W buff i tho that Azir will be okay in that moment but ppl just couldn't do anything as him. Good Azir is like a good Gankplank (@TobiasFate The best Canadian GP in Canada :D) that can Hypercarry the game, carry 1 v 9 or however you gonna call it. Look, i know that good Azir is really annoying to face because of lane pressure and free harass.But when you have + 12 MR in runes and you will rush Banshee's Veil/Hexdrinker, it's not that painfull, however you can outtrade him really easly if you will ask for gank/ reach him. For me, as Azir it's annoying to face mobile assassins like LeBlanc, Talon, Ekko, Katarina, Zed, Ahri etc. Some matchups are skillfull (like zed matchup) and some are really really hard if you face someone like 500k ekko main or 500k katarina main that is actually good. I remember when i was facing a Diamond III Ahri player (it was normal game) even if i went 1/9 i really enjoyed this matchup and i was so happy that i almost outplayed the outplay from Ahri (I needed only one more additional autoattack). I've learnt so many things from this matchup and i was so motivated to improve as Azir main. Friends started to call me Shurima Emperor, The KFC or stuff like that because their opinion about me as an Azir player was so good. After a short time i've started to recording my plays and i was about to make a montage but i wanted to play Azir in free time and i didn't have really time to actually make this montage. In this year, when i saw the teaser of a Warring Kingdoms Azir skin i was so excited to see it in game. I was holding my Rp for like 2/3 months to instabuy it. I love all Azir skins and i would play with them all in each match if it would be possible because sometimes i just can't choose between Gravelord/Warring Kingdoms/Classic (my favourites). My actual goal is to get 1 milion mastery points on Azir and to become the best Azir on EUNE server. The most satisfying thing is when someone will call you the best Azir that he have ever seen, or when someone will say thank you for the carry.\n\n\nLet's go back to rework. I think that the best Idea would be to fix numbers and don't do anything in his kit. Reducing mobility is the worst thing you can do. Why ? Let me give you an example: Azir mains that have in mind that they love Empire of Shurima, they love sands of Shurima and they love whole lore about Shurima desert and champions that stick close to Shurima's lore will just simply HATE XERATH. He stole The most powerfull magic of Shurima (the power of Ascension) and became an Eternal Ascendant. If you will choose reducing mobility you will make Azir - the champion that we, Azir mains love - into a second version of Xerath ( the champion that we really hate). Nerfing range it's just a lot way better option. For matchups like aganist Fizz, that you have to keep on max range because he can just simply burst you down, you will feel this 15% range nerf. But it's still better than killing almost whole Azir's gameplay. Without Drift mechanics, you can't really make huge outplays, just staying in the backline and autoattacking the enemies it's like casting Xerath's Q with right mouse buton. Shortly, if you will reduce his mobility you will instantly kill Azir. Staying in the bush and waiting to knock enemy backline (adc, long distance mages etc.) into the frontline with your R was the most satisfying thing you could do. Even drifts through 2 walls to kill one person weren't that satisfying as just carrying the teamfight with an amazing outplay. When i was learing Azir i was watching Apathylex's/Outclass's/Drift King Azir's montages because i wanted to be that good as Azir that they are. I leave here my opinion and i'm going to Quote some comments of people that i agree with.

I personally think that removing Azir&#x27;s dash would be a major mistake and really kill a lot of the fun that comes from playing the champion. That being said, my idea would be to go with option 1 of shorter range while still keeping mobility. I agree his range should be shorter, but not to the range of Cassio or Ryze. I don&#x27;t believe people would want to pick him over those champs if that were the case. However, if that is the range that is decided on for Azir, you could add back the knock up mechanic that used to be a part of his E ability. This would allow him to be more exposed to enemies while still giving him a chance to outplay opponents that get into close range. I also think this would be a fair mechanic considering his range is shorter, meaning he can dash a shorter distance and still be caught by enemy CC. Overall I think this would be healthier for both Azir players and those playing against Azir.

Make Azir that emperor that commands his units. Then he is strong but can still be destroyed when the gap is closed. Redmercy talks about how this is also his choice, I say this just because so many do watch his videos and learn off of what he says. \n\nHere is the reality for us players who truly loved and devoted time to this unique champion. He was hard. You played and played and always were told to not play azir when he first came out. To hard, you will feed. So between normals and practice games we learned to do the slide, which was dumbed way down for the he average player later, as well as how to properly use his range and unique feel to truly make the other player go, well shit.... this guy isn't just your average free week player. \n\nThen we Azir mains watched our Emporer get gutted again and again till he now holds consistently one of the lowest winrates of any champion played. \n\nBut that is in the past, so how do we move forward so he may shine once again. It hurts me to see him become a battle-mage, like a Swain with pokie sticks and no healing but option 1 is honestly the only choice. Here is why, option 2 offers an attractive thought of a commander but that would bring him down to the earlier designs of riots champs, which would mean another future rework to make him feel like MORE than just a basic champion. Kind of like the recent Warwick rework. \n\nHere is Azir, hard to play, harder to master. So many champs just aren't as rewarding as a hard champion to play and playing that champion damn well.

I think this falls in line with many RIven, Thresh, and Bard mains, all of which Riot seems to be quite happy with their positions within the League of Legends roster. The Shurima Shuffle, Red Mercy, and just the general mobility are the reason I play the champ. Because of this, I support option #1 wholeheartedly. \n\nGoing with option #1 pushes Azir's playstyle more towards a battle mage rather than an artillery mage. I really like this direction, as the nerfs to Azir have forced him into building poke/burst (Luden's, MPen, etc.), which is a playstyle that I do not think is healthy for him nor do I think it fits his theme. Making him shorter ranged but making him beefier like say by giving him a shield that actually works or something and making him scale harder on attack speed by moving damage from his Q to W pushes the more desired and aesthetic DPS build (Nashor's, etc.). \n\nGoing with option #2 just flattens a multi dimensional champion into two very linear, narrow options: artillery mage similar to Xerath and Ziggs with high poke and low skill floor/ceiling, or just an AP Marksmen whose damage would be less reliable than a typical ADC (people can much more easily walk out of soldier range and flash when Azir repositions soldiers than they can walk out of say JInx or Caitlyn auto range). Option #2 would also not fix Azir's oppressive ranged harass in lane, nor would it discourage the Luden's build that is even more oppressive to siege against. \n\nAll in all, I don't think Azir's problem is his mobility as often using his mobility does cost him a lot (high risk to go in to Shurima Shuffle, takes a lot of mana if used in lane). His mobility also has a high cooldown, which can be taken advantage of. I think his range and poke is the major issue with him and I'd gladly trade those for some more survivability and incentive to build DPS.\n\nPlease choose option #1 :]\n\n\nP.S. \nI don't think I've seen many people talk about his passive but I find it to be thematic while simultaneously incredibily underwhelming from a use versus reward point of view. The optimal uses of it are often unclear and sparse and even when used well it does not feel very impactful for the player. I understand the Sun Disk is a characteristic Azir thing with the lore and all but I am just expressing that I have absolutely no qualms about receiving an entirely new passive (which could be a rework of the current one or a new one that is even more in line with Azir's thematics). \n\nJust thought I'd start that discussion while I was thinking about it.

I think this should ultimately be left in his kit as it really marks his identity as a high-skill cap back-line mage that can make the plays when mastered. As a result, I belive in option #2 and have though up a kit which might accomplish just that and weave in some conterplay:\n\n**Passive**:\nI think this could stay the same, but on the other hand it could also be changed to: \"Azir's damaging spells apply on-hit effects. Additionally, Azir's attacks by his sand soldiers deal (40% AP + 80% AD) -> (80% AP + 100% AD) damage scaling with level.\". This could create some interesting spell interactions with spells critting, possibly creating a champion who might build both AP and AD items nearly equally.\n\n**Q**:\nI think this should be kept relatively the same, but it would only move perpendicular to the direction of the mouse from Azir (see JakeDuck's post) and maybe the range is changed to scale by rank and have a larger range at rank 5 in order to keep his early game down and late game up. Also could be changed to deal 1 auto-attack of damage (and apply any auto-attack based abilities/damage). Probably should also have dash speed scale with Azir's movement speed. (Talisman Azir anyone?)\n\n**W**:\nThis should be kept the same.\n\n**E**:\nThis ability is quite different. Instead of allowing Azir to dash, it instead switches all of Azir's soldiers to either attack-mode or defense-mode (think Jinx Q). In attack-mode, his soldiers deal 100% of the passive damage and are AOE (similar to current Azir soldiers). In defense-mode, the soldiers take out their shields (the soldiers from the current Azir ult). These soldiers have hit-boxes like minions, and will only allow phantom-dancer champs and the like to pass through them. Their auto attacks only deal 25% damage and have 25% of the range but knock-back champions for a small distance (like 3x auto-attack distance). Champions who are dashing during the auto attack have their knock-back distance doubled. Champions like Shen and Jax who can block auto-attacks would also be able to go through them. Additionally, Q'ing through a champion will knock them back for the 2x the distance, multiplying with the previous distance, but cause the soldiers to stop at the first champion hit, ending their dash. This ability would have a cool-down like (11 - rank) * (1 - CDR) meaning that even at 45% cdr rank 5, Azir will have about 3.4 seconds where he is very defensive, but deals very little damage. (insane power balance right there amiright)\n\n**R**:\nThis ability has two parts actives (think Riven R). The first activation will cause Azir's abilities to be empowered for the next 10 seconds, resetting their cool-downs (so now they are ready to be used and abused). **Q (Empowered)**: Increases dash distance by 25% and damage by 10% for the next Q (ending its empowerment). **W (Empowered)**: On its next use, Azir summons 4 soldiers the the cardinal directions, affected by facing direction, directly around him. **E (Empowered)**: In attack-mode, Azir's soldiers will root enemy champions for 1.5 seconds if 3+ soldiers hit them (its kinda hard to move if you are impaled by a lot of spears ya know). In defense-mode, Azir's soldiers knock-back enemy champions by an additional 25%. This lasts for the entirety of the duration, unlike his Q and W. The second part of the R, if activated in the next 10 seconds, would allow Azir to dash to one of his soldiers with a 1 second shield scaling with AP (think current E). This ability will have a similar cool-down to current Azir ult.\n\nThrough these abilities, you'll notice that Azir loses the ability to have massive movement, but keeps the Shurima Shuffle as show [here](http://imgur.com/a/kzNvp), although it takes a whopping 7 ability activations, 1 Summoner Spell, and 1 Zhonya's. Additionally, Azir's safety is then balanced by his inability to deal damage for a short while by his E. Since he relies on auto-attacks, he have good late-game, but not as good early-game, especially because he scales with ranks in Q, and levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-06-20T07:49:21.676+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just wanted to say, thank you so much for letting us know _ahead of time_ what directions you're considering for the next champion update.

Right now, because of the combination of the dash AND ult, Azir is very slippery and has a lot of self CC. As a backline mage (the playstyle I most identify with) this should not be the case. \n\nHowever, if you go about removing the dash you make Azir pretty much a worse Xerath in terms of gameplay. So the replacement ability should be good to make up for it.  \n\nHere are four things I'd want if you make him a backline mage: \n1. Allow his soldiers' attacks to apply on -hit effects. This will not only buff the nashors build but allow for fun off meta builds to mess around with.\n2. Bring back his CDR > AS conversion, it was really cool and distinctly Azir!\n3. Implement some sort of scaling range. Azir should be the best late game mage if he can position correctly, having extra range would definitely help.\n4. Give some sort of shield or movement speed to his kit.

Provides useful stats when drifting in, but he loses that tankyness if he wants to play at long range.\nHowever you decide to change him, please leave his core playstyle in tact.

Azir has lots of survivability in his kit, ranging from good mobility to the best self-peel skill in the game. Also, he has become known for the sleek tricks his mobility makes him pull off.\nA character like Azir should need the protection of his team, but he's very good on his own. And, like another user suggested, his mobility in the end is in contrast to his theme of an emperor and commander: he should command his army from the backline, not dart around the battlefield like an Ahri or a Lucian.\n\nI think it goes down to deciding what is more important between his theme and his gameplay. Personally, I'd go for his gameplay: he should have a lot less mobility and feel extremely powerful if he can survive, but be very vulnerable if you can pass through his soldier line and go toe-to-toe with him. But that would mean losing the shurima shuffle, which is one of the main reasons people play Azir (and watch Azir plays)\n\n\n\n/rant: It always bothered me a lot how much self-peel Azir had, from his mobility and ult, and at release his E was just so overloaded.

I personally think that removing Azir's dash would be a major mistake and really kill a lot of the fun that comes from playing the champion. That being said, my idea would be to go with option 1 of shorter range while still keeping mobility. I agree his range should be shorter, but not to the range of Cassio or Ryze. I don't believe people would want to pick him over those champs if that were the case. However, if that is the range that is decided on for Azir, you could add back the knock up mechanic that used to be a part of his E ability. This would allow him to be more exposed to enemies while still giving him a chance to outplay opponents that get into close range. I also think this would be a fair mechanic considering his range is shorter, meaning he can dash a shorter distance and still be caught by enemy CC.

I think the opposite. Azir is the emperor of the glorious empire of Shurima. He's an emperor who fights with his soldiers and alongside his people. Even the other ascended like Nasus and Renekton fought alongside the soldiers of Shurima; being symbols on the battlefield; symbols of inspiration to soldiers and symbols of fear to enemies. I know that they were protectors; but still the power of an Ascended and seeing it on the field of battle just seems so iconic of Shurima to me. I see Azir as the general who fights with his soldiers rather than stays back. That he is a symbol to his people as an emperor through his presence alongside them. That he stands among everyone in view to be seen gloriously upon like the sun disc. He was the emperor that set his slaves free, and to me I would see him walking with them on the streets; rather than staying in his castle having people grovel at his feet.\n\nOn another note; practicing drift mechanics and getting so in tune with it was so immensely gratifying. At this point it's become like instinct and muscle memory to drift and maneuver. Drifting in a sense has ingrained in me a more keen awareness to seeking opportunities made by the opponent. Thinking about the longer ranged play style seems lazy to me; as it'll just make Azir a zoning bot, that I'll put my soldiers here and you can't walk here.  To have that stripped away from him would essentially be taking away a part of what Azir means to me. A falcon who is swift and agile that can strike accurately with deadly force, but if only done correctly. There's already a lot of long distance control poke mages in the game anyways. There aren't really any close range brawling mages that I can think of off the top of my head aside for maybe someone like Ryze or Cass.\n\nOverall these are just my thoughts.

Whether it was intended or not, the Shurima Shuffle is what's actually interesting about the game itself, not just the character of Azir. It's not like Talon's resourceless wall jumps or anything like that, Azir has to spend resources to do it which can hamper his offensive capabilities whether through CDs or mana.\n\nRegardless of if the majority of Azir players are Silver or Bronze or something low, Azir grew into a high mechanics champion that let you sort of feel like an AP Riven that could make tremendous plays when you had the resources to do so. Azir dashing in and cutting a team apart is much more interactive than him sending his soldiers forward to stab the enemy team for a thousand damage.\n\nAzir can be a great spectator's champion, he's enjoyable to watch, enjoyable to play with his different mobility mechanics and you need a healthy balance of both. He is honestly more interesting as a mid-ranged ap diver than he is as his theme was, standing in the back sending sand soldiers forward at people. Orianna already basically does a similar thing, replacing the soldiers with her ball and capitlizing on people's poor positioning.
