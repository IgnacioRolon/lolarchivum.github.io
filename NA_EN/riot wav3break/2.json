(W)*\n\n* When Azir has 3 soldiers out, he doubles his passive attack speed from Arise for 5 seconds.\n* Command Soldier Attack Cast Time :: Reduced from 0.5s &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.35s \n\n*Emperor&rsquo;s Divide (R)*\n\n* Cooldown :: Reduced from 140/120/100 &gt;&gt;&gt; 120/105/90 per rank\n* Wall Size :: Increased from 4/5/6 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5/6/7 Soldiers per rank\n\n**Highlighted nerfs:**\n*Arise! (W)*\n\n* Soldier command range :: Reduced from 800 &gt;&gt;&gt; 660\n\n*Emperor&rsquo;s Divide (R)*\n\n* No longer continues to knock back dashes over it after the initial movement of the Shield Soldiers. \n\nOverall, we expect Azir to be buffed from the full suite of changes in 7.19 and still fulfill the same fantasy and epic gameplay. These highlighted nerfs are likely to be more contentious and so I wanted to dive in a little bit more on our reasoning for them:\n\n**Why did we choose to nerf Azir&rsquo;s range?**\n\nIt goes without saying, but this decision was very tough to make. Many aspects of a champion make up their identity and ranges are definitely very influential in that equation. We used some survey tools to get a better image of what aspects of Azir his current players loved. It turns out that when a champion has so many powerful and unique aspects, players will attach to all of them pretty equally. It was apparent that removing any one of his unique interactions would come at a huge cost for Azir players. \n\nUltimately, the results helped us realize that the core parts we needed to preserve were his signature Shurima Shuffle and his fine control over Sand Soldiers to do his bidding. Given these requirements, reducing his ranges felt like the most reasonable way to deliver a middle ground that kept the core skill tests of Azir intact. Azir&rsquo;s theme and mechanics definitely don&rsquo;t support a short-range champion, but the notion to challenge here was: Is artillery-tier range the crux of the Shuriman emperor&rsquo;s gameplay fantasy?\n\nThe answers to this question range with personal taste, but throughout internal testing with a shorter ranged Azir, it didn&rsquo;t feel like we were losing too much of what made him special. Furthermore, challenging the perception that Azir had to out-range 90% of the cast of League of Legends was getting us a lot of immediate benefits in terms of counter-play and agency for the opponent. \n\nUpdated Azir is by no means a short-range champion. His functional max auto-attack range is still around 900+ units (that&rsquo;s a lot of Teemos) and though he can&rsquo;t out-range his nemesis Xerath as easily, his range is still worthy of an emperor commanding a battlefield. The benefits we gained from this direction also meant that we could keep room for the Shurima Shuffle.\n\nThe key goal that range nerfs benefitted was increasing opponent options against Azir. By nerfing ranges, we found that a significantly larger set of champions in League could actually reasonably interact with him both in and out of lane. If there are more potential answers to Azir in the wider game, the likelihood of him becoming a meta-warping presence diminishes and the pressure to keep him generically under-tuned lessens a lot. \n\n**Why did we remove Emperor&rsquo;s Divide&rsquo;s unique bounce house interaction?**\n\nThis was also done to help us succeed at increasing opponent options against Azir. We nerfed Azir&rsquo;s ranges, but we felt it wasn&rsquo;t enough to ensure he would not conquer the meta-game. I think this distinction sums it up nicely: the range nerfs tackle the oppressive nature of old Azir&rsquo;s general gameplay, while the removal of bounce house creates an exploitable weakness in Azir&rsquo;s gameplay when the meta-game calls for it. We can now rely on champions like Kha&rsquo;Zix, Kayn, or Ahri to be clearer counter-picks into Azir that make it hard for him to dominate all levels of play. Of course, removing this mechanic also gave us much more room to buff other things about Azir that help his general performance in the hands of an average player. Things like higher base health, higher base movement speed and a lower cooldown ultimate were all afforded in part by the removal of this mechanic.  \n\n**Wrap up**\n\nHopefully our design reasoning resonates a bit with you and Azir can now find a healthier home on the Rift.  We&rsquo;re committed to making him feel like a champion you can feel good about mastering, so you can expect us to keep an eye on him and respond accordingly in the patches following 7.19.","replies":[{"poster":"nhentai177013","date":"2017-09-19T02:43:00.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":50,"body":"Why did you basically remove the reason azir had alot of highs and is such a cool champ: the shurima shuffle","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Jericho","date":"2017-09-19T03:14:38.894+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"But they didn't remove it?

By lowering his range, you have made it even harder for him to deal with poke champions and by removing his walls ability to stop dashes you have made it even harder for him to kite assassins around it and to generally deal with assassins. \nIn other words, once people realise this, I'm sure Azir's win rate is gonna go down purely because he is even weaker against things he was already weak against. \nWhat they needed to do was ignore the azir mains (250k points on azir myself, yes I am an azir main) and change his ultimate. That is probably the one part of his kit that makes him OP when in the meta.\nGiving him an incredibly situational attack speed buff, one that is completely useless early game yet requires sustained team fights late game, does not do anything for azir really. If azir shuffles into his ult, he isn't likely to have 3 soldiers out and by the time he is able to reposition them, the speed buff will be gone. \n\nThere is no reason to have 3 soldiers out to Q, as his Q doesn't stack damage from other soldiers. Azir will rarely have 3 soldiers out in a 1v1 or 1v2 as he will generally want to maintain his mana or keep one up.\n\"Oh, but his E gives him one!\". Yeah, but you never EQ in unless you A: Are going for the finisher or B: Going for your ult and in both situations, the attack speed buff will be incredibly temporary and will not provide great enough damage to compensate for the new weaknesses he has.\n\nNow, maybe I'm wrong. In fact, I'm probably wrong, but azir's playstyle has been incredibly static for a long while and these changes do not seem to change his build path (which really hasn't changed since he was released) as nashors will still be necessary to provide the extra attack speed and rylais will still be needed to provide the tankiness to get close. \nThey should have changed his ultimate. Maybe some of these changes would go along with the new ult, but he really needs that ult changed if you want him in the meta yet not dominating.","replies":[{"poster":"HOT BEEF ","date":"2017-09-19T05:30:28.644+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"i completely agree with this the fact that you will hardly ever use your new E where u get an extra soldier it is basically a straight nerf to it in my opinion I would like them to bring back the knock up on the E back instead of the soldier it actually rewards azir players who hit the E and gives them a satisfactory for hitting the E and now that the wall turns into a regular wall i feel like this would be a nice compensation for it","replies":[]},{"poster":"EROTIC RAID BOSS","date":"2017-09-19T06:14:41.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Did you actually play azir before?

Frankly, playing Azir is half of the reason I enjoy playing League so much; seeing and play-testing these changes on PBE has made me the most excited I've been about this game in 2 years, if not longer.  I've played since Season 3 and while I did not pick up Azir immediately when he came out in season 4, I started playing him in season 5 and haven't stopped since.\n\nThe rework preserves everything I've found core to his gameplay.  Summoning sand soldiers is still intact, his E is still fluid and exciting, and Emperor's Divide remains a spell that can be integral to Azir's arsenal of defenses or used as a proactive initiation tool.  What I mean to say is his kit still has depth.  He currently has a variety of (defensive and aggressive) options for using his Q, W, E, and R and the rework maintains those options.  The rework also plays up his theme further, encouraging Azir to summon more soldiers, command them more often, and to use Emperor's Divide more often (now with an extra soldier added to the wall).  And when it's time to conquer, Azir can lead the charge to victory or back up his allies to overcome defeat.\n\nPlaying him on PBE, he still feels good to play as.  While the amount of range cut from him certainly wasn't minor, it definitely was the sweet spot where you still have reasonable reach but nothing insane.  More importantly, it feels like **I actually do damage early**.  I cannot stress that enough.  So many times I've lost 2v2 (mid and jungler vs. mid and jungler) fights early due to a lack of damage and the following consequences were often deciding factors in the game.  \n\nFrom patch 7.19 and (hopefully) onward, that lack of damage will no longer be a crippling part of playing a champion who I enjoy so much.  He's been playable since the buff to his W damage curve in patch 6.24, but he's just never felt quite as impactful as he once did.  The early game always played out as \"pray the jungler doesn't gank repeatedly, pray your opponent doesn't push and roam frequently\" and now an Azir player can actually respond to those actions.  And believe me, it **_feels_** good.\n\nYour work is greatly appreciated; it makes me glad to say Riot is among my favorites when it comes to communication with their players, as well as making changes that make the game more enjoyable.

For me, when you ask the question \"Is artillery-tier range the crux of the Shuriman emperor’s gameplay fantasy?\" I answer yes. I liked the safety and the scaling. I liked that at the end of a long game I could get to a place where I felt I could take on the world. I liked that I could play a scaling champion whose strategic identity wasn't \"invalidated early, mid, and late by assassins unless your team brought two or three champions with shields\".\n\nBut either I was in the minority or what I wanted wasn't balanceable, so instead I'll try to offer constructive feedback on this design. If you want Azir to be playable in solo queue, removing the secondary knockback on the R seems like a bad idea. Assassins (when they are successful) already have tools to access the backline, and furthermore have tools to make that access count in the form of enough burst to kill a champion outright. If Azir can't protect himself (and in solo queue it is not an acceptable burden to place on the rest of the team to be responsible for Azir's protection) then he can't get near assassins. If he can't get near assassins then, given his new ranges and the playstyle you are trying to promote, he can't use his skills. If Azir is supposed to get into the fight instead of sitting on the backlines then emphasizing how vulnerable he is when he gets there is working against your intent.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinlaire","date":"2017-09-19T04:20:55.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E now has an AP ratio on top of his W now instantly generating another soldier for him to cast upon making contact with an enemy champion. meaning if Azir gets dove he can use his E to protect himself better than it ever could before with his new W mechanic making sure he will never be without a soldier able to attack enemies directly on top of him ever again. HE also got a damage buff on his soldiers attack damages or his Q or something I believe. don't remember where it is but he has better early damage all the way up to like level 16 now than currently.\n\nThere used to be situations in which an Azir E could strike an enemy champion and he would still have to run to his soldiers if poorly placed, now he gets one for free to make 100% sure he always has damage on hand as well as the 50% AS steroid with having 3 up helping him meet that goal with the instant generation from E.\n\nEven if Azir is a little more risk due to being closer to the fight, his new E shield AP ratio, W instant soldier, and 50% AS bonus now make him much more lethal close range than he ever was before.

Like, what is Azir supposed to build now? We're battle-mage ranges, so we need to be tanky, but all of our damage is AA based, so we can't really skip out on Nashors (which still isn't allowed to apply its passive? We know you can reduce effectiveness thanks to Urgot's W), and without a Rylais, we're both kited AND chased down with ease.\n\nAzir definitely has counterplay, but, now he honestly just feels like a weaker Cass to me. I'm just leaving myself out there, waiting for an assassin to jump on me, so I can go a flash-distance away by burning all 3 of my basic spells. If I wanted to be a short ranged control/DPS mage, I'd just play Cass. Hell, I'd be better off just playing Orianna. The things that made Azir so unique (long range DPS based off of zones) are gone, in favor of a poor man's Lee Sin.\n\nIf this rework HAS to stick, can we at least get a dev-blog showing us what you actually tried to try and keep a long range, less-safe Azir? Because, as it is right now, all I personally feel like is that the team behind updating him shortened ranges, saw it worked, and just rolled with it, instead of even attempting to keep range and cut out his unneeded burst.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shahamut","date":"2017-09-19T17:16:18.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would it be possible to add an option for Azir's ultimate, where, after it becomes a wall, he could reactivate the R to turn the wall into 1/2/3 comandable soldiers?

I've played Azir on PBE and I have had a BLAST. For one he still has a decent amount of range. Second he doesn't always have to shuffle. That's literally not his bread and butter like y'all make it seem. He's still a unique mage but now has more weakness while gaining more damage. His damage is absolutely insane once you're in his AOE and it's still longer than Viktor of course. With his damage he can actually compete with other battle mages along with some assassins that miss a skill shot. He will punish you more if you over step. The shield on his e activates on cast and can grant around a 400-500 shield which would block one spell damage. His W cast range makes it easier to do aggressive plays. He can actually W Auto Q for easy thunder lords or maybe get an extra auto. That movement speed he has? That's for juking. You juke a skill shot and punish your enemies much harder now if they miss up and possibly kill them. His W damage that people complain about clear and aoe, I'm not sure if you read but it scales up to %100 by level 11. Also the full damage applies to whom you right click- not what is in front. Again I've had a blast on PBE and even more when they reverted the e dash speed. Azir feels absolutely amazing for those that make aggressive proactive plays. As someone with 500,000 Mastery Points on Azir I love the tuning they did. He still feels like the cool Shurimen Emperor that controls the flow of battle. He can still set up plays and be that play maker. He still makes people say \"Holy Shit Azir. That was soo good.\"\n\nGood job Riot.
