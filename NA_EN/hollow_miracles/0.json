Now my computer isn't exactly brand-new, but this seems like too major an issue to be attributed to hardware failures, especially since it seems to be a recent occurrence. I can get 110-120 fps just walking around/farming/etc but when it comes to team-fighting it drops all the way to about 30 (I know that's still not too terrible, but when you're used to much higher it can be very jarring and, more importantly, frustrating). Just wanted to post here to see if that's something that can be attributed to the game itself or if it's just my PC showing it's age.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T02:41:00.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first thought for these fps issues always goes to updating graphics drivers first, but also make sure that you've gone through the other steps listed in the [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) as a precaution. Those steps have been known to help with a good number of common fps issues so it's always good to start there.","replies":[{"poster":"Hollow Miracles","date":"2017-12-15T02:39:36.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestion.

Sometimes it becomes unplayable and it's getting REALLY annoying. Just wait until they find a proper fix.\n\n~~Even tho holidays are near and we could stay with those shitty fps drops for like 1 more month~~","replies":[{"poster":"Hollow Miracles","date":"2017-12-14T14:30:15.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Rito will give me back my frames for Christmas.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":" VÃ¥x","date":"2017-12-14T01:43:28.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not just you,  me and   my premade  all have this issue at the exact same time in some fights. so its a client thing","replies":[]}]}
