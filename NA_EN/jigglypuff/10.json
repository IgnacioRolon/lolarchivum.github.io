Someone could be addicted to things that are good for them, such as being addicted to work or working out, but if too many eggs are placed in one basket, it can have a negative toll on the other aspects of one's life. Likewise, gaming has some genuine mental benefits, but there are cons to every pro, and too much overindulgence without restraint is never a good thing, regardless if that thing is gaming or something else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kurt Hyzan","date":"2018-06-18T16:22:15.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who doesn't really enjoy the game and kinda uninstall it frequently, what keeps me hooked (and sadly I don't even want to) is the release of new content pretty frequently.
