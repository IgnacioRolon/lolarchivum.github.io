I mean gorey and bloody as all hell!\r\n\r\nThen the Giant polar bear about the size of a small building was trying to take people off of the building slashing and clawing at my friends and taking them down while they screamed... I finally was left and the monster finally got me and I woke up :) It had a realistic feel about it, which made it worse lol.","replies":[]}
