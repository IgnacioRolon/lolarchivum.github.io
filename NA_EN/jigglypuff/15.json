Jarvan dies and Varus finally picks up the kill 7 seconds after Jarvans ult. \n\nAt this point, Jarvan is thinking &quot;Why did I die, it should have been a fast in and out kill, since Lee&#039;Sin wasn&#039;t there&quot;\n\nAs Jarvan ponders about the situation he looks at Varus&#039; build and can see that he had two Daggers during that fight.\n\nJarvan now understands to look at idiot teammates builds before going in, because people don&#039;t understand simple math 12% As+ 12% As x (S)&lt;Stupidity= No Attack Damage.\n\n~Fin","replies":[]}
