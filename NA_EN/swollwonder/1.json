If the enemy team has a Vayne, and they are even equal with you, as a tank you HAVE to buy armor. You HAVE to purchase things like Thornmail, Randuins, Frozen Heart etc. It doesn't matter if the enemy team has an AP jungler, AP top, and AP mid, because if you don't build armor, Vayne will just murder you even if the entire rest of the team cannot. She is a one person AD threat equivalent to having an enemy team with Yi jungle and Zed mid.\n\nIt doesn't help that a lot of defensive items you would want to build against Vayne aren't actually as useful against her. Silver Bolts only becomes stronger as you buy health, therefore punishing the tanks for... building tanky. That one thing that is their job remember? Yeah, it more heavily punishes them for doing that. Add to the fact that Vayne will almost ALWAYS buy a BotRK, and as soon as you finish your Randuins Omen you are probably weaker against her than when you started.

Is this considered balanced?\n\nVayne has always had %max HP true damage, and as far as I can remember it's always been 8% at max rank. It's something Riot's defended on several occasions, and there nerfs to her kit have hit everything else besides it when they've needed to address her.\n\nThe bulk of Vayne's damage is physical auto-attack based due in large part to her ult's steroid and Tumble's bonus damage as well, which {{item:3143}} {{item:3082}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3047}} all hit with a double-whammy.\n\n-------------------\n\nAs for her true damage, consider:\nA) LoL is a game reliant on skill and using tactics and stratagy to a certain extent\nB) No tactic or stratagy works 100% of the time in LoL\n\nYou can't dodge point-click skills with mobility.\nYou can't land point-click skills on opponents in fog of war, stealth, brush, invisibility, stasis, or untargetability.\nYou can't use Tenacity or Cleanse vs. slowing fields, knockbacks, pulls, suppression, or knockups.\nYou can't damage invulnerable targets or targets that refuse to drop below 1 hp.\nYou can't rely on out-tanking someone that's tankier than you.\nYou can't rely on out-running someone that's speedier than you.\nYou can't rely on out-ranging someone with more range than you.\n\nThe answer to every champion simply isn't just counter-build them even if you are a tank or fighter capable of doing so.\n\nWith Vayne counter-building her will force close to 37.5 AAs with her %max HP ture damage alone though.\nThis is in a game where Nasus can 2-shot a squishy, so it's not like counter-building her damage does nothing. You just don't get to be invulnerable vs. her if she manages to hit you 30+ times, and she gets to do something if she manages to survive within 550 range of you long enough.\n\n----------\n\nIn regards to fighters - getting within striking distance of her as a tanky DPS like Nasus, Shyvana, Warwick, Olaf, or Udyr and flat out killing Vayne is your stratagy. Difficult if you telegraph your movements and get immobilized by the enemy team. Not particularly difficult if you use walls, brush, fog of war, and/or wards to approach her from a difficult angle and land a few hits. She's a solid chaser, not a great runner.\n\nIn regards to tanks - Vayne is the highest priority target on the enemy team to lock down with CC. Her front-loaded burst is pretty low and her damage contribution will rapidly climb the longer she's allowed to auto-attack, which most CC prevents her from doing. Vayne's defensive mechanic is mostly reliant on out-maneuvering her foes as well, which CC generally stops.\n\nIn most cases true CC tanks counter Vayne much harder than she counters them, seeing as most are amazing at initiating a team-fight and locking down priority targets, where Vayne is a mediocre team-fighter by most accounts and does not handle being locked down very well.\n\n-----\n\nAnyways - don't assume defense is always the answer. In regards to a lot of bruisers and fighter/tanks it's pretty useless as well, darn hybridized physical/magical/auto-attack/ability damage output.\n\nBut every champion has different strengths and weaknesses.

But Solo Q games are not like that. You can't ask if X has their ult up or if Y is split pushing without taking a significant delay. In addition, split second picks don't happen as much because of the communication factor mentioned previously. Lastly on this matter, solo Q games tend to go on longer than team based game often leading to that \"You didn't win early prepare to lose\" (which I think is a terrible design philosophy, see Veigar and Nasus, but that's a different story) situation. \"You didn't win early\" should not be a counter to a champion. P.S. for this section of \"she isn't a great team fighter\" see above thornmail video. That statement is debatable as she can shred your front line just as quickly as she can your back. \n\nDoes vayne have a distinct role as a tank killing adc? Yes she does. Weaknesses? Sure. Does she do the job too well? Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2015-08-12T08:30:08.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> On itemization: You're saying in order to optimize against vayne I would need FOUR of my SIX items dedicated to ONE person of their FIVE man team.\n\nI mentioned items that hit Vayne's physical damage pretty hard, not a build you need to counter her damage.\n\n> On team play: Yes you should kill vayne first.
