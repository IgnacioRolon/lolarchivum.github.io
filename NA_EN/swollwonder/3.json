Honestly I&#039;m not sure how to fix their damage beyond just nerfing it but everyone knows that. But what if we made ADC&#039;s do less damage to towers and up AP laners auto damage to towers just a tad? This would reward grouping with the same amount of tower damage (towers being weak is a different issue) and also would make adcs less likely to just annihilate towers at level 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainfall","date":"2017-10-19T06:45:15.566+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"who upvotes these threads?","replies":[{"poster":"wyvern011976","date":"2017-10-19T06:49:38.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rainfall,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZbwG26I9,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-10-19T06:45:15.566+0000)\n>\n> who upvotes these threads?\n\nBronze children who don't understand positioning, team comp, vision, itemization, and cd windows.  They honestly think its the ADC that's the issue.  When you look at their game data and try to explain to them why they have no clue they cant even fathom that its them that plays poorly and not the role that is broken.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-10-18T23:38:21.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":6,"body":"How to nerf ADCs:  Revert all the changes made in the Assassin Rework.

I feel that, to some degree, it's pretty hypocritical to justify the current mandatory status of marksmen because they're apparently the only class capable of truly pushing towers, when there is a) an artificial restriction imposed on structures that prevents most AP champions from using their greatest asset against them, despite allowing marksmen to use their own abilities to push harder, and b) an actual ratio in place to allow AP champion to push, which is still being kept so low that marksmen eclipse them at all stages. Some parts of the game do favor autoattacks, but only because they've been forced that way, and I feel there are a great deal many things that shouldn't be autoattack-exclusive (making wards take damage from abilities could help non-marksmen clear them faster, for example, and many monsters could have their MR drastically reduced to let casters kill them more consistently).","replies":[]},{"poster":"wyvern011976","date":"2017-10-19T06:52:17.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"So many bad ideas about a role that is working as intended. \n\nNO NERFS NEEDED.   \n\nPeople learning to counter however.......","replies":[]}]}
