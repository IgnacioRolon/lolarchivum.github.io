The taunts give a &quot;ok I&#039;m playing a champion with a story&quot; instead of a &quot;this is just a new character with four different abilities&quot;.\n\nRiot seems to be heading in this direction. Kindred, jihn, and tahm kench have all had around 20 MINUTES of dialogue. However, in my opinion, it&#039;s not used as smartly as it could. Its great that Yasuo and Riven have a taunt but it&#039;s almost rarely used. Why? Because taunts are used during the laning phase and riven and Yasuo rarely face each other in lane. It&#039;s a lot easier to taunt when you don&#039;t have an entire enemy team trying to kill you during late game. \n\nSo here are some of the proposals I would personally like to see happen\n     ---Champion specific dialogue needs to get paired with champions which also inhabit that lane. This way they are much more likely to actually be used. An example would be Jinx and Caitlin.\n    ---Champion specific dialogue should NOT be a taunt. Most people are focused on laning not saying &quot;oh I actually have a chance to hear my special interaction with this champ&quot;. Similar to how Yasuo comments on Rivens Q, champ specific dialogue needs to be done without the input of the player. This could be solved by switching out some of the attack/move dialogue if conditions  are met such as the correct champion being around and visible.\n    ---Champion dialogue needs to reference the actual champion. Going back to Yasuo, he had several taunts referring to ninjas. The problem is this is as bland as its vague. It&#039;s not really directed at the champions but just the idea of ninjas, which isn&#039;t a whole lot better than champions normal dialogue as far as making them feel like they have a story.\n\nThese are just some of my ideas on how to make champion specific dialogue more enjoyable as its something I like in league.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-23T01:18:47.984+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are actually working on this.   Both in terms of tech and artistry.   So for instance.  My first VO was dunk master Darius.  --lots of taunts.   But not as effective  as he could be.  We advanced the tech on Rek'sai.  I then used that tech on Tahm.  Then based on what we learn from that, Beefpunchbeef stayed up a bunch of late nites so I could give Illaoi  a whole new style of interactions.  Jhin then pushed that forward.   An important gate to remember is this tech and techniques are developed on new champs and champ relaunches.  We are gaining this stuff-- and slowly  it will make its way through the roster.     It will very very probably happen and on a champ in 2016.... then begin to spread to other champs and relaunches.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Moon Wolf","date":"2016-01-23T01:39:32.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds great, but what are the chances of older champs not in line for a rework ({{champion:12}} {{champion:3}} and {{champion:91}} for example) getting new champ specific dialog?
