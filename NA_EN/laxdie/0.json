I have heard of several programs as you describe that include skins but also scripts or other hacks, and people do get banned for that. Be careful in which programs you want to download.\n\nI would advise you to only use the LoLKing skin viewer or watch the Skin Spotlights videos if you're unsure about a skin you want to buy. Downloading a program to work around the League client can get you banned.","replies":[]}]}
