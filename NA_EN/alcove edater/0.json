They made it so your Resonating Strike will put you right on top of enemies. I would like to ask for an exception, to the Baron Nashor. If you cast Resonating Strike on Baron, it puts you inside the little dude for a second, which can be really frustrating. Because of this, Lee Sins never use their Resonating strike on Baron, although it deal great damage. So Riot, I ask you this, please keep the Patch 6.20 change on Lee Sin&#039;s Resonating Strike just for Baron.\r\n\r\n SAVE THE {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}}","replies":[]}
