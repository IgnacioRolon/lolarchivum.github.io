The updated client is still in testing so not everything is implemented yet or you might run into issues.  You can return to the legacy client in the meantime if you the invite isn't being sent.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Buddelmuddel","date":"2017-02-24T19:54:28.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the implementation of the last patch, the short cut with the lol.launcher won't work properly anymore. It starts with the page where you have to click launch, then when you press it, it goes back to the new client. There you can click on start legacy client, and everything will work fine. Except that you get a pop-up with ziggs who would like to send a bug report. Although the client works fine, it just takes a long time to get to the legacy client now.
