Shouldnt I be getting one more chance for plat 1 since it's based off 3 games? This is also a question: Were promos changed or am I very very stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-22T23:30:50.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw, bummer!  I looked into this and it does look that there was a dodge once your mini series started.  A [queue dodge](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) followed by a loss ended the series.  :/  That only put you 10 LP away from another series though, you can do it!  Best of luck!!","replies":[{"poster":"MTSDeathWind","date":"2017-03-24T00:15:49.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, I'll pay more attention next time!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lew","date":"2017-03-22T03:43:31.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you have a dodge sometime during the promo series?
