And bubblehead isnt really a skin, i know he isnt as popular as Lux or Ezreal but he sees some play in League and he is still in the S tier in Botlane in my opinion. Godking would be great, Project would be fine, just anything else than bubblehead and santa claus. hope you will react to it riot &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Lulu","date":"2019-08-20T10:05:29.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, we just got this year's project skins, so project skin isn't possible for draven in 2019\n\nAnd i'm pretty sure godking Dravenwon't be a thing either 'cause it's quite unique to Garen and Darius and their rivalry, just like Dawnbringer and Nightbringer are unique to Riven and Yasuo as VS event skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-20T22:27:52.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The God-King skins were for the Vs. event in 2018. I get that Draven is Darius's brother, but he himself doesn't exactly have any sort of rivalry with another champion so there'd be no reason to make a Vs. event skin for him let alone recycle the God-King ones.","replies":[]}]}
