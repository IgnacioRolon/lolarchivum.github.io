Now i know it was just released so it is okay for it to not be perfect right away. Now to jump in: The system rewards players for playing a champ, basically they get xp for a certain champ by playing them. Normal level up system. The goal I assume is for players to have their \"main\" champions be something more special, that others might be able to view their profile and see what champions they excel at. The problem with this system is that in 6 months what do you think is going to happen? Every champion will be mastered, everyone/most people will have top mastery on all the champs they have an interest in, not just the ones they are best at or play the most. To quote the Incredibles \"everyone is special Dash. That's just another way of saying no one is.\"  That in a nutshell is this system. \n\nWhat needs to happen in my opinion is for there to be decay on champion mastery. Now maybe decay should only go back down to no further than rank 2. But decay is important, if there is no decay then this system is doomed to be obsolete as fast as the honor system. It is no different then leveling up to 30. Given enough time it will be no more special then being lvl 30. In fact all it will do is promote rage and become a channel for people to get mad/annoyed/worried about their teammates not having the mastery banner in loading screen. I can hear it now \"oh great we got a non mastered (noob) kat on our team gg\". Decay will keep you being mastered on just the champions you actually play, which I think is the goal here. \n\nAnother solution would be for you to only get certain ranks by getting a certain number of grades on each tier. Let me be clear. In order to go from:\nRank 1 to rank 2 you need 15 games of a C or better. \nRank 2 to rank 3 you need 15 games of a B or better. \nRank 3 to rank 4 you need 15 games of a A or better. \nrank 4 to rank 5 you need 15 games of a S or better. \n\nIn this system you can only truly be a master of champion if you are actually good with them. It shows that you have preformed well enough to earn it. Otherwise I can theoretically play Tryn (who i am terrible at) and get to rank 5 on games that i get a D grade in. Sure it would take awhile but lets be honest, Ive put enough time into this game, I'm sure as hell going to put in more. \n\nWe need to ask ourselves \"what does it mean to be a master of a champion?\" Is it playing them a lot? Or is it preforming well on regular basis with them? I think its the latter. I personally don't want to ever be rank 5 on a champion i suck at. If a majority of my Tryn games are me going 2-5-8 should I really be considered a master Tryn player? There are some champions i come back to from time to time that i think are fun but I'm not good with. One example is Heimer. I'm okay at him. Ill play him for a few days then drop him for  a few months. I very rarely get a great score on him (what id consider a rank S or even A). But with the current system ill get to rank 5 with him within 6 months easy. Is that the system we want? \n\nBy combining this system with the decay system you would have a really thorough champion mastery. It would even adapt with meta changes. For example: if you play a really good Shyv and you are getting lots of S games you will reach rank 5. Then lets say they nerf the play style you like on her (i used to max her E season 3, this happened to me) and you stop playing her or you start to lose more or play less well (less S ranked games). As a result you are not the master you used to be, you drop from rank 5 slowly to rank 4 or 3. \n\nThe last thing id like to talk about, and this is more of a question, but what exactly determines your grade in a game?  I don't feel that the system is quite so fine tuned. For example I don't know how 0-0-25 support Nami games gets me an A+, or me getting a S- going 3-5-30 as support and my jungle got a A+ going 10-15-21 (is that even a good score?) (cuz that happened). I know the system takes into account the role, champ, and average scores of people in your elo, but I don't know if the system also takes into account your wards placed/killed, assists on objectives such as towers, dragon and baron. If it does not then I think it should. \n\nThe reason i argue it should is that some play styles don't net you the most kill participation. Split pushing for example might get you 3 or 4 solo tower kills and you might be playing 20-30 wards from your trinket. You may be clearing 2 wards from pinks you lay. Your end score might look like 2-4-3. But does that mean you didn't do much for your team? No probably not, id hope you drew in the enemy and your team took dragons, you helped gain vision of 1/4 the map most the game giving your team great vision control. You gave the team global gold and map pressure. \n\nJust some food for thought. Let me know what you guys think, would be really awesome to get a red in here for some input. \n\n-KingSpadeIX \n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFriendly reminder overstaying is a good way to die and lose objectives. \nFriendly reminder vision wins games, upgrade dem yellows trinkets riot made them at bargain price.","replies":[]}
