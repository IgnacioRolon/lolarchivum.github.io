Your division can still go up and down. If you are Silver 1 now and get to Gold 3 by the beginning of next season then your reset will reset you from Gold 3 not Silver 1. In other words climbing during preseason just gives you a head start on next season.  \r\n\r\n**_&quot;When does next season start?&quot; _**\r\n\r\n**ans:** January 23rd 2019\r\n\r\n**_&quot;I thought preseason has big changes?
