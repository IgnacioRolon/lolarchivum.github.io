Disables HARMONY on your other items.\r\n\r\nBy building {{item:3174}} first you are making every other mana regen item you buy more efficient.  If your end build looks something like this:  {{item:3174}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3092}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3107}} you will be getting 500% bonus mana regen or 100 free ability power! In terms of gold value that is 2175 free gold in stats! \r\n\r\nPoint 3: The heal is really nice, is fun to use and feels rewarding. \r\n\r\nUNIQUE: Gain 25% of the premitigation damage dealt to champions as Blood Charges, up to 100 - 250 (based on level). Healing or shielding another ally consumes charges equal to 100% of the heal or shield, to heal them, up to the original effect amount.\r\n\r\nThis is really handy vs poke comps, will keep your team topped off as you siege but also can be really big for saving your adc or other ally. But it actually feels best when used on your tank. Nothing will make the other team cry more than throwing an empowered {{champion:43}} E on someone like {{champion:122}}. The shield is alone is huge, but now you are healing them for 250-300 HP on top of that. \r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind though when deciding to rush this item is whether or not the opposing comp has someone you can get stacks from. If the enemy team is mainly made up of back line champs, then you will have trouble stacking your {{item:3174}}. But if the enemy team comp has a tanky front line then you will have no trouble at all stacking. You will be able to chuckle to yourself when {{champion:57}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:58}} or some other tank gets picked, because you know it is free stacks for your {{item:3174}} . {{item:3174}}  is at its best when your team has a tanky front line and so does theirs. \r\n\r\nPoint 4: The Heal component of {{item:3174}} combos well with the other support items. \r\n\r\nBonus healing and shielding effects from {{item:3504}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3222}} will be more efficient when paired with {{item:3174}}. They will not only boost your Champions built in Shield but it will also boost the power of the healing mechanic on the {{item:3174}} . What was capped at a 250 point heal now becomes a 350 point heal when you have the 40% bonus healing, and that is on top of the shield or heal you are already giving. If the target of your heal/shield also has a  {{item:3065}} then it will be even bigger!\r\n\r\nI really do believe that {{item:3174}} is an under appreciated item and is much better than people think. Maybe people just don&#039;t like support, maybe people just have not figured it out yet. But I love support and hopefully this build might help other support mains feel more impactful in their games and be able to climb up the ladder as well. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see it in action you can follow me at: https://www.twitch.tv/commonsatyr. May the climb be ever in your favor. \r\n\r\n\r\nOh and remember \r\n\r\nPick smart, Build Smart, Play Smart and you will climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Purgë","date":"2018-01-28T21:31:54.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude msg me , i also think this items is fking broken and sleeper op , most supp items are cheap and busted , i need to theory craft a build for top lane","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-28T21:56:39.942+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Purgë,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EvX3ljbL,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-28T21:31:54.024+0000)\n>\n> dude msg me , i also think this items is fking broken and sleeper op , most supp items are cheap and busted , i need to theory craft a build for top lane\n\nYou dont have anyone to heal in top lane, and the gold efficiency comes from stacking mp regen, which is not a stat you want in top.","replies":[{"poster":"Purgë","date":"2018-01-28T23:35:39.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EvX3ljbL,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-01-28T21:56:39.942+0000)\n>\n> You dont have anyone to heal in top lane, and the gold efficiency comes from stacking mp regen, which is not a stat you want in top.\n\nno acutly i tried it and it's legit, u need the mana regen in top cause ur abilites cost so much mana, also the first item component transfer portion of manaregen to hp regen so","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-01-28T21:09:53.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good math.\n\nBut, nobody expects the {{champion:10}} {{item:3174}} with Aery.","replies":[{"poster":"RenownedWheat42","date":"2018-01-28T21:15:59.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn it now I wanna try this, if I can get off the klepto Kayle train","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hèntaî ","date":"2018-01-29T06:02:21.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
