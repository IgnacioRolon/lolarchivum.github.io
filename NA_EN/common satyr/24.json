My name is Common Satyr and I have recently set up my stream. I did all i could think of to add features and make things look good. I am a top lane and support main. Currently in my series to Gold 1 and have my eyes set on Plat soon. I love Anime, video games and debating controversial topics. \r\n\r\n My main champs are: Malph, Galio in top,  Karma, brand and Nami as support. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the stream is to be more about the viewer, I look at my twitch chat more than my minimap which is something I should probably change.... But at any rate Id love it if you came and said hi.\r\n\r\nHope to see you around!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/commonsatyr\r\n\r\n-Common Satyr\r\n\r\nps: Song request is on so feel free to play w/e music you like, and you can ask me any questions you might have and I will give you my thoughts.","replies":[]}
