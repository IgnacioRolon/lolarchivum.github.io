My problem with reworks in general.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"First and foremost Id like to say that new Taric is still good, very playable, very viable champion. My problem is that he is NOTHING like old Taric. The closest thing he has to his former self is that he gets bonus armor. \r\n\r\nI have a problem with this because Taric no longer fills the same niches that he used to. Old Taric was a great pick into melee, comps, AD comps and most importantly high mobility champs (Yi, Kalista... ect.) Champs that jump around a lot making skill shots difficult. New Taric feels like most champs now. It  is as if everyone has to have a long narrow skill shot. Old taric was one of the few auto hit stuns in the game. That was largely what made him great. In addition he had lots of damage and a decent heal. New Tarics heal is very underwhelming. It is an aoe petty heal that you need charges to make okay at best. To use without 3 charges is near worthless with the amount of heal you get. Now you can use it to trigger your passive, except that your stun doesnt last long enough to combo out more than one passive trigger. I don&#039;t think new Taric is as much fun to play, I don&#039;t feel that his abilities flow together nearly as well. \r\n\r\nOld Taric you would stun auto (reduce cd by 2), w auto, q auto, e auto again. If was fluid and fun. Each ability not only gave you a satisfying effect, but also you felt his passive working. Now his passive can&#039;t combo as well because the stun doesnt last nearly as long, in addition it makes you do two &quot;quick&quot; auto attacks rather than the one you had before which was faster. In addition using abilities would reset your aa animation on old Taric. In no way does he attack faster with his rework. \r\n\r\nNow as a Taric main (old taric) I am really disappointed in this rework. I feel as if you cared more about his forum gay identity than his game play identity. \r\n\r\nAnd look again new Taric is viable, but that is my problem. He is so different, that he could have been released as a whole new champion. My main did not have to be removed from the game for this one to exist.  And that is what really makes me angry. NOWHERE did I read that old Taric was bad and needed a rework. Visual update yes, rework no. Old Taric was STRONG, niche pick yes, but strong. I do not understand why you (Riot) feel the need to rework champions because they are unpopular. You have over 100 champions in this game., there will always be unpopular champions. If new Taric became the most popular champion in the game tomorrow, someone else will fall to old Tarics level of unpopularity. Nothing new was solved. All you did was frustrate and alienate the small player base he had before hand. The people who were excited and super happy that Taric got his deep Vee shirt and rework are the ones who never played him to begin with.  Go on rework Zed next, change his abilities so that he feels TOTALLY different, see how annoyed his player base gets.  It would be the exact same thing except to a larger number of people. \r\n\r\nPS: PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT REWORK GALIO, HE IS PLENTY STRONG STOP LISTENING TO THE META SHEEP!\r\nJust because something is unpopular does not mean it needs fixing. \r\n\r\n- KingSpadeIX","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-05-03T07:02:52.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> He is so different, that he could have been released as a whole new champion.\n\nKinda the whole point of a full relaunch","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fovere","date":"2016-05-03T07:54:16.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a huge fan of reworks unless the mechanics of a champion simply can't be fixed.\n\nThe complaint with taric is that he brought too much \"passive \" power to the table, like old sona and her auras.\n\nI don't see what's wrong with that personally. I liked his old kit and feel, and weaving autos between spell smashing during team fights never felt passive to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"antymattar","date":"2016-05-03T07:28:05.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sory to inform you, but that's the point. Some champions are downright bad in their current state. Old taric was an aura battery. He didn't do anything, he had a stun and that was a point and click stun. Two of his abilities were auras, the other two were point and clicks and one of those was a heal. Look at old sion, look at evelyn now, look at something like warwick. They have good kits I will agree, but they desperately need better ones. \n\nNot saying that I myself think this was the best way to do tarc, but I DO think it's better than old taric in many ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-05-03T07:18:39.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingSpadeIX,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EuEE81p6,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-03T06:36:25.883+0000)\n\n> PS: PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT REWORK GALIO, HE IS PLENTY STRONG STOP LISTENING TO THE META SHEEP!\n> Just because something is unpopular does not mean it needs fixing. \n> \n> - KingSpadeIX\n\nI don't think you understand how reworks work...","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScriptBrand","date":"2016-05-03T06:41:14.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"taric is broken, he does everything bard does, except 10 times better (except walking through walls, that is)","replies":[]}]}
