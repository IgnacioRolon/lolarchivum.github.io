Sat for a bit waiting for something to happen. After a bit I exit to reload except instead it takes me to end game screen I was labeled the leaver and lost 17 Lp. \r\n\r\nSuper not cool. No idea what prevented me from getting in since this was game number 10ish for me today and had no issues in my other games. \r\n\r\nWhat info do you need from me to look into this in detail? I have seen this sort of thing happen once before recently ( I had quit out then and reloaded and actually got into the game that time).","replies":[{"poster":"Yboat","date":"2018-11-09T04:27:59.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just happened to me again, now I have 20 min leavers buster.
