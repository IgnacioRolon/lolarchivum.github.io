This is some grade-a bullshit, unfair and borderline discrimination. I've never had an issue in-game with anyone saying my name was offensive or even bullying me because of it and we all know how toxic this community is.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOperatorsBox","date":"2016-08-04T22:57:51.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teeeechnically it's not. Someone probably reported your name as offensive, and believe it or not \"gay\" can be an offensive term. You can probably contest it, change your name and whatnot, but keep in mind you don't see people with the name \"%%%%%\" and contest it on the grounds they are black.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-08-04T00:39:38.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katey probably can't personally help you with your issue.
