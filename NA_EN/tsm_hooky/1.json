Unfortunately, regardless of the reason the disconnection happens, it still negatively impacts everyone in the match. This is a key reason why all disconnections are treated equally, and why penalties cannot be modified or removed. \n\nI recommend working towards solving the core issue causing your disconnections before queueing for more games and potentially gaining more penalties. If you can give me a bit more details about the behavior you experience before the disconnection happens, along with any error messages you see, I can point you in the right direction.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"MÃ£ge","date":"2016-09-13T06:59:57.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the contrast between the style of speech of this response and OP's post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-09-13T16:53:50.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like Involuntary Manslaughter","replies":[]}]}]}
