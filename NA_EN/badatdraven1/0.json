You can usually narrow it down to this anytime you see League \"start\" to open, but never actually pop up. \n\nRun through our [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) to make sure those settings get updated, and let me know if that doesn't fix it!","replies":[]}]}
