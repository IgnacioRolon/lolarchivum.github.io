I'd imagine at one point Trundle's pillar was supposed to do damage, so there may be some residual coding in Trundle's pillar that's causing the turret aggro to jump to you. Hopefully Meddler sees this post and double-checks it. **Hopefully.**","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-09-20T09:01:16.960+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Trundle's pillar is deliberately set up to draw agro around towers as are a couple of other non damaging spells that affect enemies (Zilean's Time Bombs for example draw agro on application, despite no damage being dealt then, not just when they detonate).","replies":[{"poster":"Tuss","date":"2014-09-22T01:48:03.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here I was thinking it just dealt 1 true damage upon touching it in order to draw turret aggro.

However can you explain the reasoning behind it? I understand why Zillean's Bombs draw aggro, but why does trundle's Pillar draw aggro and not other cc such as Nasus's wither?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wildfire GoG","date":"2014-09-20T19:06:48.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who made the decision to rework trundles lore ;-; we want u back trundle, u were a hero!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-09-20T15:11:55.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh.

It use to do 1 true damage per second. Although i don't believe it does damage anymore and instead just draw aggro. The true damage was just a work around instead of having to write it's own code.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lneacx","date":"2014-09-20T05:03:01.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last I heard, it's intended. I imagine it's because Trundle's pillar is a lot of CC and a great setup for tower dives, so allowing Trundle to use it without drawing aggro would make it oppressive.","replies":[]}]}
