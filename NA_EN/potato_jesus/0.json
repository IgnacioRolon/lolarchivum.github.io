After laning against one and being bursted to oblivion i realized that veigar doesn't laugh when his ult takes the finishing blow.\r\n\r\nSeverity: Low\r\n\r\nRecreation: Kill (or be killed) by a veigar ultimate and listen closely\r\n\r\nProof: Here is a small video with the audio adjusted for hear the champion voices better. (Fraps was acting weird, so the part happens at the very end very quickly, notice the soraka death sounds but nothing else)\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOSIBRpSiRw  (sorry for bad quality)\r\n\r\n-Potato Jesus","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2014-08-07T01:03:20.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report! \n\nWe'll take a look at it!","replies":[{"poster":"Potato Jesus","date":"2014-08-07T07:23:03.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to help!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elduris","date":"2014-08-06T21:57:34.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there\n\nSounds like some files might be corrupted or missing.
