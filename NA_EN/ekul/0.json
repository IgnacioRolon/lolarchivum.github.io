Feel free to correct me if I did any of it wrong.\n\nif my build is like: sorc shoes-void staff-morellos (or even just oblivion orb if they dont have much healing you need to cut down) on him. \n\nthe way MR is made is:\n\n1. mr reduction flat.\n2. mr reduction percentage.\n3. mr pen percentage\n4. mr pen flat.\n\nso. at that point you would have: \n\n65% magic pen percentage (25% from E passive, 40% from void staff):\nthen 33 flat (15 from morellos 18 from boots). \nthats not including runes which you can get a bit more (6) from sudden impact putting you at 65%/39.\n\n\nand what that would look like. is say you got 75 mr as a adc/sup/jg who didnt build mr. You'd lost 65%  of that and have ya know... 26.25. and at that point the flat reduction applies and youd lose 39 more or be at 0 (doesn't go negative?). so mord would be doing true damage. \n\nmany champs have low MR at 18 if you dont build mr, see here: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions/Statistics_at_level_18\n\nthen.  flip it around\n\nNow look at MR items: https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_resistance \n\nTo Imagine a full MR TANK build. \n\nmerc treads: 25\nGargoyle Stoneplate: (4o but if 3 or more people around gets another 40 so 80) 80\nLocket of the Iron Solari: 60\nBanshee's Veil: 55\nAdaptive Helm: 55\nSpirit Visage: 55\n\n= 330\n\nthen. if you have Conditioning you'd get 9 more at 9 min. as well as the 5% to total mr buff. so 339 + 5% which is at this point: 355.95 or 356. \n\nTHEN. the ONLY WAY TO GET MORE is either the rune sheild bash which would get you 9 more when your sheilded (365). OR smartly running Aftershock (will be a must into mord). Which states...\n\n\"PASSIVE: Stun icon Immobilizing an enemy champion grants 70 (+ 50% bonus armor) bonus armor and 70 (+ 50% bonus magic resistance) bonus magic resistance for 2.5 seconds. The bonus resistances are capped at 80 − 150 (based on level).\nAfter the duration, you release a shockwave that deals 10 − 120 (based on level) (+ 4% of your maximum health) magic damage to nearby enemy champions and monsters.\"\n\nfor 2.5 seconds after immobilizing an enemy champion grab 70 + capped at 80-150. so for this case with 339 (assuming your not running sheild bash. heh). + 220 for 2.5 seconds. you would have 559, + 5% from conditioning= 586.95, for 2.5 seconds when afterschock goes off, which sounds godly.\n\nHowever: then you take 65% of it off. 205.43. then subtract 39 from it... you get 166.43. SO FOR 2.5 seconds AT MAX MR with MAX MR ITEMS and OPTIMIZED RUNES. you'd be at 166.43 after mords done with you. Then it would wear off and you would...\n\nGO BACK TO 339+5% from conditioning = 356. which 65% off is 124.6 - 39 flat = 85.6 \n\nso a 6 item MR tank without a ornn in the game (would let you boost one of the items a bit more MR), is gonna give you 85.6 MR after MR calculations from mord hitting you... as a MAX BUILD MR TANK. Which most people will not be, and if you only kind of build MR, you will still be hurting. \n\nThis also isnt including if anyone were to help you out on Mords team by picking a champion that helps reduce MR flat or by percentage (Evelynn/jayce/karthus/kayle/kogmaw/trundle/corki). Like putting a trundle on Mords team would make it so even if you did build 6 MR items, he would just R and take 40% of your armor/Mr away during that time. And 40% of max mr would be devastating. \n\n\n**TLDR**\n\n3 item mord will do 65% mpen, and 39 flat. Those 3 items are Sorcery shoes (1100g), Oblivion orb(1600g), void staff(2650g) = 5350g build.\nIf you build no MR. and let your champ go to lvl 18 without any, your at about 75 possibly with runes: 75 mr - 65% = 26.25 - 39 = True Damage from mord\nIf you build 6 mr items max in the game with aftershock and it goes off: You would be at 576 for 2.5 seconds. So 586.95 - 65% = 205.43 - 39 = 166.43MR for 2.5 seconds. \nTHEN aftershock wears off: Your at 356 - 65% = 124.6 - 39 flat = 85.6MR\n\nOoft.","replies":[{"poster":"Phieldworker","date":"2019-05-28T23:21:54.496+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense but let’s wait till he is on live servers before we start calling for a hotfix.
