Based on your projects (ie roster updates and vgu's) champions like Oriana will never get looked at since shes pretty healthy balance wise. \n\nIs there any intention of looking at updating the textures of champions with healthy kits? I know it doesnt really fit under a roster update or a full vgu, but some of the older / classic champs are honestly an eye sore to look at. \n\nKeep in mind champions, such as oriana, WILL show up at worlds ... do you have any intention of bringing those type of champion's graphics quality up to par with the rest of the champs? \n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-08-25T21:54:42.216+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could always happen in the future as strategies always change and evolve.
