All I can do is watch him outscale me and its so frustrating; there is nothing I can do about it. He is strong early game and he also outscales me into late game...","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-15T22:01:57.261+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to trade with him when either his passive has just ended or his passive stacks have just fallen off. If he's beating you by poking you down, try to position yourself on the outside of your minion wave. If he casts a Q at you, dodge into the wave to avoid it, and if he casts an E at you, dodge out of the wave to avoid additional damage from bounces off minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beoridas","date":"2015-08-18T13:28:33.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair. it also depends on the champion you use. melee's with no gap closer will have a nightmarish time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beddlam","date":"2015-08-18T13:16:47.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have any cc that will stop him from casting, hit him either as soon as he pops is passive or about 4-5 seconds after a spell cast. Either of these totally ruins his day. DO NOT STAND IN YOUR WAVE after Ryze hits 6. He is a sustained damage dealer, not a burst mage, but E+R does a ton if you are surrounded by creeps. Also, Ryze is crazy mana hungry during laning phase. He probably won't be able to finish you off if he is below 50% mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Puri Puri Taric","date":"2015-08-15T23:13:50.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how to beat rize : take your hand form a fist beat ryze. done \nhttps://media4.giphy.com/media/LVIbmaUwpRJ1C/200_s.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2015-08-15T22:05:19.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had one of the worst experiences with Ryze too, honestly. If you look at my match history, it was the game i was playing Alistar. So i had to put up with him in top lane. I knew from the get-go that i would be outfarmed by him due to the fact that he DOES spam abilities and has more range than i did at the time. So what i did was pretty much get 1-5 cs from the first wave, and i waited for his minions to push all the way to my tower. It was a bit harder to last hit the minions but i felt a lot safer underneath my turret. Thankfully, my jungler and i had successfully landed a gank on him, so that set me ahead of him from there. As a tank, i instantly built magic resist and a sheen (so that i can output more damage than he would do to me if i wanted to trade with him). Ryze takes a lot of patience to lane against. You have to play REALLY safe in order to beat a good ryze. I also think that if you're a tank, you can build mikaels or even bring cleanse to get out of his stuns (Not 100 percent sure about this)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valderis Vandala","date":"2015-08-15T21:59:39.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ryze\n\nHis passive only works on every 5th spell cast, so he is predictable, wait for it to activate/fade before going for a trade with him.\nHis CC is only a root so you can still attack and use abilities that are not movement based.\nHis Q is blocked by minions but you should also learn to dodge it.\nHe is also completely mana dependent and starts with very little mana regeneration and no way to get health, he can't keep up fighting over and over. If you can favorably trade with him and you have a better sustain champion/build then you can easily win lane against him. Just got to poke him back.\n\nAnd whatever you do, do not all-in him if he has his ult. Unless he has no mana, then his ult is useless.","replies":[]}]}
