I was kind of filibustering.... I was referring to my childhood and how it's not fault I was a child prodigy that learned things nearly automatically; I literally learned to play the piano by watching someone do it ONCE.... my mother bought me a keyboard and I kept learning tunes by ear, harder and harder each time because I got bored as soon as I mastered one. I consider myself a complete retard compared to what I used to be, I was legit a child prodigy.... but being in an environment of stupidity (In Mexico, intelligence is considered bad) where everyone is complacent sapped my spirit and I became complacent too.... I wish I had the instinct, the drive I used to have to learn anything and everything as aggressively as possible (My initiative was unparalleled; No one WANTED to learn things as badly/as quickly as I did).\n\nAnyway kind of a funny story (At least to me), whenever I went to school, or my mother made me do chores, or I was forced to attend some family function it was always necessary to speak spanish, I was doing this by force (I.e. \"Because I must\") and in my free time, doing \"fun things\" was always  in english (Playing video games, reading booklets, watching TV).\n\nSo in a very strange way, it's like my mind was programmed to associate \"Fun\" with english and \"unfun\" with spanish. In real life I'm considered INCREDIBLY stoic and serious (Never laugh) but as soon as I start to speak in english my mannerisms, tone, inflections and even facial expressions soften a lot.\n\nI have skimmed a couple of neurological studies that indicate that switching language does in fact change a person's behavior, mannerisms and all of that stuff I mentioned... in my case **I accidentally \"wired my brain\" to make me super personable and \"Charming\" (It doesn't come across over the internet) when I am speaking english but super serious and stoic in spanish.**\n\nAs I am a university professor, I come across as a real hard-ass (so to speak) except to my english speaking students who all describe me as very weird but super nice and funny.\n\nEtc. I love english, I hate spanish. \nSpanish super rigid.

Good point..... the only accent I ever run into is the typical \"Normal\" U.S. accent (Think California). I had a girlfriend that was from Galveston and I liked... no, absolutely **adored** the way she talked. It was so fucking cute, my god. She was a very attractive woman but even if she was butt fugly, just the cute way of talking would have made me feel super attracted to her.\n\nI would love to learn more about U.S. accents and dialects but it's very difficult from where I am in Mexico.... my favorite of course is the Texas accent but I also like the slight mid-western drawl.  I have a niece that has a \"southern belle\" accent despite having grown up in Folson California (WTF? I have no idea either) and her manner of speaking is cute as hell.\n\nAlso I recently met a woman from \"Oregon\" which I only discovered was pronounced \"Organ\" yesterday, and she talked with a strange accent I couldn't quite place....
