Before the large fin on the end of her tail, there are the two smaller fins on either side. The one on the right side appears to have folded into her tail model, and it doesn&#039;t look like it normally should.\n\nHer gameplay is not affected in any way by this bug, but it has been bothering me a bit.\n\nCheers,\nAcolyte Tel Fyr","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-09-12T20:16:32.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi! Thanks for the report! I just took a look at her in game, and you're totally right - her fin's collapsed.
