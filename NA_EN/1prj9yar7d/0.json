So i go through the pains of remember/changing passwords and when I get in I see that my name is well this \"1PRJ9YAR7D\" and i'm like wtf?!?! So I see that you do have a chance to loose your name if youre out for some time and if they pick yours. Thats cool and all I can understand that, but why don't you get a free name change?! The game practically stole my name TT \r\nSo now i have to grind 13k ip which for a lvl ten i think is impossible or fork out 5 bucks.\r\n\r\nSo i'm to raise awareness to riot to give people a break and give them a free name change if their name was taken.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-09T18:01:27.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you may have experienced an issue with the inactive summoner name system.
