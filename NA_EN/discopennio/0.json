This happens every game and i can't play because of it. I need help asap please. My friend is on the same network as me and it works fine for him.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T15:51:04.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is failing to reach our game server, so it doesn't download assets and eventually times out.  My suggestion here would be to go over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help troubleshoot and fix up the blockage.  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[{"poster":"KoalaPie","date":"2017-04-01T18:31:34.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious, I've had the same problem before multiple times and currently my friend is experiencing the same thing pretty much every game. The difference is, when I had the problem and the same one my friend is having right now, we could eventually reconnect to the game after the loading screen had ended for the people who got in loading screen or after restarting the client. To me that doesn't seem like a connection issue on my end and the fixes suggested in the connection issues page probably won't fix it. To me the occurrence was very random, some games connected normally some games not, time periods when it never occurred at all. Like I mentioned earlier, for my friend it is almost every single game so finding a fix would be very needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T18:35:11.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the OP, it sounds like his network is unstable enough to lose sync entirely while still in champion select.  Meaning, he never made it far enough for a game to actually begin.\n\nFor your scenario, champion select successfully finished, but a network problem might be causing problems.  Specifically, your connection needs to transition from champion select to our game servers.  A block or connection issue can cause that to fail or require you to reconnection.  I'd still recommend the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide and making sure security settings are adding league as an exception.","replies":[{"poster":"KoalaPie","date":"2017-04-01T19:28:38.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So even though it works after a client restart / when the game started, it still might be a connection issue? I'll see if these work. I'm curious, what kind of effects do opening those ports and changing to a public DNS can have?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-01T20:10:59.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially, the guide helps rule out most possibilities.  Adding league as an exception through your ports will make make sure that your network is allowing your connection to communicate with our services.  You can use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure that!  The DNS configuring can sometimes help re-route your connection, in case your ISP is taking a more scenic scene to reach us.  Hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
