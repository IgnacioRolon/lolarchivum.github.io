As if I was trying to wrong resolution. Toning the resolution down to 1280 x 720 fixed the issue. However, my laptop screen is in fact 1920 x 1080 (which I checked and rechecked multiple times). \r\n\r\nReally confused about this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-05T22:32:47.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it a 4K?  It's not officially supported for League right now so it's possible to run into issues.  I also suggest resetting your config just in case something corrupted and failing to read your resolution properly.\n\nLog into the game client.\nNavigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\nDelete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\nGo into a custom game and verify that settings have saved properly.  Leave game to sync settings. \n\nLet me know if that helps!","replies":[]}]}
