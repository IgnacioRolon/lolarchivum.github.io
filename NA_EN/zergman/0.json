On top of that, you provide an item augmenting the scaling of tank and reducing the incoming damage from one source is available at the expense of a summoner. In my opinion, Top laners pick cinderhulk for the +25% bonus hp not for the aoe damage.\nExample : Hecarim. Dealing aoe damage is a bonus, but the added hp scaling and the reduced incoming damage allows him to jump in and assassinate a squishy target while being healthier than ever.\n\nI have a proposition to counter that:\nMake the bonus value scale with the number of big monster killed in the jungle. \n       Example : gain +0.5% of bonus hp of by big monster killed, up to 25% -50 big monster kills- \nWith a nerf like this one you will need to be a full time jungler to unlock the full potential of the item.

Why not make it work similarly to Seeker's Armguard/Devourer Enchantment? Cinderhulk is a problem because it's used by people outside of the jungler role, right? Well, make it so the bonus health isn't as good unless they're killing large monsters in the jungle. As you kill large monsters, Cinderhulk \"levels up\". Build the item and it starts at 10% bonus. Every one or two large monster(s) killed adds 3% until it hits 25% (I'm thinking two large monsters per \"stack\", since one would be too easy still and any more than two defers the power of the item too much for the jungler. Giving it a 10% baseline makes sure it has some semblance of gold efficiency early on). \n\nThis makes it much more valuable for the jungler and far less appealing to the laner, as the power received from it is dependent on actually killing jungle camps. At the same time, it also slows down the overbearing, super tanks that are so strong right now while not nerfing the item into the ground, thus making them underpowered again.

Shyvana in particular is a premier duelist who can already function very well with only tanky items. Cinderhulk exacerbates her advantages.\n\nAlso, I have a somewhat related question to the effects Cinderhulk has had on tanks as a whole if you wouldn't mind answering.\n\nWhat do you intend to do about tanks who are reaping Cinderhulk's benefits like a wheat farmer on cocaine? Gragas and Sejuani have become pick/ban thanks to their teamfight-changing CC to go with their newfound tankiness, but Volibear is a champion who feels like a serious problem just waiting to charge out and chew on everything like a squeaky toy if those two are banned. Chosen of the Storm heals him for significantly more than it used to, forcing mages into Morellonomicon and AD champions into Ignite just to deal with that, and he actually does *more* damage by stacking tons of health, which means he has even more survivability. Frenzy's base damage and bonus health scaling are very high on their own, and it's an execute to boot. With only Cinderhulk and Warmog's, he already deletes squishies who are unfortunate enough to be not even as low as half health.\n\nWith Righteous Glory (which he's guaranteed to get adjacent to Warmog's Armor) and Rolling Thunder—hell, throw a Randuin's Omen in there, too; another 500 HP and slow—you can't run away from him. Majestic Roar slows them for the last two basic attacks he needs, and he can already kill any squishy champion with virtually no counterplay to show for it.\n\nLeague of Tanks has turned the game on its head (for better or worse), but it's made it nearly impossible to play anything squishy or immobile in solo queue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ugulabugula","date":"2015-04-26T20:14:59.733+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Meddler :\n\nI had a Idea, not sure if anyone tought about it. You can only buy the Cinderhulk when you have Smite as a Summoner Spell right?.\nSo why dont limit the Smite Spells per Team to 1?. So only one Summoner per Team can pick Smite. Sure there is the Chance that the Toplane picks it and refuse to give it to the Jungel, but then you can Report the Top-Lane and the \"Troll\" in that Case gets Punished right?.\n\nI only saw that you plan to move the Damage and all that Stuff and i tought \"why not simply limit the Smites per Team?\". That would, in my Opinion, solve the Problem and still leaves the Jungle Tanks in a Good Spot so they are still usefull\n\n@Ahri Desu: Not broken, usefull. If they get nerfed again there is again no reason to choose a Tanky Jungel like Seju or something over VI or Xin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zergman","date":"2015-04-25T20:18:35.677+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. I wish there was an easy solution. Maybe someone smarter than me can come up with it. The problem with 1 smite per team is trolls. You know people will take smite just to piss off the jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-04-26T07:47:00.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont remember sightstone getting nerfed, or at least, straight up nerfed. They nerfed the base heath but made it cheaper to compensate. then they also removed the \"can only use 2 charges at one time\". \n\nthe problem with {{item:3751}} is that its too good with the new jungle items. tank junglers (and others) used to only be effective with the purple item, since it was the only way to clear. the sunfire passive helped solve that problem and the mana issues with it, opening possibilities for the {{item:3715}}  item or the {{item:3706}}. but even in this situation, it probably wouldnt be as useful as an actual summoner spell. but then they added 25% bonus health, making it one of the best scaling items in the game. take away the %health increase and top laners wont want it anymore. \n\nive taken it support before. for support, its feast or famine - if you do well, you snowball super hard. {{item:3401}}  + {{item:3709} + {{item:2049}} gives you a massive amount of HP for 5000 gold. if you dont, you die repeatedly because {{summoner:3}} is such a useful summoner to stop assasins or fed carries.","replies":[]}]}
