I heard that just playing norms eventually ill get better but usually it isn&#039;t myself that goes behind in lane and in teamfights. While more my teammates (ik i sound like a bronze player accusing my teammates) but some games i go 6/3 mid with a 1/5 top 1/5 jg and 1/10 bot lane. I understand i can roam bot or top to help them out but i don&#039;t get to six before someone dies. If anyone has any tips on how to improve myself i would like to know.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-08T15:52:53.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to be level 6 to roam, especially if someone else is having a really rough time. Saying positive things in chat can also help, since it can cause your teammates to feel less stressed about the mistakes that they have made and play better.\n\nAlso, for mouse accuracy and such try playing Osu!\n\nIt is a free music rhythm game for the pc that really helps if you do it even a couple of times a day. Really helps increase your CS among other things.","replies":[]}]}
