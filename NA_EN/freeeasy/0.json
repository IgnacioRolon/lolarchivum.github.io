I am using the old client, and everytime i launch league, I have to press the launch button 2-3 times and wait about 2 mins for it to launch. Once I manage to get into champ select, my chat bugs out and is delayed by 5-10 seconds. Skip to ingame, I start out with 60 fps (My PC is capable of runnign most games at 60 fps at highest settings, league shouldnt be an issue, never had this issue). \n\nI noticed that if I alt+tab out, back, or die, my fps drops to 30 as well and it starts to tear and while not unplayable, its harder to kite/teamfight especially as an adc.","replies":[]}]}
