You could only dodge projectiles at the END of the projectile cast as it was about to hit you. Now you can &quot;dodge it&quot; anytime. Sometimes. I guess? Its not predictable anymore, like it used to be.\r\n\r\nThe bug started happening when you guys implemented those dumb patience bars onto the camps and Master Yi&#039;s alpha strike made the patience bars reset. You guys &quot;fixed&quot; the patience bars from resetting but in exchange Master Yi gets wrecked in alpha. I&#039;m assuming he no longer &quot;disappears&quot; or something which explains why he can randomly get hit, so the mobs don&#039;t think he disappeared.\r\n\r\nHopefully using the origin of the bug someone can finally fix it. It&#039;d be worth having the monsters deplete their patience bars... If you guys, you know, want to revert it.\r\n\r\nPls its been too long. {{champion:11}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Exgeniar","date":"2016-07-18T00:00:43.098+0000","up_votes":106,"down_votes":5,"body":"tldr; Fix in progress... 90% fixed, still need more time to work on it.\n\nFrom my investigations, it has nothing to do with patience timers. It might have been there since he was released, but probably no one was good enough to have noticed it back then. The bug, as far as i understand,  is that there is a 2 server frame delay on when the un-targetability state is applied, like 10~50 milliseconds.\n\nThis bug is extremely time consuming to fix.... To fix this, we'll need to rewrite the entire ability and architect the spell logic correctly. This means that we'll need to retest everything with this ability. This is essentially 25% of the QA work needed to release a new champion, and more since we need to ensure it looks, sounds, and feels just the same on all skins (and Master Yi have a lot of skins). On top of that, we need to verify a bug that exists for about 10~50 milliseconds, which is really bloody time consuming.\n\nThe fix I attempted went out to PBE in 6.13, and had 1 failure. I'm currently in the tail of a project, and do have no time to readdress the issues until it ships. There's a lot of moving parts in Alpha Strike, and I can't garen-tee the fix will be identical in feels to an experienced Master YI player, your feedback will be appreciated when that rolls around. \n\nCheers,\n\nExgeniar","replies":[{"poster":"Mictest","date":"2016-07-18T00:59:53.550+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":81,"body":"In short:\nToo much work to fix, have no time.

This is a recent problem that started in patch 5.18.\n\nI believe it is related to [Disappearing missiles fix](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-518-notes#patch-disappearing-missiles-fix)\n\n>  This time, we’re addressing a bug where the game client (your computer) could incorrectly cancel a spell that still existed on the server. This led to cases where a spell could briefly appear on screen and then immediately visually disappear, but still be able to hit enemies.\n\n\nQuote 2\n\n> Basically, the server’s cancel command was too generic - rather than “stop this thing”, it just told the game client to “stop a thing”. In cases where multiple similar actions were happening in extremely rapid succession, the game client had to guess at what the server was trying to stop, and this bug happened when it guessed wrong.\n\n\nMy guess is that prior to 5.18 alpha would cancel every effect of a targetted spell, even when it is en route.\n\nAfter 5.18 the avoidance is handled server-side.  When determining which effect has precedence it is using the <begin cast> time.\n\nFor example TF casts yellow card.  Yi alpha strikes when the projectile is in the air.\n\nThis causes Yi to show the alphastrike animation.  However, since yellow card was cast before alphastrike, the stun effect registers.\n\nPerhaps adding projectile  speed * distance to the <begin cast> when adjudicating the event log would resolve this.\n\nOr code a mini-timewinder ability to alphastrike.  When yi exits alphastrike return his health/status/buffs/debuffs to what they were when alphastrike was first cast and ignore any effects applied to him for alphastrike's duration.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyrum Graff","date":"2016-07-18T01:17:19.420+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Exgeniar,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=jrjbUlkK,comment-id=0021,timestamp=2016-07-18T00:00:43.098+0000)\n>\n> From my investigations, it has nothing to do with patience timers.
