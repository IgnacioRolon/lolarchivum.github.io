The game then crashes and goes back to the client where i am forced to press reconnect but I still am not able to load into the game. Someone help me please, i am not getting banned but I am not able to play its very frustrating. Also, I have tried both clients, I tried fully reparing, and restarting my computer but nothing works. Oh and also, it doesn't work for any gamemode so no Aram, custom games, I even tried doing the tutorial. Help. I got a ban now  please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-30T18:55:03.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens usually result from connection problems, so your network is failing to reach the game servers properly.

I have tried all the troubleshooting steps on your support site but still no luck. \n\nSpecific Problem: After champion select (on any game mode), the timer counts down to zero and the game tries to switch from the launcher to the game. It crashes and gives me a bug splat error. It puts me back to the launcher with the reconnect button. When I press reconnect, it does the exact same thing with the same bugsplat. \n\nThings I have tried:\n- Clean windows boot\n- older graphic card drivers\n- updating DirectX\n- update Java\n- compatibility mode\n- run as administrator\n- turning off firewall\n- turning off anti-virus\n- uninstalling/reinstalling LoL and cleaning the registry\n- repairing LoL through launcher \n\nNone of these things in any combination seem to get me into a game. I have leaverbuster now from the ARAM games I was trying to play, so I switched to custom games to try and troubleshoot but still not luck. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end here. {{item:3070}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nEDIT/UPDATE This worked for me: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/X6sPFPu8-fps-drops-and-crashes-after-the-windows-10-anniversary-update","replies":[]},{"poster":"KatMechs","date":"2017-01-23T23:22:00.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I FINALLY FIXED IT!
