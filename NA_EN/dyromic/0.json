A heartbroken kid is given, after he has lost one of his loved ones and a gentle creature helps him out, pulls him out of sorrow and gives him reasons to live. (Heck, even Hiro&#039;s and Nunu&#039;s riding posture are resembling each other)\n\nI know copyright issues would have occured with this one, but this wouldn&#039;t have been the first time for Riot to &quot;borrow&quot; from a non-Riot franchise (the Chosen and Forsaken skin lines, Prehistoric skins and so on)","replies":[{"poster":"Tormentula","date":"2018-08-14T00:10:26.061+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They could've used a similar narrative (and it still probably could)\n\nbut using the design I think would be too far from the original nunubot design.
