I didn't get a Riot email so I waited for about 10-15 minutes, checked again, nothing. I tried entering the email for the account I'm currently using and received the email immediately. I did not incorrectly enter my original email and am wondering if anyone can explain why I'm not getting the recovery email? I've tried to submit a ticket to Riot Games Support but I do not remember my account creation date.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-29T22:43:03.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your recovery email could be hitting your spam folders.
