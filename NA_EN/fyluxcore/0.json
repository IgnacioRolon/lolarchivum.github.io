Error massage: \"Username or Password is incorrect. Please try logging in again. If you have forgotten your Password, click here\". I tried to recover my username and my Password and on the Website it said \"Account name has been sent to the specified Email address.\" but I did not receive an email. Strange Thing is, my smurf account is totally fine: I can Login to the launcher, I can recover my username and Password... Anyone having the same Problems or any idea what the Problem might be?\r\nBtw, this is not my main account, cause I cant log in on the Homepage either.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirracle","date":"2017-12-06T22:26:32.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I tried to Login to my main account today, i got a red message above username \"You have tried logging in too many times in a short period of time.
