I wont bore you with my life story but basically i had no consistent way to play for a couple years.\n\nBu now I have a new place, job, and all that. Trouble is I kinda also have a new email and dont have access to the one I used. In fact if im not mistaken i deleted it as Yahoo wont even recognize my username on it (its my same SN here)\nthis is troubling as when i went to change my email, i was sent an email confirmation. The problem of course being I cant access that email. I was going to make a support ticket but again, guess where that would go. Is there a way to get a code sent to my new email?\n\nAlso I think this is a silly Q but I can change my account name too right? Like what I use to login, not the SN in game? I've gotten more creative than this in the years I been gone lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-13T23:46:52.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, we can help with this!

I'm not sure how I could prove it other than asking the friend I had recommend post here vouch for me as again it's been quite a bit since i been around.\n\nAh darn, well i guess i'll just have to accept logging in this way. Thanks for the reply.","replies":[]}]}]}
