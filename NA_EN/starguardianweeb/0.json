Even if a CD is as low as 4 or 5 seconds, its more useful than &quot;you did XXXX damage over the course of the game with this rune.&quot;\n\nSo maybe make that panel more useful and put cooldowns and other things there where applicable.\n\n~~or dont im a scrub not a cop~~\nEdit: I kinda forgot i made this thread until reading Surrender at 20 and seeing the riot comment on it, where I went \"Oh hey I was just discussing that....wait a minute\" lol","replies":[{"poster":"Riot MapleNectar","date":"2018-02-28T20:02:25.039+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll see if Riot Sparkle could talk about this (she was the UX designer for the runes system). I personally would get more value out of the things you're talking about - I usually just trust my runes are doing what they say they are and don't care so much for how much I've healed with triumph as an example. That's just my opinion though, and I have far less insight into the player implications of not providing the information we currently do. I could easily believe that it entirely comes down to personal preferences, but can't honestly speak with any authority on this topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-02-28T21:05:52.989+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"O hai, I'm Riot Sparkle and I'm going to write a long answer because I never get to talk shop about stuff like this and I'm really excited. :D \n\n>So maybe make that panel more useful and put cooldowns and other things there where applicable.\n\nSo, this suggestion is a pretty dang good one - I know because it was actually originally how we had the in game rune panel set up tbh. We had different rune cooldowns and changing damage values on there, and the idea was to provide tactical \"in the moment\" information on the in game panel.\n\nHowever, in practice (i.e in testing) this didn't work out so well. Players needed the information on the buff bar for many of their existing abilities and buffs, and attention was divided between the two spaces. This meant that players often missed important rune info because they were looking at that teamfight action - and the rune panel is farther from the action than the buff bar. Hence, we decided to move keystone cooldowns etc. to the buff bar instead and group all of that \"need to know now\" info together. \n\nAdditionally, we found that players were _actually_ most often using the runes panel  in a \"moment of rest\", while dead or in the base, for example. And, generally, having a cooldown or value of \"0\" for something wasn't very useful to them in that use case. Stats like you mention for the quest runes, for example, were far more useful. \n\nNow, this isn't  to say I think we've perfected the formula of showing information on the runes panel - we still have an upcoming task to do a giant sweep of both in-game and end of game rune stats to make sure we're showing the most useful things we can and to push the two rune info spaces further apart (players tend to want different stats during the game than after it from an evaluation standpoint). So, basically, I think there's more work to be done around rune stats for sure.\n\nI've also talked about how we're going to be evaluating individual runes more often now (ex: Manaflow Band) to see if they need to display more tactical information on the buff bar to be used effectively. The danger there is indeed in overloading that space, which is why we're pretty carefully weighing each rune that goes up there, but I think that runes like Manaflow or Null Orb, despite being normal runes instead of keystones, certainly earn that spot. \n\n**TL;DR **We are concerned about having too many things on the buff bar BUT at the same time it made sense to group all of the tactical information you need together in one spot visually, or else it was actually really hard to use that information when you needed it. Also we have more work to do in the runes stat space.","replies":[{"poster":"StarGuardianWeeb","date":"2018-03-01T04:53:46.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all of your input! I appreciate you guys responding. :)\n\nI can totally see where you are coming from there, I will admit I want thia change more for \"when should i initiate/back off\" but with the position of the panel it could detract from teamfights or even get me ambushed (always ban shaco :P ) In that regards, I hope you at riot find ways to \"compromise\" the info. \n\nI wish I had more to offer than just \"Ah i see, well good luck fixing all that!\" but if i were any good at UI design i'd probably be working for you all lol. I do think tho that maybe something similar to the PBE flair for CD resets might help notice some rune effects better? Or maybe a sound effect might help. Im just spitballing tho.

I don’t see how the running total is useful at all in game. After the game sure. It’s the equivalent of showing total seconds saved on ult by running ultimate hat (which it currently doesn’t but shows the % cdr achieved) As a random bit of trivia somewhat interesting.

For example: \n\n· Aftershock should get damage mitigated and damage done, instead of only damage done, you pick it to get tankier.\n· Grasp, same as aftershock; the healing is as important as the damage, if not more.\n· Aery shoud have Damage and Shielding, instead of number of procs/number of procs.\n\nI understand it would be a bit harder to fit 2 lines of text instead of one, you could always just show the bigger number beetween the 2 or at least consider the Aftershock rune to display mitigated damage, its a tank keystone the damage it deals its just a bonus not what you pick it for.\n\nAlso it would be lovely if you gave us stats for ravenous hunter i would love to know how much im healing from it, even if it isnt the main display, you could just add it on hover, or make it replacethe \"5/5\" as its pretty useless at that point.\n\nIm also a big fan of useless/funny stats like {{item:3046}} deaths prevented, you could give Guardian a counter on how many times you saved someone from death, or zombie ward/poro ward a counter on enemies spotted/amount of vision score you gained from them.\n\nEdit: Sorry for my broken english, I promise I tried my best.\n\nEdit2: Runes that give raw stats (Gathering the storm, Mirror shell, etc...) should give you the data on how much damage/mitigation you gained from those stats. It would be much easier to compare for example 800 damage mitigated from bone plating with 950 damage mitigated from mirror shell, than comparing 800 damage mitigated with \"+9 mr\", i know the rune literaly gives 9 mr, but how much is that 9 mr helping me? ill never know.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-02-28T23:13:12.838+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the suggestion!

I'm often looking at the damage/healing/whatever currently done in a game by a rune. It's very useful to give me context in regards to how a rune is performing within a specific set of circumstances. A rune can do half the damage in a game as it did in the prior game despite being similarly lengthed games. I wanna know how useful my rune was during laning, how useful it was after laning, ect. A single end of game stat does a very poor job of that.\n\nA huge change I'd like to see is the ability to look at the stats on other people's runes. At the very least using the on site match history feature, which currently doesn't even show rune builds, let alone their end game effectiveness. I used to look at the player builds and stats from pro game vods on the esports part of the site and check out what runes and masteries pros used and now that's gone. Ideally I'd like to be able to see the effectiveness of each player's runes at any snapshot of time in a given game, but I'm pretty sure that's asking too much and even if it happens it won't be for many years.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-02-28T21:20:47.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is some useful information that having it the way it is gives.
