We&#039;ve seen some questions about the speed you earn BE in the new system (compared to the earn rate on IP in the old system). We&#039;ve always said that most players would earn champions either as quickly or faster than before. To prove it, let&#039;s look at the numbers.","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I levelled up from 11 to 12 and got 400BE\r\nand then from 12-13 and got another 400 BE.....\r\nIdk how I'm ever going to afford champions also didn't get any shards from either levelling.\r\n\r\nAs a fairly new player the grind is going to be real haha.  Playing enough games to level up only to earn less than the amount of the lowest champion isn't really a reward in any way. I hope something gets done to fix this :)\r\n\r\nPS is it supposed to be both or a higher value shard when you level up? Because it seems that way according to 'Mortdog ': \r\n\" First, a couple baselines to get us started.\r\nA Leveling Capsule contains champ shards with a BE value of either 720, 900, 960, or 1,240. (The average value is 910 based on drop rates)\"\r\n\r\nClearly this isn't happening to me. Idk if this is my low level or what but I thought these changes were meant to help players like me not hinder us this badly.","replies":[{"poster":"UsualPaper","date":"2017-11-20T20:17:30.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having a somewhat related issue. I'm at 34 and started at 30. Every level capsule has given me 1 champ shard or 1 skin shard. All of my friends are getting 3-5 shards per level up. Why is that? I want to get the URFwick skin but at this rate it takes about 3 days to get 2k essence and I need another 30k. It's unobtainable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-09T23:05:40.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alrighty, had to do a bit of digging and tesing for this since it's a bit new for everyone, but after trying it first hand I can see where you're confused with Mortdog's examples. He mentions you get a *shard* from leveling capsules, but you didn't. It looks like at levels 12/13 you get a capsule that gives you a flat 450 essence, not a shard at all. \n\nOverall, it looks like Mortdogs post is only talking about levels 30+ and not below that. For now, it looks like 12/13 just give you BE.","replies":[]}]}
