My goals for this concept are...\r\n\r\n-Create a champion who is specifically an assassin (or something akin to one)\r\n-Create an assassin who mages can counterplay by knowing how to dodge skillshots\r\n-Make an assassin, who, despite being immobile, can go toe to toe with other assassins.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the concept i will call the champion Danger Noodles. \r\nApologies for the blocks of boring text \r\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}} \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, on with the concept!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Passive: Grasp of Madness**\r\nAttacking an enemy inflicts them with one stack of madness for 3 seconds. Upon receiving three stacks of madness the enemy who is afflicted with madness will be put under a debuff called **Insane** for 3 seconds. If an enemy marked with this debuff is attacked by Danger Noodles or their ally champions they take 40-125+(45% ability power) damage and they are feared for 0.5/0.75/1 seconds (levels 1, 7, and 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Q: Constricting Reach**\r\nDanger Noodles channels for 0.5 seconds. After which he launches his tentacle arms in a line, knocking enemy minions aside. Upon hitting an enemy champion, his arms rap around them, dealing 40/60/80/100/120+(40% ability power) damage, then he drags the enemy to him, dealing the same damage again (80/120/160/200/240+[80% ability power] damage total). \r\nrange: 600\r\ncooldown: 11/11/11/10/10\r\n\r\n\r\n**W: The Maw**\r\nDanger Noodles uses his (mouth?) to chomp on his opponent, this deals 100/145/190/235/280+(65% ability power)+(140% bonus attack damage) magic damage. This deals 30% more damage if the enemy is feared.\r\nrange: 200\r\ncooldown: 7\r\n\r\n\r\n**E: Cosmic Illusions**\r\nDanger Noodles uses his celestial elder god powers (that's what Lovecraft monsters get) to slip from sight (become invisible) for 3 seconds. This can be interrupted by attacking or beginning to channel **Constricting Reach**.\r\ncooldown: 20/19/18/17/16\r\n\r\n\r\n**R: Will Beyond Stars**\r\nDanger Noodles channels for 1 second, after which he unleashes his cosmic area in an area in front of him. All enemies caught in the area take 150/300/450+(55% ability power) damage and are marked with **Insane**.\r\ncooldown: 140/110/80\r\nwidth: 400\r\nlength: 750\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Strengths**\r\nImmune to minion block\r\nHigh damage\r\nDecent skill expression with e and q\r\nDecent utility\r\n\r\n\r\n**Weaknesses**\r\nLack of Mobility (as intended)\r\nCC that a lot of mages have access to\r\nNo survivability or escape\r\nEasy to dodge q when e hasn't been used beforehand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Please leave any thoughts you have on the concept in the comments! Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"ACatIsFineToo","date":"2019-11-10T01:48:03.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassin with no mobility = Mage.   \n\nYour thinking of a mage.\n\nAlso \"-Create an assassin who mages can counter play by knowing how to dodge skillshots\"   Then proceeds to give assassin/mage a 3 second invisibility. And Weaknesses -no escape?  He has a 3 second invisibility.  Thats an awesome escape. \n\nI won't say this is a bad design tho.   What you've created is an invisible burst mage.  Think of a brand with invisibility that always opens with his W, where you can see it for 0.5-1 second before you get hit. \n\nThe champions would be fun to play, probably see play as a support.  You've created an invisible hook champion btw.  A pyke with half the range but with invisibility.  There is a real reason Pyke's camo gives a global danger sound when he uses it.  Its so he cant hook people while invisible.\n","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyNecroman","date":"2019-11-10T02:00:00.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I said no escape I meant no dashing away, but now I see it does give Danger Noodles the ability to pull a slip on someone. As for the fact it's a mage, I'm starting to see that. The thing about his q is that its range isn't that high, meaning most mages could outrange him. As for adc's most have a range of 550 but for those who have 600 or more ({{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:235}})  will be able to contend with him far better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sune","date":"2019-11-09T06:45:59.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyNecroman","date":"2019-11-10T01:48:28.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"explain please.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iiGazeii","date":"2019-11-09T06:44:12.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An immobile AP assassin is just a burst mage.
