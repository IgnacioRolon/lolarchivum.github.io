First I check my ping and it was okay. But when I did a spell it got one sec delay, so wierd because I got 100 for ping. Then the next match I high level lag happened. Suddenly I couldnt move, and I checked my ping and it was 200 which was also wierd because you dont get so much lag with 200ping. I think theres a problem with the servers or something.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2014-02-04T01:36:16.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey xdspx!\n\nThat is indeed extremely weird.  Usually, when you experience delays when you cast spells, this is due to unstable connections or Packet Loss.  Essentially, your computer is trying to tell our Servers \"Yo dude, I pressed Q, make the pretty spell happen!\"  This usually happens instantly, and your spell is cast.  However, if there is a lot of buffering on your connection, or if you are experiencing Packet Loss, this command may take longer than normal to reach our servers, therefore causing the delay.  \n\nIn an effort to help troubleshoot this issue, make sure that you attempt all of the steps found in this Knowledge Base Article:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/21696815\n\nOnce you have completed all of them, and if you are still experiencing this delay, make sure to escalate this issue to us here in Player Support by submitting a new [Support Ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new).
