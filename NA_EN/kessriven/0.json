I know full well that riot doesn't care about its players but this has been an ongoing, consistent problem since the game came out. Riot eventually will have to address these issues because the current systems in place do nothing but randomly decide who should get a slap on the wrist punishment for intentionally ruining 4 other people's games.\r\n\r\nOn to the actual post. I'm low-mid elo, was in promo's to plat 2. I'm a support main, have been trying to broaden my support pool outside of just thresh and Lux. Was playing as Karma, and everyone who has ever played karma knows it's extremely easy to poke the enemy bot lane by hitting the ranged minions with your Q as it's basically impossible to miss. The vayne that I was unfortunately stuck playing with didn't like that I was shoving the wave by poking. We were against an Ezreal/Nami. Shoving the wave is exactly what you want to do instead of giving them lane control and letting ezreal get constant free cs and klepto procs. Said vayne continues to rage at me for q'ing the wave, recalls with full hp/mana and only enough gold for a dagger. Then proceeds to walk continuously to lane tower, recall, and repeat. This continued for 4 minutes until I bought mobis and decided helping my team was the safest option. We were winning a 4v5 situation but Vayne actually wasn't even csing, she would auto the wave like 3 times and then recall back. They decided to finally rage quit at around the 25 minute mark. \r\n\r\nA report was issued by some of the players (the enemy team was very happy that vayne was griefing the entire team). How has riot not fixed this issue? How has the toxicity not been addressed in any way shape or form? They \"implement systems to catch toxic gameplay\" but I have never in my life heard of someone actually getting in trouble for this. As long as you don't say forbidden words, you can do whatever you want and riot essentially condones it. Sorry for the rant, just sharing my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-11-04T08:30:06.221+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":">They \"implement systems to catch toxic gameplay\" but I have never in my life heard of someone actually getting in trouble for this. As long as you don't say forbidden words, you can do whatever you want and riot essentially condones it. Sorry for the rant, just sharing my 2 cents.\n\nIn the past few days there have been several posts lately of people getting banned for intentional feeding. So it does happen (if you wish I can find those threads to link).\n\nThe main issue is detecting malicious intent from gameplayer related behavior is much more difficult than for chat behavior. In both cases the sheer size of the playerbase basically requires an automated system to handle the heavy lifting.\n\nChat is 100% in the players control all the time. You can't \\*accidentally\\* flame someone.\n\nGameplay is a whole other ballgame. Playing poorly unintentionally is not bannable or punishable beyond losing more games. So Riot has to be reasonably sure that the person is making mistakes maliciously. This makes automatic systems suck at detecting it. Manual reviews are better (albeit unlikely because of the playerbase size) but Riot is still likely to ere on the side of caution because falsely banning someone for intentionally feeding is a good way to lose a customer fast (and likely more if they tell their friends).\n\nBut gameplay related bans do not get a \"slap on the wrist\". They get a 14-day ban followed by a perma if they do it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Skt T1 Deadproof","date":"2019-11-10T01:45:12.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chatting alote , get u banned sence it is considered a spam or a harrasment, at least it is recognized that way by AI.\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/IOoxkGks-kind-of-premadepeople-that-gets-you-banned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yin Yang Taoist","date":"2019-11-04T09:14:16.775+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"OP, I agree with you. Karma does work like that. I had a similar issue where an ADC kept getting angry and spam pinged me whenever I tried to harass the enemy bot lane. In this case, I'd suggest that you simply stop. If they just want to farm and try to scale instead then in order to avoid confrontation. I'd usually let things pass and have it go the way that the ADC wants it to go. Given, they are wrong about how to play the match-up. But its always better to not argue or try to correct them because most of the time, it'd lead into a meaningless discussion. \n\nHaving said that, I think that the Vayne's attitude was very disappointing. Really wrong to deal with it the way that they did. I feel for you and wouldn't be surprised if you were tilted for your next game. Its unfortunate when you get teammates like that.\n\nAnd no, they do get punished for it. Its just difficult for Riot to see if someone is being intentional. What I did was, I took screenshots. I recorded the times of when they did run it down, along with what they said. Posted these on my ticket so that it'd be easier for them to confirm and see their actions in game.\n\nYou can't always avoid players like that on your team. What you can do though is to try to adjust to them and try to work with them, as difficult as it sounds. If they are happier with me hugging the turret then by all means, I'd just do that after I put them on mute to avoid any random tilting.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2019-11-04T09:23:59.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thank you for taking the time to say that.

I like the game play, but it's really upsetting to have a game automatically lost or ruined by essentially a leaver that isn't getting punished by leaver buster.\n\nPeople who afk in fountain or on certain parts of the map.\n\nPeople who do the above specifically after a FF15 or FF20 vote failed drive me crazy the most because I've yet to see any one of my reports on people who do in this specific fashion punished. There's no point in a system for FFing requirng 4/5 or 5/5 if 2 or 3 people decide the game is over and decide to fountain afk/afk in the jungle instead of defending a 5 man mid push. I wouldn't be wasting my report score on these people if the system required a 3/5 or 2/5 to surrender. I'm not advocating that be the standard, but Riot Games should uphold their own freaking system or modify their system to cater to these people if that's what they actually support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skt T1 Deadproof","date":"2019-11-10T01:44:24.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/IOoxkGks-kind-of-premadepeople-that-gets-you-banned","replies":[]}]}
