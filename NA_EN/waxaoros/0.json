You should be able to find the option to do so within the Account option in the Store. \n\nOnce logged in and viewing the Store, there's a button on the top right which looks like a person's silhouette and a cog behind it. Once you click that, you should see the options to transfer to other regions.\n\nI hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
