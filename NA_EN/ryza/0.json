Surprise Fiddle was a community idea and was set at a permanent discount and Primetime Draven was a \"thank you\" (aka buy more skins) from Riot for making a billion dollars USD profit through esports that year.\n\nThey're both way subpar for legendary skin standards today, as Primetime Draven was on release, but it's legendary tier purely because it has new VO lines.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T19:51:59.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!

So you could say \"Does this mean it will forever be on sale?\", which the answer is yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T22:54:19.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe this particular skin goes on sale, besides the permanent discount.","replies":[{"poster":"Braum Mechanics","date":"2016-02-22T23:16:07.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.
