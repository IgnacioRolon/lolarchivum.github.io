More often than not, the game DCs for no reason, and it's a fucking mystery whenever it decides to reconnect. Last game it was long enough to punish me as an AFK. If I get hit with LeaverBuster over this shit, you can expect my account to go inactive. I'm sick of game ruining bugs persisting for MONTHS, only to get replaced with a newer, worse one when they finally get fixe. Jesus Christ, I don't understand how a company with billions in revenue from ONE product can be so awful, or successful.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-02T01:32:41.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is not an issue most players are having, either it is a problem with your computer/network, or a problem with the new patch not liking your computer/network.

I'm not getting a PC solely to play this damn game.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-11-18T21:50:59.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"0 mentions of mac, and you can run windows on a mac easily anyway.
