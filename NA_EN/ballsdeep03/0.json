I can&#039;t believe how pussified this generation is.  Why is there even a report feature? If someone gets on your nerves or hurts your feelings just simply mute them!  Why do you have to tell on them like a little cry baby?  Also why is perm ban even a thing?  If anything it should be perm ban from chat.  People spend their money, time, life on this game and then the company just perm bans if you talk trash?  Why don&#039;t they issue a refund in the money you spent how about that?  Can someone please answer my questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Skins Project","date":"2017-02-24T06:06:54.646+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Read the terms of service.\nYou agreed\nYou broke the rules\nYou got banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-02-24T06:31:08.373+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is a huge difference between trash talking and flat out harassment. We dont have your chatlogs so we can only assume, but from what ive seen on these boards people like you seem to think trash talk is using derogatory/racial slurs, or telling people to kill themselves. Trash talking/small banter is ok, but there is a limit. Plus what does spending money have to do with you breaking the rules? You do realize this is normal right. The same could be said about basically any other aspect of life. You could go to a store and break the rules. But all that money you spent doesnt change the fact that you broke the rules and it ended up you getting ban from the store. Its the same thing here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ballsdeep03","date":"2017-02-24T06:50:28.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"You guys sound like a bunch of cry babies.
