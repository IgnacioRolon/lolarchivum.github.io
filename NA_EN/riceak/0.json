The past 3 weeks my fps have been dropping from 60s to 10s and even 02 and this is a fast drop. Its really making the game really hard to play because the frames are dropping so much. I tried seeking help from the League of legends technicians but whatever they told me it did not work. I tried everything possible but its just constantly does this in game. I dont have a fast laptop and my laptop is old but this problem just started 3 weeks ago before that my fps was around 40 to 60 and that was perfectly fine for me. So if anyone have any kinda solution or could assist me with this issue will be highly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"BootySIapper","date":"2017-06-01T09:04:16.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had a problem close to this it feels like the game is almost freezing its so bad, I also have weird visual issues with the game being super blurry.

I noticed they asked you to go and try a [**clean boot**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974#wq7) as well, so let's try that too. \n\nIf neither of those steps are helping at all, go ahead and hit up those tech guys again and they can pick up where you left off! ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord of Swine","date":"2017-06-01T17:27:57.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem!
