My computer is very good, and for some reason it gets lower FPS than my crap computer. I used to get about 120 FPS on my computer, but one day it just dropped. Now the game is laggy and it is a pain to play. The ping is completely fine, around 30 ms. I need some help on what is gong on, and how to fix it. Because I don't really want to play when it's this choppy/laggy.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-31T23:20:41.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your pc might be going through some general wear and tear, and could use a tune up.
