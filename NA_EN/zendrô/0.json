Of course, Taric isn't quite Sion-level in scale, it sounds like he's going to stick closer to his current theme than Sion did to his old theme, so it's possible they might release them separately\n\nEDIT: A commenter on a reddit thread on the topic of Taric made a good point; it's likely his spells are going to be pretty different, so old VFXs, etc. probably aren't going to work for him (ie. Sion's Q. Another commenter pointed out Sion's ult with old Sion's model, which I think would be hilarious to watch XD)","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-05-04T02:22:27.848+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion's stubby little legs pounding asphalt would be pretty much the funniest thing I've seen in league.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-05-04T02:23:39.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito plz","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-05-04T15:03:46.435+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's funny cos Rito released a full-on champion spotlight for Ashe last year when they 'reworked' her Passive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kitcat300","date":"2015-05-03T23:18:19.178+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Found](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Oaj48EZJ-riotrepertoir-please-consider-this-minor-ashe-change?comment=0001) it","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-05-04T02:00:43.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CaptnJakSparrow","date":"2015-05-04T07:01:56.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrBuffington,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jOXMoxvs,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-03T23:04:39.394+0000)\n>\n> I think RiotRepertoir mentioned that they unfortunately don't have time to go through her visuals for this update; the ChampUp team is pretty swamped with reworks; the only reason they were able to even do a minor Ashe rework was because a small window opened up in their schedule.

Also, the casting time takes off the time it takes to hit, and with many mobile champions it's hard enough to try to hit the arrow as it is since it's so easy to jump out of the way. The animations are what people look at it in the game. They try to match the animation of the abilities to the model. So adding a freezing animation would show how the enemy was frozen.","replies":[{"poster":"Go0bEr L1TtLe","date":"2015-05-04T14:38:19.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you want Ashe's ult to be more attractive? that's all.

I'm not really arguing too much for Ashe animations, considering that the more animations you have the more it lags your game. It's common sense that the more animation to process is the more it takes up and all.
