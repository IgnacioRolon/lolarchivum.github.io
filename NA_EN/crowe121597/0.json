It used to be fine and it would put me in a game lobby instantly as soon as everyone accepted, now it takes about 15-20 seconds in a blind pick and everything has already bee called. The hextech and draft pick animations where super slow until a day ago i read that i should update my adobe air and flash. I did this and that problem was solved but the problem of taking to long to enter a lobby is still present. Is this an issue affecting multiple people  or is it just me and does anyone know if this is a fixable problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-03T18:42:28.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the context you've provided, I suspect this issue stems from a poor connection to the PvP.net service, which is the platform that delivers and receives your notifications in matchmaking and transitions you to the lobby. I'd recommend starting with your local network settings using our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure they're compatible with League.\n\nIf this issue persists through those changes, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
