This is all great, they all look fantastic, except for the swamp master Kennen one.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eXfZFfT.jpg\n\nThe issue is that the black in the background is supposed to be tracing his hand to represent motion, and since they took the pointer finger out it is no longer accurately tracing his hand, it just has that giant glob in front of his hand doing nothing. Personally I think that either the black in the background should be edited to fit the new form of his hand, or the pinky should be edited out, although that would require completely redrawing the hand.\n\nI like the latter option better because finishing the throw with a closed hand and nothing leading to the shuriken makes it look like the projectile was never connected to Kennen, and instead he is just awkwardly looking at it, however as it would be less of a hassle to edit the background instead I could definitely see going with that option.\n\nFor reference, here is the current one:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dCUCcuT.jpg","replies":[]}
