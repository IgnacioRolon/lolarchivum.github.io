I have seen a couple other posts about this but nothing that has been replied to. It started the day of the patch. Does anyone know a fix or is also having issues with this?\r\n\r\nI have tried repairing the client, no luck. Might uninstall and reinstall it later, see if that helps. Also been getting very small lag spikes in game, might be my own network though, and it hasn't been happening as much the last couple of games.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help and suggestions in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Xilky","date":"2017-02-28T02:45:47.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been having this same exact issue.... its a black screen for 10-30 seconds and then loads properly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-28T00:37:43.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loading slowly as in, takes a few seconds?
