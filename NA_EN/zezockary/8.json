If they do get hit by it I cant usually get in range of Q before the slow wears off so they get away.\r\n\r\nWhen I gank people I usually walk into range (or flip over a wall), throw W, miss the second hit because they walk out of it or use a movement ability, then I leave or die. I can sometimes kill them with ult if they let me walk into range for the first hit and arent under turret by the time I can cast Q because of the delay, and even then I usually die before I can AA them for the passive proc.\r\n\r\nFarming is easier making build paths broader since I dont have to rush tiamat every game,  which is helping a bit.\r\n\r\nI feel like the most useful thing I have done since the rework is sweep wards with the new duskblade XD","replies":[]}
