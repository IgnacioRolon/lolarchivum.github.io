I don&#039;t know if maybe I changed something about my builds or runes or masteries or something and don&#039;t remember or something.\r\n\r\nLike one game I got fed as lucian and feel like I did maybe 20% of a squishy&#039;s health out of a full combo with passive autos between them, then I played against him and at like level 4 he was one shotting me with the same combo.\r\n\r\nI never played against a graves, but I had a graves game where I was fed and had a similar issue. \r\n\r\nThose two games were on aram, but I don&#039;t see how that matters any. \r\n\r\nAs malzahar I could have a W out, E them, and they could sit there and tank 4 of my voidlings and take maybe 25% hp if they didn&#039;t kill them and let it hit them the full duration.\r\n\r\nIdk, I just feel like I am doing something way wrong lately.

The only Talon game in my history has a ghostblade, BF sword, two longswords, and mercury treads (I cant remember why I got the treads, but it was important).","replies":[{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-10-11T04:23:40.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"youre talking about recent history maybe.. I can only see your ranked history on this particular non-laggy site lol. \n\nIt would appear that you aren't great at farming. You seem to play jinx a lot. I wonder if you finish {{item:3031}}  or get {{item:1038}} {{item:3085}}  first because the latter is more popular and seems to help ppl out more on jinx, especially those that aren't getting a lot of gold. That's part of why a lot of jinx players do bad. They try to prioritize crits over attac speed and wave clear. \n\nAs for everything else I suspect you're just not used to ppl getting tankier builds.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Umio","date":"2016-10-11T03:28:15.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.\n\nYou need to remember that just because you play against what are assumed squishies - doesnt mean they are in every match - even against the same players.\n\nI have a few really good examples of this.\n\nEvery play against a Vigar that usually can 1 shot people because of his passive and ult?\n - Doesnt happen when you start 24 flat MR in lane against him and just continue to build MR\n - I did this as a lulu in ranked and my first item was banner of command\n\nHe had a really hard time because I would easily push him out of lane because he would exhaust all his mana trying to ruin me when I just could easily heal it back while taking very little damage\n\nSame thing applies in bot lane\n - a squishy support could take flat armor 24 and take almost not damage from autos.\n\nIf you are having a problem in your matchup - maybe try lolnexus and see what runes your targets are carrying - you may need to adjust your build to compensate on your ADC such as MortalReminder/LordDominicsRegard","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-10-11T03:52:55.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umio,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=u42XRvJR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-11T03:28:15.293+0000)\n>\n> Hi.\n> \n> You need to remember that just because you play against what are assumed squishies - doesnt mean they are in every match - even against the same players.\n> \n> I have a few really good examples of this.\n> \n> Every play against a Vigar that usually can 1 shot people because of his passive and ult?\n>  - Doesnt happen when you start 24 flat MR in lane against him and just continue to build MR\n>  - I did this as a lulu in ranked and my first item was banner of command\n> \n> He had a really hard time because I would easily push him out of lane because he would exhaust all his mana trying to ruin me when I just could easily heal it back while taking very little damage\n> \n> Same thing applies in bot lane\n>  - a squishy support could take flat armor 24 and take almost not damage from autos.\n> \n> If you are having a problem in your matchup - maybe try lolnexus and see what runes your targets are carrying - you may need to adjust your build to compensate on your ADC such as MortalReminder/LordDominicsRegard\n\nI have been doing that and I haven't noticed any weird rune sets like that.
