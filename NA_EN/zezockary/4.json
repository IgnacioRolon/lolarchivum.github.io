He doesn&#039;t look like Galio anymore. His head looks unnatural, his wings don&#039;t look like a gargoyle&#039;s anymore, and his color scheme looks horrible. He looks like a statue a demacian would make, however I would have preferred them to change his place of origin than to change him into something completely different.\r\n\r\nIf he is good for the role I will still take him mid when my team needs a tank, but I won&#039;t enjoy the character as much overall anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"BLACK REALM GOD","date":"2017-03-07T19:16:45.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if he looks like a statue that a demacian would design then he has all of the criteria to be a gargoyle. the only other things would be that he's sitting on a building and being used as a fancy gutter both of which are negated by the fact that he's magically alive. not all gargoyles look like theyre monsters. his head looks like a person wearing jarvan's crown. his color scheme reflects the demacian color scheme.\n\nbesides all of that he looks a lot like a seraphimon in my mind with a few colors swapped and modified armor pieces.\n\nhttp://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2013/092/b/5/seraphimon_by_sylvainfinrod-d6081eo.jpg\n\nalso reminds me of the lords of cinder from dark souls.\n\nhttp://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/Yhorm-the-Giant-Dark-Souls-3-700x389.jpg\n\n\nand king tryndameres crown \n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L78zEKWCMII/TJe-8WfoFOI/AAAAAAAABBM/54APjwyhexw/s1600/Tryndamere_King.jpg\n\nand maybe even a little bit of the belfry gargoyle.\n\nhttp://i.ytimg.com/vi/tW5xbfr1gQo/maxresdefault.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janna m√¨d","date":"2017-03-07T19:08:03.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What could be nice is a traditional skin but riot doesn't make that anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonasaurous","date":"2017-03-07T16:51:16.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He looks like some Dwarven Centurion from Elder Scrolls now, rather than a gargoyle. *sigh*","replies":[]}]}
