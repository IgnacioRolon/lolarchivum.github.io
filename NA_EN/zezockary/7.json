I have tried resetting my key bindings in game, which made it so left click no longer does attack move but did not change anything else back. I then deleted the input.ini file, which did nothing for me. Then I ran a repair and that did not work either.\r\n\r\nThen I tried making a new input.ini and putting that info back into it and then changing everything back to the default, which oddly also did not fix the issue, so now here I am.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know a fix for my issue? Thank you in advance for the help! ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Rkoturdo Ndo","date":"2015-10-05T13:13:02.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya\nDelete the input.ini and the .json file in the same folder.
