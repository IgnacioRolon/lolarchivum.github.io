I cannot possibly type anything to anyone. I can't listen to them, I can only ping and listen to their ping. \r\n\r\nWhat have I learned with this new account: IT IS DEFINITELY EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS TOXIC, NOT ME. I AM BANNED ONLY FOR DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST THESE TOXIC SUMBAGS. RIOT DEFINITELY IS PUNISHING THE REAL PLAYERS AND LEAVING THE TROLLS ALONE. \r\n\r\nAll my bans have been to retaliate against the game destroying toxic players that I get matched with every game. I'm never the instigator. I'm always the retaliator who gets stepped on and then punished for sticking up for himself. \r\n\r\nDo you want proof? Almost every single one of my games is destroyed by some scumbag who will go out of his way to get under my skin. The biggest enemies in all of my games are not the enemy team, it's my allies. I get players almost every game who will:\r\n\r\n- harass me with pings\r\n- rage feed if I do something they don't like, such as not gank their lane enough, or pick a champion they don't like, etc\r\n- follow me around the entire jungle, camp after camp, trying to last hit monsters that I fight\r\n- back off and let me die in every single team fight without helping at all\r\n- farm minions during every single dragon/baron/rift\r\n\r\nI am not exaggerating when I say this happens almost every game. I maybe get 2 good games out of every 10. And need I remind you I CANNOT TYPE ANYTHING TO THESE PEOPLE. MY CHAT IS OFF.\r\n\r\nI report these horrible ass holes and nothing happens. Sometimes I get the same troll on my team again the very next game. No punishments. No instant feedback thanking me for the reports. Nothing. All my reports get sent to the trashcan under the excuse that \"they were just having a bad game\" blah blah blah. \r\n\r\nRiot, your report system is total garbage. It actually promotes toxicity instead of reduces it. It punishes the real players such as myself who just want to have a good game and get frustrated at the game destroying trash out there. You need to turn this system on its head. Start punishing the real trolls and leave the good players alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2019-12-31T14:31:42.948+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **So I made a new account after about 50 banned to see if it was really me who is toxic**\n>\n> So I made a new account (not this one) after about 50 banned to see if it was really me who is toxic and deserving of constant bans...\n>\n> IT IS DEFINITELY EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS TOXIC, NOT ME.\n\nHas it not occurred to you that there's a fair probability that it's _both_? It's not a mutually exclusive \"either me or them\" kind of thing. Both _can_ be, and plainly, _are_ toxic. The fact that you've gotten _**50**_ accounts permanently banned kind of ensures that it's not even up for discussion as to whether or not you're toxic, even moreso the fact that in this very post, you continue to deflect blame for your actions onto other people.\n\n> I AM BANNED ONLY FOR DEFENDING MYSELF AGAINST THESE TOXIC SUMBAGS(sic).\n\nAs Modi pointed out, you're not defending yourself. You're retaliating. If you _were_ defending yourself, you most certainly would not have been banned fifty-some odd times over.\n\n> All my bans have been to retaliate...\n>\n> I'm always the retaliator...\n\n_You even use the term \"retaliate\" and \"retaliator\" yourself. You **know** you're not defending yourself._\n\n> Do you want proof? Almost every single one of my games is destroyed by some scumbag who will go out of his way to get under my skin.\n\nSadly, I can't view your match history from your Boards Profile, so all I can do is doubt the veracity of your claims. It's incredibly unlikely for you to have players like that in virtually _every single game_.\n\n> ...and leave the good players alone.\n\n\"Good players\" would follow the rules and not retaliate, no matter how frustrated they get.\n\nAnd they most certainly would not continue to act like they should be allowed to retaliate even after roughly **_200_** times of being told \"_no, you don't get to do that._\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"GDIvsNOD","date":"2019-12-31T10:18:34.159+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DontPhuckWithMe,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=u74VyVHs,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-12-31T07:37:31.535+0000)\n>\n> All my bans have been to retaliate against the game destroying toxic players that I get matched with every game.

Riot doesn't care who started it because that's not the only thing that matters. For you to have gotten banned 50 times (which means way more than 50 offenses) means you must have been spending a lot of time arguing back. You are the one and only constant in your games, and likewise you are the only one ultimately responsible for your own actions. You can not control others, nor will you be punished for others doing things. You may be punished if you spend a lot of time doing things back, though. You are supposed to ignore it, report it, and move on.\n\nIf your reaction is \"well, Riot isn't doing anything\", then you need to ask yourself this as a follow up; IF Riot isn't doing anything anyway, then what does arguing with someone time and again, further upsetting myself in the moment, AND possibly getting banned, going to accomplish? It's legit healthier for your own sake to just brush it off (if it's legit toxicity, that is), and If the other person's actions/words are bannable, then they should be without your involvement, no?\n\nThis \"Riot isn't doing anything\" thing makes no sense anyway. I'm not saying Riot DOES do a certain thing, but I'm saying it makes no sense to point that as reason for vigilantism because even if they aren't anyway, then what does arguing back attempt to accomplish? Sounds like it further upsets you, to be honest. For your own sake, I hope you get past this because the game is a lot funner without feeling like arguing with people all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2019-12-31T07:49:07.185+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"well yea, it's low level play.

You used both terms in different places saying thats all you do. Well, which is it? Cuz self defense is perfectly fine. Retaliation, done in a manner that breaks the rules (insulting, trolling) is not fine. They will punish for that, and why wouldnt they? Theres no reason to add a stipulation in the rules that once someone offends you, you are allowed to retaliate and offend them back. That would be fucking r%%%%%ed... come on man. Can you imagine the arguements that would cause? How \"but they told me to x and that was offensive so i told him to y\" arguements would pop up all the damn time? People just using the excuse that \"they offended me first\" even though maybe all they said was \"hey build x cuz your damage is garbage\" but that person took it as an insult? It would be utter chaos. Just exhausting arguements over levels of offense and whether insulting someone was justified or not. Fuck that.

Or throw in the times at which they did w/e they did so its easier to look them up. Honestly, even submitting a ticket doesn't always work.

THE. TIME.\n\nAlright, so I wasn't there when the Tribunal was replaced. But from what I read, you had the Tribunal replaced because it took months for things to get resolved. People would get punished for stuff happening 5-6 months back. And sometimes, people would troll the Tribunal verdict. Of-course, this probably happened after I quit. Which was about Season 4 end. While I was around. There were trolls but it was fine for the most part. Personally, I can say that I'd only punish the person starting it and never the guy defending himself so long as he wasn't toxic. So that's what I mean by not punishing the retaliating party.\n\nAnd that was the popular mindset. If you aren't toxic then you won't be punished. This is why returning players keep wondering on _how_ they are being punished by the current system. That said, if things deteriorated to the point that everyone was trolling the Tribunal then that probably happened later. I gotta add that allowing everyone to be a part of the Tribunal was the most stupid thing to _do_. Its like allowing everyone to be a forum moderator. Can you imagine what would happen if they did that? And, notwithstanding that. You have the age limit set to 13+ to play the game. Then you begin having 13+ year olds access these reports. Not to take into account the immature trolls. Things aren't going to continue looking bright there! So I am not surprised that -\n\n>bc the tribunal would vote to punish BOTH arguing parties ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nIt got to that point eventually. {{sticker:sg-lulu}} \n\nRegardless of how it was, the Tribunal gave leeway to the defending party so long as they weren't too far out of bounds. This was the popular consensus. Nobody who was judging Tribunal reports would come outright and say that we should be punishing both parties or randomly clicking on who should be punished. Because if they were doing that then they were just messing around. \n\nThe current system has no tolerance for any type of defense. Because, literally anything can be deemed as being negative. And trust me, someone listening to crap is not exactly going to be happy about it and start giving out positive vibes unless they are a masochist. Which is why I said that -\n\n> retaliation was okay with the tribunal.
