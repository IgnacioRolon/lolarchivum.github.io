I feel like in most of my games i play decent and assumed for a while that it was just due to bad luck and my team mates that i was unable to climb, however after reading many threads similar to this i noticed that it is easy to blame your team mates for losing games and therefore tried to focus more on what i could do to improve myself instead of putting my failure down to others. Having said that though nearly every game i have relatively good kda, put down more wards than most if not all the other players in the game and cs well if i am playing any role other than support, etc. Because of this i have no idea why i cannot get out of bronze so i was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to maybe have a look at my match history or something and see if they could point out anything i should work on, TIA.","replies":[]}
