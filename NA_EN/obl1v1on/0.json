Following this the client refused to open the game even after relaunching the Alpha client. Also though I cannot see or participate in the match I can still hear what is happening. Along wit this there is no reconnect option is this not included yet or is my client just bugged to the extreme? Please let me know if any of you have encountered this problem. Thanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot a huevo","date":"2016-07-22T00:28:00.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should be a reconnect screen if your game crashed.
