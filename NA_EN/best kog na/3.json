She sent a ticket into player support and player support gave her her account back. However, I got a message from her today that the hacker got control of the account again. How you ask? By going through Player Support and convincing the Rioters on the other side to give the hacker her account. Is there anything any Rioter can do so she can \r\nA: Get her account back.\r\nB: Do something like disable any and all future attempts to recover the account so the hacker can't get access to it.\r\n\r\nAt least please do something so the person can't play on the account please. It really hurts to see the account being abused by somebody else.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-15T22:58:36.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since our communications inside tickets aren't public, I'm not sure how your friend would have knowledge about a potential compromiser's interactions with support to get the account back. Regardless, your friend will need to write in another ticket so we can look into this, feel free to have to reference this post for context.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Kog NA","date":"2016-11-16T05:06:22.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well her account email changed A: Without her getting any confirmation email, and B: She didn't get a text that somebody logged into her email account. Also the player support person replied to her saying that they can't confirm that she is the owner of her account. And also if (hopefully when) she gets her account back is there anything that can be done to disable any future attempts to recover the account through player support?","replies":[]}]}]}
