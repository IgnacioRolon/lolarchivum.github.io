Tried restarting my router / PC. using different internet and VPN. And nothing seemed to help the situation. It seems as if the connection to the league servers is blocked and i dont know how to fix it. I actually have the same problem with discord, my better discord doesnt launch and in the log file i get hash error, which basically is caused by my network failing to connect to github. I think its same cause that causes me to not be able to connect to league, but I cant get around to fix it. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know a fix for this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T21:42:58.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might actually be an issue where the update didn't install correctly the first time.
