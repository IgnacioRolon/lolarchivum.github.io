So, the thing, which I want to ask you is-why Evelynn&#039;s E has not been reverted to be magical since DFG is gone or the ultimate&#039;s biggest nerf (from max health to current health)? In my opinion at least one of them should have been brought back to her power. Sadly, Evelynn&#039;s player base have not been given an answer, even if we have made a lot of threads about this topic.

She is a sneaky assassin, and yet your latest change to her pushed her even further away from that, toward a tank initiator even more. \nI feel betrayed, since the stealth rework that took almost 3 years was supposed to move her to a healthy stealth assassin play style.

But I could see a slight boost to her clear speed in the jungle, since jungle monsters don't have MR. (Save for Dragon and baron) That said, It could hurt her early ganks since champions will have More MR early. \n\nSo it might shuffle around her early power a little while allowing her to be a better assassin late game.

If you change her E it will break her and you will have to nerf her again (just like you guys did when Runeglaive came out).\n\nNo thanks. Just leave her alone.\n\nAs a side-note, if you want to increase the amount of magic damage you do (making pen more effective) you can build a Nashor's Tooth like I do, since her E applies it twice. If you changed E back to magic you would likely have to remove the on-hit part of the skill and change it back to a \"spell effect\", which would make nashors useless on her and also make it harder to proc spellblade (which is now conveniently mandatory if you go AP, since it is part of your jungle item). It would also ruin a lot of current AD Eve builds (which rely on on-hits such as bork and still usually include a sheen item such as triforce or IBG). Liandrys/Rylais/tank is a common build right now, and this is probably the build that would cause her to get nerfed if E was magic again (so people who think it would make assassin Eve stronger are wrong; it would make assassin Eve pretty strong, for a patch, but then rylais/liandrys/tank Eve would cause Eve to get nerfed the next patch, making assassin Eve weaker at that point than she is right now as of 5.15).\n\ntl;dr leave her alone, she's fine, and I don't want her to be \"buffed\" only to have her nerfed even harder the patch afterwards. Assassin Eve works right now, you just have to build properly and sacrifice a couple utility items if you want your damage. Don't punish the people who make assassin Eve work right now by actually thinking through their builds just because SOME people lack the capacity to come up with viable builds with her current kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-08-14T04:26:46.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While mixed damage precludes building penetration, it does make your champion harder to itemize against.
