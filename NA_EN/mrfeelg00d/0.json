You put a language filter in a game, and then people literally have to watch what they say bc if they let something slip and upset the wrong people they can just get reported and your automated system will scan the chat, see the word(s), and ban them?

We claim to want to provide a nice and happy community, one that is welcoming, but we have people getting banned because they suck? Makes sense.

Literally had a dude thank me for helping him not tilt last night...and now I'm perm banned because A) My little shit of a brother got on my accnt, and B) I was having a bad week and tilted a little bit?

If he does so respectfully and is punished? No. But if he starts shouting and insulting THEIR family, he's nearly as bad. Remember -- it isn't \"self defense\" or \"defending someone else\" if the attack can be negated by something as simple as the mute button.\n\n> I wasn&#x27;t just talking about chat stuff, btw...You don&#x27;t see the posts where people just suck at this game and get banned for int feeding?\n\nIn most of those cases I have to acknowledge that I do not have access to the entire game's data, while Riot does.

The latter, however, is not. I don't mean that as a personal attack, but I know for a fact that several of my good friends (and great guys/gals ass) are completes ASSHOLE in *League*, to the point where I've had to shout at them over voice chat to stop typing. They're legitimately thoughtful, friendly, welcoming people -- but sometimes they just snap in very toxic ways.\n\nIn short, you can be a great person but a toxic player at the same time if you're bad at controlling your temper, and/or you default to certain types of language when annoyed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MrFeelg00d","date":"2017-07-25T01:50:18.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LmUoMPb3,comment-id=00040004000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-24T23:40:12.701+0000)\n>\n> Personal experience having participated in the Tribunal on a not-infrequent basis, and having seen first-hand the community opinion on cases.\n> \n> Also further experience in the *League* community in general over the years, and on the Player Behavior boards in general, and on the recent &quot;The Verdict&quot; threads that are, effectively, recreations of the Tribunal.\n\nHey Djinn, I went over to that thread, and it actually specifies that the purpose of that thread is for discussion and they won't actually be looking any deeper in to it, ie. to reverse any of the restrictions/bans?\n\nI started to get excited, at first, because I saw them mentioning reading FULL chat logs, like of the games before/after/etc so that they can actually get a good idea of who the person is, as a whole, instead of one little instance where they got triggered.\n\nAny insight?","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-07-25T01:53:46.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrFeelg00d,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=LmUoMPb3,comment-id=000400040000000000000001,timestamp=2017-07-25T01:50:18.867+0000)\n>\n> Hey Djinn, I went over to that thread, and it actually specifies that the purpose of that thread is for discussion and they won&#x27;t actually be looking any deeper in to it, ie. to reverse any of the restrictions/bans\n\nCorrect.
