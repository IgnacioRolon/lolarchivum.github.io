I'd really like a pbe account since I want to try out new champs and skins, but I can't do that if there isn't even a sign up page. I don't want to pay 15-30 euro for a pbe account on sites (is it even legit/worth the money?) \r\n\r\nAnyway let's make it clear to riot that we want the sign up page back for the pbe.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-08T21:39:47.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any updates on the PBE just yet, but our devs have updated the [PBE status page](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) regarding its maintenance.
