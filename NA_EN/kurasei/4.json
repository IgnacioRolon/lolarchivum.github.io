But then again, I was just looking at past board posts. I don’t imagine I’d find much positive feedback on here, lol.\n\n\nTo add to the issue though, aren’t we already seeing 56 minute pro games because they can’t end? I don’t watch much, but I recall seeing some posts on the topic. I mean it’d probably be fine to bring them back if that’s the case since they weren’t great to begin with. I do remember we used to call them “tickle beams” since they were all but worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"KuraSei","date":"2018-02-06T23:52:35.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I mentioned they would totally need their damage buffed if brought back.

First team to drop an inhibitor has roughly a 92% chance of winning from what I read. https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/win-stats .  IDK how accurate that is though. \n\nEither way, you buff the Nexus towers and I feel like you're just delaying the inevitable. At that point you've probably lost all map control, are pretty far behind, and generally doomed. But then again, maybe its a good change that won't affect high elo and helps out lower elo?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-02-06T20:45:55.284+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"it made it harder to farm under tower and didn't significantly add damage to enemy champs, which made the whole thing pointless","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2018-02-06T21:31:25.316+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, but laser towers slowed and reduced the damage of what they were targeting.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadUnborn","date":"2018-02-07T02:40:12.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a regular turret can do that as well if need be, no need for lasers.
