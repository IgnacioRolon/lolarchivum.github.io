I could be just be in lane phase at level 1 or it was during massive team fights!!! It was soooo painful. It would last anywhere from 1 second to 10-15 seconds where I couldn't even move... I thought at times I DC'd because during the long FPS drops myself and the enemy/team/minions were just walking around in circles or doing random glitchy movements. I knew my rig could handle LoL during the worst AOE team fights but couldn't figure it out... \r\n\r\nWell friends I did a little research and found the solution!\r\n\r\nIf you're having this issue, and more specifically, having an ERROR prompt during computer restart/startup (like I was) then it could possibly be a league of legends installer/updater that runs during your computers start up process. I looked in my tast manager (windows 10) and went to the startup tab. In this tab I found a LoL app running on startup which said the following:\r\n\r\n\"This installer database contains the logic and data required to install League of Legends\" \r\n\r\nI simply disabled this and have improved performance. Now I don't know why this was running or is even programmed to run during startup but this fixed me issue and I hope it fixes any problems you all might be having. \r\n\r\nGood luck Summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"alaskaneagle","date":"2017-09-18T22:34:17.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"54367\n\nI'll have to check mine too.  I was having weird lag spikes like that for a couple games today, and I have an amazing comp and great internet.  Though every once in a while lol is just bad.  The most OP thing in the game is rito's packet loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-17T21:09:31.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straaaaange.....I'm curious as to if you've stumbled across some new malware or something similar. I've talked to our tech guys a little more to confirm that League doesn't have any kind of startup processes normally unless you have some special setup on your pc, so I'm a little concerned as to what might be going on there. \n\nGrab a screenshot if you can so I can share it with the tech guys here, then we can see what's going on there.","replies":[{"poster":"HavenKai","date":"2017-09-18T01:26:06.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[img]https://i.imgur.com/582zmNw.jpg[/img]\n\nDon't think it's malware...

Confirmed League does not have any startup processes, especially involving the installer, so that process isn't an actual League process. It's most likely some type of virus or malware. You should be okay with it disabled, but I'd really suggest running some malware scanning software of your choice, something like MalwareBytes should do!","replies":[{"poster":"HavenKai","date":"2017-09-18T22:10:50.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=thkjyHsn,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-18T01:55:34.653+0000)\n>\n> Mmmmmm yea that&#x27;s not supposed to happen.

Apparently I'm not the only one having this issue with the application running on start up or having particular issues with the app file name. Kinda weird. Maybe something to look further into if possible :O","replies":[]},{"poster":"HavenKai","date":"2017-09-18T02:23:14.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=thkjyHsn,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-09-18T01:55:34.653+0000)\n>\n> Mmmmmm yea that&#x27;s not supposed to happen.
