You can contact support and ask them to review the situation and provided there wasn't anything else in your behavior that would get you in trouble with the system it's a pretty good chance that they'll reduce/remove the punishment.\n\nAs a heads up though, you don't need to get other people to report someone for what they did. It literally doesn't help and, as you found out, you can end up tripping the system yourself if you quote rule-breaking stuff or if you disrupt the game by spending a lot time accusing others.\n\nAll you need to do is report them. A single report is all it takes for the system to look over the behavior and additional reports doesn't make it any more likely that their behavior will/will not be spotted.","replies":[{"poster":"sticknstone1","date":"2020-01-16T04:02:13.161+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you , I will be submitting a ticket when I can.

It's no different than being out in public and getting purposefully talked down to...\nNo different than being in an office environment where you have to put up with managers that don't know what they're doing. They cash in on your expertise, and you're the one liable when things get messed up. Life isn't fair and nor is the game environment. In either case there's always a limit of what one will put up with. \n\nThe parallel here, and more to the OP's point, is that the ban system has no logic behind it except pure number of reports behind it. At least at the level of bans that I've been exposed to since starting this account.\n\nI can't count the times that all I did was turn the verbal harrassment from a teammate onto its head to see how they like it. They never did find it funny when they're on the receiving end.\n\nSo why should the OP take it from the trolls when they treat him one way or the other? Are we really to expect that the gaming environment should be treated like an open sewage?\n\nFYI, the sewage reference doesn't necessarily refer to the verbal cacophony that exists in game chat (for which many people get banned when tilted). Lower ELO is an open sewage even with respect to gameplay. Astronomical increase in griefers, feeders, inter's and the latest brand of people that I got exposed to \"Reverse ban reporters\". \n\nIn the end, there are 5 players on your team per game. If 3 of them collude, they can crush your winning chance as well as the account via majority ban report. \n\nThere could have been many other games for me to get banned for if it was just negative attitude/verbal cacophonies. But the one that was chosen and put on my \"report card\" from the ban bot  was the one where i feel 100% justified to loose my temper. \n\nAnyway, sorry about the rant, but I don't believe that in situations described by the OP, we should take it up the wazoo from players with no scrupules...\n\nThe fact that there are those that openly admit to having 2000 reports to their name but no bans, and don't get reprimanded, but then there's cases like the OP where he is verbally abused and stands up for himself and he gets banned... with no personal disrespect to devs and moderators, this is open sewage mentality.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-16T07:39:07.538+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MeNoPlayMuch,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IvA2KyB5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2020-01-16T07:32:37.516+0000)\n>\n> the ban system has no logic behind it except pure number of reports behind it.\n\nThat is incorrect.","replies":[{"poster":"MeNoPlayMuch","date":"2020-01-16T08:11:21.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"I give up trying to argue with people. \n\nAll I can say is read the report that the game serves the player for a temporary ban.  \n\nMaybe dev's and dev team gets involved with the permabans. But the temporary bans have this built in to the ban reply from the developer bot itself... \n\nWhen it says \" you're banned of 14 days, for being reported X amount of times for y reason\" it's fundamentally a counter limit. \n\nWe can argue in the forums all we want, but unless we see the source code for the game, we'll never see eye to eye. \n\nAll I can say is that, regardless of my play style and quality of game play(consistency), I've done nothing different over the last 6 to 12 months? That includes my more than occasional verbal cacophony in game. \n\nSo you tell me why I got banned now, when game skill/verbal arguments/playtime and player reporting was consistent. \n\nSimple and only reason I can think of is the mathematical entropy behind the temp ban system. (basically, the gravity of the language used is irrelevant, but the amount of times you get reported in a fixed period of time is not. The higher the report count in a short time period, the exponentially higher chance of getting banned. It makes sense as far as getting people to take a forced time out. But it makes NO sense, when the case on the report is one that you could argue fair and square... That's why I keep saying that the temp ban system is illogical. Dev's don't directly deal with it, and whatever idea forum guru's come up with ignores the fact that we are essentially getting temp bans from a BOT. Which is a computer program. Which by definition takes an action based on conditional statements, which can be of a few types: if statement, else statement, if/else and for loop.  Basics of programming...\n\nRobotic logic/BOTS do not react unless they count something. And if it's the expletives or cacophonies that I've used in game then the timing of the ban is completely illogical. The text dump on the BOT generated ban report had a total of 1 expletive word in the entire \"proof\" of my misbehaviour. Now, I don't know about you, but getting banned for using \"fk\" instead of full blown arguments that HAVE happened, with colorfoul language on both sides to color the rainbow, makes no sense to me. \n\n6-12 months I've had:\n- same average number of games\n- same temper\n- same verbiage\n- and due to my long tenure in ELO hell, same level of teammates for the entire duration of the occasional LOL play\n\nOther companies like Blizzard make use of the same entropy based system. And whats more, they sometimes use it to make rulings for perma bans and perma account lockouts. The \"strike\" based system.\n\nTry this out on a dummy account if you want. See how many temp bans you can get before the dev's take notice of you and perma ban. And guess who flags you for the dev's? (THE BOT). Guess what it's based on...","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-16T18:07:11.336+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MeNoPlayMuch,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=IvA2KyB5,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-16T08:11:21.768+0000)\n>\n> When it says \" you're banned of 14 days, for being reported X amount of times for y reason\"\n\nIt doesn't do that. It says that you were punished for inappropriate chat, inting, or other actual reasons.
