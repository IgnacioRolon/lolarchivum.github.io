I am unable to reconnect at all since the bug splat just reappears. \r\nThe only way I was able to resolve this issue was to reconnect my laptop to my computer monitor (the issue when I decided to play on my regular laptop screen-- a rare occasion).\r\n\r\nI am going away for a few weeks, so I will be unable to bring my monitor with me. \r\nDoes anyone know why there seems to be an issue with my client  when I am not connected to my monitor?\r\n\r\nAnything will help!\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Evelectra","date":"2016-12-17T05:14:09.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think it is any bad game files?
