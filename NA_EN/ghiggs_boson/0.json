It feels like it lags or jumps randomly or doesn't respond to movements.  I've looked up and read a bunch of other threads complaining about similar issues but nothing seems to have helped. The mouse movement lags noticeably more often if i'm holding a key down or holding and dragging w/ right click. \r\n\r\nMouse is a Razer deathadder 2013","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-29T00:33:26.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes these sorts of issues are tied to the application that comes with the mouse.

I changed the mouse with a Hama uRage Reaper without installing any software but it remains the same. I also notice that at the beginning of every patch, it fixes itself just for a game or two, but then it bugs again. I repeat again, this happens only in LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghiggs Boson","date":"2016-12-01T04:25:29.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems to have fixed it, although I assume changing keybinds or DPI on my mouse is impossible now :|","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-01T23:38:13.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DPI, and bindings, yes, but you can at least adjust your mouse sensitivity in-game. I'm glad we were able to pinpoint this issue's cause, I just hope that Razer sorts out the Synapse issues that have been going around. =/\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghiggs Boson","date":"2016-12-09T21:01:03.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So after further testing, It's definitely less frequent, but i'm still getting a sense of something grabbing my mouse on occasion. It feels most frequent during large teamfights where i'm likely experiencing FPS drops.  Uncapped i run 150~ FPS but it fluctuates regularly so I have it capped on 60.  Even then in most teamfights It'll drop to something near 30.  Oddly enough being around reksai tunnels almost guarantees a large FPS drop below the 60.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-11T21:54:42.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Issues with FPS are caused by different factors entirely, so there are still steps we can take in order to resolve those. Most FPS issues are caused by display driver or windows power issues, which are covered in our [**FPS Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting), so I recommend working through it.\n\nLet me know if those steps helped in any noticeable way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
