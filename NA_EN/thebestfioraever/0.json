To stop this, you could make it so you cannot dodge after everyone has locked in their pick, or maybe even after FP is locked. Or you could just make it so that dodging 2 times in a row will give you a loss instead of just one dodge = 1 loss.

No one is going to say it's not even worse during promos. However, those occurrences compared to the occurrences of people who would dodge to avoid an unwanted role, a bad matchup, or just a generally weaker team compared to the enemy team are rare. On average, people being assholes in your games is going to even out; you'll get games where the assholes are on your team and where they're on the enemy team. Being allowed to dodge would, I suppose, yield the same result, but with an extremely increased wait time to actually get into a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cavesloth","date":"2017-10-22T01:47:11.571+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because there is no point in dodging in your promos,  matchmaking WILL fuck you over every single promo game.
