Why is he just now seeing LCS play? As a long time Viktor main, I have understood his potential before and after the rework as a strong mid range burst mage. I have always been confused why he isn't more popular. \n\nSo why is he suddenly viable?","replies":[{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-03-09T02:45:44.726+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Koreans have picked him up.\n\nBut really, he can zone assassins, with his gravity field. Clear waves easily with E.

Said pro then noticed Viktor actually not being too bad, and proceeded to play him in scrims and training matches. Said pro saw good success with him, particularily in some popular comps, and picked him in actual games.\n\nSaid pro might have been Kur0 of GE Tigers (the first Viktor in recent times, iIrc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kingsgrave","date":"2015-03-09T06:53:40.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He does a fuckton of damage in 2 abilities and hard counters anything that tries to engage on him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skia Asteri","date":"2015-03-09T03:07:15.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone figured out that rushing {{item:3100}} as the first item on him was bad and that his kit had uses in and against certain team comps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stonington","date":"2015-03-09T03:01:26.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People just figured out he can be strong.
