Maybe take the dark designs and lace in some of the blue Shen currently wears in spots that'd tone down the sinister look while still being awesome and ninja-like.

Shen could be given a very conservative ninja outfit with a ghostly armor around him, signifying that he is under supernatural protection.\n\n(Technically, though, the stereotypical ninja outfit is wrong. it's the outfits used by stage actors who are meant to be seen as invisible while they move around the background scenery in a play. There were plays in which characters were supposed to be assassinated by surprise, and the playwright chose to have this done by one of those background characters, which led to the trope - Ninjas in real life were indistinguishable from average ordinary people)\n\nShen, being the noble protector that he is, would choose to protect his friends with his ghostly armor, even if it put himself in danger. \n\nThat right there is just a half-assed attempt to explain his mechanics and his look. It seems like it would work just fine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pastramka","date":"2015-03-21T16:00:28.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed's head suits him so good on that splash!","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Superb Villain","date":"2015-03-21T14:48:50.964+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor guy could use one.
