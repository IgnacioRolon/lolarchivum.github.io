I was in a game where someone admitted to using replay.gg by titling one of his mastery pages and recording the game? I may be wrong about how he did it, but he got me curious as to this app(?) being used. He says that Kshaway uses it all the time. Idk, just wondering.","replies":[{"poster":"jpguy902","date":"2016-07-04T18:52:16.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all third party software is bannable though. \n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5dmkJinG-3rd-party-applicationsmodifications-whats-allowed-and-what-isnt\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Wuks,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=5dmkJinG,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-24T21:37:23.168+0000)\n>\n> \n> replay.gg\n> \n> Because these softwares and services utilize documented features within the Riot API and the spectator stream and they don't interfere with in-game experiences, replay software and services are allowed under the Terms of Use at this time. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-07-04T19:18:33.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dam you beat me to it while I was searching for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-07-04T19:37:56.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"99% positive replay.gg is okay.
