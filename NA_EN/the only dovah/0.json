A setting on your OS or network is preventing the patcher from connecting to the server.   I suggest going over our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to get this fixed up.  More specifically, you can use our [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) to automatically configure your firewall settings to establish a connection.
