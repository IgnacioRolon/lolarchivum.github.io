But I got it when she said \"I was born in Piltover\" while how she was talking about his home country for entire story.\n\nShe also said I would be dead if I was in my home country, which I expected Shurima, Bilgewater or Noxus. I did not assume an agent though. I feel stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-12-02T17:22:17.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought they were going to put her in some new or unnamed country.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thorgram","date":"2016-12-02T09:20:30.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=iO34TE7T,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-02T06:38:20.937+0000)\n>\n> Progress Day was written by the mighty Graham &quot;Dinopawz&quot; McNeill!

Well, considering the kinda grim approach to Piltover and the Commissar Caitlyn i should've guess it was him D:\n\nAre there ant plans to credit the authors directly ? I can feel why it's not the case, but i think the response would be majorly positive and could spark some interesting discussion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thorgram","date":"2016-12-02T11:04:06.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And by the way, Jaredan, is there an ETA for the rest of the story ?\n\nCan we expect it on a weekly basis ?
