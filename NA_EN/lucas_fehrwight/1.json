In all honesty, mana changes are not morg&#039;s fault but the mana regen rune (which got nerfed?). Also, the rune is supposed to help mana regen. Why is my champ getting nerfed if your rune doesn&#039;t work the way you want it to?\r\n\r\n2. Riot changes her passive. It not working on minions is the biggest load of BS i&#039;ve seen. ADCs have way more lifesteal and suffer the same issue of lifesteal any damage they take, making for a boring lane. (More ADC bias) And then you nerf the new passive. Why not just revert the passive? Also, the nerf is stupid because it is nerfed in the one part of the game where it is supposed to be strong. Again, you are nerfing my champ for your own change is not working the way you want it to.\r\n\r\n3. In all my Morg games. No one has ever complained about mana regen or spell vamp on Morg. Its mostly her Q and black shield. A few also complained about her w proc&#039;ing rylais. Even smaller complain about how much money she gets from blue supp item ($$$).\r\n\r\n4. Morg is mostly played support. All these changes were targeted towards mid morg. There is so many more problems but you target one of the smallest playerbases. Not really a good use of resources.","replies":[{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2017-12-11T04:29:18.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">no spell vamp on minions, maybe more spell vamp on other stuff\n\nShe has no spell vamp period.

She is just a little bit out of line with 52% wr and 3% playrate. Not *gamebreaking* numbers but it's obvious from these changes that Riot doesn't want Morg to be taken mid over support so these changes are to enforce that.\nYou can disagree, but at least you know *why*","replies":[{"poster":"Attticus Finch","date":"2017-12-11T04:28:03.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's had a 50+% win rate mid since literally s5 at the very least, though. Your theory has holes in it.\n\nIt seems more likely that Riot just wanted more runic echo jungles and Morg (and Zyra) are both mages with DoT aoe that makes clearing possible.\n\nAnd in Morg's case, since shes due for a rework anyway if they mess up her kit they can just dumpster her, shit on her player base for a little while and then wipe the slate clean with the rework.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boulderox","date":"2017-12-11T03:49:11.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the changes were a point for sake of clarity. Spellvamp was a thing in the past that many champions had phased out due to how difficult it was to balance on certain champs COUGH {{champion:8}} {{champion:84}}... and is one of the remaining instances that needed to go.\n\nMid morgana is also a thing and was pretty powerful and a pain to deal with, thus they changed things around to balancer her lane presence in mid...\n\nHowever as a side effect, jungle morgana is now a thing that is very strong due to her Soil mechanic working on large jungle mobs, resulting in very strong clears and consistant damage with how the CD works with it. And having insane ganks pre 6 and post 6, the roaming morg support nightmare all game, and she builds damage too with the build.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Existential Bard","date":"2017-12-11T03:37:47.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The changes were targeted ataling jungle Morgana viable","replies":[]}]}
