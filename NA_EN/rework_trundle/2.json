Emergencies does happen, ofc., I have also left a game for \"too long\" because I had to, but never due to something merely unexpected.\nAny random guest can come it, sit down and shut up until the match is over. It's not just a game; it's a commitment made when queueing up with other people in the first place.\n\n>And another thing that can happen are things beyond your control like a power break, a bug with rito's client, your wifi dying etc. Which will cause you to dodge. \n\nBlackouts doesn't concern me. I got a UPS on my PC and monitor, and another UPS on every piece of networking equipment.\nI got 5 minutes on battery by default, but can increase to ~17 minutes if necessary - any longer, and the power would be out for hours anyway, and in those cases I would already have received a notification prior to it as it 9 out of 10 times would be scheduled maintenance.\nExceptions would be by bad weather, and I know better than to make online commitments if I KNOW the power may disappear at any time.\n\nGot fully cabled network, so the WiFi is not in use. Router restarts may happen (though I'll blame the game for that - LoL is the only game I have ever encountered which kills internet connections), but my router does that automatically (as it's not some ISP-issued trash).\n\nIf my network card or harddrive or any other component decides to spontaneously combust, I will switch to my laptop and can be back ingame in ~5-7 minutes.\nExceptions be if the oh-so new and glorious client decides to go wonky, I'll give you that. It's no less spaghetti coded than the old one.\n\nAlso, most of this are technical stuff than would happen _when already ingame_ (except the client bugs). You don't just \"dodge\" because your WiFi dies. The server still has you listed as connected to a game (why else do you think you got the reconnect option?), and any temporary leaves is taken care of by the leaverbuster system anyway.\n\nIn all of my 6648 ARAM matches, I have dodged precisely 0 of them by own will.\n\n-----------------\n\nAll this said, as I pointed out in the post above, it was more of a rant than anything else. Yes, I'd like to see what only a monthly free leaver card would do, but a weekly one is likely more realistic. \nAfter all, we do want there to be people left to queue up with, right? ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2017-07-21T09:11:28.053+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"as i've mentioned before. \nYou want everyone to be kind and respectful.\nWhile your desire, your demands and your requirements are by far admirable.\nThey are also not in concord with reality of the human nature.\n\nFew humans will just \"suck it up\", and do something they don't enjoy, especially in a game.\n\n>Poor planning.

It's not just a game; it's a commitment made when queueing up with other people in the first place.\n\nIts not poor planing. Especially if you still live with your parents, which, a lot of us choose to still do.\nAnd I'm quite sure you got demands from your own (assuming you ever lived with your parents) to DO THIS THING I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n>Blackouts doesn't concern me. I got a UPS on my PC and monitor, and another UPS on every piece of networking equipment.\n\nNot everyone is you, not everyone is as rich as you.\nIf the power goes off in my house, everything goes off.\nThe fridge, the heating, the microwave, the tv, the internet, the electricity (obviously), the lights, etc.\nThe only thing that keeps working is the water. And its not just my house, its usually the entire neighbor.\nIt its night outside with the moon behind clouds, its REALLY REALLY DARK.\n\nI'm living in an 'medium class' or 'low medium class' family. Other people got it better, others got it worse.\nAnd your fully cabled network (which again, is not standard for a lot of households) can also fail if something happened to the cable around your area.\nLike, lets say your IPS is modernizing the infrastructure. They might have to take the internet out of a lot of you for a while. This will happen even if they aren't working right in front of your house.\nWi-fi has become more and more of a standards for households as more and more devices use the internet such as: smart tvs, ps4, xbox, smartphones, laptops, pcs, other consoles, etc. Its by far more convenient to have wi-fi internet than cables going all though your house. And this is why, wi-fi connection is to be expected on the majority of lol players.\n\nYou also personally got 2 or more devices which can play lol (pcs or laptops), I got 3 for example. But only 1 of them has windows, the other two have linux for obvious reasons.\n\nAnd yes, you 'dodge' when your wi-fi dies. Wi-fi can die due to multiple reasons such as: the ips stopped giving you internet, the router that gives you wi-fi failed, your machine is infested with viruses and can no longer keep the connection open, radiation (wi-fi singals happen in waves, stuff like microwaves if there's enough of them in the area and cause destabilization, even airplanes).\n\n>In all of my 6648 ARAM matches, I have dodged precisely 0 of them by own will.\n\nWhich is again, great, amazing, congratulations.\nYou are a great player which cares about his team.\nHOWEVER, please do not expect everyone to share your mentality and behavior.\n\nLike I said at the start. The idea is admirable, but it goes against human nature.\nAnd you'll never be able to win against human nature. As in: not everyone is a good and nice person. There's assholes, there's trash out there and so on.\n\nI'm personally in that category, just for you to get an idea.\nI would dodge a game if mom or dad need me right that moment, even if they usually know to wait, sometimes they do something that needs help asap.\nI would dodge a game if I have to play poppy as an example, sometimes even if i have rerolls available.\nDuring december, my internet is quite unstable (not just mine, everyone's in the area), so, i might dodge involuntarily as well.\nIf i get a call from a friend that needs my assistance, I'm also dodging (or afk-ing in game if it already started)\nAnd so on.\n\nMy whole life doesn't resolve around League of Legends. I'm not making every preparation possible to avoid harming my team mates.\nThe problem is, a lot of players are like this.\nHence, one per day free dodge would be great as in:\nWell, you tried to play the game but for whatever reason you couldn't. How about you tend to real life problems today and you might give it a shot tomorrow, what do you think mate? :)\nCompared to:\nWell, you tried to play the game and for whatever reason you couldn't. How about you stay the fuck away for 1 month or I'll ban your ass off my previous game, how dare you do that to 4 innocent people, who will give them back that minute?? now go away till I don't decide to ban you for your first dodge!!!\n\nYes, I've exaggerated.\nBut that's how strict the proposal is. If you fuck up twice in one month while playing a game that's supposed to be for fun, you'll get punished.\nThis is how you alienate people.\n\nEven some of your kind, that doesn't dodge will slowly start to fade away seeing their friends getting hurt for random shit.\n\nPS:\nthere's always more assholes than good people in the world","replies":[{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-07-21T11:03:16.778+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aye, I hear you, mate.

No server freak myself, but instead [keep everything on/in one computer.](https://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/off-topic-en/fQOqgEgz-show-your-set-up?comment=0001)\nFun fact: I also still live at home. Technically, at least. Renting a 28m² room in the basement. Cheaper than anywhere else (though still no less than it should be), and it's within driving distance of work.\n\n Reasonably arguments for the most part. Though what I got a beef with (though I may have misunderstood you, I'm not quite sure) is when you say \"most people aren't like this [putting a video game before real life]\", and yet you say (again, if I understood you correctly) that you will dodge if you get Poppy.\n\nI wouldn't. I would swallow the taste of disliking Poppy, and try to make the most of it. Who knows? Maybe I'll even get to like playing her.\n_It's a longshot, I know, but no need to deliberately make things miserable by thinking negative thoughts._\n\nAlso:\n\n>I would dodge a game if mom or dad need me right that moment\n\nI wouldn't. If it was important, I'd go, yes, but let the countdown go and then tell them in no uncertain terms that I got 1-2 minutes. I will not dodge over it.\n\nI have just made a prior commitment with other humans, and, to me, parents doesn't get the right to claim more importance than other people with which I have made a promise (by staying there with them for however long the match may last).\n\n>Not everyone is you, not everyone is as rich as you.\nIf the power goes off in my house, everything goes off.\n\nI wouldn't claim the term \"rich\". Some would certainly call me such, yes, depending on their own living standard, but in my country, we're, as far as I know, below the average.\nIt's just what I decide to spend my money on. Priorities. I don't drink, I don't smoke, goes to a restaurant once a year, maybe, and don't care for traveling.\n\nInstead, I spend my money on technical stuff; computer hardware, flashlights purchases (some addiction to have, huh), and other utilities. So when the neighbourhood goes dark (where, in winter, the outside is _really_ dark), our computers still work, internet is still up, automated backup lights in the roofs on both floors kick in (makes for going outside a real laugh: All is pitch black around me - except our house ^^).\n_I even have had some come knocking on the door, wondering how the hell we still have power. Priceless!_ xD\n\nI think we'll round this off now, else we'll stray too far off-topic. I think I've made my points - you at least seem to have understood and accepted them with grace - and I've read yours. And while I can't say I agree with it all, I can understand and appreciate your logic.\nAs you say: Human nature (it's a bitch, ain't it?). Except here's a fun fact to maybe help you understand how I think: I _know_ it's human nature, and that's why I think as I do - I want to beat it! I don't like being controlled, not even by my very instincts.\n\nIt's impossible for anyone to change unless they are made self-aware of how they think. And even then, they must _want_ to change. And that goes right down to dodging. Someone don't want to not dodge, they'll keep on doing it - unless they're taught not to.\n\nI see I easily could add more here, but I feel that wouldn't contribute to anything, nor make a shred of difference to others, so I'll leave it out.\n\nSo as a final word, would it surprise you if I say that I had 1200+ Teamworks honours (RIP)? And that I am a Support main (at heart, I am such in most things - wanting to help)? _Rhetorical question, so no need to answer that._ ;)\nI may not have particular skills at the game (high Gold at best), nor do I care for gaining more skill, BUT...I like to be friendly, and engage in conversation as much as teamfights on the Howling Abyss.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, having a good time is much more important than winning. Though ofc. not at the expense of others - and not just because rules (boring), but because that's how I feel it should be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Fuzzi","date":"2017-07-20T20:19:39.712+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"People want this?\n\nYou dodged, it's your problem.
