Use whispers if you want to insult your friends in \"humorous\" fashions -- doing it in-game WILL get you punished if others are exposed to it.\n\nThat said, let's look at the logs.\n\n> le un le seul: MY DICK\n> le un le seul: anal beads\n\nUnnecessary sexual comments aren't good. I'd recommend avoiding them.\n\n> le un le seul: stfu weeb\n> le un le seul: stfu aaron\n> le un le seul: g i t g u d\n> le un le seul: fk u\n> le un le seul: shup the popup\n\nThis is all rude and/or insulting.\n\n> le un le seul: kys\n> le un le seul: then kys\n> le un le seul: kys\n\nThis is something Riot punishes very aggressively. It doesn't matter if you're Zilean -- use another phrasing. Even \"Zil ult. Die\" is better.\n\n> le un le seul: fuck%%%%\n\nThe part that is censored is 100% not acceptable, and Riot has a zero-tolerance policy for it.\n\n------------------------\n\nIn general, you need to remember there are other people in the game. It doesn't matter if you and your friend find this stuff 100% acceptable and 100% hilarious -- if you're exposing other players to it, you can be punished for it. Full stop.\n\n-------------------------\n\nIf it WAS a 5-man pre-made, be aware that (I believe) reports check the ENTIRE log. So proceed with caution -- if an enemy reports you and your log contains this sort of language, you can still be hit with a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-05-15T02:20:24.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still not convinced that it's someone from a 5 man party, people who i've played like 30-40 arams with? reported me.

Be warned though -- after a 14-day ban, your account is on VERY thin ice, as the next punishment is the permanent one. Tread carefully, double-check everything before you hit enter, and, when in doubt, delete it without sending it.\n\nGood luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"rework trundle","date":"2017-05-15T02:24:03.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.

Both are free, easy to set up, and light weight enough to run behind pretty much any other program, including *League*.\n\nOtherwise? Save that sort of chat for out of game, or use the /w function (although that only lets you talk to one person at a time).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Anomander","date":"2017-05-15T02:14:57.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">le un le seul: kys\n\nShoulda been a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"Bansheenoir","date":"2017-05-15T02:15:43.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
