But re-releasing said skin as something \"new\" is as bad as what they did with Championship Riven.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with Neo PAX Sivir, here is Riot's official page: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/neo-pax-sivir-and-epic-capsules\n**TL:DR**: Either get Neo PAX Sivir at the upcoming PAX West event again or (and here's the kicker) **you can craft this skin for 10 gemstones.**\nCause if you don't get this _amazing_ skin now, it's retired as well after the event. (Meaning it can't be obtained through any means.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM43e7b0ftw\n\nSo worth it, so wow! Just eye-popping amazingness!\nIt's basically the exact same skin; am I the only person who honestly can't think of a single legitimate reason for this skin to even exist?","replies":[]}
