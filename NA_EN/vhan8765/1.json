For roughly 2 months now, I have not earned a single key shard even though I have been playing and winning PvP regularly. I have reached out for help on this matter many times in various ways now and have been directed to this section of Boards now in hopes of finally receiving some aid.\r\n\r\n\"Simply put, I'm not earning key shards at all; 100% nothing. I know how they work, I know about the restrictions and limitations, I know all there is to know on how to earn key shards at this point and yet am not earning a single one still for the past, going on 2 months now.\r\n\r\nThere had been a two month period where I basically wasn't playing League at all, except for an occasional Co-op vs. AI game with a good friend. You cannot earning key shards in bot games, which mean my rate on getting one has been completely reset for awhile.\r\nLittle more than a month ago now, I started playing League regularly again. I've been playing 95% PvP games and have shuffled through each game mode throughout the past however long now, but haven't won a single key shard since. My chests have come fine whenever I get an S rank on a champion, but I've gone well over 100+ wins since playing League again and haven't gotten any key shards.\r\n\r\nYou can see by my games I'm winning often enough, as well as I am indeed in PvP.\r\nI haven't won a key shard in almost 4 months, so my rate on earning one should be low, meaning I should be getting one.\"\r\n\r\nThat is about the just of the problem I'm having. Going off of everything that's been said about key shards, realistically I should have gotten one by now. In the most recent \"Ask Riot\" post on the home page, it is directly stated the system is made to give you a key shard even if after long enough you haven't gotten one, but for many player (not even just myself), that doesn't seem to be the case for an extended period of time. Just how bad the problem is seems to varies among players.\r\nOh, and I have no forms of punishments on my account. I don't believe I've ever been reported once in fact, so apologies for mentioning this fact so late. I know punished players are void from some aspects of crafting.\r\n\r\nThank you though for taking the time to read and reply to this.\r\n\r\n(I was told that perhaps reaching out to some specific Rioters in this area may aid in the matter, so if Rioters, Riot KateyKhaos, REAV3, or POROCLES have taken notice of this, I would hugely appreciate your help with this matter; thank you.)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-16T21:33:14.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a look into this for you, but was unable to find any problems for your specific issue.  You've been receiving a healthy amount of key fragments, and quite a handful even today.  Per our [Hextech Crafting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide), the rate of obtaining fragments are lower the more you receive them until it resets roughly every 30 days.  I hope that helps clear things up but if  you would like more specifics for your account please reach out to player support by[ submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2016-07-16T21:57:40.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Until just today I hadn't received any for roughly two months though? As stated as well, I wasn't playing for the prior two months before that even; not PvP at least. So logically I would have earned the key shards when I first started playing again and then had a reset in my rate now this month.\n\nI assume your data is coming from some form of logs and if so then I question even more so if something was wrong? If the system was trying to grant me a key shard but it simply just didn't go through.\n\nFor now though at least I guess the problem fixed itself. Hopefully it stays functioning now actually. Perhaps continue to investigate this because I have heard from other players mentioning as well their key shards seem to be not functioning properly. And knowing from experience now, it is a frustrating position to find yourself in. I enjoy Hextech Crafting and would like to see it 100% functional, you know?\n\nEither way, thank you for taking the time to read and reply to this. Not much actually had to be done though now that the problem just took so long to be addressed that it fixed itself.\nIn regards though to submitting a ticket, I had done so before this actually and it proved to be completely useless to be honest. Not to be rude, but everything I mentioned here was completely ignored there. The replies I received were generic and unresponsive to my situation entirely. (So even more so thank you because it seems you actually took to time to read and look into this matter. Even if nothing needs to be done now, I do appreciate the time and consideration you've already put into this.)","replies":[]}]}]}
