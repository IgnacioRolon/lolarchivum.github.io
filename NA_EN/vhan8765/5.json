Each of them look amazing and chances are I&#039;ll end up owning at least one, if not all of them.\nBut as a decently aged League player, it would be great seeing some of the corner champions be dusted off and dressed nice too.","replies":[{"poster":"√ùones","date":"2016-09-20T04:38:47.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jinx already has too many skins.
