(Much like how MS is pingable currently.)","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently my main computer broken; video card fried and while I'm working on replacing it, I have been playing League on an old laptop of mine. The laptop I've been using for the past little while now is rain damaged and has a few various problems, and while playing League is a bit difficult it is still playable, but my main concern comes in whenever I have an FPS drop for a tad and have no way of indicating that to my team unless I type a message in chat.\r\nThe problem with typing a message in chat is, not only the most likely of teammates not believing me, but there is also the possibility of the teammates who mute everyone at the start of the game or other various reason. My point is that being able to ping FPS would be great for us lower spec players who like League and play casually when we can.\r\n\r\nI do understand FPS isn't nearly a concern for probably, 90% if not more players on League of Legends, but for having a ping system already made, I think adding the option of pinging FPS would be a great add on for slower spec players. (Especially with the official launch of the Alpha Client coming soon, I think this would be a great addition.)\r\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T02:59:35.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Since you're intending to suggest a feature, I recommend reposting this to the [**Miscellaneous Boards**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), where suggestions like these go.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Vhan8765","date":"2017-02-15T13:12:56.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rioters never look at the main boards though...\nNot to mention the toxicity of Boards in general..\n\nI was posting this here in hopes to get a serious reply.\nBut I can try Miscellaneous I guess; thanks for all your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-15T22:32:01.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rioters actually do look at this Miscellaneous Boards, you can even find pinned announcement posts by Rioters on those specific boards.
