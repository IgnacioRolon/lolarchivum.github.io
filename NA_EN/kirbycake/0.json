His lore is one of the reasons i chose to main him. Just because his lore doesn't fit his gameplay style 100% still makes it a better fit. He has super long cooldowns early so every time he casts an ability is more meaningful than other champions that spam. He has no mobility and requires better positioning than most champions and despite his ult being considered braindead you still need to learn when to turn it off and not turn it off and not fight when its off.\n\nGameplay wise, all I have to ask is why does swain need a rework at all? In fact the problem with swain is that he has TOO much counterplay. He has super long windows to punish him due to his long cooldowns. His snare has a super long delay and avoiding his snare avoids at least 50% of his damage. MR items hard counter him since he will go oom before killing tanks. If you're really bad just buy grevious wounds. His win rate has been garbage ever since the new runes came out.\n\nIf anything vlad needs a rework due to his kit that actually has no counterplay. He is legitimately just a better version of swain yet swain is getting a rework instead of vlad who is so broken that he is being played competitively.\n\nI would honestly rather have swain in his garbage state than reworked and be op so I can at least enjoy the champion. If I wanted to abuse broken champions I would have mained vlad already.","replies":[{"poster":"Dead flag blues","date":"2018-01-24T20:57:54.238+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You answered your own question.\n \"why does swain need a rework at all?\" \n\"swain has TOO much counterplay\"\n\nSwain is either a monster when buffed (aka an unkillable tank with both sustained damage and burst damage, or completly useless due to grevious wound","replies":[{"poster":"KirbyCake","date":"2018-01-24T21:00:51.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why should a champion with counterplay be reworked when there are broken champions with no counterplay against them other than pray that the person playing said broken champion is bad???

His gameplay wasn't befitting a \"master tactician\". The only thing you do as Swain post 6 is Ult and run into the middle of a fight while using your Q, W, and E. There was literally nothing \"tactical\" about his kit.\n\nAnd his visuals desperately needed work. \n\n>vlad who is so broken that he is being played competitively.\n\nVlad works in competitive right now because all games last 40+ minutes. Vlad scales into the late game. He does little early.  Pros currently turtle around for half an hour because no one wants to die due to how snowbally League is at the moment.\n\n Inspiration, and more specifically Unsealed Spellbook and Perfect Timing make Vlad's laning incredibly safe. He gets a reduced CD on Flash, the ability to change his second summoner from Teleport in lane to Ignite or Ghost late game, and he gets a free Stopwatch six minutes into the game.\n\n\n>If anything vlad needs a rework due to his kit that actually has no counterplay.\n\nVlad.

His lore was literally just \"he's menacing and mysterious and always has a bird, but he's supposed to be this crafty man who leads Noxus, but he's so dark and mysterious.\" That was pretty much it. Being a puppet for a bird demon invalidated ALL of Swain's characterization because he basically didn't exist, just his bird demon did.\n\nNew Swain is the commanding leader of Noxus we needed Swain to be. He's an actualized person with his own motives, and his core lore no longer relies on him eating secrets and shitting mystery. New Swain collects knowledge and secrets, sure, but we know he's using that to better his nation and press onward with his plans to conquer the world in anticipation of some big, dark even that he has forseen. He is a man who absolutely commands attention and presence, and he isn't just some vague old guy with a bird anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Cacique","date":"2018-02-09T08:45:42.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how you frame it, but I personally preferred the mysterious crippled menace to this ridiculous Lucius Malfoy ripoff.

His heal and DPS output is ridiculous even for a 1st release. Isn't the PBE supposed to avoid this? Alas, that's a small fix But in all honesty his new design is what irked me the most. Why overhaul his unique design? Why remove his limp? Because it makes him different from the otherwise nearly flawless human champions? Before he represented someone who isn't completely flawless and bore the scars of the sacrifices he made to get to where he is. One of which was definitely the reason for his limp. Why was that changed? God forbid there be a champion who's not a fantastic projection of whatever genre chosen. Swain's character and personality were the most realistic in the way the character was projected. Such a shame that he was turned into another pretty faced \"older evil guy\" without a shred of relate-ability.","replies":[]}]}
