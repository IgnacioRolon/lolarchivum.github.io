Retaliation DOES NOT HELP. **It is NOT worth it to put your account at risk for the short-lived gratification of telling a troll, _who legitimately does not give two shits, a fuck, or a rat's ass_, to fuck off.**\n\nThe troll is not going to magically stop trolling for any reason. If you don't feed them, they're still going to troll, but if you do feed them, they're just dragging you down with them. It's a lose/LOSE situation, and frankly, I'd rather take an L in a promo series because of a troll than take an L _and_ get chat restricted, making the whole ranked climb pointless.\n\n> And Jo0o is literally telling the guy 'This game is in the gutter because people like you'.\n\nBecause the OP is saying \"this game is in the gutter because x\" to blame someone else for their own shortcomings. He's making outrageous claims that Riot does nothing about intentional feeders, and trying to excuse his poor behavior by saying \"I had a feeder in my game, I should be allowed to say whatever I want, fuck the rules!\"\n\nFrankly, Jo0o picked the harsh wording well, and I honestly agree with him. No need to mince words. People who think it's okay to flame and retaliate and act like they get a free pass to break the rules **do not belong.**\n\n> If that's not blaming the victim, I dunno what is..\n\nThe OP is not a victim. They retaliated, they flamed, they broke the rules - they don't get to play the victim card. They're another perpetrator. If they didn't flame? _Then_ they'd be a victim. But, they did, so they aren't.\n\nThey literally could have just not typed anything to the troll, and would not have been punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2018-11-03T17:25:16.967+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not his fault someone trolled.\n\nBut it is his fault that he decided to flame, turning one person into two, making the game even worse for the rest of his teammates.\n\nIf someone is actually a legit troll, what is saying \"no, stop it\" going to do?
