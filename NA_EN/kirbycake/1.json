So I quit.\n\nIt just gets to a point where, finally, enough is enough. The last 7 months have been extremely disappointing... if you're not enjoying the game for similar reasons, it's not worth your time. Riot has devalued ranked with ridiculously imbalanced matchmaking (it's a premade lottery half the time) and, if you're a solo player, you've been betrayed and lied to for nearly a year by this company.\n\nIt's just a frustrating 20-40 minute prison with no reward.","replies":[]}]}
