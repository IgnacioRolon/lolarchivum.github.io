This would be really cater to low elo players and whales (players who spend a lot of money), and spitting in the face of high elo players and dedicated, but low-spending players. You'd see micro-transactions  like this in a mobile game, which aims to make as much money as possible without making their players too mad. Micro-transactions in any other genre is considered real taboo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T02:44:26.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing as this is almost literally a way to guarantee that you get into promos, and like you said it's almost a pay-2-win scenario, I don't see this getting added anytime soon.\n\nYou're welcome to post this over in general discussion to see what your community feels about the idea!","replies":[]}]}
