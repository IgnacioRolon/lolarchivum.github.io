It stops being a fighting game, and it becomes a guessing game.\r\nWill they roll left? Right? Three times in a row? 10? Randomly spam rolls at the edge and try a grab? Who knows.\r\n\r\nIt's not like it's even a good strategy. There's a reason I have a 71.12% win rate. Roll spamming is for r%%%%%s, plain and simple. It doesn't do damage. It doesn't make you immune - in fact, it makes you vulnerable as fuck. You can't kill by spamming rolls and dash attacks. It's just straight annoying to go against.\r\n\r\nSonics seem to be, by far, the worst offenders. Sonic is a character that plays itself, his animations are him rolling around, all they do is roll around, they press a button and do 40 damage. But, like all roll spammers, they can't kill even at 200%. But these are just mega annoying because their B, side B, and down B have stupidly high priority and speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this is the reason ROB became one of my favorite characters. He's versatile, but most importantly, he has a plethora of responses to roll spammers. Down smash, up smash, side special, gyro, laser, neutral air. Just build up damage by spamming projectiles, which are ultra easy to land on roll spammers, side B every time they think they're gonna do anything, wait until 150%, and then do an up throw. That's literally every fight. It's just boring.\r\n\r\nI've tried new characters, but if they don't have quick responses to roll and projectile spam, fights are just frustrating and really drawn out.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoll spammers are going to kill For Glory off before the Wii U version picks up momentum.","replies":[]}
