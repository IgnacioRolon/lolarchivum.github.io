The modern Children&#039;s Chinese Cartoons would take the cat girl that appeared for 10 seconds, turn her into a 4 year old without changing her outfit, and make a show about how she goes to school and flirts with teachers.\r\nThis quality show focuses on the two battlers who shoot beams of light at one another and transform into dragons and shoot lightning to kill each other. \r\n\r\nWhy do they produce Children&#039;s Chinese Cartoons these days, instead of edgy anime tv shows?","replies":[]}
