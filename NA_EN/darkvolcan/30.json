Do they just randomly hang out again every day or something? I legitimately don't get it. \r\n\r\nFor example, I have friends, right? It's shocking, but I do. We go out (not like that) like once a month or something, catch up on shit, have a few drinks, and then go home.\r\nBut like, what are you supposed to do with a gf? Seeing her once a month doesn't seem right, but neither does senselessly going out to see her everyday for no reason.\r\n\r\nPls respond.","replies":[]}
