Years ago, the old GD crew was in high school, and now we&#039;ve grown up, but we&#039;re still in the same spot, inhabited mostly by annoying 14 year olds. So it seems like GD died, but it didn&#039;t. It&#039;s just a new generation of children on it, while the old kids are now grown ass adults who have to listen to the &quot;creative&quot; input of current 14 year olds. GD sucks because we&#039;re basically internet babysitters now. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s crazy what time actually does.","replies":[]}
