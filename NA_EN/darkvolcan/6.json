I spent the day with this dull soreness, and it eventually went away on its own. I also noticed I had back pain, near my upper back, along the spinal cord. Again, dull pain. It was sore enough to notice, but not enough to stop me from doing anything.\n\nThe pain disappeared a couple hours ago, and that was nice. I had a meal, and my upper back pain came back, and then my chest started to hurt as well. This lasted for about 30 minutes before the dull pains disappeared again.\n\nI checked google, but a lot of the possibilities they offer affect the stomach and lower back. I haven&#039;t had stomach issues in a while, and the pain is in the wrong spot anyway. So it&#039;s not the 5 million diseases webmd wishes on me. But there&#039;s something wrong still. So what can it be?\n\nThe pain isn&#039;t serious, but the fact that I think I&#039;ve identified a consistent trigger is a bit of a flag for me. \n\nYes, I know it&#039;s probably aids, ebola, bird/swine flu, gonorrhea, sickle cell, cancer, autism, etc. I need other diagnoses though.","replies":[]}
