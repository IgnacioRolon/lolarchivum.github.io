The second a female even mentions she's a female, whether it be by accident, intentionally, or within context, she's instantly attacked by a bunch of losers for allegedly attention whoring.\r\nThe second a female streams, even if she doesn't mention she's a girl in the advertisement, she's attacked and called an attention whore again.\r\n\r\nThe reason they do this is obvious at first glance. Just about every single girl on the internet has an army of thirsty virgins coming after her, and just about every girl on the internet cashes in on this simple fact.\r\nBut if you take a closer look, there's something else going on.\r\n\r\nWhile there exist actual attention whores, I propose those are the minority. \r\nI postulate that the reason every single girl on the internet seems like an attention whore is because you virgins rush in at the sight of a girl. A girl gamer doesn't even have to want an audience - that will NOT stop thirsty 12 year olds from flooding her.\r\n\r\nSo what everyone sees, and what is actually happening, are very different things.\r\nThe kids who call the girl an attention whore just see a female garnering popularity for being a girl. The thirsty kids jump at her because they see a potential online girlfriend.\r\nBut has anyone even considered what the girl sees?\r\n\r\nI have a proposition, and I will support it with evidence.\r\nI argue that, from the girl's perspective, she only experiences confusion, fear, and pressure. I argue that when the average girl gamer sees an army of thirsty virgins lunge at her, she feels attacked, rather than appreciated.\r\nConsider what actually does happen in the average girl gamer's stream. Most of the time, she'll end up hooking up her bf or her friends or whatever into a skype call once the virgins are on the attack. She'll call for help from mods to get rid of them.\r\nShe'll do a variety of things, none of which involve attention whoring.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the reason every girl seems like an attention whore is because there's an army of virgins lined up waiting to pounce at the first thing that even resembles a female. Girls don't need to do anything - the nerds will be waiting. This isn't popularity. It's more like harassment. \r\n\r\nAnd because this is what it's like from the perspective of the female, for anyone to call the average girl gamer an attention whore for just existing somehow ends up placing them below the thirsty virgins. It puts them below because it shows they're extremely closed minded. They don't consider the possibilities, they don't consider the problem from any angle other than their own, and they seem to think they can claim victory. And, the least surprising part, is that the population that comprises these idiots happens to be primarily Ledditors.\r\n\r\nI hope to have convinced a few rational minds out there. Ledditors will of course attack me and call me a white knight virgin, failing to see that I presented an axiomatic proof showing why they're r%%%%%ed. The best part is, they don't even know what axiomatic means even though they pretend to worship science.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[]}
