Her passive is what really allows this to work powerfully.\r\nNot even building tanky will help much since she can also build Madred&#039;s and shred your HP. And her damage is mixed, making it difficult to itemize against her.\r\n\r\nPeople say AS Lulu is just a gimmick, but I&#039;m becoming convinced that she might actually be a very viable pick.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-04-20T05:36:13.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes. you have won yourself a chicken dinner sir.","replies":[]}]}
