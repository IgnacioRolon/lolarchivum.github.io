Today I was looking up at the sky, and everything looked really beautiful, and I'd look at the buildings around me, and they'd seem more vivid for some reason. I feel better about myself than ever before, and I'm completely unphased by the complete disaster my life is. I was thinking about how amazing the world is, and how fortunate it is to be alive to be able to take it all in, and how I want to just watch the world change and grow throughout my life. I was thinking about how amazing it would be to explore other places, and experience the wonders of life. I'm feeling strangely content, and it's concerning me.\r\n\r\nIdk, it's weird as fuck. Am I becoming schizophrenic or something?","replies":[]}
