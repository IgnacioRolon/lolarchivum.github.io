I&#039;m actually legitimately scared for the first time in years, and I keep thinking I&#039;m gonna have those really bad infestations where there&#039;s like a hundred giant worms that need to be surgically removed, but idk that sounds really bad but it&#039;s a possibility, idk, does anyone know? \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been having bad stomach issues on and off for the past couple months, but today was the first time I actually saw strange things with my own eyes, which promoted me to google all this and now I&#039;m really scared lol","replies":[]}
