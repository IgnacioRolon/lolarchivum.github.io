You're my doctor today, GD. And you won't charge me 150 dollars for this which is really nice.\r\n\r\nOkay, so about a week ago I caught what felt like ebola, but it was just a flu. Nothing too interesting happened, except for this one new thing I've never experienced in my life. My face started to hurt strangely. It was my left cheek and left teeth, and coincidentally, my left nostril was really runny with greenish mucus. \r\nNow, skip a bit, I've still got a bit of a runny nose in my right nostril this time. Coincidentally, the right side of my face hurts this time, teeth and gums included, up to my cheek, below the eye socket.\r\n\r\nI wanted to blame this on wisdom teeth (I was supposed to get them removed but never followed up on it), except, the dentist said it was only my lower wisdom teeth that could become a problem, and my upper ones came out fine. Yet, both my top and bottom gums are sore, in conjunction with my cheek.\r\n\r\nMy second hypothesis is that it's a sinus infection, or inflammation, or congestion, or something like that, as both times, the sore side of my face coincided with my runny, seemingly infected, nostril.\r\n\r\nIt isn't too bad, but it's this dull, constant soreness that makes it hard to sleep at times.\r\n\r\n\r\nwut do?","replies":[]}
