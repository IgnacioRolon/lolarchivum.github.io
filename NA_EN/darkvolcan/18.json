Every single poster on here has their own life story, and their own issues, and their own aspirations and shit. And a bunch of people are actually also struggling with the lack of significance in life. Like, literally every single person has a full, life story, full of decisions and interests and experiences and everything, that we ourselves will never be able to understand, see, witness, rationalize, or live. \r\n\r\nLike, reflect on your entire life. And then realize that literally every single person on this world has just a long of a story. It might be better or worse than yours, but literally everyone has a story. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if this is common knowledge, but it&#039;s just sinking in for me. But what I&#039;m wondering is, what advantages are there of becoming aware of this knowledge and exploring it?","replies":[]}
