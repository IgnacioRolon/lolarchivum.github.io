I stopped playing when I got into a car accident around the end of summer before school started. I think it was around August. During this time, Ekko with triforce was really strong, I use to spam as he was my favorite champ. What happened to him, was he nerfed or did he just fall out of popularity? Does Ekko with triforce in the top lane still viable in this meta?","replies":[{"poster":"Leo1024","date":"2017-01-29T07:17:03.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They killed the tank ekko build but buffed ap ekko, still loads of fun, i've always hated tank ekko and ap ekko was always fun but now it's greater than ever","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-29T00:02:15.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They finally removed the slow from his passive, the base percentage heal from his ultimate and changed Fervor of Battle to no longer be on-hit damage.\n\nThank god.","replies":[{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-01-29T00:34:57.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EndlessSorcerer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A3EJvqAA,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-01-29T00:02:15.184+0000)\n>\n> They finally removed the slow from his passive, the base percentage heal from his ultimate and changed Fervor of Battle to no longer be on-hit damage.\n> \n> Thank god.\n\nStill haven't removed the %missinghealth damage on W... tank Ekko would still be viable if he had a way to get tanks to 40% health without dying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"deáth márk","date":"2017-01-28T23:49:42.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He got nerfed hard","replies":[{"poster":"SSAMI","date":"2017-01-29T00:00:39.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that sucks","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-01-29T00:10:40.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, multiple base stat nerfs along with changing up his ult to have heal increase off of AP amount or something like that.\n\nForced him into a champ that needs ap items to be strong....er instead of doing whatever he wants as a tank with triforce","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RlP K0BE","date":"2017-01-29T00:01:28.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His changes during the assassin rework made Tri Ekko weak","replies":[]}]}
