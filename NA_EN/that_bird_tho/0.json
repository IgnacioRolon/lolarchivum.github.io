This is because Leaverbuster always shows a number of LPQ's left in the corner, and if it doesn't it's likely the message you're getting is not for Leaverbuster. If you wait out the timer and don't dodge, you shouldn't see another Low Priority Queue window again. \n\nOur [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging) covers the complete details.
