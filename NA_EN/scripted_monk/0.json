Help!","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\nFirst of all, I run League at around **144 FPS(capped, High/Med)**, I never had any FPS issues or drop problems before until two days ago. Moreover, this isn&#039;t really an FPS drop, nor is it lag, but mostly when the game starts and goes into the loading screen I hear this weird digital sound _*boop boop*_ and the game runs **at 40 fps and sometimes jumps into 70. **\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I tried to repair, update drivers, restart PC, reinstall the game, change drivers from SSD into normal, but nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nThe game runs normally overall, nothing major or anything else going. Just once that sound happen the game started running at capped **40FPS. **\r\n\r\nAny help? Every other game runs the same as before and no FPS issues or drops, so this issue seems to be only around League. I also didn&#039;t install or download anything for the past week so idk. \r\n\r\n**Thank you!** {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-06-23T00:35:59.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OS, background software, any overlays, graphics card?","replies":[{"poster":"Scripted Monk","date":"2017-06-23T00:38:18.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking the same, but no.
