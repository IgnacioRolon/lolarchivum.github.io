I&#039;ve played at least 200+ ranked games in every single position, and to me personally it seems ADCs takes the cake on this one. Here&#039;s my thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. You don&#039;t really hit spikes until about 3 items generally. So you&#039;re generally reliant on your team at least the first 20 minutes there&#039;s just not much you can really do until that point. Sure you can stomp your lane, and if you can do that every game then kudos to you. But the vast majority of us don&#039;t, so next point.\r\n\r\n2. You&#039;re only as good as your support is. Let&#039;s be honest we&#039;ve all had that one support who exhausts the Leona every fight. not only are you dependent on your support in lane, but also in team fights. If your support builds full AP sona, you better hope that talon doesn&#039;t get near you. Or you&#039;re getting 1 shot most of the time if you don&#039;t have a locket/redemption to give you those few vital seconds to life steal back up. ADC first to die in a 40 minute game? Probably gg unless you can get theirs. \r\n\r\n3. There&#039;s not much room for error. If you die in lane, generally your support dies to. You just fed their team 2 kills and 2 assists. Lanes snowball a lot harder due to this reason. Team fighting: back to the whole getting one shot thing, your positioning is more vital than anyone else&#039;s on the team. Most adcs don&#039;t have much built in survivabilty, and if your adc dies first in a team fight at the 45 minute mark, you&#039;ve probably lost over 60% of your teams dps from that fact alone. \r\n\r\nTldr: adc is the hardest role IMO due to positioning, snowballing, and relying on your teammates to get you to your spikes. Itemization/laning with your support is vital. You rely heavily on your team. \r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-25T15:14:34.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Depends on the elo.\n\nLower elo hands down support.","replies":[{"poster":"Outlaw782","date":"2017-07-25T15:23:18.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think in lower elo you can do well with support by simply building the right items and keeping your adc alive. I see sooooo many full AP Morg supports who don't focus on keeping their ADC alive. Itemization on supports is heavily looked over in low elo. My opinion","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-25T15:40:10.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not at all, it's the fact that you know the supports aren't the best and the adcs are just as bad if not worse, that's why in lower elo support is the hardest, from like high plat+.... maybe diamond it becomes easier for a support to climb with less effort compared to other roles, then after that, i feel adc is the hardest while jungle is the easiest","replies":[]}]}]}]}
