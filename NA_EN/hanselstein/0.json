I can't even be invited by friends, it pops a message that I'm not allowed to join the queue. \r\nI have already done a Full Repair with the Troubleshooting, but it didn't solve anything.\r\n\r\nI have visited the link I posted from Riot Support, and I'm still confused what should I do.\r\nI tried to download the automated Troubleshooting and the first time it failed; now it's 3% after a long time.\r\n\r\nMaybe some kind soul can help me out? It's frustrating that I'm in my last days of holidays and I can't enjoy the game...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPS: I play on the EUW Server, came here because this forum is much more active it seems :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-05T17:18:59.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you receiving any errors?  It sounds like your pc is blocking the patcher from scanning your game files, so no updates can be performed before taking you to the login screen.  I'm not sure which support link you went to, but you will want to specifically run through the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to fix this up.
