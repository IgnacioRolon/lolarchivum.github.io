Now when I play on it I get on average 200MS of ping which it will jump all over from 200 to 1000. I though my internet must be FUBAR but just a bit ago I logged onto league on my laptop. I played a custom match first with no issues about 40MS ping which is good for me. Then I played a normal game, no lag and no insane lag spikes. I tried one solution where I went into windows firewall and created a \"outgoing protocol\" or something like that I entered in these IP addresses like this post told me but when I tried to make a custom game the client would crash. I couldn't reconnect to league until I deleted said protocols. But there is still the insane lag ONLY on that PC.. any suggestions??","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T23:00:49.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There may be specific issues with the local configurations or network adapter on that one PC that isn't on the others.
