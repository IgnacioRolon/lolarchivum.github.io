I;ve gotten the hang of the game a bit more so I am getting a better feel with my main champs power, jhin and kindred. Well sometimes this game makes NO sense to me. So for example a game a few days ago a rengar got first blood at 2;30 then ganked bot and got a double kill. I was running through our jungle to place a ward as I walked into a bush rengar was walking by. He had not been back to the shop so all he had was refillable potion and the first jungle item, the cheap at game start buy one(cant remember name of it) well anyway I figured since he hasn&#039;t been back to the store yet he shouldn&#039;t be much stronger than me.\r\nSo I shoot him from the bush (I&#039;m playing kindred) He flashes into the push and starts hitting me. He kills me, in our scuffle I took maybe only 30-40% of his health, A sliver compared to what he did.\r\nI think the game tho I was very confused was a game I just finished playing me as jhin versus a varus. the first ten min we just farmed with a few pokes here and there. we backed once and we both had the SAME exacted items dorians blade, and serrated{{item:3134}} . my support lux and their support morgona both too had the same items, exactly the same. All four of us were also the same exact level. anyway their pokes never really hurt too much to notice but then lux snared varus and I jumped in. I was a little out of position so I W&#039;d and flashed in I got a shot off when him and morg started focusing me. Me and lux focusing varus together. then out of nowhere my health plummets, I die then lux. morg and vaurs still standing while varus remaind just under 50% health maybe like 35-40% idk for sure. but I don;t understand, their pokes never hurt that bad until that fight.\r\nI just don&#039;t understand how it seems like just because someone has 3kills and no deaths even without going to buy stuff they just seem automatically stonger and tougher.. Please someone help me understand this game","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2017-02-16T08:33:15.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well not all champions have powerspikes at the same level. Some champions are much stronger with levels and some are stronger with items, some early, some late, and some in the middle.\n\nVarus + Morg is by far better early game than Jhin + Lux. Lux has very bad stats early and is more of a secondary carry than a true support. Jhin requires crit + AS + AD while Varus goes off by base damage and has 4 abilities mainly used for skirmishes and outright damaging the opponent while Jhin's traps require setup and his ult requires him to be farther away as he can be interrupted otherwise","replies":[]},{"poster":"Winters Dawn","date":"2017-02-16T09:44:48.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback everyone, I think my biggest issue is reading up on other champions passives. I've seen varus enough to recognize abilities but I've never read into his abilities passives or his own passive. I think that's where I'll start from now on if I have an issue with a champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2017-02-16T09:07:58.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add on to what TeCoolMage said Kindred is overall pretty weak right now and most of her power is focused on the mid-late game.  Rengar on the other hand has a lot more early pressure and is an assassin, meaning he is built to kill squishy champions.  Melee champions also tend to beat ranged champions in a head to head fight because they have the penalty of not having range.  Example being Rengar needs to be near a bush or have ult to generally get to a ranged champion so he gets better base stats to make up for that.\n\nA big part of League is also learning what champion abilities do, which can definitely be hard early.  Varus abilities and how they would influence a fight vs poke are as follows:\n\nPassive:  Bonus Attack Speed on killing a unit, more on killing a champ.  This doesn't play into poke much but it means after he kills one of you he can do more damage for a short time, allowing lux to die faster.\n\nQ:  Charges up an arrow to deal damage at range.  It also does less damage for each target it goes through, so if he is sending it through minions it wont hurt as much as if you are the first target it hits, adding to the burst.\n\nW:  Auto attakc's leave up to 3 marks on a target.  When you hit an ability on something with marks it does extra damage.  So vs poke he wont have attacked you, just used Q.  In a fight it will make his abilities do more damage though.\n\nE:  AOE damage, also reduces healing when you stand in it.  This means you don't get as much lifesteal and if you use the heal summoner spell in it you only get half the healing, which is why you will lose fights if you stand in it.\n\nR:  Roots you and applies 3 W stacks.  Also has a strong base damage on it but doesn't scale into late game very well.  This can add to burst a lot early game.\n\nMorgana pool also does more damage the less health you have, which also tilts fights at low HP in their favor although Jhin has the same thing.\n\nAs a Jhin you need to chunk your enemies down more because your burst isn't super high and your 4th shot does more damage the less health they have.  Jhin is also a late game carry and while his lane is pretty strong it is due to his poke and pressure rather than raw power, which is very similar to Varus.  The difference is that you are better at killing low health targets than varus but he does more sustained damage and a bit more burst.\n\nLux also tends to need some items to start doing damage and she tends to be more poke focused until after finishing 1-2 items at which point she transitions into a burst champion.  Morgana in comparison has a lot more low level burst and lockdown, but in return lacks the burst or range later on in the game.  Morgana also somewhat counters Lux due to her black shield which will block most to all of Lux's damage and neither Jhin nor Lux have the mobility to get out of Morgana's ult.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn the end it comes down to experience.  There are over 130 champions in the game, roughly 700 different abilities/passives to learn, item spikes etc. etc.  It sounds daunting and in some ways it is but you will definitely get it, it just takes time.  I have been playing for just over 2 years now and can list off all of a champion's abilities and passives, any passive's on their other abilities, roughly half of all the ability names and Cooldowns in the game, and I know most of the scaling of every ability in the game give or take 10%.  I don't even own all the champions much less play them.\n\nIt is just game knowledge and there is no cheatsheet for it.  You can study it, but you can't just learn it overnight.  Keep playing and take some time to think about when champions feel strong/weak, go check the wiki if you ever feel confused about how a champion did something (Wiki is superior to the LoL site for this, you get a lot more detail and information on specific interactions) and eventually you will start to get it down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-16T08:57:22.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Varus's W stacks on autos up to 3 and makes his next skill hitting that person do bonus damage, and hos Q does less damage if it goes through minions.\n\nYou were probably taking his poke through minions with no stacks.","replies":[]}]}
