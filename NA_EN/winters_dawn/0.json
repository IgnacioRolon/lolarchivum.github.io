I was going to use that to buy a bunch of mega orbs. Well at the bottom of tye store they had some bundles for good and great orbs. For some reason I thoight one of those bundles was for mega orbs and I bought one. I instantly realized my mistake. \r\nI have sent in a support ticket but with it being so late I don't expect a reply in a while. I was just wondering anyones opinion on the chances if me being refunded so I can use the RP I pirchased for my intended purchase. \r\n\r\nAlso note that once I realized my mistake I have NOT opened a single orb from that bundle. \r\nI'm just stressed because I don't have a lot of money to throw at stuff like this and now I feel like I just threw 20 bucks put the window because I do not want this good orb bundle. I wanted to just buy as many mega orbs as I could.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-12T04:30:29.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as the orbs haven't been opened at all, we should be able to set this right ^_^!
