Starbucks, my school wifi, and home wifi. Normally my connection would be very good at Starbucks except the occasional 5000ms short term spikes when it gets the busiest with a ton of laptops. With the patch I've noticed these ping changes:\r\n\r\n=Average ping=\r\nBefore:              Patch 6.9:\r\nNA: 80-120-------->220-300/350\r\nOCE: 180-250---> 280-350        200-250 ping is playable for me, but 350+ spikes are not. \r\n\r\nI was pretty used to high ping but now its just getting annoying. Ahaha. League has also been freezing occasionally with my ping and fps staying the same. (only happened once to be fair, but I couldn't reconnect to the game after because of the network error connection everyone else is complaining about.) Already tried the support techniques. It's not just my wifi. Too coincidental.","replies":[{"poster":"itsWind","date":"2016-05-17T02:12:49.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same. since the new patch im getting random periods where my ping goes from 45 then spikes randomly to 500-1000 for like 10-20 seconds then drops back to normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-05-10T23:33:36.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get a better idea of what the root cause could be, where are you playing from exactly?
