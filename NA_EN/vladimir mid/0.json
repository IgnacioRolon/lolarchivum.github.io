I was banned for verbal abuse which i agree that i did. Until season 6 i was never banned or persecuted for being toxic and i believe the reason for this is that you took out the report option for &quot;unskilled player.&quot; Until this time when a player on your team was playing bad and feeding you could report them for being unskilled and the deed would be done. BUT SINCE YOU TOOK THAT OUT, LEAGUE PLAYERS  FLAME THESE PEOPLE AND LET IT ALL OUT BECAUSE THERE IS no longer a report option. I am telling you that if you simply brought back this option it would make the community better because when a player was feeding one would simply say &quot;reported for unskilled&quot; instead of &quot;YOUR SO BAD OMG BRONZE 5 AWARNESS.&quot; I dont see a reason why you would take out this option in the first place it made perfect sense. The player that was reported could never be banned and would simply be put into a que with other people who were also reported.  This made sense because of the players who were level 30 but did not PLAY at a level 30  level. (lol) Same for players in high ranks who could have been boosted.

It literally did absolutely nothing. It was a completely dead report option that Riot has no reason to bring back.\n\n> ...it would make the community better because when a player was feeding one would simply say \"reported for unskilled\" instead of \"YOUR SO BAD OMG BRONZE 5 AWARNESS.\"\n\nAlso, calling for reports is considered harassment and a punishable offense. While players likely wouldn't be banned for it alone if they only said once, it is still considered harassment and is something Riot does not want. The system doesn't look at the total number of reports a player receives, it looks at the number of games they were reported in, so there's really no need to call for reports against someone else. If you want to report them, do so yourself as your report alone is enough to flag the entire game, any extra reports won't do much else.","replies":[{"poster":"Vladimir Mid","date":"2016-09-01T04:33:24.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is less of a chance of getting reported for telling  other people to report someone then there is for actually harassing especially if everyone else agree's there trash","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loner Nerd","date":"2016-09-01T03:25:59.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or just hit \"Uninstall button\" make life easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Vladimir Mid","date":"2016-09-01T04:37:40.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*sigh* if only it was that easy my friend","replies":[]}]}]}
