As other have mentioned, she is available via Mystery Gifts.\n\nChampionship Riven is not available via Mystery Gifting. If you're curious about which skins are and are not available, check out the [Mystery Gifting FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752934-Mystery-Gifting-FAQ). We've mentioned before that there is a possibility of bringing Championship Riven back. Most limited edition skins took four years to come back after release, and it's been a little over two years for Riven so far.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Baby Ghoul","date":"2015-08-18T19:25:34.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Kayle can be obtained through mystery skins, and they will probably release the skin for a limited time in the store at some point in the future.
