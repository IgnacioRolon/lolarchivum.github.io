I just logged on to my game and discovered that I had been gifted the &quot;battle bunny Riven skin&quot; by riot.  thanks!\r\n\r\nBut  here&#039;s where I&#039;m confused, I just received the anniversary riot Kayle skin. I appreciate the gift but I&#039;m wondering if anyone else received one, or if a rioter could shed some light on this. (oh and a side note I don&#039;t own Rivin) Thanks for the help! and thanks for the skin! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2016-09-20T07:03:16.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might have just been an honest mistake. since it was manually done to each account there is the possibility that a rioter put the kayle skin on your acc and might have had a memory lasp and just assumed you already had it and gifted you.","replies":[{"poster":"StoneColdTaliyah","date":"2016-09-20T07:05:40.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if that's the case what luck!
