The client never loads up.\n\nNow, I'm not asking how to fix this because I simply go to my League folder --> delete 'lol_air_client' folder by going into RADS -> Projects.\nI then run League as Administrator, wait for it to patch (takes a while), and then it's fine after that.\nI've had this problem pop up several times. (found this fix on an old post on the boards)\n\n**I'm not asking for how to fix my issue since like I said I manage to get it working. \nBut how do I fix it permanently?\n**\nThe weird thing is that at the same time this occus, my Google chrome is 'unable to load my profile correctly' (I get a popup message on my browser when I open Chrome).\nThis stops videos from loading for example, the image in the video would be loaded but pressing play or pressing pause doesn't make a difference. It just doesn't start. You can skip through the video, it will load up the frame of the minute/second you fastforwarded to, but it doesn't actually play. It just remains at the same frame/spot, whatever you may call it.\n\nFunnily enough this all goes away by simply deleting the 'lol_air_client' folder.\nMy browser (google chrome) and videos work just fine immediately after deleting said folder.\nAs for the LoL client, it loads up fine and works again once it's done patching.\n\nI've done this \"fix\" for quite some time now everytime the problem resurfaces.\n\nMy question is: does anyone know _**why **_this happens?\n\nI don't think it's my computer or chrome that causes this, since like I said, both the issues involving my browser and my client not starting is/will be fixed by deleting the folder and patching again.\n\nI don't have any programs installed on my computer that interact with League except Overwolf and LSI, incase anyone is wondering if I have any other programs messing with League folders/files.\nFrom what I understand they don't breach any terms so I don't think they are modifying anything within the League folder surely? Or anyway should be safe to use?\n\nSo how come does that folder 'supposedly' cause these issues? \nI say supposedly because I don't know for sure if the folder itself is the reason for the errors or if it's simply the fix. \nI don't have the knowledge to fully believe its the 'lol_air_client' folder doing all of this.\nI haven't, and don't, modify anything in the League folders, so why does this happen?\nIt seemingly happens randomly but usually shortly after a new patch is released.\n\nIf it's not the folder itself causing the problem, but it does indeed fix it, what causes it then?\nBecause to be honest it's becoming really frustrating to have to deal with this often enough.\nAlso, how can the folder have an impact on if my browser (google chrome) works or not?\n\nIf anyone can help me out I'll greatly appreciate this, thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-09T21:33:27.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you may have found a temporary fix here, but I don't recommend modifying files as it can usually end up causing you more trouble.
