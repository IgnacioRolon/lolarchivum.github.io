We players sense it. Fans can smell it and the Poros taste it.\r\n\r\nYou guys are over-saturating your own market.\r\n\r\nHow many champs are in the roster now? 129? Guys, this has got to stop. The game is becoming too confusing for new people to pick up, and more complicated for veterans to bring in new buyers to your market. The learning curve is growing steadily higher and higher as people try to learn every single champ in order to know how to play against or with them, and in the process, you are making your own game harder for people to join or jump right in to.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re rolling out skins and new champs like an assembly line these days, and I must ask... WHY?\r\n\r\nI know that you are, at the end of a day, a business of sorts. Your aim is to make money, and there&#039;s no shame in that. It&#039;s fine, we get it. So you crank out skins because it brings in money, and new champs for the same reason, but you&#039;re only making your problem worse. \r\n\r\nSkin sales are down, and hype for new champs is dwindling because we are getting tired of seeing similarities between new and old people, even though you try your absolute damnedest (and sometimes perform quite well, admittedly) to create really different and new champ play styles or concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut again, you are just over-saturating your market. Where is the creative thinking on how to get more funding and more player paying more money to your free game? Where is the ingenuity to make new things that create a flavorful twist to an already awesome game, instead of stretching out the current money-making meta?\r\n\r\nThe new game modes are a potential GOLDMINE for you, Riot. I still don&#039;t understand why you don&#039;t create amazing game modes for permanent unlocking, purchasable by RIOT POINTS?\r\n\r\nImagine how many screaming, begging, and pleading players would actually fork out money to have URF mode permanently, or have ascension mode available, or have one-for-all or hexakill there to give them a retreat from the stressful atmosphere of regular 5v5 Rift play?  \r\n\r\nI swear by all that is holy and good in this world, I would gladly, willingly, and RAPIDLY fish out $50 to have URF mode for good. I mean it. I wouldn&#039;t be alone in this.\r\n\r\nIt just seems like the more champs you make, the more skins you print out, the more you re-work champs, and the more you re-write history and lore of the game, more and more players are getting tired of it. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m only saying this as an avid and die-hard fan of league. There has to be SOMETHING you could come up with to sell to us other than more champs and more skins. Isn&#039;t there?","replies":[]}
