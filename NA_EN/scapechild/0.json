So I don't know how much longer or how many more missions will be available. I bought the pass but I don't really play with too many people and haven't been able to do the 2 5man missions that came up. This has left me 10 world coins or whatever they are off from the Ashe chroma and ward skin. I really want both and need to know if I'm going to get more missions or if I'm SoL since I didn't do the 2 5mans (both worth 5 coins each). Because I would honestly be pretty upset if I can't get it just because I didn't do the premades. :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-18T22:52:52.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh snap, that would *really* suck if you ended up only 10 tokens away from that chroma. Hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) when you're only 10 tokens away and we might be able to help out somehow.","replies":[{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2017-10-20T22:04:27.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you guys need to factor this kind of thing into future mission sets anyway. It creates stressful situations in which it's possible to pay for permanently missable content and still not get it. I personally had a beast of a time getting the 12000 GP mission because it took me over 20 attempts to not only win a match, but do so inefficiently enough that I got the gold. I realize that story is beyond a pocket scenario and probably souldn't be given much weight, but it's something to consider when you have people paying for mission sets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scapechild","date":"2017-10-18T23:31:32.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am only 10 away :/","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-19T00:17:18.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think you missed it in my previous message, but you'll need to hit us up in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"Scapechild","date":"2017-10-19T00:41:40.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it seems I did overlook it.
