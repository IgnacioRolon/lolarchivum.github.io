If it isn&#039;t someone who thinks it&#039;s funny to dodge in Queue while banning champions, it&#039;s during when you&#039;re selecting your role, or when the actual game itself starts. I literally was just forced to play a game where I could not even hold my own team to a win due to the fact that the support chose Teemo and decided to stand in a bush beside top lane the entire match and his ADC left the game due to it.\n\nLeague of Legends you promise to do something about these trolls who enter into the game and cause terrible experiences for your true players yet I am seeing nothing done. I have spent at least $50.00 on this game because it use to be enjoyable and I wanted the beautiful skins you designed for my mains, and honestly now I wish I had never begun playing or spent my hard earned cash on this crap fest. If I could receive a refund for every penny I&#039;ve spent it would be heavenly just because you&#039;ve allowed this game to be filled with such filth and cause bad experiences to those who truly want to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Surr20plz","date":"2016-06-14T10:36:16.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the fuck is this guy ^ yammering about?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atronthor","date":"2016-06-14T09:31:55.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well these \"trolls\" have the job to keep you down. The higher leagues are only for the \"c os\". This is in every so called \"e-sport\" game the case. In WoW it was a little bit different at least 7 years ago. You get trolled there also but if you were good and I was very good you could win the battlegrounds alone. I was able to win alone against 6 noncheaters. But it was very unsatisfied if you won a game alone when your \"team mates\" did not care and behaved like retards the whole fight.\n\nI very often still lose the games cause of that but I had the best statistics. For example I had very often 20 kills 0 deads or I defended the flag 5 times in a row in our flag room in Warsong. I was very good. I think I was actually the best retribution paladin in WoW. I made more damage with a self smited weapon than warriors with legendary PvE-Weapons in the battlegrounds. It was because the way I played the game. Because if there were 30 people and I was alone I totally fight them. And the guys with the legendarys played 2vs1.\n\nI made very many duells in WotLK and I only lost one time against a much better equpped Warlock at the end of WotLK. I always played alone that means I had only bad equippment only the honor equipment and a self smited weapon. And with this equipment I beated Arena players with full equipment in duells. And very good classes like Deathknight. I played on a very high level I would say.\n\nIn the past there were no cheaters in WoW. The humans played themselves and skill mattered in the past in WoW. I can remember one time I played with a very good nightelv warrior together in Alteractal during BC and we both alone stopped the whole team of the horde. That was my best PvP experience in my whole life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"x R e n g a R x","date":"2016-06-14T04:00:08.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what someone said 4 years ago...\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}
