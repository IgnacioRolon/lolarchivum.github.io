I found the same case before my reply earlier.\nThere are many types of cases, like account recovery, where most of the work is done outside the view of the player. In this case I can see that two Rioters have been working on your particular case, and that number may grow as the investigation progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"GÔÐ","date":"2014-08-06T07:12:18.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long should this process take?

I imagine that providing as much info upfront as it sounds like you did could be part of why you haven't had a response to the ticket at all yet. They've got enough info to go off of for now, and are looking into it. If you had given less info, they probably would have had somebody respond to the ticket asking for more info. And then it would go silent for a bit while they look into it.\n\nBut seriously, relax about the time part of it. Two days is nothing, especially for something that's as big a deal as handing an account over from one person to another. They really don't want to mess that one up. Sometimes tickets can take even a couple weeks to close out. I had a client issue not long ago that took about two weeks to clear up. At any rate, it sounds like it's not even your current main account, so just use whatever your current one is for the time being.","replies":[{"poster":"GÔÐ","date":"2014-08-06T22:35:41.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope that's the case..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thoroniul","date":"2014-08-06T14:12:15.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What steps can we take as precaution to make it easier too prevent stealing of accounts?

Now someone has access to your juicy game account and the person doesn't like you much. Not a good combo. :(\n\nFor phishing, many players get tempted by free RP, or other social engineering scams. The *only *place you should be entering your LoL username and password are within the client and on leagueoflegends.com. \n\nThe easiest way to better secure your account is to verify your email. This can be done when logged into leagueoflegends.com, and you get a free 4-win IP boost by doing it! Also, you should have a different password for your LoL and email account.  \n\n\nAs for the best way to prove ownership, I really can't say. First because every case is unique, and second because the bad guys can read this and adjust their bad ways accordingly. If you're dealing with an account recovery case, we will ask you privately for all the information we might need to resolve it. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
