At this point, you should hold down the power button until the computer turns itself off.\n\nWhile I'm not sure what the progress has been made on fixing this issue, the following solution is a temporary measure which I found corrected the issue.\n------------------------\n\n[1] Navigate to the following directory (assuming default installation location): \n\nC:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.XXX\\deploy\\League of Legends.exe\n\n> 0.0.1.XXX should be the highest numbered directory in this location.  I don't believe there should be more than one, but I mention this just in case.\n\n[2] Right-click \"League of Legends\" executable and select \"Properties\"\n\n[3] Select the Compatibility Tab\n\n[4] Ensure the checkbox for running this file with Compatibility Mode is checked\n\n[5] Select \"Windows 7\" from the dropdown.  Other versions of Windows may work, but I haven't tested them.\n----------------------------\nHopefully, this will get you fixed up.  If it doesn't best of luck to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-13T20:23:58.008+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The freezing after the anniversary update appears to be an issue with the Xbox game bar.
