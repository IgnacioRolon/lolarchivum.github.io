We also felt there were some cool opportunities in this skin - especially particles, which is something Zilean's other skins were severely lacking. \n\nThat said, we're always open to giving a champion a new look, and we don't limit skin lines to five skins just because they have 'a full team comp'. Many have suggested Blood Moon Zed, or Blood Moon Diana, and I think both of those have potential to be cool looking skins.","replies":[{"poster":"lxlLilybellelxl","date":"2015-04-13T17:49:08.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"can people stop asking for bloodmon zed.. kennen deserves the blood moon skin first.

I'm not seeing it with Zilean, and just because she's moon-themed, doesn't mean Diana should automatically have one.

As someone who has been fighting for a Zilean skin since Seasons 2, I am not sure how I feel about this. I even had multiple Red comments, such as Meddler and Damiya, before she left.\n\nAt the very least I am happy that Zilean was shown some attention. Despite being one of the original champions of league it felt like Riot had abandoned him. Recently at Pax East 2015 I met Meddler in person right after the League panel on Friday. When I asked about the status of Zilean and if there would be any potential visual updates. He told me that it wouldn't be for a long time. As a company known for '**Soonâ„¢**'. It made me believe that we wouldn't get a new Zilean skin or update for at least another season. \n\nDespite how well it looks, and don't get me wrong it looks amazing! (Great job skins team). This is not something that would be for Zilean. I fully understand that this is Riot's game and they are able to change what they deem fit. But Blood Moon Zilean? It feels like this was a themed that was chosen from a hat. As though it was chosen simply to make Zilean edgy, which isn't what Zilean is supposed to be. \n\nWho is Zilean? An old man? A time wizard? Beard enthusiast? Sure, these could be used to describe him. But they aren't what he is. He is a watcher. One who has seen death an innumerable amount of times. One who's suffering has pushed him past the boundaries of good and evil of normal beings. As described by Vel'Koz's lore, Zilean has horded technology. These marvels so wondrous, so magnificent, that they could advance all of Runeterra decades, if not centuries in the future.  They were enough to convince Vel'Koz to follow the Institutes rules, just to learn more about Zilean. Now, most people would be thinking, 'Madlock, why isn't Zilean sharing these great items with the rest of the world?' He has. Take the Chronomancy powered air-ships he constructed with Janna for Piltover. Was it solely to help them? Possibly, though unlikely. \n\nZilean's main goal, his entire reason for joining the League, is to cure his Chronodysplacia and save his people from their fate. He doesn't care for the other civilizations of Runeterra, because he already has his own, and then watches it be destroyed countless times. Then rebuilt as if nothing has ever happened. But how Madlock? The 'Chronodysplacia' I mentioned earlier? Yeah, it makes him see all of his timelines at the same time. He sees his past, his beloved city sprawling with life. He sees his present, his civilization crumbled beneath the sands of time and blood of brothers. He sees his future, a future we can only guess at. \n\nThis is why I feel the Blood Moon theme isn't something that Zilean should have. Zilean is not an assassin. Zilean is not a killer. He exists only to save his people. Before Time Bomb, before Rewind, before Chronoshift, there is Urtistan. This is his theme. It is not time, it is not death. It is beyond both. It is Zilean.\n\nEdit: Despite all this hard work, Riot won't respond :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"roflSong","date":"2015-04-09T21:06:28.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played around with Ziliean a bit when he got a rework, but the blood moon skin makes me actually _excited _  to play him.

I'm so looking forward to the skin and really learning Ziliean now, and even if they tweak some things like the colors I don't mind, as long as they don't hit the filter button I'll be getting it on release. ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"some taters","date":"2015-05-07T01:03:35.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When's the skin supposed to come out?
