So I ran the tests that I saw a support person post on another post and figured I would post it here. Can we please solve this, I don't know if I can handle ping spikes of almost 150.\r\n\r\nOverall Connection Score for This Game\r\n83\r\n/100 \r\nAvg Latency\t88.91 ms\r\nAvg Packet Loss\t6.51%\r\nAvg Jitter\t24.81 ms\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n\r\n|                        \r\n\r\n|                  \r\n\r\n|host-69-144-72-165.msl-mt.client.bresnan.net -    0 |  277 |  277 |    8 |   32 |  580 |   12 |\r\n\r\n|  host-69-144-192-143.static.bresnan.net -    0 |  277 |  277 |    8 |   33 |  574 |   12 |\r\n\r\n|ldvco001hb6-ls-0-3-0-U96.int.bresnan.net -    0 |  277 |  277 |   13 |   38 |  584 |   13 |\r\n\r\n|  host-72-175-110-219.static.bresnan.net -    0 |  277 |  277 |   13 |   37 |  583 |   17 |\r\n\r\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   56 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|                   No response from host -  100 |   56 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |\r\n\r\n|                             4.59.253.98 -    0 |  277 |  277 |   51 |   77 |  576 |   56 |\r\n\r\n|                          104.160.138.35 -    0 |  277 |  277 |   52 |   78 |  579 |   53 |\r\n\r\n|          ae34-br01.chi01.riotdirect.net -    0 |  277 |  277 |   65 |   92 |  586 |   66 |\r\n\r\n|                           104.160.131.1 -    0 |  277 |  277 |   66 |   94 |  585 |   70 |\r\n\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n\r\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-23T04:04:40.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So these two lines.....\n\n> | No response from host - 100 | 56 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n> \n> | No response from host - 100 | 56 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\nare showing some *major* packet loss. Packet loss means your connection is getting damaged before it ever reaches our server, which means it's not something we can fix on our end. Typically this is caused by a damaged or improperly working ISP node, but overall it'd be best to reach out to your ISP with this data to show them proof that something may not be working correctly. In the meantime, you could try using a VPN to get a better route to our server, but that should only be a temp fix.","replies":[{"poster":"xGogeta","date":"2017-11-23T04:16:03.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will try the VPN throughout the holiday, but my ISP is a little special, for being a major company.
