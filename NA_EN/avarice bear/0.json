Lately my client's been acting up. For example, when I try to create a party I won't even load and won't be able to click the 'confirm match' button to start a queue. Sometimes when it works I'll be stuck at the accept the game screen. When that works, I'll be stuck at the 'ban a champ' or 'pick a champ' screen. Finally got fed up so I decided to reinstall my leagues. Deleting the application, redownloaded it, and now I'm stuck at 0% on the actual download (got the dmg file just fine, got the icon to my applications folder just fine, it's when the client opens to actually download where I'm stuck at). And the 'disable login music' button doesn't even work so I'm stuck listening to Zoe's theme music over and over again unless I mute my entire laptop. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-05T21:23:58.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds frustrating, especially with reinstalling.  :(  The symptoms you're reporting here all suggest a possible network issue specifically reaching our services.
