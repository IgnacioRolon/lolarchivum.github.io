It's likely that one of those charges will not go through at all.  Even in cases of a possible double charge, we will be happy to help resolve that!  \n\nI looked into this for you and see that you currently have two tickets open.  It's likely one will be closed to prevent confusion or delay in responding, and the other has been escalated to our billing team.  It's important not to reply to your ticket until you receive a response, or it can drop you to the bottom of the queue.  In the meantime, there are a lot of players who need our help and selecting to spam the boards or suggest malicious intent towards support won't expedite a response.  Our team will review your ticket and respond as soon as possible; hang tight!","replies":[{"poster":"Hipster69","date":"2016-09-28T20:55:02.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for robbing me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hipster69","date":"2016-09-28T18:15:19.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot you can't just take my money and ignore me like this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hipster69","date":"2016-09-28T17:05:54.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot please reply, this is some serious stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hipster69","date":"2016-09-28T19:22:02.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think my matter is much more important and should be has a higher priority than bug fixes","replies":[]}]}
