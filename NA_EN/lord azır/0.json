The screen will just freeze up and then a few seconds later the bugsplat report option will pop up. If I try to get back into the game the game is literally stuck at 3 FPS and the game looks like a slide show. If I alt + tab though the FPS goes back up to 15. The only fix I've found for this is restarting my computer. All other games run exactly the same as they normally do during these periods, so it's not the graphics card. Running a 750 ti though with a i5 - 4590.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-12T16:49:16.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have outdated drivers, corrupt game files, or hardware issues that's causing the game to crash.
