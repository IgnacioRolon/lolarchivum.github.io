I presently have 180-200k IP. I have all the champs I want, and all the runes I want. Right now I have 46 keys. Unless they allow us to purchase chests or something with BE, I&#039;ll just have a renamed currency in large amounts to continue to sit on. I saw no mention of what kind of stuff they&#039;ll allow old farts like me to spend it on. Emotes are the most annoying thing about league in my opinion. Aside from giving us a new one to spam, has there been any mention of anything cool or interesting to do with the new currency system?","replies":[]}
