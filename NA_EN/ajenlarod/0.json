When I was a more... dedicated player. But this game, seems that once someone is fed up, or the other side decides to troll, no way to catch back up, and it's just a steam roll. Maybe it is a different way. Sure, I'm all ears.","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-05-11T16:40:44.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the problem is that league is a very snowbally game. It's a slippery slope downhill once someone gets tilted, fed up, or decides to troll - as you've pointed out.\n\nSo with league it has to be all preemptive. Start the game off on the right foot, be cheerful or at least kind in chat, and show people that you've got their back even if things go wrong. If they see you as an ally from the very beginning it's going to be a lot less likely for them to decide to ruin the game for you out of spite.\n\nIt's much easier to maintain morale than it is to re-build morale after shit has hit the fan.\n\nIt's really useful to control conversations with verb tense. People use different tenses for different things.\n\n1. Past tense is always used to attribute credit or blame for what happened.\n - This means that any time you talk in the past tense, people are going to think you're trying to divvy up either credit or blame. It's subconscious and they aren't going to realize it, but that's how they will react instinctually.\n - Complimenting people for good plays, regardless of whether they contributed significantly to them.\n  - Example: If jungle ganks a lane and the laner kills the enemy laner with minimal help from the jungler, you still want to compliment the jungler for being there and ganking. Because in the future you will still want them to continue ganking, so rewarding them with praise for doing so is beneficial even in that situation.\n - Also, criticizing people - while sometimes helpful - is usually not going to work. People are too defensive, and too easily offended. And it's too easy to say something meaner than intended in the heat of the moment. All of this combines to make criticizing others for their choices or play into a very high risk, low reward act. It's just not worth it.\n - So after a bad play steer the conversation away from past tense. And after a good play, be sure to _use_ past tense and give credit to everyone involved.\n2. Present tense is used to talk about values. It can also be used to align said values, and make people feel like you are on their side.\n - People will often talk about how they feel or how broken or unfair something is. They will get distracted by this and lose focus on what they need to keep doing or what needs to be done next, so it's important to steer them away from this.\n - Don't dismiss their feelings though, because that's a big mistake if you want them to look at you as an ally (which you should, because that makes it easier to get them to listen to you when you make calls or offer advice).\n - My suggestion is to say something agreeable (just to make them feel supported) and then point out, \"we can't really change that though, so lets try and figure out how to deal with it better for the rest of the game.\"\n3. Future tense is used to talk about choices, it's for making plans and then executing on them.\n - Future tense is where the magic happens. \n - League is am RTS at heart, there's constantly things happening and maintaining focus on what comes next as well as on what needs to be done is really important. Keeping people thinking about what comes next and about what needs to be done is a great way to keep them from getting distracted by arguing about blame or complaining about unfairness.\n\nPutting all this into practice, you can intercept a person as they start to tilt, make them feel camaraderie with you, and then refocus them on what can be done or what needs to be done to overcome obstacles in the future. I've put this into practice across many of my matches in league, particularly over the past year and a half, and it's worked very well for me - when I actually use it at least.","replies":[{"poster":"AjenLarod","date":"2018-05-13T00:31:53.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, I did not expect that. Everything you say seems like very detailed, like psycologically. Copy paste, or did you actually know all of that on the top of your head?

Sadly, it doesn't help much getting steamrolled, because as I said, mostly all of my matches have been snowball'd, so I hope getting to ranked, would make it more tactical, like HoN or DotA, and less steamroll","replies":[{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2018-05-14T16:34:31.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a topic I've discussed at length numerous times.

It's mostly based on rhetoric and logic, it happens to correlate to psychology but what I learned about the verb tenses I actually learned from \"Thank you for Arguing,\" by Jay Heinrich.\n\nI agree, with the way the game is balanced / how matchmaking chooses opponents / other factors... It's just super snowbally right now which leads to more people getting frustrated. There's only so much we can do to keep our teammates from tilting, and some of them will simply be beyond help. The strategies I've discussed here do still work, but like you've said with things being this snowbally it's a lot harder.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2018-05-06T21:47:51.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not think of them as trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"AjenLarod","date":"2018-05-08T13:29:27.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, they are, they either flame me, my teammates or my opponents, feed on purpose, or go afk.
