Jg tells me to definitely go gnar because we need more tankiness. Ok, cool with me. I'm a shit Gnar so I could use practice anyways.\r\n\r\nProceeds to play horrible game vs. Nasus top (which may be a completely fine match up for Gnar, I've just never played closely against Nasus, or played Gnar very well).\r\n\r\nEnd game.

(at least not in bronze - gold ) \n\nyou go 0/2 and its \"/all GG REPORTS FEEDER PLOX!!\"","replies":[{"poster":"waspcreaturesx","date":"2016-02-17T04:30:03.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't different whatsoever actually, with dynamic queue. I was going to play draft pick normals. Saw the draft pick part, was talking to someone and didn't read the rest. Queued as jg/top, as I would have for normals. Went through picks and bands which again, occur in normals as well. I'm actually failing to see which parts are so night and day different.\n\nThere are literally two options side my side. Both say draft pick. Only difference whatsoever is that one says ranked and one says normal. But nothing else is even different.\n\nNot defending my mistake just thought it was hilarious when I realized it was ranked and I had queued for my worst roles. Not blaming the flame either, I'd be pissed in the same situation. Guess I should pay more attention :'D","replies":[]}]}]}
