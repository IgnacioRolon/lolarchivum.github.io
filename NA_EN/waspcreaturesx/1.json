I was going to pick Jinx, but the enemy adc got her so I picked Cait. \r\n\r\nGame starts, Sona support is AFK.\r\n\r\nI ask the JG Diana for assistance. \r\n\r\nLong story short: answer is no. \r\n\r\nI proceed to sit under tower as the enemy Jinx and Karma bot lane bring the minions to me. I try to CS, but the second I hit a minion I get Karma Q&#039;d to the face. Hit another minion, Jinx W. The harassment goes on, I get low, I back off. I can&#039;t steadily CS. Under normal circumstances, I could CS under tower just fine. However, with two enemy botlaners poking me the second I get into range of them (under tower or not), I was left with 6 CS by about 6 minutes.\r\n\r\nI pinged for assistance, jungler refused to help. Why? Supposedly because I&#039;m cait, I have the longest range in the game so I should be able to CS fine. Jungler proceeds to gank top before even trying to help bot lane.

Obviously not.\r\n\r\nMy point is that teams need to be more understanding and take in ALL the circumstances in order to judge someone&#039;s play. If the support AFKs, the Jungler should be helping bot lane. If lanes don&#039;t overextend, lanes can survive ganks, but there&#039;s little that can be done about a constant 1v2, especially when they are one that can and will poke you to death. \r\n\r\nMore generally; if someone is having trouble against their lane opponent, instead of harassing them about it, do what you can, when you can to help. \r\n\r\nTLDR; When supports AFK, HELP the 1v2ing squishy on your team.

Help ANYONE struggling on your team.\n\nAs a jungler, this is a choice. Not always necessarily the correct one. In fact, in your case, almost definitely not the correct one. The point of ganking is to get a kill by forcing a 2v1 situation. Going out of your way to force a less than equal fight (since you're underfarmed), is often going to end badly and just make that lane worse for you. God forbid the enemy jungler happens to be in the area.  \n\nI'll probably get flack for this and I don't mean to be some edgy hardass, but you can farm just fine 2v1 as Cait. You're only gonna drag your team down further if you force your jungler to sacrifice his income to sit around and camp you. \n\nDo notice the way you responded to being thrown under the bus is just to throw the jungler under the bus (even if you didn't say in game and only just now).

My point was that I can't CS when I'm practically being dove under tower by two people.

However, if I'm being shoved out of lane so hard that we're losing towers, I just assumed it would be logical to even it out a little bit (at least until the Supp connected) so that the towers weren't lost so early in game. \n\nAs I've said, I won't claim to be an AMAZING league player.

She's all around the perfect ADC for this situation. Making due with this situation is a lot about understanding how to manage the wave, and with Q and a passive that does massive bonus damage to minions, you can do that. If they're tower diving you, you have traps to keep them there and restrict their movement.

If she stayed in ur lane and helped, then she would've just been another target for their practicing on until she hits 6. By that time, it'd be pretty much over. It's Diana.\n\nFor the poking problem: Do you know how to animation cancel? I'm high bronze and I do, at least with some basic abilities and auto attacks. Well, if you do, dodging the Jinx W and Karma Q should've been rather easy. I mean, a cast time of at least a half a second with average projectile speed isn't exactly the best for long range poke. Karma's has less range, less cast time, but also a much slow projectile speed. We're talking about two very easy to dodge projectiles here.\nBack to animation canceling: If you do it, you move around a lot more even while attacking, so you're in a place for much less time. Thus making it harder to land a skillshot on you.\n\nTo sum it up: Learn to animation cancel (kiting, with auto's), dodge, and know your ally champion's (and enemy champion's) capabilities. Sure you would've been poked down by Jinx rockets, but staying far enough under turret makes that a risk for her. With the minions pushed under your tower, you should get roughly 3-4 CS each wave if you're bad (in other words, if ur me). Being under your turret means no minions to hide behind (but then Jinx would've just poked with Q and Karma with Ult+Q, but also means that you're much further away (especially cuz ur Cait).","replies":[{"poster":"waspcreaturesx","date":"2016-01-20T02:18:29.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand what you're saying, but I was very far behind my tower and both of them were at the very edge of the towers range, if not coming underneath it to poke me and then back up. \n\nI don't animation practice animation cancelling, and I don't really play champion that are reliant on it as much (like riven, etc).

She prob pushed out the wave, which is good in normal circumstances but not if ur behind and trying to freeze.\n\nI think putting traps on the edge of the turrets range would be a good idea (free headshot if they step into it), and clearing the wave with Q (and picking up a few CS as well as forcing the enemies to move, aka don't poke back, to dodge it). With how far away you were, it's... really strange since Karma's Q only has 950 range (think of it as about 2~3 minions more than ur auto attack, I think) with a 7 second cd at rank 1, and Jinx W has a 10 second cd at rank, so... there really couldn't have been that many... y'know?\n\nAnyway, if you still are dying under turret (or forced to back), let them take it. Stand just in range for the xp, but let them take it so you can farm under your second turret. If they continue to poke, call for a top, mid, and/or jg gank. 2 squishies with low hard CC against 1 assassin, 1 assassin/mage, and a bruiser/tank?
