(the gold he gets will be more beneficial since hes an assassin at this point in the game.)\n\nA second example: Their team is setting up for baron, one member jump in and assassinates their ADC/jungler for his life -- this very likely would stop them from baroning since they would be lacking the DPS or smite\n\nThese are just two examples of a few where it could be beneficial","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Poetic Zed","date":"2016-01-29T04:23:41.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In most scenarios yeah.
