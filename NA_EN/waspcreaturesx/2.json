Is that really all the champions they've done so far? Cuz that is a little depressing they've only 20 of 130 champs done. I sort of assumed they were further along by now. \n\nThat and my dislike of a decent sized portion of the new lores just leaves me feel worse off than I did prior to finding out how much they've done.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-05-03T09:51:46.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20 champions are done in the new format but the amount of lore that's actually canon is much greater than that. Just about everything from the start of 2014 till now can pretty safetly be considered canon, and 2013 stuff is also pretty safe. The problem lies in the fact that there are some huge outliers in champions like Jax, Nocturne, Fiddlesticks etc, and in regions like Bandle City. \n\nProgress isn't quick but there's progress at least; that's how I view things. The Shurima stuff is right around the corner, so that'll bump the number up to 30. Adding the champions who've also been said to be getting long form lore soon either as a fix or for a VGU, Ryze, Yorick, Tahm Kench, Ekko and Bard are there, so we're at 35 at least, meaning we'll have double the amount. As Green said, last year we got 13 fully updated lores and that only started a little over half way through the year. We've got 7 over the last 5 months and 15 on the way, so the pace is picking up somewhat.\n\nAlso I'm no expert; I just draw appropriate conclusions from the information that Riot provides on such matters. I'm a herald of information, not an expert on the inner workings of Riot games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2016-05-02T19:01:07.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well those are at least the ones who have the updated new lore format(consisting of a bio+color text)\nOther champs also have lores that are considered canon,but they are still written in an old format(like Gnars lore for example,his lore is actually more comparable to a color text).\n\nAnyway at least it seems like they are finally picking up speed,I mean they said that the shurima lores will come soon(likely around taliyahs release within the next weeks),if that is true,then we'll get ~5-10 full lores at once depending on how many shurima lore they'll actually update.\n\nfor comparison last year we've got only 12,even if you count the new champs,this year we've got already 7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Igotlazy","date":"2016-05-02T18:46:23.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much everything from the Freljord event onward in terms of Lore is confirmed to be Canon. More isolated events like Rengar and Kha'Zix's stories are probably still good too. The real issue is that they haven't told us what was kept and what was thrown away on a case by case basis. For example, we weren't sure if all of Zed's stuff 100% still applied until Jhin's color text confirmed it.\n\nOverall though champs that were really hit by the retcon were those whose stories involved the League. Jax, Fiddle and Nocturne are pretty much non-existent at the moment.
