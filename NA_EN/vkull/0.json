Sometimes...","subforum":"Report a Bug","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I know there&#039;s a few people here having the stuck at 30 fps issue but for whatever reason mine fixed itself after I restarted my client. Other issues I noticed during that session was I couldn&#039;t use the practice or vs bot game modes but I could use regular, ranked and customs on the various maps.\r\n\r\nI restarted my client and all seemed fine after. My main issue is I primarily play ranked and to have the odd game cap me at 30 fps is very annoying. Restarting client in the middle of a ranked match is not a viable fix as I&#039;m sure y&#039;all understand.\r\n\r\nThis issue just started happening after last update.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-01-18T04:19:48.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have vsync enabled in-game or in your gpu configuration? 30 fps on a 60Hz monitor is normal if you are you able to meet or exceed 60 fps.","replies":[]}]}
