I submitted a recovery request almost 3 days ago and still not reply. They did say they are experiencing high volumes of requests but its still taking a bit.

No sweat, though, because any response you receive will be sent to your email.  You'll be able to use your email to reply back as well!  Looking into this for you, it looks like you've got a few tickets open on this.  Response time will be a bit depending on the size of the queue, so hang tight as more tickets can cause delays in responding.  The account team will reach out to you as soon as possible!","replies":[{"poster":"Boujee Stripper","date":"2016-10-19T18:16:36.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you so much, i was worried i wouldnt be getting riots reply, now im at ease about atleast having a chance to get my account back, now its just a waiting game lol. ^.^","replies":[]}]}]}
