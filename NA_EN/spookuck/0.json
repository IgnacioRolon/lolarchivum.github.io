I'm definitely not gonna say that kinda stuff in chat anymore as it was the first time id ever gotten frustrated like that so is there a way to lose the status or something cuz I've put time and money into this game and I'd hate to just lose it, and I understand I got the punishment I deserved but is there a way to change my rep or something cuz this is honestly the first time ive been a douche in chat and I dont wanna be stuck with that label forever for just one bad game. Also im really scared of being false reported now and getting banned for just having a bad game or having different ideas than my other teammates or any conflict whatsoever that would get people to report me for doing nothing remotely toxic. Any help would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-03-02T07:43:56.170+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The next _valid_ report will result in a permaban. It is _sometimes_ possible to demonstrate months/years of good behavior and reduce the tier of your next punishment (meaning a second 14-day instead of a perma), but don't count on it. Basically, no more poor behavior or that's the end of your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PH45","date":"2019-03-02T07:41:33.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">  am I gonna get falsely reported sometime \n\nFalse reports don't do anything. The system checks you, and if you've done nothing wrong, the reports get thrown in the trash.\n\n> but is there a way to change my rep or something cuz this is honestly the first time ive been a douche in chat and I dont wanna be stuck with that label forever for just one bad game.\n\nYou got to show in games that you aren't toxic. Just play the game, and over time as your honor level goes up etc your report level will go down, but it'll take a lot of games so don't risk it by typing stupid sh%t in the chat, just leave that behind.\n\n\n\n> Also im really scared of being false reported now and getting banned for just having a bad game \n\nAs I said, false reports don't do anything, if you don't break the rules, you are fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2019-03-02T07:37:05.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For the foreseeable future, any valid report could tip you over the edge. It is possible to drop in punishment tiers, but it will take roughly 200 games of neutral or positive behavior. There is no magic number given though. \n\nDon't bite at bait. Don't get snarky. Avoid sarcasm.

The system is _more strict_ against people who've received multiple punishments. It's not unfair, these people have nobody to blame but themselves because _their actions_ got them punished. \n\nIf you actually think it's \"unfair bias\" to crack down on repeat offenders, I don't know what to tell you.\n\n>If your chatlog contains anything that can be interpreted as sarcastic by the rabid SJW working at support, the perma won't be lifted.\n\n Yikes.\n\n I guess being a decent person means I'm a \"rabid SJW\" now.\n\n>You can't act just like a decent or(god forbid) average person now.\n\n Wrong again.\n\n You can act normally.

Rabid SJW seeks to ban words and occasionally compel speech.\n\nIf you think \"gj\" to a dying teammate should warrant a permaban in a videogame under any circumstances, you are also suffering from utopic delusions.\n\n>  Wrong again.\n> \n>  You can act normally.
