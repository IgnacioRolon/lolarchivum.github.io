Somehow this seems wrong.\n{{champion:17}} What is wrong?\n{{champion:57}} Just placing saplings all over the map and waiting for people to walk into them.\n{{champion:17}} And what is wrong with that?\n{{champion:57}} Well...I mean shouldn&#039;t we be fighting or something.  I mean I am a tank.\n{{champion:17}} Do you have any shields?\n{{champion:57}} No.\n{{champion:17}} Armor or magic resistance buffs?\n{{champion:57}} no.\n{{champion:17}} Do you gain a bonus to your max health?\n{{champion:57}} No but I do heal a bit.\n{{champion:17}} So you have sustain for laning?\n{{champion:57}} Well....yeah.\n{{champion:17}} Does that sound like a tank to you?\n{{champion:57}} No...not really....but I mean I'm supposed to be a top laner right?\n{{champion:17}} Yes, you are but now you do it my way.  Riot brought you to me as a mess of a champion in need of a rework.  So I have been training you.\n{{champion:57}} But...all you&#039;ve told me is to place saplings all over the place and build ap.\n{{champion:17}} Exactly, and now we wait for some fool to come and fight us.  Normally the jungler.\n{{champion:57}} But...shouldn&#039;t I help the team?\n{{champion:17}} NO!\n{{champion:57}} Why?\n{{champion:17}} Because the enemy will come to you and you will be ready.  If you really had a team they would come to you and your saplings.\n{{champion:57}} I donno.\n{{champion:17}} Shhh. Wait.  I hear someone coming.\n{{champion:86}} Damacia.  Do do do do.  Damacia.  Do do do do.\n&quot;Sapling runs at Garren&quot;\n{{champion:86}} Oh.  Hey you cute thing.  Are you lost?\n&quot;explodes on Garren&quot;\n{{champion:86}} Gah....my god...this ouch....  I think I&#039;ll just.... &quot;steps on mushroom&quot;\n&quot;explodes&quot;\n{{champion:86}} ......gah......&quot;crawling away&quot;\n{{champion:17}} Okay, now you go and attack him.\n{{champion:57}} Isn&#039;t that....kinda dirty?\n{{champion:17}} Nah.  Here, jsut toss another sapling.  That should do the trick.\n&quot;ENEMY SLAIN&quot;\n{{champion:57}} That...seemed really easy.\n{{champion:17}} I know right?  They just keep walking into them.  Hell, yours chase them down.\n{{champion:57}} Yeah, I guess so.  So I just need to build Liandry&#039;s?\n{{champion:17}} Yep.  You don&#039;t even need to kill them, they just need to keep heading back to base with no CS.\n{{champion:57}} I&#039;m still not comfortable with this.\n{{champion:17}} Alright, alright.  here.  &quot;hands Maokai a little green mushroom hat&quot;\n{{champion:57}} What will this do?\n{{champion:17}} Just put it on.\n{{champion:57}} ......&quot;Puts it on&quot;\n{{champion:17}} Do you understand now.\n{{champion:57}} Not really.\n{{champion:17}} well give it time.  If you start finding everyone hating you you will know you're on the right track.\n{{champion:57}} What?  Hating me?  Why?\n{{champion:17}} I don&#039;t know.\n{{champion:57}} Are you sure I can&#039;t just build a Sunfire cape?\n{{champion:17}} Nope.\n{{champion:57}} But I liked being a tank.\n{{champion:17}} Sorry Riot left you in my charge.  They said to rework you into something new.\n{{champion:57}} But I liked the old me.\n{{champion:17}} Well...i mean if you really want to I could probably train you to be a support tank.\n{{champion:57}} NO....no anything but that!\n{{champion:17}} Alright then.  AP Maokai it is.\n{{champion:57}} Why do I have a bad feeling about this.\n{{champion:17}} bah, don't worry about it.  We will give you some more changes to follow up with the rework.\n{{champion:57}} A really really really bad feeling.","replies":[{"poster":"Velzard of Koz","date":"2017-05-12T01:31:52.228+0000","up_votes":71,"down_votes":0,"body":"He became such a offense to his family roots.","replies":[{"poster":"Sraeg2013","date":"2017-05-12T16:35:51.430+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://i.giphy.com/ac7MA7r5IMYda.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-05-13T18:36:47.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But at least they did leaf something of his old self.
