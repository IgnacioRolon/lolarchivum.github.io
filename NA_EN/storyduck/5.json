What are you both up to?\n{{champion:114}}: Oh, I was just explaining to Lux that I can reflect light with my sword.\n{{champion:99}}: Wait, what?\n{{champion:86}}: Oh, yeah sure you can.  I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t know that Lux.  I use my sword as a mirror all the time.\n{{champion:99}}: No, no you can&#039;t parry light like that.\n{{champion:114}} {{champion:86}}: Yes you can, you just have to polish your weapon enough.\n{{champion:24}}: Really any weapon can it just takes a lot of polish.\n{{champion:86}}: Oh, I didn&#039;t see you there Jax.  Why are you here?\n{{champion:24}}: I was just being the judge to their duel.\n{{champion:99}}: You cannot just parry light like that and you certainly can&#039;t do it with a lamp.\n{{champion:24}}: Challenge accepted.  Go ahead try and shoot me.\n{{champion:99}}: If it will stop this ridiculous argument.  FINAL SPARK!\n&quot;BOZEEM&quot;\n{{champion:24}}: *&quot;Riposte*&quot;\n{{champion:99}}: AAAAAAAH, how did you do that?\n{{champion:24}}: I just put a lot of lamp polish on my lamp and then you swing it fast.\n{{champion:99}}: No...well not just that, how did you even do that?  That is one of Fiora&#039;s skills.\n{{champion:24}}: What riposte?  Any swordsman &quot;Looks at Fiora&quot; or swordswoman can do it.  It&#039;s a pretty basic technique.\n{{champion:86}}: Yeah, I can do it too.\n{{champion:99}}: But...but YOU'RE RIPOSTING LIGHT!\n{{champion:86}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:24}}: You just have to polish your weapon enough.\n{{champion:99}}: NO, YOU CAN&#039;T JUST POLISH A WEAPON AND PARRY LIGHT!\n{{champion:164}}: What is all this shouting for?\n{{champion:114}}: Lux seems to think we can&#039;t parry light if we polish our weapons.\n{{champion:164}}: Oh, well of course you can.

It really gives us a good opportunity to parry your light beam.\n{{champion:114}}: Oh, for certain.  It makes it so easy to time our parries.\n{{champion:86}}: I can probably parry it too.\n{{champion:44}}: Hey guys, whats up?\n{{champion:24}}: Lux is having trouble accepting that light can be parried by our weapons.\n{{champion:44}}: Oh, the polish right?\n{{champion:24}}: Yeah.\n{{champion:44}}:  Well, it could be worse Lux.\n{{champion:99}}: ?\n{{champion:44}}: Try and hit me.\n{{champion:99}}: Whatever.....Final Spark.\n&quot;BOZEEM&quot;\n{{champion:44}}: See.\n{{champion:99}}: You...you didn&#039;t do anything.  My spell...it had no effect.\n{{champion:44}}: I know.  I&#039;ve covered my body with polish.  I don&#039;t need to parry.\n{{champion:99}}: he did....but an.....if then.... &quot;wonders off muttering to herself&quot;\n{{champion:86}}: ....I should probably umm...watch her.\n{{champion:24}}: Science is a cruel mistress.
