Lucian, Graves, and Draven for example. Take these along with an aggressive support like Thresh or Leona and you're solid to shut her down for the rest of the game just through lane.\n\nYes, her early game isn't as bad as everyone says it is, but it's still pretty weak in comparison to others (like the aforementioned adcs/supports above)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkrius2g","date":"2015-08-29T21:31:11.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add 8 bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ultra da boy","date":"2015-08-29T18:53:25.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne, even with a QSS, get's royally fucked by {{champion:53}} Cant QSS the pull or the knock up, by then she's dead.\n {{champion:201}} Q?

You have at least 2 jumps on your ult, presuming you landed the Q.\n{{champion:111}} Of all the supports right now. With ignite, he can probably solo your AD. Not even gonna mention that CC.

IMO, worse than vayne. Can't QSS his ult. By the time you land you're crit for 9000% damage\n {{champion:254}} Fuck. That. Ulti. A nightmare for all ADCs. countered with banshee's veil, but bait that out and you wont even have to ult the enemy adc with how much zoning power you have\n{{champion:23}} Literally invincible glass cannon against a squishy adc. you do the math.\n {{champion:14}} probably the most CC one single person can bring to a team.
