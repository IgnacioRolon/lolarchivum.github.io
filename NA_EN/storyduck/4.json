You also assume the enemy team will throw, I'm plat 4 so we are not talking bronze players that miss 50% of their skills, build triforce on soraka, or lack complete map awareness.  They are not going to throw such a massive lead.","replies":[{"poster":"Automated Riven","date":"2017-05-03T04:07:15.560+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am sorry.

Which might also avoid HAVING/BEING FORCED to play that same champion the next game if he played a decent amount of minutes to satisfy him in that game.\n- A player might refuse to FF when the players initiating the Surrender Vote are being extremely toxic and childish. That player can proceed to mute those players and hold them hostage in their own toxic game as punishment.\n- And games CAN be thrown, maybe not the higher Elo you go, but the more you go down, you'll notice that throwing no matter how big the lead, is VERY common.\n\nI can go on really but what's the point really? And I can actually list more reasons for not surrendering by the way.\nYou're probably just going to ignore the valid reasons I've shared, and you and everyone else on here will downvote this to the abyss like every other reply defending the refusal to surrender.\n\nUltimately there is a vote in place for a reason. If someone refuses to surrender deal with it. Go live in North Korea if you get butthurt with democracy not going your way.\nThis huge rant and circlejerk of salty people downvoting anyone disagreeing with this is pretty pathetic.\n\nEDIT: and also the distinction between surrendering a normal or a ranked game should be done.","replies":[]}]}
