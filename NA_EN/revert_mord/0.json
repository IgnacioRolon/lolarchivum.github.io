RiotScruffy even said on a reddit post that it works like {{champion:236}} {{champion:201}} in terms of how it plays.\r\n\r\nBut unlike synergies like that or {{champion:82}} {{champion:53}}, where the support indirectly makes the adc stronger (whether it be covering weaknesses or like lucian&#039;s case where he can proc 2 stacks of braum passive), Xayah and Rakan&#039;s synergy is forced by the small buffs rakan gives to xayah. This isn&#039;t due to kits being compatible, it&#039;s literally &quot;use this on her and it&#039;s better&quot;. That seems somewhat lazy in terms of making champs compatible and honestly feels like another attempt to &quot;shake up the meta&quot; at bot lane. \r\n\r\nAm I alone on this?","replies":[{"poster":"byakugan123","date":"2017-04-05T21:26:50.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think the lore plays into it because Xayah's shtik (did i spell that right?) is \"She fights for the cause\" and Rakan's is \"He fights for her\" meaning Rakan is supposed to compliment Xayah's kit (I THINK)","replies":[]},{"poster":"reaperteaser","date":"2017-04-05T21:58:35.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like it was intentional, but from the other way around, seems like there was once too much synergy in their kits so the devs changed it to not be super op upon reveal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cub√≠x","date":"2017-04-05T20:55:14.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The minute buffs are more of a push to make them played together. Realistically, based on what I've seen, I feel like their kits also synergize well. Xayah needs time to set up feathers to get out the best of her damage, and granted Rakan is the only one, like thresh or leona, but his kit holds the opponents down pretty well, with the charm/knock up, and adding in her own snare as well. On the flip side Rakan needs to be able  jump around after getting in by moving to other champs and Xayah, similar to caitlyn or jinx, stays far enough away for him to benefit off of this. \n\nSo its not like they're the definitive duo for bot lane, but they do seem to fit the group of champs that benefit of each other, I guess labels like engage supports and spacious adcs would fit them","replies":[{"poster":"REVERT MORD","date":"2017-04-05T21:19:41.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a good explanation.
