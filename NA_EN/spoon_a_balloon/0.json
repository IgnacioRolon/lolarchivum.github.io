This last game, was a person going kaisa, their kaisa got taken so they picked vayne (they were last pick mind you) I was third pick on our team, I went xerath since pyke was banned and it was a kaisa I could poke her. Their support was a koz, then finally our adc picked Vayne into koz and kaisa (he should have went ez but ignored all advice). During the game I was poking their adc and supp with q and our adc was taking all the hits from koz, like i said they would if they went vayne into their comp, and then our adc decides that I was griefing our lane by staying back and poking and decides to leave me alone bot facing adc and supp (something I can handle as xerath once I get more mana) but then settles in middle lane and feeds their yasuo. I reported this person the FACT is Riot never does anything about them, EVER. I get them Nearly EVERY GAME.  The summoner name of this person is PredatorNA. They even said \"I have no problem running it down\"","replies":[{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-09-10T10:25:56.239+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Guaranteed this \"troll\" was fed up with you telling them what champion they should have picked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2019-09-10T05:11:57.367+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Jesus, I almost never get trolls. Its such a rare occurence for me. Something must be off about what your perception of a troll is. Are you in iron/bronze? Like, are you sure theyre not just bad players? (Im talking about in general, since you said nearly every game you have trolls)\n\nAre you ragging on people constantly maybe? Theres a lot of people with low tolerance for anonymous strangers shit talking them, so they often do things in game to spite the person talking shit. This seems more the case given your description. Im not saying their trolling is justified, but for your own sake, stop telling people how to play. You will get much less trolls, like me.
