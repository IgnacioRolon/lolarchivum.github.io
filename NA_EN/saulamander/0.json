You didn't actually have a negative balance, so no worries there. I've synced up your account on our end, and you should be able to see the right IP balance now. If you're still seeing that odd negative, feel free to hit us back up!","replies":[]},{"poster":"u wan sum fuc","date":"2017-04-13T07:58:22.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ngl, did you... relog ? bc that might fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Saulamander","date":"2017-04-13T15:16:13.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeah it did thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
