I was a little worried but also confused as to why they took TP and heal.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of playing it became clear that this was not a m7 on that champ, they played like they were a bot, so I asked who she bought her account from.\r\n\r\nHer and the midlaner LOST THEIR MINDS. It was funny because of how tilted they became and eh i wont deny i inflamed it, but nothing personal (aside from asking if they knew what ironic meant). \r\n\r\nSo, after the game I had a moment to calm down and thought hey, i wasent very nice but that was acceptable levels of banter.\r\n\r\nFigured i would get your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"insomniacjezz","date":"2019-05-10T17:16:39.430+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying it once wonâ€™t get you in trouble, but I could see the IFS catching on if you made it a regular thing and enough people reported you for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Syrile","date":"2019-05-12T03:40:07.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The downvoting on this post is kinda hilarious.\nMakes me wonder how many people bought accounts....","replies":[{"poster":"Red Mage FTS","date":"2019-05-12T16:54:32.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know right?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-05-12T04:40:11.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/65379667/how-wude.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-05-11T05:18:54.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fine by itself but it can very quickly turn into punishable with the replies and responses around it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-05-10T23:29:42.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it clearly depends on Rito's definition, and I assume they have very strict rules, so it may be considered negative, but it just alone should not worth any kind of punishment. (Maybe if you do it more, it will show up as one of the reasons for a chat restriction or something.)\n\nAccording to some other people on the Boards, the banter is more like the opponent's ass licking, so for them it would be clearly considered toxic.\n\nSo in short: This one case should not get you punished, but do not make a habit of it!","replies":[]}]}
