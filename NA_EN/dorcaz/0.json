The same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago. Four bug splats within a 5 minute period. Reconnect to game, bug splat at 32% loading. Got the leaverbuster and couldn't play. Repaired the client two times and it still happened. My drivers are all updated as well and it had never happened to me before. I contacted Riot via support ticket and they STILL left the leaverbuster on my record because \"it created a negative environment for all players\" despite me telling my team I was having problems, they were all invisible in the game, including myself and I could not buy. I even told them I was reconnecting and they still did a remake. Not any of my fault and yet I am still to blame? I'm sure my team wasn't nearly as frustrated as me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"  iHeim  ","date":"2016-09-25T03:32:12.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"windows 10 strikes again","replies":[]}]}
