Meanwhile the ADC's you speak of {{champion:202}} {{champion:21}}  both get oneshot by those guys as well.

This between it's short cooldown and long uptime is a mayor issue.\n\nJust in my last game i played Quinn jungle.

It´s like building lethality lowers the difficulty while allowing you to reap the same rewards. There are a lot of threads about this on the forums. \n\nSo in Korea assassins are permabanned along with Quinn.

However, the examples you created probably aren't there yet.\n\nThe \"Tormented Rod\" is a LOT of AP for its cost (considering how few >80 AP items there are currently), and mages would be likely to pick it up just for that even with the short range on the active. Battle mages or close combat mages in general would certainly take it (Ryze, Lissandra, etc), and it isn't too hard to believe that it could become a standard anti-assassin mage item (You're going to jump on me? Here, let me just mark you, unload my burst, then Zhonya's/Flash and laugh when the mark kills you.)\n\nFor the \"negative stats\" idea, I like it when looking at items like Sterak's Gage (Marksmen abusing it? -20% crit from items) since it's easy to distinguish between the intended class's desired stats and the abusing class's. With AP assassins and mages, it's a bit harder - both like AP, mana, and cdr. I don't know if you could really take any of those away without making the item equally unappealing for the assassins. \n\nAs far as item passives/actives that encourage assassins but discourage mages, what about a persistent effect while you are close (200-300 units) to an enemy champion - increased movespeed or cdr, for example - it could be the AP version of Black Cleaver's \"Rage\" passive: dealing magic damage to a champion within 200 units gives you 20 movement speed for 2 seconds; kills/assists on a champion give 60 movespeed, regardless of distance. A few non-assassins might be able to take advantage of it (mostly hybrid champions like Jax and Warwick, if they went for an AP build), but very few mages would want that effect very much.\n\nOr, while you are within 200 units of an enemy champion, your abilities cool down twice as fast (possibly with an internal cooldown - approaching an enemy triggers this effect, lasting for up to 5 seconds with a 15 second cooldown). Killing an enemy while the effect is active grants the effect for an additional 5 seconds, regardless of enemy proximity.\n\nI feel like those kinds of effects (utility, rather than straight damage) would be very attractive to assassins while being unappealing to mages either because of the effects themselves or the proximity requirement. They would help assassins stick to their targets more easily and also get out if they score a kill (increased movespeed to run, or cooldowns halved so they can get their escape back up quickly).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Critmaster Garen","date":"2017-02-14T17:08:04.836+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean like those?\n\n{{item:3100}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3285}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2017-02-14T11:37:32.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, at least half of those use {{item:3146}} (not sure about Elise and Nidalee), and Leblanc simply tries to maximize AP and CDR like most other mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2017-02-14T12:30:19.561+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elise and nidalee cant buy gunblade.
