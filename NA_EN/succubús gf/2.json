Not that losing to someone automatically equals boosting. We won the game. And I looked on that persons profile and they have only 50 k mastery on their most played champion since season 4. (Wont disclose name so I don't get this deleted) I then asked the person if they are smurfing, sure enough they are. It was obvious but I wanted evidence. The lee sin they were duoing with was being very toxic. Like alarmingly toxic to me. I then looked up the persons op.gg and they duo with that person who is gold 5. I also have pictoral evidence stating they are being boosted by the person","replies":[{"poster":"pachiporomari","date":"2017-11-30T00:40:59.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like that was still a miserable match to take part in. :/\n\nFirst off, hopefully you were able to report that half of the duo that was being toxic. That'll permanently flag their account so we can investigate them for reform and adjust that attitude.\n\nSecond, our system is able to detect elo boosting but player reports also really help us track them down so we can review their match history and game patterns. If you have a screenshot of them admitting boosting, [send us a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and our Game Support team can take a look at those accounts. Next time you run into someone you suspect of boosting, send us a report in post-game and it'll flag their account for investigation!","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2017-11-30T02:27:21.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response. \nI did report both of them and in the comments I put that one was being boosted\".
