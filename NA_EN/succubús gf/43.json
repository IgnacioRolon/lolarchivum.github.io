It also accounts for a very small chunk of his kit, 1/4 of it disregarding the certain speed boost he gets for using his QE combo in the first place.

And Jayce's isn't even like an ultimate dodge, either, it's 2 of his 8 skills. If Kat is Jayce's counter, then she's even more of a counter to any champion with a dodgeable ultimate, which is a very heavy amount of them.\n\nfor godssakes, *Jayce counters Katarina*.

However, the majority of players find they lack the general capability compared to the rest of the League. Katarina *can* dodge the game's fastest skillshot by spending her defensive cooldowns, if sensed quick enough. But that is not Katarina exclusive, and should never have been entertained as such.\n\nAs I've mentioned, she's hard countered against Jayce for a reason, and it's not because she's been dodging everything he's been throwing at her. If anything, these \"slick dodges\" have put her in a rut to then try to face Jayce with his other 6 skills, and you've only created a scenario where she dodges one skill only to be left helpless to die regardless.
