Sure his r has some sort of delay, yet he is extremely safe while doing it. Have you ever waited so long for your e chain on lb to activate passive that your w timed out? Good lord. Now that's an overkill on delay\nFizz, correct me if I'm wrong, but if fizz hits you with chum the waters his w doesn't need a timer.\nEvelynn's cook timers is fucking atrocious\nEkko doesn't quite have a delay unless he wants guaranteed safety","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sahn Uzal","date":"2017-11-01T10:24:15.040+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Like the delay on Death Mark?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-11-01T10:25:21.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Zed already has a delay system.

Zed is first untargetable, than can cast his combo in no-time, and than just blinks away. Early in the game he might need to use more than one auto to kill his target, giving those delays actual meaning, but most of the time he doesn't need to spend even half a second near his victim to earn the kill.\n\nIt's nothing like newer/reworked assassin kits.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2017-11-01T14:34:21.695+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Imagine if riot implementeda delay system to zed\n\nHe already has one?
