Either your opponents get better or your team mates become worse or some combination of the two. However, you clearly do face better opponents and not just receive worse allies. We see this with challenger smurfs, who can go on very long win streaks, say 30+ games long. With 30 games, they'll probably be somewhere in D5 (conservative estimates here). On their 30th game, they're not playing with Bronze 5 allies because \"Riot keeps giving them worse team mates\" for every successive win they get.
