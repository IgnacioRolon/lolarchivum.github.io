Outplaying is still very much a part of this game.\n\n\"Outplaying\" someone is defined by playing a situation better than your opponent to achieve a better result\n\nZed jumping on an isolated target and oneshotting them before they react is, indeed, not an \"outplay\". It's an assassin doing his job.\n\nIf that target flashes just right when Zed ults, dodging his spells, then stuns the Zed and bursts him, then the target \"outplayed\" Zed because the target was expected to die to Zed.\n\nIf Zed expects the flash, predicts the location with his Q, and finishes with a flash-E-AA, then Zed outplayed his target, because it was expected that Zed would fail to hit his target if they flashed out of the normal Q area.\n\nFor just those examples,\n\n{{champion:238}} Dodge his Q. A well timed flash can cause you to leave Zed at your prior location when he ults, often causing him to miss his Q/E and negating a large amount of damage. Using hourglass obviously negates his ult, and if he ults in while your allies are waiting unbeknownst to him,  he very well may be fucked.\n{{champion:120}} E has a weird interaction with flash that can let you get out of range. R can be dodged with mobility spells, especially at long range (compared to other initiation spells, Hec ult has a pretty slow travel time.)\n{{champion:104}} autos can be bodyblocked by creeps, towers, and even your team mates. His R can be dodged and you get two chances to dodge his Q.\n{{champion:21}} Don't stand behind low HP minions (duh) and take advantage of the fact that she can't fucking move during her ult. Fight her in areas without other targets she can hit to massively lower her dps. Stay in close range to be able to quickly and easily move out of her ult.\n{{champion:133}} is a lane bully, and can dominate most melees in a 1v1. She can't do so well in a 1v2: fight dirty.
