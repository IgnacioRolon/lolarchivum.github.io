They're skillshot oriented and Lucian is a really mobile Marksman. Or are you asking me why is it fair for Lucian to specifically go mid?\n\nI mean, you can make the same argument with Galio mid that builds tank and still manages waves no problem, deals a lot of damage to champions if he catches them, can soak up a lot of punishment and can still be at one ult reach from either top or bot lane, thanks to his ult (and he has a TP as well). So in respect to Lucian mid, why is Galio allowed to perform in the role of a mid laner that is usually a Mages job, as a tank?\n\nFurthermore, didn't Riot change the damage for mages to scale off their AP (to true damage dealt to turrets on AAs) quite a while ago? So AD and AP champions should scale similarly when it comes to AA damage to turrets from their respective stats and the only difference should be in AS and crit Marksmen always buy. But Lucian mid doesn't buy crit, as far as i've seen.\n\nI highly doubt Lucian mid wins against an assassin like Zed.\nIf he does, it's because of Exhaust to at least allow him to not die to Zed's burst while he duels him for his life. And that will most likely happen the moment he buys BotrK, not before. He does need some lifesteal after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2017-06-07T18:49:12.208+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"The point was, adcs shouldn't get to do what they want for free.

You name it. Riot can't just destroy a champion because some people don't like them going mid (Lucian mid). If he is healthy there, i don't see a reason why Riot should force him to go bot again. People did the exact opposite for Ziggs bot, where THEY wanted Riot to do nothing to Ziggs because they found that a mage replacing a Marksman was a nice change of pace.\n\nRiot replied that if the style was healthy and could be supported by the current bot lane meta, they didn't intend to meddle in those matters. If the entire bot lane shifted because of Ziggs (or mid lane shifts because of Lucian), both of them would've been nerfed. Not saying that Lucian can't be nerfed if he's too strong, i'm just saying that there's a reason why Riot takes action sometimes immediately and why other times they don't.\n\nJanna is the worst example you could've provided as she was meant to be a support, nothing else. If she builds AP, her utility is immensely boosted. She herself doesn't have any reliable damage but she has a ton of healing, damage absorption and CC. The way her kit works basically supports non-aggression and the reason why her \"mage\" was gutted (solo laner) was because she didn't even fight her opponent, she just cleared minion waves with a single use of her Q. No enemy champion could pressure her lane and if they managed to do so, shielding turrets was again delaying it considerably.\n\nRemember that Sivir was reworked for the same reason, because she didn't even fight in her lane, she was just eating up entire minion waves with the use of her Richochet constantly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Skias","date":"2017-06-07T14:07:35.190+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=magic lasso,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AYbGRfcs,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-06-07T04:16:02.193+0000)\n>\n> ADC are flashy and simple to use and the majority of players are simple-minded and like flashy things.\n\nADC...

Ahri cannot kill someone even when landing everything(unless she is ahead, but if even, she cant lol). If an apc is behind, they will probably never be back in game. But if adc is behind, just a simple misplay by an ahead mage would mean that adc can kill them. Even if mages are fed, if they miss their skill they are no stronger than a cannon minion. Which is imo pretty bad design. Unless that is how it is supposed to be, then ADCs are just OP. A lot less room for mistakes than apc and yet can carry harder and do more damage consistently. They are also not mana gated. ADCs require no skills at all, except to have enough to be better than opposing ADC. Well not better, but be more fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefrostyviking","date":"2017-06-07T23:46:50.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ahris,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AYbGRfcs,comment-id=000e000000000000,timestamp=2017-06-07T22:12:36.810+0000)\n>\n> The fact that adc can kill someone without really landing anything is broken.

If he was behind then he would have needed more than 8 seconds to kill you from the start of the fight.\nA single mage combo can kill in under 2 seconds, i would know since i main midlane and over 4 different mages regularly and another 3 when i feel like it.\n\n\nAnd it's untrue that mages are garbage if they fall behind a little, that's very damm far from the truth.\n\n\nI´ve gone 0,4,0 less on serveral and still made comebacks having the most damage and kills in the end, particularity on Syndra and Lux, a few times on malz and Ahri as well.  Anivia and even Azir before the final nerfs made him too difficult for me to succeed with. \n\nOri is also very forgiving, as is vel koz. \n\n\nThe reason you lost is because of 2 things.\n\nFirst, you missed your main burst damage, the E-W combo, second, you let him get in range and just stand and auto as a result. And from what i hear you also facetanked his ultimate. \n\nHad you been kiting properly wtih a rylai then no amount of dashes should have let a lucian gapclose on you as taliyah, i know because even when playing Ahri i found it hard to approach a good one.  And if a champion can make Ahri struggle with gapclosing then only a few will stand a chance.\n\n\nAnd you call mages harder than marksmen? All it takes for a mage is the half baked skill to aim a bit towards the very slow and immobile marksmen and you can literally kill them in  a single rotation unless a lulu is stacking shields and heals. \n\nAnd i´ve played Ahri, a lot.\n\nShe can still kill easily with a good all in, the only difference now is like landing a single Q more first if you lack AP or are dealing with someone whos building health. \n\nReally, for having a 20% pickrate it's amazing to have 52% winrate at this time i am writing.  Even when nerfed. \n\n\nNext time, don't let a DPS champ get past your burst and stand ontop of you, i am sure you´ll find more success that way.\n\nAnd you might wana stop playing Taliyah if you feel so frustrated, she´s been nerfed nearly as hard as Azir, while you can play her and succeed it's probably twice as hard compared to any other.  It's really no wonder Lucian felt confident enough to go near you, even after you missplayed.
