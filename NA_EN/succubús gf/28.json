I really wish lee sin would get &quot;nidalee&#039;d&quot; just thrown out of meta for a while, BUT NO. He cant be because of riots precious little favoritism game. He has literally had the number 1 pick rate for junglers for pretty mcuh all of this season and a lot of season 6 and even before then. His kit, is toxic. There is nothing fun nor interactive about ward hopping behind someone under turret and ulting them out of turret. Like ??? Where is the counterplay to a point and click displacement that sends you flying into 1-3 people all at once. NEWSFLASH there is none. I literally dont understand why he even gets to be so safe.  Lb is too frequently abused? Gut her. Kat? Take out ward hops and force her to only be able to get shunpo resets late. Nidalee is really strong? Ruin her, make her not a great pick anymore. Lee is also god tier? Hmm, maybe nerf *some* of his damage but nothing that would substantially make him even slightly horrible. God forbid they even touch lee sin without giving him his 8th damn skin. Meanwhile cass hasent gotten a skin since s5 but whatever riot. Did i mention how long its been since urgot has seen a skin or even a balance tweak? But you know maybe we can compensate by throwing THAT under the rug and you know making lee sin freelo as hell :^). Never mind how absolutely brain dead he is. I mean at least nidalee had to land a spear to actually do anything. Lee can just walk up to you and hit r and the chances of him missing q are so damn slim unless someone walks in front of it or if the player actually goes, into a coma. He also gets a free shield! Oh you ignited him or an ally and theyre about to die from the last tick. How about no ? Because on top of damage he should get a shield so he doesnt ever have to die unless he is plastic 10\r\n\r\n/endrant\r\nCommence the downvotes and the &quot;git gud&quot; comments","replies":[{"poster":"Mouth Stuff","date":"2017-04-24T17:51:53.041+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lee is riots poster boy, having been in the meta pretty much since season 2 and I doubt they are changing that anytime soon","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-04-24T21:14:24.912+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":0,"body":"With his new skin lee is literally riots golden boy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Funkin Dunkin","date":"2017-04-25T15:37:56.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They've actually officially said they have no intention on removing him from meta.

Whereas for Amumu and Sej, usually if they&#x27;re playable in competitive they will probably be unfair in normal play (probably 55+% winrate). We also have some jungle changes that may be going in in the future that disproportionately hurt Lee Sin compared to other junglers. Also I believe that when Lee sin is balanced (but still playable in competitive) he doesn&#x27;t disproportionately harm jungle diversity in competitive. \n\nThe context was to balance Lee to be both playable in competitive and solo queue, because he is one of the few champions that is so multi-dimensional and has such a high skillcap that it can actually be achieved. I think you would agree that some champions just cant be balanced for competitive in their current state, since they would require significant buffs that would destroy soloqueue (Garen, Amumu, Annie, Blitz come to mind). \n\nNowhere does that say \"broken\" or because of LC$. In fact, I would guess that buffing some champions would be GREAT for LCS - how loud do you think the crowd would go if Blitz ever became a competitive pick? And plus, I dont know about you, but I find the competitive meta to be pretty stagnant and could use a reshuffling.
