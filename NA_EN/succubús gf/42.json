Love laners like you as a jungler, say I'm in top JG, enemy mid backs and my mid roams botlane with the wave either at the middle of the lane or crashing on enemy tower, Im gonna look and see if top is in a gank ready spot, if not I'll pop to that empty midlane and get some damage down on that turret, consistent map/objective pressure wins games as does making the best use of all resources available (lane minion farm, jg creeps etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Pisykan","date":"2017-04-28T07:26:44.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely! it also extends the roam time and allows the jungler to concentrate elsewhere, counter jungling, top gank, anything, even sneaking the mid turret sometimes, the other thing i hate is when a mid laner (this is when I'm not mid) or again anyone that roams through the enemy jungle, as a Talon main this i do almost constantly and DOES NOT WARD like come on, this is league 101, dump deep wards as you go, right? on quad paths, not in the damn side bushes highlight as many paths as possible! this helps everyone out especially the jungler!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2017-04-28T00:00:46.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate it when, as a jungler, I last hit in a lane as the laner returns.
