Like not that tolerable broken english  but like literally no real form of sentences or grasp of our words. Or they just blatantly speak native tongue with their duo. Thats totally fine i guess, but it seems odd to be on a server where nobody can really understand you. I actually had someone flame me with the most broken english for not understanding them o.o","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2016-11-08T01:45:31.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"u not the good player yes? dont know language? ashe must make the tower. gank very op but i do not make buff. very bad player no op, makes lose. i report. leave the 20. take jungle dragon rest the ward. very middle push.\"\n\nActual literal transcript of a match I had yesterday.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2016-11-08T01:31:43.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life?\n\nIf I found out I needed to move to Japan today and would be there for the next 5 years, I'd transfer my account to the Japan server despite not knowing the native language. You can bet that if I found someone else who was a native English speaker that I'd type to them in English in game, since that's what I know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2016-11-08T01:23:18.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, a lot of high elo players use Korean servers due to their higher competitive ranked ladder\n\nAnother more applicable reason would be that maybe they were in the country for some random reason at the time? Or maybe they were playing with a friend from that country and they had to use that server because of lag reasons. \n\nTbh, I don't have a definitive reason","replies":[]}]}
