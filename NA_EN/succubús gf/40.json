I'm generally fairly good.  I don't always carry, but I do every now and then.\n\nHowever, I also (rarely) epicly fail in a game, and get \"called out\" as a boosted animal.  You can't just assume that because they did poorly in 1 game they must suck.  I mean sure, in the jungle it's mostly ai stuff, but you can still mess up a ton if you're tilted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2016-07-13T08:04:12.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"or you can just get better at the game and stop thinking its the system holding you back","replies":[{"poster":"WukongMain","date":"2016-07-13T08:20:24.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have to admit though...\nplayers who wander around the jungle going 0/12 in under 20 minutes....are indeed holding players back. \n\nEven if just by 1 loss.\nEven if you focus on yourself and improve.\nYou still have that loss, and now need 1 win extra win just to get back to where you where before.\nAnd players like this in the lower ranks like Bronze and silver come all too often. and each time they come you now need 1 extra win just to get back to where you were before they showed up.\n\nIt's basically like taking a walk around the block. but every 5 steps you have to literally take 2 steps backwards.\n5 steps forward, 2 steps backwards, 5 steps forward, 2 steps backwards, you get the picture.\n\nSome people work. \nSome people have lives.\nSome people can't afford to play a million games a season. \nSome people can't afford to have to win an extra game cause a troll decided to basically steal their LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2016-07-13T08:34:04.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i worked ( up until last month ) 6 days a week. i could still bet you i could climb out of bronze with 0 effort. i have proven it and riot has proven it before. that was a 60 minute game, playing an assassin jungle? that game should have been closed out way before. there might have been a way to win it there mgiht not have been. but if you're truely are climbing out of bronze 1 lose litterally means nothing. \n\nside note:\n\nlast session i started bronze 4 and ended silver 1\nthis session started bronze 3 and im still climbing currently silver 2\n\nit isnt impossible, every guide out there and ever pro players has said it about 100 times **_ you are the reason you are in bronze not your team not the game state nothing but you keeps you in bronze_**\n\nEdit: i'm pretty sure you have been in bronze, if you ended the session in silver there is a good chance at one time you were bronze, i have no idea if you have seen what goes on in low bronze but im telling you right now if you played there you would be straight up baffled about how people stay there. bronze is the division were the worst of the worst go, silver- gold is pretty average  while anything above plat is better then average. to be in bronze **_and remain there_** is just proof that you are below average and probably have some glaring issues that need to be fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Succubús GF","date":"2016-07-13T08:42:39.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what game you are referring to, but nonetheless.
