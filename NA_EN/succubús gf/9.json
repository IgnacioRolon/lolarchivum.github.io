Most top laners dont have much to counter junglers besides {{champion:420}}. \n\nMid usually has tons of stuns, a way to escape, and a way to kite the jungler and mid laner. The lane is also very short so the mid laner can back easily. The only junglers who can gank mid well is {{champion:60}} if she lands her web, and {{champion:64}} and level 6. The others are meh/decent. \n\nBot lane the support is always gonna fuck you over when the jungler ganks. {{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:12}}, not very easy to gank those type of champs when they have an easy counter fuck towards junglers.\n\nTop lane is the best one because of champs like {{champion:126}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:133}} and many others. Theyre all squishy damage champs. And if the lane is pushed to your tower, then the jungler should gank.
