Other 3 call us the N word and say how they're going to triple report us at the end. In game I ask the enemy team to please report our Anivia as she used the N word as an insult against other players.\n\nThe enemy teams only response was a member joining in with N word insults and reporting followed by honoring each other. According to them at the end it was fine because they have multiple accounts anyways so even if they did get banned it'd have no impact on them. The fact that the ONLY response to people using the N word in this community is to join in makes me ashamed to be part of it.\n\nEven so me and my duo tried our best (though both suffered a bit in performance as we were upset, and reported at the end) I really DONT want to play games with these people and it's such a shame that there are THAT many that Riot lets run rampant.\n\nAnyways all I did was ask for the report, my duo partner never said anything all game.\n\nTL;DR The best communication I've ever seen in this game involved two people on opposite teams jumping in to call people that did nothing the N word and join together to report those people for fun.\n\nEnd game screen:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RauvEj9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Zarddramon","date":"2015-03-17T04:04:30.621+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man, gonna be honest, but I'm getting to be ashamed to be a part of it too.

That's dumb. If you don't know how to hide behind minions to not eat spears, then you need to work on that. She can't \"nuke\" you if she's not fed. And if she is maxing q, her heal won't heal for much early game, so you can't bitch about her sustain. Just go ham early. Funny how once ap nid got reworked no one bitcjes about her. In fact, everyone said riot destroyed her. Now just cus she's back everyone is cryin again.","replies":[{"poster":"georgiotatos","date":"2015-03-18T02:33:16.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1 their playstyle is offensive, they qqqqq if you try to kill them they wwwww away, only way to kill her in lane is to bait her otherwise she is too safe,they never fight unless they know they can kill you and if they cant they still have the nerve to keep throwing qs and not backing just because they have such a strong escape\n\n2 i can stay behind minions all day long but what happens in a dragon fight? a spear comes out of the bush and bam! i am now at 50% hp, also note that i am not my whole team, i cant control every nid i see to not get fed,its bound to happen a few times\n\n3 her sustain is not a problem early, but late game were she can poke all day and be invulnerable to poke at the same time  while also having an escape that has a 3 sec cd and cost no mana is really annoying\n\n4 ap nid got bs nerfed, she lost some q damage and she got 1 ton of utility as compensation and now her q was buffed again thats just bs, i never stopped complaining about her  and i never will except if:\n\nher movement speed decreased by 20\n\nno longer gets r at lvl 1\n\nq damage and scalings cut in half in all ranks ,now slows the target 99% for 0,1 sec\n\ne heal no longer grants as\n\nw trap now disappears after 1 min\n\nw when in cougar form no longer gets reset and now has a 12 sec cd\n\nall spells in cougar form now cost mana q 100 w 100 e 100 r 120\n\nw costs X4 mana each time its cast , stacks will reset to 0 after 25 secs unaffected of cdr items","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Simplicate","date":"2015-03-17T16:18:04.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait I'm confused because it feels like you're leaving something out.

The guy in question was also bronze 4 in a 3 man premade of low levels so he probably thought he was something special at level 30. Pretty sure my little joke wasn't enough to justify being called the N word all game, nor was it even provocative or pushed tbh. \n\nAs far as the enemy team joining in, I guess they thought it'd be a lot of fun? I'd be more than happy to let riot check the logs and call me out if I had any wrongdoing at all. Other than that and asking the enemy to report them I said nothing all game (and I only asked after they said they were reporting us both as a trio so I wasn't escalating the situation), my duo literally said 0 words.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2015-03-17T13:55:15.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember my first days playing and encountering some random stuff like this and even when doing the Tribunal I've found some really dark things said in games and I can't really believe how I'm still here. However aside from our friend the \"Mute\" button to utilize for our preference. It's quite common in most MMO Communities granted I haven't met any on GW, GWII, Elsword, Onigiri, etc. yet but I'm sure there are some infamous players in their respective games noted for their misdeeds towards other players out of either amusement or personal problems. \n\nThe best advice I can give to you really is that don't stress over it so much. Focus on the match and mute them if you need to because psychologically being depressed and hurt from comments like that will decrease your performance as you stress over that one line.

I mean yeah, report them... But if this is bad, try the real world. There's this odd myth that League's community is somehow worse than other competitive communities. It isn't. Though, I will point out that lower mmr is absolutely worse than higher. The worst I run into is people who harp on their teammate's (lack of) playing skill. I can't REMEMBER the last time I saw someone that bad... 'course, I tend to laugh that off. They're dumb. Lots of people are dumb. Whatever.\nOn a larger scale, I don't know if I've ever been ashamed of being part of a community - even ones that are so bad I left them. I help define them by virtue of being a part of them, but it in no way, shape, or form defines me. What's there to be ashamed of? You can't really make too many conclusions about somebody based solely on the fact that they play League of Legends, or any game. I mean, you then know that they PROBABLY (unless they're a bots player) have a competitive streak and to some extent enjoys video games. Anything else is not a conclusively substantiated assumption. I can try to correct people when they make logical fallacies, but it's hardly my fault if they make them in the first place. So what is there to be ashamed of in that?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSaltyScourge","date":"2015-03-17T16:54:13.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/vCBdnQysS6Y/hqdefault.jpg","replies":[]}]}
