Friendly banter with your own team is one thing, telling the enemy team to kill themselves is another. Once accounts get permanently banned for something like this it won't be reversed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Divine Arcanine","date":"2018-02-01T01:14:16.410+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The exact same thing happened to me. Send a ticket in, riot should understand. If you are only saying \"kys\" to your premade friends and not in All Chat then you'll be fine. I got unbanned from it. But if anyone, including the enemy team, reports you, even if you didn't say anything in All-Chat, riot may not notice this at first and ban you thinking you were being toxic. Basically it's wise to just not say anything like that, even to your team, because there can easily be confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T01:48:40.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted to drop a note here, Divine makes good points here actually ^^^^\n\nSaying it *at all* will likely trigger the system and issue a ban. We're definitely open to talking about these things though, it's just generally smart not to make overly toxic/negative statements like this at all. Even if it's just quoting someone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"you go chinatown","date":"2018-02-01T02:00:39.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i kinda did some research about things that could get me banned and im definitely not saying that again. how do i send tickets in to riot or whatever; i posted here bc i didnt know where else to go to","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T04:16:42.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can shoot those tickets over from this link -> [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"topedope","date":"2018-01-31T19:32:31.825+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol there is a bot which scans toxic messages and no one gets banned w/o a reason. thats cute though that u asked your friends to proof something. {{item:3681}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TF Wolf2","date":"2018-01-31T18:12:28.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I witnessed this and he was not toxic at all and just was bantering with the teammate.
