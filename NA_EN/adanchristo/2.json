Dragon to be able to push, free xp to not be behind. This was FREAKING BAD IDEAS because what we needed is general changes. not one champion being able to go bot while being toxic.\n\nthey should fixe ranged champ poke, and ranged champ sieging or making them good at sieging but worse in teamfight than melee carries","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doctor Jarvis","date":"2015-10-18T23:57:55.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The meta has to be that way, both from Riot's perspective and player's. For Riot, its about introducing a ranged class of carries that get most of their damage through auto-attacks, but they need a weakness to compensate for the range they get over similar characters; those auto attacks need game time and items to scale up, their abilities tend to deal less damage, and they're squishier than other characters. Riot has now released a theoretically balanced Marksman, how is the player to react? This character is going to need help, clearly. Fortunately Riot release a theoretically balanced champion who's whole job is to assist the team, not necessarily carry it. These are good to have because if the game was all carries it would be annoying to play because everything can kill you and champs would have to keep being able to carry harder and harder, so a class is made to intervene, set things up for others, and deny others kills. But by definition they need someone to help to shine. They feel like they were made for each other. There are 3 lanes and a jungle, someone has to go with someone, and they go bot because that's where drag, the first contested objective, is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mimy","date":"2015-10-18T23:38:40.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well when you come up with something to beat it I'm sure we'd all love to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"KONO RUBICK DA","date":"2015-10-19T14:50:59.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Onastacia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A2cqJWhx,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-18T23:38:40.699+0000)\n>\n> Well when you come up with something to beat it I'm sure we'd all love to hear it.\n\nwas proposed multiple time since s1. They should make laning phase against them easier. That way melee can survive against them and later in the game they can split push to counter the incredible sieging of ranged champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellioning","date":"2015-10-19T17:45:39.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Primarily, it's just differentiating Marksman.
