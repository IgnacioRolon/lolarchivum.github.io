So yes, it is Riot's problem to solve.  If they made the role more rewarding ( again, I have a few ideas and i've seen a bunch posted both on these forums and reddit ) more people would want to play it.  \n\nAdd in the fact that supports get basicly no gold, no kills ( for some reason people think assists are unimportant ), don't last hit, and are expected to be ward dropping machines means they aren't fun.  A good support is priceless and I personally don't mind playing it every now and then but it's ultimately boring as hell and completely un-fun to the majority of players.  \n\nYou want more people to play support?  Talk to Riot because they are the only ones with the ability to change game mechanics and champions.  Nobody outside of Riot can do this.  It's Riot's problem 100% that barely anybody wants to play support because they do not make them more interactive and fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Rosewell8","date":"2016-02-20T06:40:36.462+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure we get fked in the current ranking system as well.

There have been countless ways to calculate this and Riot actually does do this. It would not surprise me one bit if Riot actually does rank people individually and just refuses to make it actually matter in game.

They have done it countless times through nerfs, buffs, and changing how dragon works, how strong/weak turrets are, how baron works and the buff it gives, and the list goes on and on how often Riot changes the game in more ways than just one.  \n\nThere are a plethora of ways Riot could help this.  They just refuse to do anything about it in any meaningful way.  To try and place the blame on anybody other than Riot ( considering they have 100% control over how the game is played ) is absolutely ludicrous.  \n\nPlease give me the name of somebody who can change the way the game works and is played in such a substantial way that the entire player base is affected other than Riot and we can talk to them about it instead.  The answer is there isn't anybody other than Riot that can do this which is why people blame Riot.\n\nBTW in MMO's I do play the tank and healer. DPS is boring as hell.  \n\nIf Riot were to implement a way to rank people based on their performance rather than allowing a single person on a team to completely throw the game then nobody could complain.  They refuse to do this as well even though they have all the data needed to do it.  They have already taken a baby step with mastery scores at the end of each match. They just have to expand on it but it's completely stupid to believe Riot will do this when they can't even give us solo queue like they said they would after dynamic queue came out.\n\nSolo Queue would be the absolute perfect place to use a ranking system that ranked you based on your individual play.  Winning and Losing would still be important and would play a factor in your ranking but it wouldn't be the only factor.  Thinking that it can't be done is being very simple minded.
