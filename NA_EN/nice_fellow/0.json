One step closer to thought police every time we restrict people.\n\nI understand the concept of the reduction of the English language, however, you are encouraging the usage of crude words that people already use instead of being properly descriptive. It's funny you bring this up, actually. \n\nIn a thread 4 months ago about Kickstarter rewards, people with too much money, and bad characters, I saw the word autism used in the way you described. The overuse of the word fuck or conjugation of autism is for more like 1984 than censoring.\n\nHowever, there is no thought policing going on here. The problem is that people are too long used to being ass hats to random people on the Internet and thinking it is due justice. This isn't about censoring the word retard so not to encourage use of the word and offend a group.\n\nThis is 'don't be an ass hole on the Internet.'
