But that&#039;s now what the discussion is. The real issue is how bad the afk system is. It punishes players based on how many games they have gone afk. Eventually you are put in LPQ which starts from waiting 5 minutes to 10m and finally 20m. The issue is how the afk system doesn&#039;t take into account the reason the person has gone afk. In my case i&#039;ve gotten another 20m LPQ because like always my folk call me and tell me to do something and when i try to tell them that I&#039;m busy and that i&#039;ll do it as soon as I&#039;m done with a game they start to become stubborn and not caring that you are in a game and that there are other players who have to suffer from you being afk. Now i don&#039;t know if there is a way to be able to file that I&#039;ve been set on a LPQ because of people that always tend to not understand you can&#039;t a pause an online game and you never will be able to and while i feel bad for my team who fights and gets killed while my champion sits at spawn like nothing was happening i also wish they considered that everyone has a reason to be afk. Wether it&#039;s because your internet went out, parents constantly bothering you to do something or else they&#039;ll take away the pc and etc... Now there is the possibility that people would take advantage of there being a way to get rid of your LPQ since many people go afk cuz they get salty or because they just wanna be a troll but still it takes into consideration of what is going on in the players life that might affect them no being able to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-08-22T01:49:54.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should just get your parents to play a game that can't be paused and then keep asking them to do things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sarutobi","date":"2017-08-20T08:56:35.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that's the problem though. If anyone can just make up an excuse how will the system see the legitimacy of that excuse? if anything that is your fault that your parents need to call you in for every little thing. Make sure all the things you need to do is done before jumping on a game. That's how I was raised. Gaming is a privilege not a right, so why should the other people on your team suffer because of you being called in from your parents?\nAt the same time whats stopping people from using this excuse to get a free pass to dodge a game? Match not going in your favor, get a free pass by claiming you have an emergency! You also seem to forget the LPQ doesnt hit you on your first leave. heck ive had emergency and left a couple games but since those were far a few between each other it doesnt see it as a consistent problem. You seem to be leaving loads of games if you are always hitting the max queue time.\n\nAll in all just make sure everything you need to do is done before having break and playing a video game. if this is a constant problem maybe try a single player game so you dont ruin it for all the other players!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-08-20T07:50:14.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is very lenient, if you are getting 20 minute LPQ's then you need to change something. Before you start playing ask your parents if they need anything done because you will not be able to pause your game.","replies":[]}]}
