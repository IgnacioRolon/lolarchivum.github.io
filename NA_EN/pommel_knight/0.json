Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n 1. Too many of the blind or retarded people saying &quot;Omg, sry didn&#039;t see. I was watching Pewdipie on you tube!1!&quot; \r\n\r\n2. When you get the remade team that bans your champion because one of them wants mid and you to support. \r\n\r\n3. The person who had a bad Yasuo, Irelia, Vayne, Riven or some other champion and bans it, even though you main them.\r\n\r\n4. The person who thinks your champion is a &quot;noob&quot; one, troll or just doesn&#039;t want to have that champion on their team.","replies":[{"poster":"Talisid","date":"2016-11-05T18:57:59.777+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's stupid. If somebody is *last* pick and pre-selects the current FOTM overpowered champion his chances of actually ever getting that champion are really bad.
