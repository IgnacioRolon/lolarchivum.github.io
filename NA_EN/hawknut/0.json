They are making it to where he will have a hard time helping the allied ADC shove lane with the fact that the E will no longer hit minions, and changing his Q to single target damage on top of lowering the bonus from the stab completely. In my opinion,the ability change to his E alone should have been enough to kill solo lane Pyke, but all of these changes on top of each other will hurt Pyke's damage immensely, and he might not be getting the same treatment as S7 Azir when they completely killed the champion's win rate for months without buffs, but it will still be a huge hit to his poke, his all ins, and his over all assassin aspect of his kit. With these changes it will be much harder to punish enemy ADC's and supports for over extending into minion wave, and will punish you more for trying to frontline for your ADC at any point in the game, trading off your Q damage for lower cooldowns on the ability instead. I am sure this AOE removal is a part of the riot team trying to kill solo lane pyke, but even if the Q had its AOE damage, you would not be able to out  shove most laners, unless against a very passive early lane or getting a heavy early lead and getting a fast tiamat. Even with the removal of the AOE damage, I feel that the combination of the removed effects on his Q will effect his over all usefulness in all situations heavily, and punish him greatly for attempting to take small trades to poke down an enemy laner, even if they are a late scaling ADC that has nearly no damage in the early game he will lose most trades, and because of the E changes he will not be able to be nearly as aggressive already. Against a support like Nautilis, Leona, Alistar, or Thresh he already has a pretty rough laning phase due to their tankiness, but the reduced Q damage will make these lanes into monstrous lanes where you are doomed to either fail to protect your ADC, or to have to play an AFK lane for 10-15 minutes at least, when you will be able to roam and help other lanes while your ADC is most likely forced out of a decent bit of their CS due to your lack of trading potential. This is the thoughts that I have had on these changes, and hope that they will not nerf his Q as hard as they are planning to.\r\n\r\nThis change will make {{champion:555}} seem as threatening as {{champion:350}}, and make him hit like {{champion:16}}","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-24T03:29:08.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"\"Hey, players, here's a paradigm we think you'll like; it's an assassin support, which means that you can HOLY SHIT WHAT ARE YOU GODDAMN GREMLINS DOING ASSASSINATING PEOPLE?

It stifles creativity and exploration, which should be of fundamental importance in a game.\n\nDoes Soraka top work? Sure. You have a useless W for a while, but you get good poke and sustain in Q and your E can help you avoid ganks. It's not the best thing Soraka can do, and she wasn't designed for it, but it's okay, and it's allowed. Brand/Zyra/etc. were designed to mid but are now also played as support, and that is apparently fine. Tahm was designed as a support, and then Riot realized they made a horrible mistake with an ability that can provide untargetability to any champion in the game and booted him into top lane where he is reportedly causing even more problems but not problems that make LCS boring so it's okay. Fid was designed as a mid, but then he found success as a jungler and a support, and, although he got a Q nerf due to its strength and low counterplay, it wasn't flat-out removed. Annie was designed as a mid, but is now also a support pick due to her stun.\n\nWhen a champ that hasn't been pigeonholed into support goes bot lane and buys a gold gen item, it's totally cool and Whose Lane Is It Anyway. But when a support - especially an enchanter support - goes to another lane, they get a nerf to that to encourage them to stay in bot lane. And now we have a support who's being played in roles other than support being booted back to bot lane so hard that he's almost not allowed to damage minions. Note that this includes jungle Pyke, which doesn't involve trading or sustain with his passive. With a single-target Q and no damage on E, it'll be worse than... I dunno, Soraka jungle.\n\nIt's important to note that these nerfs aren't related to the things that make him too strong or oppressive, like \"Pyke's sustain is too reliable in a solo lane, so we're reducing his grey health cap from a single source of damage.\" It's just \"Pyke is going top and mid and we don't want that, so if you leave bot lane before 10:00 Scuttles will eat you.\"\n\nAnd it bears repeating: no more jungle Pyke. He'd basically be a cannon minion. With Smite.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2019-06-24T05:36:03.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I don't think that designing a champ with a lane/role in mind and then enforcing that with an iron fist via not just a gutting but more of a disembowelment is healthy for the game at all.

Here's that part in particular:\n\n>Basically, this is how solo-Pyke goes: Pyke goes in or you engage on him, he pops Aftershock and trades with you for a bit OR he dashes out to disengage, Pyke heals off the damage you did to him and repeats the process until you're low enough to get ulted.\n\n>If he can't do any of that, he just hits 6 and tries to roam as much as possible to snowball his team.\n\n _No_,  Pyke isn't out-bursting mages and assassins left and right, it's the opposite actually. Solo Pyke slowly wears down his opponent until they're in ult range or just roams to other lanes to snowball his team. \n\n Also, statistically speaking Pyke has one of the lowest damage outputs in the game. He'll very rarely (if ever) go above 4th or 5th on his team.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaosReyn","date":"2019-06-24T14:04:26.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I'm saying \"why not just let him?\"\n\nHe's already known as an \"assassin\" in TFT, his ult is an assassin-style execute, and his passive makes no aesthetic sense at all.

His entire kit has minimal risk for high reward, and that's what I mean when I say I can see a problem. Make the risk more of a risk, and the reward will actually feel rewarding instead of inevitable. At *some point* the guy's gonna press R and get a kill.

The only damage nerf he received was to his shotgun-Q and even then it's not that bad, he's just losing the % damage bonus.

It's also a pretty low cooldown....\n\nAgain, Nami and Morg are better and more reliable. \n> \n> -------------------------------\n> \n> {{item:3098}} {{item:3003}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3107}} \n> \n> Yup. No AP....... Also.... she doesn't have to HIT skills. She has a point and click. \n\n\"P.S. Nami can do just as much damage as Lux...... if not more, when played correctly.\"\n\n...\n\nAnd you're saying Nami can do more damage with that build? HAHAHAHAHA.\n\nNOPE.\n\nNice making me laugh dude.\n\nSupports can never do as much damage as a mid lane mage.\n> \n> Also, it's not like Nami is more mobile than Lux or anything..... and it's not like Mobility doesn't increase hit frequency.....\n\nLux's spam their spells just as often as a Nami so that doesn't mean anything.\n> \n> _**This is the one topic which I vary from the stats on: Most low damage Nami builds are purely healers and aren't using her passive properly. They are generally going defensive with a rushed Redemption and putting off AP.**_\n\nDuh. She's a support that shouldn't be building AP anyway. Only time you do that is in ARAM just to have fun without being reported for trolling.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Armaniac","date":"2019-07-02T14:54:22.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"listen, im a pyke main, i've played him on every role (even ADC)\nyes he can engage and disengage pretty well but does he have a chance against a zed, talon, veigar who have MASSIVE burst damage? no!\nthey nerfed the Q to single target and E to just deal with champs. that a problem for pyke support aswell,\ni mainly played him on supp, and as a pyke player i loved the fact that i can Q when the enemy is behind the minions and slow them by the stab, then E to engage, but now that's not a thing anymore, i don't care about the damage, pyke is all about Ulti, we all know that, you've never seen a pyke clutch a team fight by just using his abilities and not using his ult, but the AOE nerf on the stab is really annoying.\ni know if you feed pyke he can be a monster but realistically you can dodge all his abilities, W E and even the ulti.\nif you want to kill Solo-Pyke do something that only effects him in that position, i like the trick you can pull of with him as i mentioned one above, but now they are turning him to someone who is only worthy for the ulti and nothing else. you wanna nerf the E? nerf the damage atleast keep the stun on minions because i've done this alot when our nexus was under attack by mega minions but i E to stun them and make them target me instead of the nexuse and many other instances.\nyou wanna nerf the Q? ok, atleast makes it like something that if theres a champ in the range of the AOE instead of hurting the minion it only hurts the champion.\nim not saying these are solutions because its riots job to think about these but the way they nerfed him just made him to be someone who sits back wait for enemy to get below under the threshhold and BAM! ulti just for the kill, there are many supports who even do more damage then the ADC, like veigar, and leaves the enemy with a little bit of health for the ADC. im not complaining about the damage but the fact you can stab both ADC and support to slow'em down instead of hooking just the ADC, was and is really important to me!\nall im reading and all the reasons im seeing is to nerf his wave clear, but riot by doing this effected support pyke alot aswell.\ni play him alot, sure, you wanna remove solo pyke? do something that doesn't harm the role he is made for!\nyou may think it didn't but the nerfs made him really hard on support aswell, coming from someone who plays pyke not only on EUNE but EUW and NA.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NEGATIF","date":"2019-06-26T14:10:22.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ey people, i play alot pyke and now is dead. you cant go tank, you cant take HP for the pasive, you cant help push your adc, you are not an assasin anymore, you are a bad hydrid thresh + rakan = PYke. the kit is great, the dmg is SAD, if you want an assasin suport please dont nerf the dmg, now is better zed as suport than pyke in the \"assasin\" style.
