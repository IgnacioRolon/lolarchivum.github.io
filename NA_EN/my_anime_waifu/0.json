The shield on the tower itself protected it against a significant amount of damage from enemy minion waves. Without the shield each time enemy minions reach a tower it takes guaranteed damage from them. With the shield, particularly if the wave that reaches the tower is relatively small, a large proportion of the damage is dealt to the shield, so the tower doesn't suffer much permanent damage.\n\nLast I check minions ignored the shield, and directly damaged the tower's HP?

Teams wouldn't be punished for not clearing wave, and the meta would have to shift to Team fighting, because split pushing and long range wave clear would be devalued.\n\nThe turret shields does attack the siege comp however. You protect the turret from some champion damage, which means you can't easily widdle it down. And the champion shield would make it harder to be poked down while defending it.\n\nIf the current changes remain. Their will probably be more action required to actually defend turrets. But the Turrets will remain Safeish places from constant poke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-03-17T22:07:58.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shhhh, no muddy this tread with facts...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"darkdill","date":"2015-03-17T21:19:41.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take it by the recent changes, though, that you consider turret-hugging to be toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Retillin","date":"2015-03-17T21:35:32.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was this not part of pre-season?
