Obviously you cannot submit a ticket if you cannot log it. I apologize again for that post lol.\n\nMoving along, we're working to see if we can get this figured out at this moment. I was able to finally get through myself by manually changing my DNS settings. Check out our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5), specifically the DNS steps and let me know if that helps!\n\nAgain, please ignore that rather dumb slip-up XD.

Make sure those DNS settings stayed set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4, let your pc restart, then try to access the support page in Internet Explorer. Let me know if that still hasn't worked, and if not I can see what I can do on my end to get you a ticket made!","replies":[{"poster":"yeulx","date":"2017-04-17T04:40:56.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep it stayed the same and forsure i mean its nothing really big i just want to find out whats been going on with my FPS in league lately it could just be my computer being bad but i have attempted to do everything that would try and fix it yet like if i go to play normal summoners rift at some point in the game my fps will just die out  normally lategame and when near the enemy base for some reason  i cant even look at my fps ingame because they are not showing up in the corner","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-17T04:54:30.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm the plot thickens. \n\nI just reached out to a few more of our tech guys (since we can't get you a ticket to them directly -grumble-). They've suggested that we try using a VPN like [**CyberGhost**](http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_us) as a last resort to see if we can get you on that support site. I know this is frustrating, but a least we can slowly narrow this down.\n\nAlso since you mentioned you needed a ticket due to FPS issues, luckily I can help with that as well ^_^! Since your FPS slowly starts getting worse throughout the game, there might be an issue with your pc having a hard time rendering everything that's going on in the match. Check out this [**FPS guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) and you should be able to smooth those frames out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
