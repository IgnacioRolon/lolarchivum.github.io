If you recently patched or updated to the test client it's possible that the game files corrupted during installation.  The PBE uses it's own files so it can load fine.  The other factor here could be security settings that's preventing your game files from being scanned.  Running as admin is one small step, but I recommend going over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide instead.  \n\nIt would be better to check your permissions first before considering a complete reinstall.  Let me know if that does the trick, and we'll go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"Souji","date":"2016-11-23T21:25:35.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it, I noticed my firewall was off so I turned it back on.
