Too many play makers and not enough supporting characters.\n\nLiterally every role you picked is a \"carry\" role on their team.  Nothing to assist them in carrying.  No real contributing assistance. Dyrus isn't a carry, but he's constant and can keep his team alive. Xsmithe isn't a carry jungle force-feeding kills to the carries, but he counter ganks and gets Zion going.\n\nYou can't have a team of full carries and expect it to have any affect in competitive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WrongRunesBG","date":"2015-03-09T21:45:21.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too much hate for zionspartan here. But Santorin isn't that much of a playmaker so I guess the comp, alongside with good synergy between the solo laners, could pay off here. Indeed a supportive top laner such as dyrone could work wonders.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-03-09T22:11:09.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zion is pretty good, don't get me wrong.
