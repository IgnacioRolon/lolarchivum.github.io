I'm especially pleased to see that Twisted Fate had such a major focus, considering he was my first champion, and practically the reason I started the game (Saw him in the Twist of Fate cinematic, I'm a sucker for card themes, and he happened to be on the free rotation that week, so I decided to start playing). Almost feels like something's come full circle to see my first champion take part in an event.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-08-02T20:52:52.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I thought the patch would come on august 10th\n\nThats really awesome,cause I really enjoyed GPs new look :)\n\nThanks for the info,thats really awesome\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-08-02T20:00:06.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question; so one of GP's upgrades on his ult is called \"Death's Daughter\", which is also the cannon he strapped to Graves/TF during the story.
