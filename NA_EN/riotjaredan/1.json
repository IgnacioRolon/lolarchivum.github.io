A while back we started moving away from the older style of 'historical' bios in favor of character stories (think Braum &amp; Gnar), but we've found that issues like character limits and formatting constraints are preventing us from really pushing things further in the in-client lore tabs. Given that the lore tab is also intended to give players a quick feel for a champ's thematic and identity, we've decided to morph it into more of an introductory space that links to deeper story experiences on the website's champ info pages.\n \nThat said, we’re frankly behind on all of this. We recently released in-client champion intros for Shurima champions without having their deeper story pieces ready to go. We know this is frustrating and we’re working to get them all out as soon as possible.\n \nAdditionally, as I mentioned last week, we've run into some tech issues preventing us from de-linking the champ info pages from the lore tabs. We hope to have this fixed very shortly, but for now we're actually unable to deliver completed stories in the way we've promised. \n \nBecause of this, we’ve taken the interim step of stickying the new Azir and Xerath short stories on this board. We hope you enjoy them, and deeply appreciate your continuing patience as we work to bring you the stories you want and deserve. \n \nI’ll be hanging out in this thread for a bit, so feel to leave any questions you may have and I'll do my best to address them.\n\n[Azir](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/zmvrQ7I6-short-stories-azirarisen)\n\n[Xerath](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/RdkEIREJ-short-stories-xerathunbound)","replies":[{"poster":"LordHippoman","date":"2014-10-18T00:45:09.100+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":3,"body":"This is awesome.

I just mean that as someone who started in Season 1 and watched Lore kinda fall apart at the seams post JoJ (There was, what, a year or so where literally nothing happened?), actually having Lore just kinda fall into your lap one day seemed like a total impossibility to me about a month ago, and now suddenly two short stories that actually expand on characters instead of posing more questions that will never be answered (Who is Jax, who is C, what the hell was up with that Karthus/Kassadin/Malz thing) pop up on the Boards.  I used to gripe a ton about the direction Lore was going before the retcon went down and people got downright nasty towards Narrative (We all know this story, not going to go with the gritty details again).  So I'm just pleased with something, and this was of really high quality too.\n\nI actually think one of the biggest things standing between Lore Fan/Lore Team harmony is pretty evident in your post here alone.  You aren't asking what the next events will be.  You use the word \"target\".  And I'm certainly not trying to blast you over that, because that's how Freljord and Shurima felt to a lot of us who were really attached to characters.  The easiest way to rile up a bunch of Lore fans is to walk up and whisper:\n\n*Trundle, the troll KING is very PASSIONATE about XERATH*\n\nThe events were mostly retcons, and hopefully Riot takes that into account, and makes the next events more about progression than rewriting the base of the story.  Although, due to the CarnivalKnights post about serial lore entries, etc., my outlook on it feels pretty positive.","replies":[{"poster":"CupcakeTrap","date":"2014-10-18T03:22:23.392+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I actually think one of the biggest things standing between Lore Fan/Lore Team harmony is pretty evident in your post here alone.

Narrative seems focused on tearing apart established lore and replacing it. Maybe that's something that needs to happen. But the appropriate community relations style differs drastically based upon whether, as you put it, they're providing \"progression\" or instead \"rewriting the base of the story.\"\n\nIf the new lore fits with established lore and carries it forward, or colors in some details, that's great, and there's not as much need for prior community discussion. Those sorts of things are fine as shock reveals. This lore update here, for example, doesn't really *rewrite* Xerath or Azir.\n\nIf the new lore is primarily focused on rewriting the foundations, then I think a different mode of community relations is called for, at least if they want to follow the Riot model and engage with the community. I'm not necessarily opposed to rewriting even very big pieces of League's lore, but such actions should be preceded by meaningful discussion. Let the community share their thoughts on the essence of the characters and settings at issue. Tell us what you're thinking about scrapping entirely, and explain what you're planning to put in its place. Gather ideas from the community. Get feedback. You don't have to put it to a vote, Narrative, but at least talk with us with an open mind.\n\nIt's not just about preferences. League is known for its active, creative community. Tons of content has origins in the community. If Riot values that, we need some more dialogue. Narrative may consider the old lore to be a collection of neglected ruins, but these ruins are inhabited. Show some respect for what your community has created while you vanished for years on end. Talk with us before you start indiscriminately bulldozing our homes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Avelden","date":"2014-10-18T14:48:40.912+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad part is that this probably/very likely won't be acknowledged in any post.

I was a bug lore buff in the past (playing since early season 1), but they've made me not really care anymore about it, because they've just stopped doing lore, then told us that more and different stuff will come, but nothing really happened for over a year and then they start releasing small snippets. Yes small snippets and expected us to treat it like several hundred pages long novels and now the lore team can't grasp why we're not sold on it. Shadow Isles \"chapter\" comes to mind.\n\nWe're continuously being told that there is so much more behing everything and anyone which are made by the \"new\" lore team, which has so much backstory, but all we receive are hints, small snippets and sometimes a little bit more, like this now. I have no idea what they're doing, but this is very reminiscent of someone not realizing that he isn't speaking, but just thinking about it in his head, while telling a nice story.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2014-10-21T13:11:27.451+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > Hopefully this does something to stem the tide of \"Narrative Team Never Listens\" threads.\n> \n> While it's great to see them releasing more lore, this is not what most of those threads are about.\n\nThere is a perfect example of this IN THIS BOARD. Click on the rioter rundown, see the fact that Jaredan rolls right past Cupcaketrap and the others who agree with his perspective. The problem is that Narrative is only engaging with the community where they want to, which is usually where people are saying nice things about Narrative.\n\nIf you want people to stop posting \"Narrative Team Never Listens\" you are going to have to talk to the people posting those threads. If you are listening to them you are doing nothing to show it.\n\nThat being said I have seen some other places where Narrative might actually be engaging, notably a recent thread on possible upcoming Mordekaiser changes.

Both Azir's and Xerath's stories were on their way when the retcon was announced.  Everything having to do with the Shurima event was already planned.  Now, they made a few minor changes based on feedback, and had a dialogue with the community about the short lore on the client problem.  Neither of those things went unnoticed here on the boards, but neither eliminates our skepticism, as well.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the major changes to Xerath's story, even to the core of the character, are minor evidence that Narrative isn't actually listening.  I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, since, as I said, that story was largely already known on their side before we started talking about having more community feedback.

At the same time, I feel like this new story does put him in a much better light than 'Evil Vizier what betrays his emperor for power' that people worried about him becoming. \n\nHe has a rather sympathetic goal and desire (his own freedom, promised to him by Azir when they were children), but when Azir finally does fulfill his promise, it's too late to stop what he's set in motion. While I wouldn't expect present-day Xerath to really care or acknowledge his past anymore, it does make me think what his first few years inside the tomb were like. \n\nIt also implies that Shurima might not have been the great, majestic, pinnacle-of-all-history empire that Azir sees it as, which is interesting (Granted, Xerath could just be a bitter unreliable narrator at this point).","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-10-18T01:36:20.261+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":8,"body":"I think you underestimate your powers of analysis.\n\nXerath is certainly an unreliable narrator.

Right now they're so sort they wouldn't draw anyone into looking for more lore on the website.\n\n---------\n**Azir**\n---------\nI think anyone who's played Azir in game is eternally grateful that the audio team added a slider for champion voices, as it's the only way to get him to shut up about Shurima.  For better or worse, Azir's lore stays true to that. \n\nI was a bit hopeful that his lore would add some depth to an otherwise broken record champion, but was disappointed. We learned a little bit about the extend of his sand shadows, but I feel like a great opportunity to actually make people sympathize or feel pity for him was missed. \n\nYes, Azir rushes to the top of the stairs. Yes, he falls to his knees at the sight of his family. Yes, he wishes he could cry. But in the end, the reaction here is about on par with his reaction for any other citizen. Azir didn't try to touch, hug, or even say the name of any of his family members. His reaction with them felt impersonal compared to what it should have been. In the end, he's still a broken record to me.\n\nThis lore gave us \"Ascended beings have a really good sense of where people are or if people are\" and little else. As someone else pointed out, it's very nice to see that Sivir left. I honestly don't want her having anything to do with Azir because of how flat he feels. It seems like any cooperation between Azir and Sivir will only serve to flatten Sivir's character.\n\n-----------\n**Xerath**\n-----------\nWho is this Xerath character? I find it a little odd that he shares the same name as one of the Champions in League of Legends, since the two are nothing alike. Must just be a common Shuriman name I guess.\n\nI liked Xerath's lore a **lot** more than Azir's lore. It was personal. It gave us details about Shurima's people, their culture, their beliefs, their government, ascended beings and more. That said, *this is not the same Xerath that is in the game*. \n\nXerath in game is always talking about power. \"I will show you true power\" and \"I need more!\" are some of the lines that instantly comes to mind. The entire Ascended game mode was about how you needed to take power for yourself. \n\nXerath in this lore seems to be a magus in title only. There's no reference in this lore to him using magic. There's no reference for him wanting power or knowledge. In fact, he is described as *already* having sufficient knowledge and power to bring about his goals. These pursuits seem of no interest to him, only the pursuit of freedom is worth anything and everything. \n\nIf this was the same Xerath that was in the game, we would see him itching to get out of the sarcophagus that is bound around him. \n\n---------\n\nI'm happy to read something on the lore, but it feels like these back stories need a bit more polish before they're finalized. \n\nP.S. this was all written on my phone late at night.

Things don't need to be resolved for good story, but advancement and progress seem pretty important. Kassadin and Malzahar can always have more little skirmishes, but neither will ever be able to strike anything resembling a lasting blow. Vayne hunts down and kills plenty of evil beings, but can never do much to another Champion. You're writing compelling characters that can't ever have story resolution (or at least significant progress, it seems like), which means their compelling nature eventually wears thin. Back to Kassadin, for example. His concept is very cool, and I love it to death. But, it's essentially a lot of fancy posing for him. He can't do anything to Malz, Cho, Kog, or anyone/thing else from the Void. Azir's personal war on Xerath and his goals for Shurima are really, really interesting.

Rather than making a purely theoretical argument, I'll use **[Factions lore](http://leaguefactions.net/previous-storylines/)** as an example.\n\nFactions started about a year ago. Its story is intricately interwoven with the League and the Institute. We've had five major \"chapters\" of the story, with outcomes determined by how matches played out, and we're now on our sixth. So far, every single chapter has centered around a League dispute. (Well, we pushed the bounds of that with Discord, but it was technically a League dispute.)\n\nThe Factions universe, and the stories of the Champions within, has changed *significantly* since it began. The League definitely has not prevented massive, sometimes even cataclysmic, changes. Instead, it's made them more interesting, by providing some larger themes and a political dimension on top of what would otherwise be pretty standard fantasy fare.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-10-18T10:20:16.318+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Institute or no institute, a champions situation can get very dire, they just won't die.

Not just his personality, but his form. \nAscension is not about \"what do you want to be,\" it's about becoming a noble and eternal guardian, who is set apart from humans by their form and power. As well, their form appears to be dictated by the kind of people they are. \n\nHowever, this new Xerath is not a seeker of power. His modus operandum is not power. It's not even known if he even knows anything about magic. In fact, this sounds more like a story about Swain than Xerath.\nHowever, this new Xerath has been consumed by the desire to be a free man, and while it could be argued that by being turned into a being of pure power is about freeing as free gets, the lore is very lacking in why Xerath is what he is. \n\nBecause at the moment, ascending is a do X, Y happens process, and when Xerath does it, he does X and something totally random happens. \nSo is the \"why is xerath a sparkplug\" question going to be answered? Because if not, I for one will be very disappointed. \n\nAlso, the Renekton lore now makes no sense. \nUnless he was completely powerless against Xerath for all that time, I don't see how Renekton would come out changed into a deranged killer, but Xerath would be all peachy keen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-10-18T00:53:42.504+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"[Spoiler on the Azir piece]\n\nJust got back from reading the both of them, I'm really interested in seeing this story taken a more linear approach (ie. a continuation)\n\nOne question I had was about Sivir; if Azir's family was killed in the fall of Shurima, who did Sivir descend from?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2014-10-18T01:05:19.920+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":7,"body":"That's an excellent question—that I will in no way, shape or form answer right now.

Forgive the cynicism, but what the **hell**  have you guys been doing?\n\nThere are nine champs now directly tied to Shurima:   Amumu, Ezreal, Nasus, Rammus, Renekton, Sivir, Skarner, Xerath and Azir.  Add to that the eight champs from the Shadow Isles:  Yorick, Evelynn, Mordekaiser, Maokai (who is on his third retcon), Elise, Hecarim, Thresh, Karthus (who just got a lore update).  Of those *seventeen* champions, how many of those longer bios are currently ready for our consumption right now?  Also, how long is this cycle going to continue, where we're shortening stories three areas ahead of when the full stories are ready to be released?\n\nSorry...

That story really should have been the end of that cinematic, though.\n• It's good to see Sivir away from Azir.  She really doesn't need to be Queen Shurima at the moment.\n• I'm curious as to what the sands around the temple are actually showing him:  Whether it's the actual truth or if it's what Azir wants to see.  Emperors and great leaders have a tendency to see and hear what they want to rather than what is actually there.\n• Just who the hell is Sivir descended from?  If all of Shurima died during the \"Xerath Incident\" except for Nasus and Renekton, who is Sivir descended from?  (I suspect this question will never be answered because... aliens).\n\n3) About [Xerath](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/RdkEIREJ-short-stories-xerathunbound)\n\n• What part of Xerath's story was *actually* changed based on our input?  Was he really going to be a bland, generic clone of Jafar from *Aladdin* and we just figured it out immediately after that preview was released on Facebook? (I'm guessing that greed had something to do with Xerath's original actions, given all the melodramatic lines during the Ascension game.)\n• Regret is a powerful tool in fiction.  If Xerath ever gets a voice rework, there should be some lines directed toward Azir that reflects his regret.\n• Side question:  In the face of this new story, how does Renekton actually go crazy after being trapped with Xerath all those years?\n\n**Note: ** It's funny how Xerath's story echoes our own history with Narrative:  We \"rescue\" the lore by giving it our all-out support, then we were promised many things which were never delivered on, treated with silence and contempt for years only to have a long awaited promise of communication delivered at a grand moment only to have it sabotaged by some stupid movie quote and more silence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Felaeris","date":"2014-10-19T19:31:02.421+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Read the Azir bit.

The writing was beautiful, well-done, honestly! The story is so degrading and insulting to the character Xerath was previously. He was once an ambitious man. Maybe a little upset with his peers for being jerks, but he did amazing things and was regarded as the most intelligent and talented magus in Shurima! This Xerath is vengeful and short-sighted and can't share and emotionally inhibited and completely unforgiving. He's not intelligent anymore. His new slave theme only works with the fact he's now a slave to his own misgivings. He's just a corrupt, angry little boy. He claims he'd be killed for speaking of freedom: would he really face that punishment if he spoke about it with the man who considers him a savior? Who **promised **him that freedom? It's not logical. And Xerath used to be intelligent enough to see that logic. Even cold Xerath had someone he loved before. This guy has nothing. Just hate. Even from his own perspective story. That's not the intelligence we're supposed to believe he has, not what's reflected in his character's words. He's been rendered flat, 2Dimensional. That's no fault of the writing (again, it was beautiful, please do more), it's just the new emptiness of his character. \n\nI really hope we see more of these stories in general, but I really hope Xerath is continued to be worked on and refined.
