It'd be unfair that Yasuo players get a loading screen for 975 RP, when loading screens for the new PROJECT skins can only be obtained by paying full price.\n\nAlso\n>We realize that newer players may not have had as many opportunities to collect skins/content (i.e. Judgment Kayle), We felt this was a good opportunity for both new and old players to engage with limited edition content.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-08-31T16:58:12.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for quoting this! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-08-31T18:25:05.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to help, K.
