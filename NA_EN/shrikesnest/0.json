I have groups of friends that I like to play with, all of us pretty casual.  None of us really play ranked, and if we did I doubt any of us would make it out of Bronze.  That's okay; none of us are interested in being esports contenders, just having the occasional night of fun matches.  There is some variance in our team's skill level, but nothing super dramatic.  Again, none of us even play ranked.\n\nBut every time, and I mean every time, we form a full 5-man premade group in ARAM or Team Builder, we get matched against a group that's practicing for ranked.  It's such a ludicrous bloodbath that we walk away, shattered husks of people, succor a distant memory.  I don't know how the MMR calculation works, but it seems to be broken somehow.\n\nIt's extremely annoying not being able to play with a full group of friends.  What's happening here?

You cant play with a full group unless you're looking to either get crushed, or play super competitively. I wish it wasn't that way, but it is. Its ultimately why my play group fell apart. We had one player that was just awful, and while any one of us could carry her in a duo game, as a full team the burden was too much. Later on I played with an entirely different group, and we had a problem where when we were 4 premade with 1 random it didn't matter what the random was we would win almost every game. The moment we became a 5 premade though we basically sentenced ourselves to losses. We wanted to create a ranked 5s team, but because of the constant losses as a 5 premade we basically dropped the idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thicc as fuk","date":"2014-08-17T19:17:15.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually have this happen to me a lot.\nThought no one in my team is unranked when we queue up as 5 being only high to low golds and silvers we get placed against high golds and high to low plats with an occasional diamond.

But I realized after being matched with Plat's, and sometimes Diamond level players on the Regular in normal's (losing quite a bit of them) That my normal MMR was higher then it should. I tend to play alone when that starts happening. What that does is bring My personal MMR back down to where it should be. Not sure how it works, but Even beating the plat's solo brings my MMR back into line with gold's and high silver 1. \n\n>It's extremely annoying not being able to play with a full group of friends. What's happening here? Is there some reason we get put up against commando teams that wipe the floor with us every time we queue as a full group?\n\nWell all I can say is play more. Get better with a select group of champs. If you and your mates constantly swap roles, try pitching the idea of sticking to certain roles. \n\nYou also said you don't have much time to dedicate to Hobbies? Well it's really easy to misconstrued that. I was working 36 hours at one point while going to school. I was not only able to make time for other things but able to get a minimum of 4 games in a night. 4 games x 7 days is 28 games. 4 games isn't a lot but it's grows fast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"67chrome","date":"2014-08-18T20:45:24.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well - before the 5x5 thing was an option matchmaking used to assume a premade team would have a significant edge on a group of players the same Elo that were just randomly thrown together, so in the case of finding a few duo, triple, or multiple solo queue players it would cobble together a team with a noteworthy Elo advantage.\n\nI'd strongly recommend trying to figure out how your friends play and definitely use something like Skype, Vent, or another such program to easily communicate.
