But my question is, what happens to their MMR? does Riot reset it 1200? or do they get to keep their inflated MMR?\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s say someone got his account boosted from Silver to Platinum. Where will they end up after their placements for next season, assume they end up with 5 wins and 5 losses in placements? Are they gonna be in mid-low Gold? or low silver/ high bronze?","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-11-08T18:28:51.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you get caught boosting and want to know if riot left your boosted mmr intact.\n\nOf course they are going to reset it.  It would make no sense to leave it at the level it was boosted to if the entire reason for punishment is that they don't deserve that level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Dont Main Mid","date":"2016-11-08T18:00:50.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were boosted werent you lol","replies":[]}]}
