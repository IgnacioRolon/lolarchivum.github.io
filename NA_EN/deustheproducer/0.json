So very much like a daemon from the warp, making a poro explode simply spirits it away for a bit. Also poros apparently reproduce asexually by eating Poro Snax :3\n\nAnd maybe they magically drop cured skins and other animal-based products when they're dispelled (hence the poro-skin rug in Winter Wonder {{champion:61}}'s splash).
