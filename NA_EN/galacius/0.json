I go to load the store and it takes some time to load (black screen and some lag - the usual) and I got a weird error when I'm trying to buy a champion shard. \r\n[Store Error](http://imgur.com/a/XXyZH)\r\n\r\nIt fixed itself when refreshing the store, but I am bringing this here to make you guys aware that things may still be buggy after yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-08T23:32:40.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you might be disconnecting from the store.  The black screens further affirm that because it's failing to load assets.  My suggestion in this case would be to run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to tighten things up and stay connected!  :D  Let me know if you have any questions!","replies":[]}]}
