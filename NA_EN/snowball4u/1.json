When I queue up, it is specifically to achieve the next rank, and get the shiney border. I do not queue up to get better at the game. The main reason I'm complaining, is because even though I find myself to be better than these players, I struggle to win against them because of the unstoppable snowballing of games, and because of the current pool of strong champions.\n\nHowever, queueing up for games feels aweful. Every game I get into, I hope and pray that my team is decent at the game. I do not expect them to win, or to even do well. I expect them to spend the first 10 minutes comfortably keeping their place in the game, until I can snowball out of control. An ideal game looks like this: I bully out my enemy laner, as like I said before, I should be better than them. After this, I roam to bully the enemy jungler, and the enemy bot lane. Most of the time, this works well and helps my team to easily win the game. \n\nRecently, games have not been working like this. In all roles, there are several champions that can easily prevent you from getting an early lead. For example, top lane has Darius and Vladimir, and Mid has Vladimir Talon Zed and Swain. Each of these champions all have their own issues, but in some way,they can prevent you from snowballing and/or force you to stay far back behind your minions. Because of this, I am unable to do anything, as I watch my team get solo killed repeatedly. I cannot roam, because If i do, I will lose my tower. I cannot farm, because I will get shoved out of lane. And I cannot fight them, because they are designed to either be extremely safe, or destroy you in a duel.\n\nEven though I'm just ranting out of frustration, it is obvious that Riot is very ignorant about the problems in Solo Queue. They seem to balance based on both casual (meaning normal games/very low elo games), or for competitive. Especially these last few patches, there has been very little balancing done around solo queue, which is upsetting, because these problems have been around for a long time, and have been this extreme since the introduction of thenew runes. The only thing I want from riot is to make the game feel like a battle, not a one sided stomp.\n\nTLDR: Another post about Solo Queue being too snowbally.\n\nThanks for reading","replies":[{"poster":"Woodakoodashooda","date":"2018-05-25T21:45:45.500+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":10,"body":"The OP complains about the game being snowbally while also complaining that they should be the one to snowball out of the 10 players in each of their games.\n\n-1 from me","replies":[{"poster":"Snowball4u","date":"2018-05-25T22:08:10.127+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chocolate Frost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=WABcP5gR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-05-25T21:45:45.500+0000)\n>\n> The OP complains about the game being snowbally while also complaining that they should be the one to snowball out of the 10 players in each of their games.\n> \n> -1 from me\n\nThis post was a very unorganized rant, Ill give you that.\n\nI'm complaining about the game being to snowbally and because its so snowbally the only way i can win is by snowballing out of control. Right now there are specific picks to prevent snowballing, such as vlad. Since I have to play against him, there is nothing I can do to snowball, meanwhile the other lanes are free to do so themselves. \n\nIf this was a competitive environment, I would not be complaining about this. However this is solo queue. In a solo queue environment, a champion that forces another player to be useless no matter what they do is unhealthy. \n\nIt might sound like I'm complaining about the champions like vlad or swain, but they that arent that oppressive and they arent the problem. What makes them a problem is the snowbally nature of the game, which should be fixed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"z63XnLCMwX","date":"2018-05-25T22:13:40.994+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"Picks fiora, dominates lanes, 11-2.

If you look at the options for the more offensive oriented items, all of their damage mitigation is automatic compared to AP: Archangel's and Zhyona's vs Hexdrinker, Death's Dance, Phantom Dancer, Guardian Angel, Sterakk's Gauge. (The outliers bucking the trend being Banshee's Veil and Quicksilver Sash). Don't forget that AD also has mechanics like Crit and Lifesteal over AP, with spellvamp basically being removed from the game.\n\nThis is on top of comparable ability damage across the two, auto attacks, and the general mobility that's been saturating the game. It also feels like you need to be much farther ahead on an AP champion to start nuking people into oblivion than you do on an AD, and even then it seems like being able to burst somebody 100 to 0 is only acceptable when done by AD champions.\n\nI'm not sure if somebody at Riot has a grudge against AP champions. While I get being combo-nuked by a mage from a distance isn't fun and can be frustrating, It's even worse where missing even ONE ability could cost you a kill, which then could very well result in you dying as a result as the AD champion missed you with half or more of their abilities ends up winning regardless because Auto attacks. (Or sometimes facetank your entire combo and win either way in cases where a champion like twitch buys a death's dance and proceeds to pop his ultimate, kill you in 2-3 crit autos and walk away because of the DR and the lifesteal)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-05-25T21:31:21.810+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are 22-14 at Plat 1.

I have seen people in silver who would destroy most diamond/challengers.  There's probably some flaw in their game play but there's some crazy shit going on in gold/silver.  Back when I was stuck in low gold for like a year, I was watching some egirl stream and this d1 yasuo main was running his mouth in chat.  My friend looked him up and he was actually on a pro team, but not one of the top teams or anything.  We got into a custom game with the streamer girl, she was my mid, I was jg, and he played his main (yasuo) and the streamer chick was like low plat I think.  That was the easiest yasuo to gank in my life.  He kept talking shit so I know he was going in super tryhard.  I went 7/0, and mostly due to camping him, because I went there to kill him once since he was talking shit and it was so ridiculously easy I kept going back.  It was a fucking joke.  There are Yasuo's I have encountered in gold/silver that are 1000x better than that guy.  There are some badass players in low elo, but every time I go against high elo people I stomp them.  I even came across Meteos in chat (in his prime) and challenged him, and he told me i'm \"not worthy\" lmao.  I'm pretty sure I would have stomped him too.  He's not that great.  I was taught by xj9 just before that and improved my game a lot, but still couldn't get out of low gold for a long time, regardless of being way better than every jgler I went against.  I played ranked 5's and dominated, and in custom games I dominated.  I eventually made it to plat, and realized a lot of it was anger issues, but mostly it was just shit teammates.  When I got to gold 1 I kept getting people who acted like they never played before.  I wrote a huge comment on this post about it so refer to that.  I mentioned a 20cs ez at 20 minutes who played like my 10 year old  nephew played in his 3rd game of league ever.  Idk if it was just bad luck, or if Riot has some weird thing where they flag your account or IP address when you're toxic (I was pretty toxic back then, but usually when the game was already fucked anyway due to these random new people probably coming down from a diamond boost or something).  Anyway my point is, there are some absolute beasts in silver/gold and a lot of garbage in high elo.  If I had to put a team together, i'd probably grab mostly silver/gold players and probably win.  I have actually done this before with a team of bronze/silver/gold players in ranked 5's we were destroying diamonds, but our bronze guy was really holding us back, you could tell he wasn't that good.  People put pro players and high elo players on this massive pedestal and I don't think they really deserve it at all.  I'll never back down from a challenge against high elo players because I know they aren't necessary great at league, they just know all the little tricks to climb Riot's VERY VERY VERY flawed matchmaking system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-05-26T08:52:19.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe the biggest problem with these players is that they think they are still better than the competition. I have this problem as well. A Diamond 5 player will stomp his way through silver and gold and still do decently in low plat and eventually reach D5. The thing is that, throughout this journey, they will do plays that are risky and only work because their skill is far superior to that opposition at that lower elo. As they climb higher, they don't work as often anymore, because the opposition is stronger.\n\nI have been a victim to this mentality. I've been playing in gold elo for 2 seasons (no time to really play more and climb), so, this season, I hit plat 3 and then dropped to plat 5 due to a series of bad games. Sure, most of them were not my fault, but I was the reason we lost in some of those. I'd like to attribute my losses to this factor. I kept trying to get leads for me and my team by making risky plays that would work in lower elo, but not in mid plat. People there would know how to react to such plays and I'd get punished.\n\nGetting to D5 is a confirmation for a lot of people that they are good players. They sure are better than MOST of the player base, but with higher climbing comes stiffer opposition, and people seem to have trouble adapting. And I mean, how wouldn't they? Matchmaking is currently so bad, that you can't know what to expect. I've seen people of the same division play way differently in skill. I've seen plat 3 people play like mid Diamond and plat 3 people playing like Gold 5.

Also the main reason people tell low elo to carry is because it is extremely easy. The enemies make so many mistakes giving you so many oppertunities to kill them. Along with that, the other players dont take advantage of mistakes the way high elo players do. If youve ever been in a silver game where a fizz is diving the other mid laner under the inner tower at 7 minutes, that is exactly why. Low elo players a lot of the time wont even end the game when they are able to, because they dont realize they can. In high elo however, you have very little room for mistake. I can be carrying my team going 8/0, but if I die once, I will lose the game.\n\nAlso my problem is that I cant abuse players to get ahead. Just because of the champion they picked, I may be forced to sit under tower, unable to get ahead. Even if they make a mistake, allowing me to kill them, I will maybe get 3 kills, which is nothing compared to the 7/0 adc the enemy team has. \n\nLike I said, this was just a rant and if I play 100+ more games I'll get to d4/5 or wherever I belong.

I'm not sure if they rig them intentionally to keep the addiction factor going, or if it's just something that is sort of happening on it's own.

Some kid who has been playing for literally a week can buy a boost on some random website (ie. xj9's website where be has been boosting for years...several sites like this exist, hundreds if not thousands), and said kid gets boosted to diamond, then q's up for ranked.  That game is ruined.  You cannot argue with this.  Putting someone who has never played a game before into a diamond game ruins the game.  Yes it is possible to win a 4v5, but this is more like 4v7 anyway because he's going to feed HARD which an afk wouldn't do.  I figured this out when every time I got to gold 1 or sometimes plat 5, I would get people who didn't even know how to lane.  They would just aimlessly walk around the map with no clue what game they were even playing apparently.  I still remember an ezreal from years ago with 20 cs at 20 minutes.  He would just wander off randomly exploring the map as if it was a place he had never been before.  I recently introduced my 10 year old nephew to the game and he does this too...that's when I realized what was really up with that ezreal.  He was probably in his first week of playing league and may have been 8 - 12 years old as well, hard to say though.  So just because of boosting, we already have thousands of people in ranked games which don't belong at that elo and this DESTROYS the integrity of SO many ranked games. \n\n2) Riot's addiction algorithm.  Anyone with programming experience can feel it...that constant push toward 50% winrate.  It's always there.  The fact is, in League of Legends, if you demonstrate skill, you get shit teammates more often.  If you're shit, you get great teammates more often.  It's a fact.  If you don't believe me, pull up a spreadsheet and play your best for 20 games, recording everyone's kda's, then play like a new person for 20 games and record kda's wins/losses etc.  The patterns will be dead obvious.  Again, go ahead and try to argue with me.  I know 100% that i'm right.  I have been playing for so many years and I can see it all the time and it's still there, and stronger than ever (they have \"improved\" it with each patch since like season 3/4).  \n\n3) This one is the dumbest thing I have seen Riot do, and it mostly affects low level games.  Smurf detection.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great algorithm.  It detects who is a smurf and/or already good and who is new.   Great job Riot.  Now all you have to do is use this algo to SEPARATE THESE PEOPLE into different games.  Obviously...I mean that's literally common sense. Oh wait, this is Riot we're talking about here, so they take this amazing algorithm and use it to rig the shit out of games for step 2 (above) to push people closer to 50% winrate, or for addiction factor, or both...i'm really not sure TBH.  The fact is they mix new people with smurfs...how fucked up is that?  I'm a plat player, and I had a game the other day with a lee sin that went like 20/0 in the first 10 minutes.   I was jg and there was nothing anyone could have done to stop him.  My entire team was new.  They told me they were new.  So Riot's goofy idea here was to put me against Lee as the smurfs, then throw a bunch of new people in there.  BTW he had 2 smurfs with him so basically it was 1v3 with a bunch of new people just kind of dying.  I get fed but there were less new people for me to farm, and also he was playing Lee Sin who has been broken since the beginning of time, so there was no winning that game.  Of all the dumb things Riot has done, mixing new people with smurfs and using it to manipulate games is the most fucked up thing.  I'm surprised they even get new players...that would make me feel awful starting out a game, then being put against people who have been playing for years, while simply trying to level my account and LEARN the game and the many champions.  \n\n\nSo these are 3 huge issues, but in addition to them, Riot has been trying to reduce snowballing over the years, which is good, but they have really just made it worse as there are certain champions who can do it more than ever.  My favorite champs can't do it anymore, but Lee Sin can come in and get 2 kills and suddenly dive literally anyone at their turret and kill them AND survive.  The anti-snowball sort of worked, they just forgot to nerf certain champs, I would imagine because some high-up people at Riot are fans of them, or want to keep the strong so they can continue to dominate soloq...idk i'm just guessing.  \n\nIf you want to climb in soloq, just get good at Lee Sin, and be super aggressive diving turrets and make sure to take the turret afterward, gg nothing anyone can do.  I know of pro players who no matter how good they get, when they see a lee sin they are like \"it's ok just take the loss because lee sin\".  They try to get to late game because he falls off late, but other than that even they are helpless.  \n\nMy advice at this point is to play Teamfight Tactics. I climbed super fast in that game, from Iron 2 to Gold 2 in my first 5 or 6 days of playing ranked.  My 3 examples above don't apply to TFT because there are no teammates.  Hard to rig up games when it's single player.  Well, number 1 may still exist because there is boosting, but i'm going for challenger so i'm cool with a diamond or challenger opponent (in the process of boosting an acct.) or even a noob who is post-boost, because if they aren't on your team they can't fuck your game up as much.  If I lose to him, I learn from it and use it to better myself.  \n\nI have just 1 more thing to say.  Someone will try to debate me by saying \"well how do boosters climb then?\".  Simple, they are often challenger players.  Lets say for example i'm a diamond 5 level player.  I place into bronze or silver, which really is common because well for reasons I explained before.  A challenger could be so much better than everyone else that he can climb even with all these fucked up things happening which I explained before, because he/she is just so much better than EVERYONE.  What about a d5 player?  What about a plat player?  We get to gold and suddenly we are getting all these kids who just got their accounts back from a gold boost and they never even played the game.  We might be better than other gold players but not like a challenger who is just perfect and so far above everyone else.  How do we climb if we're better than everyone but not 10x better?  How would a silver get out of bronze when there's boosters all over the place, and all these other things affecting the games?  Sure, a plat/diamond/challenger can get from bronze to silver.   I hope this is making sense.  This is why the best players can still climb in a broken system, and the rest is mostly luck (teammates).  The fact that 90% of people who play this game don't realize this is actually beyond me.  You're literally 10% of the people in the game.  10%.  You could be one of the best players in the country, and all they have to do is put you against TWO of the best players in the country and you're fucked, let alone FIVE OF THEM, and then you get some new guy on your team who is coming down from a fucking challenger boost lmao.  I know i'm just rambling at this point but so many people disagree with all these facts and they are plain as day to me and probably anyone who programs or at least has an IQ over 50.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RogueKnightOO","date":"2018-05-26T06:22:22.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES PREACH!

Every season, there have been broken items/champ and Riot goes on to fix it. This season is _broken season_, and here is a list that snowballs the game exponentially unlike before. \n\nRunes: high base dmg with high ratio\n\nPassive gold: increase\n\nNeutral objective: rift herald, buffed baron/elder, now buffed scuttle, so very high early contests\n\nResolve tree combined with new AP items: high vitality/mana, results in safe laning phase\n\nsupport buff: losing bot means 2.5 worth of champion is behind, and 2.5 worth of champion ahead for enemy team.\n\nresults: scaling is more valuable than before, bot lane is more important than before, which means if your team don't have an assassin/AP/bruiser that can keep enemy bot in check, it will be an uphill battle. Once there is map pressure from the winning team, neutral objective like herald and baron will greatly decrease the losing team's come back, resulting in a 1 sided snowball. \n\nextra feedback: I see you play mid a lot, you either need to just shit on their bot lane, which is admittedly hard when AD have so much fail-safes, or you can play an AP mid like Swain/vlad/ekko that stonewalls the lane and scale into a backline disruptor in team fight. \n\nOr you don't need to be a meta slave, and just keep playing Talon/LB, but you will grind more games, eat at your soul more with bad team likely.\n\nFinal note: I think the saddest thing regarding the current state of soloqueue, is that laning phase (1st tower down), have been shortened as a result of 1v2 tower hugging in pro play. Riot changed it because it was boring for the viewers to watch both teams swapping objective instead of confronting each other.\n\n I think the best period of LoL in soloQ, was when you can snowball from gradually winning small trades in lane, then take that lead and go into mid game skirmish/teamfight while your enemy catch up on CS. That's a lost art. \n\nIf you think it's more team reliant now, you are right, because winning now are heavily skewed in an early 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5 before the individual can establish a sizable lead.\n\nTL;DR: fast pace traits of 1st person shooter games have taken over slow strategy game in one of the best MOBA of the decade, ruining its unique quality/versality of a slow strategy game.
