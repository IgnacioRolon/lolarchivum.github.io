I did notice all the games you've played with him, and it seems like you only play Rengar in spurts where he's all you play for certain time periods....hmmm...\n\nAfter a little more digging, it looks like all the times where you played Rengar was during [**weekly champ rotations**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/free-rotation/new-free-champion-rotation-rengar-sona-yasuo-and-more) when he was free to play. This account hasn't ever bought Rengar or had him gifted to it, but if you're talking about a different account I can definitely look into that one as well!","replies":[{"poster":"Rengooo","date":"2017-05-13T07:22:48.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"luuuuuuuuuuuul, nice try at a free champ I guess","replies":[]}]}]}
