When i go to the Patch notes...the patch is on the live server patch. when the patch reaches the live servers (Patch 7.18) the pbe patch notes finally change to the next one, odd right? Thats not all, in the game the buffs and nerf aren't working at all, yet skins, game modes, queues are all in there rightful place.\r\n   I saw a red mercy video and i quote \"the patch of 7.18 is now on the pbe servers\"\r\ni quickly looked to the pbe, its still 7.17...17?!?!?\r\n   I still seek out a solution to this problem yet i still don't have an answer\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a a fix to this, i really need it. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-05T20:40:12.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bit confusing, it's almost like someone played some prank and swapped the name of your live and PBE launch icons.
