Ive been told to put them on different files ,but How do i do that on a mac? I also think it has to do with my account, because the pbe account i created is the same username and password on the live servers. Can you please help me, as to how to peacefully play on the pbe and live servers without any problems happen, on a mac.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-08-11T17:36:21.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The PBE Client and the Alpha Client are two different things!
