They are also extremely cheap meaning they result in a weaker full build for you in the late game.

I believe some counterplay via roles would be nice for the game. It means you have a soft target/objective in every fight depending on your champ and role. I do agree though that &quot;tanky metas&quot; becomes annoying because tanky items also work good on carry characters with good base damage, but I&#x27;d like fights to just last a little longer and give a little bit more reaction time.\n\nTbh your downvotes are unwarranted.\n\nYou make good points.\n\n_<Removed>_","replies":[{"poster":"Danyoja","date":"2018-12-03T20:01:51.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, but I don't really care about downvotes.
