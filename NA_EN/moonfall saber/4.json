Let's look at some of the content of your recent matchmaking threads:\n\n>When your on a win streak....Riot garentees that your next game will have a troll on your team.\n\nThat's it. That's a **Rant** post, as it's low content and low on discussion-starting.\n\n> Getting trolls back to back... to back.... for real? This has nothing to do with my 8 game win streak right? No way. This couldnt possibly be a forced lose.\n\nSame as the previous.\n\n>Matchmaking is still an april fools joke that just never ends. Haha guys jokes on us... it wasnt a joke. Were trapped in this shit matchmaking forever.\n\nSame *again.*\n\n>Does anyone ever feel as though they have been matched fairly? I feel as though every single game I play I get the last pick in gym dodgeball kid on my team and his special ed friend on my team\n\nSame again, but with added unnecessary comments on the athletic abilities of special needs children.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo yeah, we'll continue to remove/delete non-constructive threads that don't encourage a discussion, resemble rants, and are posted at a very rapid rate. That's intentional. If you want to have a well-reasoned, thoughtful discussion of match-making, go ahead and make a thread to do that! What you've been doing *is not that.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-06-04T22:52:41.880+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Every single post about matchmaking is a kid having a meltdown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-06-04T22:56:39.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"you have the same post in multiple sub boards and in categories it dont belong in. such as this one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2019-06-04T23:25:35.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Apologies.

Then, as a result, you get a pay cut despite it being the douchebag's fault the game was lost, not yours. But alas, people are so scared of change/favor the fucked up system (either out of ignorance or because they favor the trolls) that it never gets addressed without a hurricane of downvotes and low effort comments telling them they're wrong. And so Riot never takes them seriously, and matchmaking is doomed to remain the shitfest it has been.\n\nWatch, even this will get a swarm of downvotes. You can downvote all you want, but deep in your hate filled heart, you know that I'm right. Your response may deny it, but you know the truth.","replies":[]}]}
