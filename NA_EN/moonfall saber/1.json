Now I know this isnt my internet because this is not common. The other thing that really bothers me is that I can play 3 games in a row with the first and last game being around 40 ping and the middle game being the laggy one above 200 ping and the games are back to back. As if that specific game is causing me to lag somehow. Does anyone else experience this?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-17T04:21:50.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spiking up to over 9000 sounds pretty intense for sure O_O.....\n\nMy first thought for those major spikes is usually packet loss or bad ISP routing, so let's be sure to run a traceroute and check the health of that first. Run a trace to 104.160.131.1 for about 5-10 and post those results here for me to take a look at.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TSM Khal Drogo","date":"2018-01-17T02:59:14.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just started laging myself not sure if this helps but it started tonight I was around the 40 ping range but now I am at 50ping","replies":[]}]}
