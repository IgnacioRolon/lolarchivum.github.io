All mage mains were hoping that this pass at the mage itemization was going to bring just that. Even aside from that there has never been. Bruiser item for mages such as Diana, elise and morde. If you play any of these champions you can feel how there are no items that truly fit into your build. Basically if you didn&#039;t build morellinomicom before then your going to get screwed by thesr changes because it doesn&#039;t help you at all. Azir players could be in this category as well considering they would build nashor tooth replacing morellinomicom. Now that morellinomicom is split into a bunch of different items where is the sustain mage items? ","replies":[]}
