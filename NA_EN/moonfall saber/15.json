I play this game more than anybody who works for riot. If I was actually a new player I&#039;d be like well this company is a bunch of dicks so I&#039;ll go play something else.  You know what else sucks is that I&#039;m playing with other players who clearly play the game already. So new players just get destroyed every time they walk into lane trying to learn the game.  How is that fun?  You are not getting any new players anytime soon with this terrible new game experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2017-11-28T17:40:40.833+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you’re a smurf, you get matched up with other smurfs pretty quickly.\n\nAnd the point of the “noob” ads is to show how it’s ok if you’re bad when you start out. Everyone died a lot when they just started, everyone didn’t understand how you’re supposed to build champions when they just started out. For someone whose actually new, it has a different meaning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-11-28T17:39:46.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ever happened to the term newb?
