I didn't do the exact math recently but resist's value drops dramatically after 100-200 so you only stack it when its needed or your character gets bonus scaling from resist.","replies":[{"poster":"Glory ln Death","date":"2017-05-11T16:02:54.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"False. The values you listed are correct, but every point of armor/mr gives the same value, no matter how much you buy. Armor and mr do not have diminishing returns.\n\nSay you have 1000 health. If you have 0 armor, it takes 1000 physical damage to kill you. If you have 100 armor, 1000 damage only deals 500 to your health bar, so you need to take 2000 damage total before you will die. Your Effective Health was increased by 1000. If you have 200 armor, 1000 damage only deals 333 to your health bar (66% reduction) so you have to take 3000 damage before you die. Your Effective Health was increased by another 1000.\n\nEvery point of armor or mr increases your Effective Health against its respective damage type by 1%, no matter how much you have. The reason you need both health and resists is to maximize your Effective Health - 1000 health with 500 armor gives you 6000 EHP, but 2000 health gets you the same EHP with just 200 armor, and 3000 health gets it with 100 armor.
