They had generally very powerful early-game effects, and if you mis-played your early game, then you progressively lost harder the rest of the game. It was a balancing act to make your runes and masteries pay off in game. It required alot of fore-thought and knowing the subtle effect the masteries had on your strength throughout the game. The macro game was less complex, but the micro-game and mechanics and ability to mentally calculate trades in game was more complex and made the difference between a great player and a god-tier player. Now, the macro-game is determined by your runes, and calculation is almost completely irrelevant, because there is always a less risky course of action to take, if you cannot calculate the outcome of a team-fight and outplay opponents with a novel mechanical decision (like flashing to start a team fight). Flashing to start a team-fight is completely off limits now. It just doesn't pay off, because the alternative macro strategy (map pressure via lane control and vision) is too easy and safe and guaranteed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anatera","date":"2018-03-12T03:34:25.891+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abibyama,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=l5XpuHjB,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2018-03-11T19:51:18.555+0000)\n>\n> Yeah dude, it sure took  A LOT of thought into going the 21-9-0 , 9-21-0 and 0-21-9 mastery page and a rune page filled with a bunch of stats \n> \n> so much strategic thinking.\n\nJust because you chose cookie cutter builds doesn't mean variety didn't exist.

Last sentence is true. There is no element of calculation in the game now. Risky kills are not rewarded. Entering a team fight at the right time and chasing to get a pentakill de-optimizes your map pressure and gives enemies an opportunity to get back into the game. Currently, the most rewarding path is to make efficient kills and go push a lane, rotating between many objectives and accumulating a slow, steady map pressure lead. The game is also too complex to bother paying attention to mechanical skills. It's all a top-down planning game now. Mechanical skills don't matter any more. Timing your opponents' and allies' spell rotations and summoner spell cooldowns and focusing on micro-level game-play is drastically dwarfed in effectiveness by playing safe and making regular \"deposits\" into the vision game and lane-pressure game. Lastly, it is more punishing to roam from a losing lane than rewarding, should your roam result in a positive outcome for your team.\n\nI would love to play League of Legends Season 2, similarly to how Runescape re-released Runescape 1.0 as a special feature.

It's just group with your fed bot lane and win the game. If your bot lane loses you might as well surrender at 15 unless you want a 50 minute game...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Phazanor ","date":"2018-03-12T16:57:24.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been some weeks now that I only play a bot game a day for the FWotD.

Its fine(albeit a little annoying) on champs like Taric and Malphite who have armor scalings built into their kit, (although I still believe offense shouldn't scale with defense.) But I just wnet against a full tank Mordekaiser as Yorick and he was consistently out damaging me when the only damage item he had was Titanic Hydra. Why is it that Riot wants to make itemization for AP champs more expensive and less usefull but still allows full tank champions to burst like a fed mid laner. It makes no god damn sense to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Resolution","date":"2018-03-12T07:05:01.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's because they're slowly turning the game into a button masher instead of a strategy game.

Trust me i know , when my exp progression slowed to a stand still because every game i had no chance i left for a couple of years. the new system may not be perfect and i might not have the same level of experience you guys do , but I rarely use the exact same rune page for every champ, because every champ has it's niche.
