A one-time offense isn't harassment (though you are singling out a group by race, which counts as singling someone out) but it is hate speech which is also an offense, but a different one. If you continued it, then it would be both hate speech and harassment. Murder isn't considered stealing, but it's another crime. But if you robbed someone and killed them, it would be both murder and stealing.\n\nAlso getting up to someone and punching them in the face is physical abuse but not harassment.
