I believe you that you do, since you’ve played her longer, but when I ran some matches on her she felt good, both in her jungle clears and in fights. And clearly they weren’t necessarily “gutting” if her winrate went up. Maybe simplified, or something else, but not gutted.","replies":[{"poster":"AetherArising","date":"2019-03-22T20:58:53.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They made her idiot-proof. They lowered her power to compensate.\n\nMaybe she's just meant to lose all her damage builds and become a frontline  peel tank, since she lost large ratios on her 2 major damage moves in a fight.

Then she got changes and EVERYONE played her and winrate went up because the changes removed skill expression in exchange for safety and easy teamfights (the R changes namely making teamfights a joke if you play it right) but she lost what made her *vi*\n\nWhen you see someone slamming and punching with giant gauntlets and fairly little body armor, you think they'll be hurting you but only a little tanky.
