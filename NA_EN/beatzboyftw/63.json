You people who regularly bash it have literally 0 experience with it. I do. I have been a toxic player in the past and my account was flagged, and rightly so. However, I have taken measure to reform, and they have been wildly successful. However, I still get regular punishments. In fact, I am likely a single report away from a permaban. I have literally received a 2 week time ban, a 20 game chat restriction, and a 10 game ranked restriction SIMULTANEOUSLY for saying \"gg afk\" ONE TIME. And before you Riot sheep say \"well you can't be banned for only a single offense\", BULLSHIT. Riot linked me the offensive games, and this was the only one in the log. The fact is that if you manage to get your account flagged (ie your first offense) you are fucked. Even single games can ruin you, and even if you only occasionally rage (as literally everyone does, do NOT try to say that you are some kind of pure soul that never experiences anger and allows it to show) you WILL escalate your punishment.

Also, in your effort to invalidate my voice (which is exactly how Riot wants you to respond to such protest btw), you seemed to miss a very crucial detail: a single offense earned me a 14 day time ban, a 20 game chat ban, and a 10 game ranked restriction. That penalty was cited by Riot themselves as a punishment reserved for hate speech, PLUS A CHAT AND RANKED RESTRICTION. I was literally treated worse than someone who routinely told other players to kill themselves, or threw down racial slurs regularly.

I don't believe that because this sounds extreme for basically, nothing. \"gg AFK\" was never punishable with a 14 day ban, 20 game chat restriction and 10 games ranked restriction, all at once.\n\nIf this was your attitude in most games you played, then it clearly shows passive-aggressive attitude towards your team when things start going bad.  Then your punishments would start accumulating from starting chat bans, then to ranked game restrictions and then (if this doesn't stop you), to 14 day ban.\n\nI don't know what to tell you but Riot never did punish players for something they didn't do.

Regardless of how spaced out they are. Example: my most recent reform card cited 3 games that occurred over a period of 3 months. 3 games in 3 months during which I played ~5+ games each day. Does this seem like a fair and balanced system?\n\nAnother issue is that Riot gives 0 fucks to the context of chat the ban bot deems \"toxic\". Example: I was once harassed extensively for playing pantheon support in a normal game, despite having literally asked the team if they were ok with it. It was clear that 4 people were going to report me for trolling, so I went into all chat to try to garner support from the enemy team and kindly asked if they would submit a report on my behalf, as I did not feel that my voice would be considered against the cries of the masses. I was banned within 5 minutes of that particular game ending, and it was cited in my reform card. So, despite me being victimized during this particular game, my chat was flagged by the ban bot as \"toxic\" and I was banned, even though my \"toxicity\" was an attempt to defend myself. Would you convict someone for fighting back against someone trying to assault them? Typically no...\n\nNow, for the actually disturbing part: that ban occurred between the hours of 12 and 1am my time (so 9-10 rito time) on a weekend, meaning there was not a soul in Riot HQ save for possibly security or sanitation crews. This means that when Riot claims that \"every case is audited by a player behavior representative\" THEY ARE STRAIGHT UP FUCKING LYING. Banning is 100% automated (maybe permabans are actually audited, but I've never actually been permaed so I can't really speak to that). \n\nRegardless, this system is heinously unethical, and Riot relies on people like you to systematically invalidate my voice with cries of \n\n>it shouldn't matter how much money you spent or how many hours you have in the game, break the rules after being warned and you deserve punishment.\n\nand the like to keep actual criticism in check.

The issue is, my most recent suspension cited 3 games in the reform card (which is the currently required number of games for a punishment). The three games occurred over the space of 3 months. 3 bad games in 3 months during which I played on average 5+ games a day. Do you see how ridiculous that is? Of course, you will counter this by saying \"no, this is not how the system works\". Well, on that note, I will cite this: \n\n>I have always been chat restricted-free for 3 years straight.\n\nYou know nothing about this system. You've never sent Riot a support ticket requesting info on a ban. You've never seen a reform card except for perhaps snippets of someone else's posted on these forums.

You people utterly invalidate the voices of anyone speaking out against this bullshit system with this prejudiced behavior,  which is honestly what I believe Riot intended with the way they talk about \"only 5% of active accounts get punished\".

Riot refuses to be transparent with how the flagging system works, other than ensuring that once your account is flagged, it is flagged PERMANENTLY. \"A few days\" of good behavior makes no difference. A few months of good behavior makes little difference. One of my more recent punishments cited 3 games that were each months apart. So 3 bad games in 3 months during a time when I played as many as 5 to 10 games a day, and somehow that shows a pattern? Hell fuckin no it doesn't. The fact is that Riot literally gives 0 fucks about reforming players. You could go from cancer to a complete pleasure to play with and maintain good standing for months and still have your account flagged, and in fact, Riot has stated numerous times that they PREFER to do it this way and that this is INTENTIONAL. \n\n>Bet hey, this is a Free to play game\n\nThat I have spent well over $100 on over my 5-6 years playing it...","replies":[{"poster":"RioeinDoulu","date":"2017-07-04T04:14:48.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did not assume anything, if anything me and you are more alike than you may know so I can safely say I know what happen and how you reacted, its beyond annoying to have a rank game full of folks dicking around and then when you speak up and say something no matter how you say it they either ignore you or all jump your dick and report you, if not the back to back games full of folks that make you want to cleave your skull into the desk--So trust me when i say--I know...But thinking in Omission of your own self this reaction to folk being dumb or annoying or just outright painfully bad occurs massively on this game and then it endlessly weaves around the games.\n\nAs to what you say makes no sense i am making a point that once more--if you could think past your own self for a second, all the things that happen to you happen to other players as well but how each person handles it is vast. in that is safe to say some player get stressed and on edge and the very second they see what they start to know has the flags for failure they just spazz out--such as baiting reaction with \"gg afk\"\n\n...happy to see another person that can agree bluntly with the creeping weakness of character and ego that seems to take over the world, bleeding into the gaming world.\n\nAnd yes the some what confused way the system works is annoying, save for message tempting to spook you into being passive, the time frame that reports stay on your or really the over all nature of your account \"health\" are all to some end unknowns. \n\nGame is free to play, you willing to spend money on it means riot did a good job in making a fun game.
