If you have 1000 HP and 50 MR, it takes 1500 magic damage to kill you. If you have 2000 HP and 50 MR, it takes 3000 magic damage to kill you. That means that having 100 MR halves the incoming magic damage.\n\nMagic penetration makes it so that you ignore a portion of MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-16T07:45:05.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's... That's not how you should look at it. It does 'seem' to work out like that, but that doesn't mean you should do it like that. o.o Just use the normal equation which is (MR Or Armor)/(MR or Armor + 100). It's typically easier to just do that equation to find the actual percentage of reduction rather than factoring in your healthbar.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkwind","date":"2015-10-16T13:35:55.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't \"seem\" to work out like that, it actually does that.\n\nYou're both right in what you're saying, but one isn't more right than the other. The damage multiplier is given by MR/(MR+100), and each point of MR also increases your effective magical health by 1%. So there's no reason that one way would be better than the other, they just give different information.","replies":[{"poster":"5000000000000000","date":"2015-10-16T21:18:50.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"effective health\" helps you calculate if you're tanking and the formula is more helpful if you're a primary damage dealer.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrCyanide","date":"2015-10-16T13:39:47.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=WEuoGbmp,discussion-id=lY7ziFb7,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-16T07:09:32.284+0000)\n>\n> Ryze&#039;s Q deals **100 AP**\n\nThere's no such thing as dealing 100 AP. You have an AP Scaling and you have a Base Damage, and it deals Magic Damage, Physical Damage, or True Damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-16T07:50:43.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resistances work as Resistance divided by Resistances plus 100. This means if you have 50 Resist, you have 50/150, which is 1/3, about 33.33% reduction. With his 30 Pen, his target has 20 resist, so it's 20/120 instead, which is 1/6, which equates to about 16.67% reduction. IF his Q would do 150 damage, it would instead do 17%ish less, totaling 124 damage. \n\nThe more MR and Armor some one has, the less flats work, but the LESS MR and Armor they have, the MORE effective your Flats are and less effective your percents are. Which is why Ghostblade is such a good item for assassins who attack low armor targets.","replies":[]}]}
