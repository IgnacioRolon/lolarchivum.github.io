Therefore, feared.\n\nHm, whenever the Urgot remake comes around...maybe make more use of the bloodied blade?\nGive him something of a short dash on one of his skills. Kinda like Udyr bear stance.\nShort dash if close enough to target, jabs blade into their side, over time damage, minor slow that lasts a while/debuff refreshed by continuing to attack the target.\nWould make him more scary and actually give him a reason to want to be close to the enemy.\n\nCould you guys ever have a fully hybrid melee/range champ? Like Jayce but other than switching with his R, they just autoswitch based on distance from the enemy. Over 4 Teemos away from enemy, use a weaker ranged attack, get closer and they convert to stronger melee attacks.\nOr would that be hell to balance and cause problems with things like {{item:3748}} {{item:3085}}?\nOr just not something you would be interested in doing?\n\nAlso, I think the scarier part would be the guy who was paralyzed then suddenly they are teleported into 4 enemies...unless you're Amumu, then you're just like YAY FRIENDS *presses R\n..but I understand why the original target does not get feared.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2016-02-13T08:02:06.955+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's hard to take this seriously when you realize his model is abysmal.","replies":[{"poster":"Fikule","date":"2016-02-14T16:27:39.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His feet are even child-proofed ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sp441","date":"2016-02-14T01:48:04.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I FEEL KINSHIP WITH YOU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EliseOP","date":"2016-02-13T23:47:51.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=WmViBjNa,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-13T07:42:32.860+0000)\n>\n> Your ally freezes in place, strange energy twisting around him.

Its about having a bit of fun while your at it and THOSE champs usually do not deliver.A chimp could play them at top level and for that reason people shy away from them.
