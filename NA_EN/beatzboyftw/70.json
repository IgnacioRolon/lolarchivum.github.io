I don't understand the developers' thoughts.  One would think that buffing turrets would reduce snowballing, because sufficiently buffed turrets would provide relatively more safety for the behind player to at least have the opportunity to collect some CS while under their turret's protection.  Stronger turrets would also buy some time for allies to intervene if a teammate is being shoved under their turret, and it would make it less likely for the player to lose their own turret when roaming to help the shoved-in ally.  With turrets being as weak as they are, players can't intervene early enough or fast enough to help allies to prevent snowballing in the first place, and once 1-2 turrets are destroyed because of a couple bad trades, the snowballing is cemented pretty hard forcing laning to sometimes end within the first 5-6 minutes of the game and leaving the behind team without many options to recover.","replies":[{"poster":"Nausicäa ","date":"2018-06-18T18:37:19.594+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are fucking idiots, thats why you dont understand their thoughts.
