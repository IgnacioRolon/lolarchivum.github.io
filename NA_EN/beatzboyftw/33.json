In the case of top lane where Rivens & Yasuos are spammed, they usually just dive into you without having to worry about the ranged keg being placed near.

Gp is perfectly solid top. In fact, I'd classify him up there with fiora as one of the more stupidly overtuned champs. Arguing otherwise is either intentionally lying or being very naive. \n2. Hugging tower as gp is the normal thing to do. As long as you are not missing a ton of cs or something, there is nothing wrong and everything perfectly normal with this as a gp in the early game.\n3. Many toplaners will taunt you in various ways: mastery spam, fake recalling, spamming laugh or taunt, typing in chat, etc. to try to bait you into doing something - that something usually being taking a bad fight when the enemy has their jungler around.\n4. People 2v1 all the time - it's the job of every toplaner to ward and have an escape or outplay prepared or accept their death. If you are going to camp someone for 15 min though when you already have a counter-pick and take a combat summoner (exhaust/ignite) vs the enemy's tp, then you are just being a donkey. Have some honor and win or lose 1v1 without needing 15 min of the jungler zoning your opponent off of cs and xp just to be able to 1v1 them.\n\nWhy is gp so annoying and strong though?\na. 0 pressure to win lane or fight because he WILL almost always outscale\nb. easy waveclear from long range via barrels and q mean he doesn't have to interact with the enemy toplaner if they are melee; if ahead, he can CHUNK you out with ease from complete safety, if behind, he can't easily be tower dove because he will just clear the giant wave before it hits tower.\nc. spammable heal and cleanse means by the time he gets triforce, he can spam heal any damage chunk you get on him in a trade if you can't all-in delete him; something made hard to do since he can force you to blow your 1 gapcloser just to deal damage to him, cleanse out of it (plus heal himself), and pop a barrel for some nice return damage which also SLOWS you to prevent you chasing him down again. Then hide under tower, set up barrels, and spam heal to negate all the damage you did while the damage he returned sticks. Thus, he needs to majorly screw up to die 1v1 - you basically need a teammate with cc to help you kill him 1v1. This is only made more impossible since many gp's take (or used to take) exhaust instead of tp.\nd. he gets more gold than you do just for farming, gets more gold for q'ing you in the face from range whenever he wants, and gets free kills or assists just by pressing r on someone halfways across the map almost guaranteed.\ne. they all tend to act like they are some amazing player with tons of skill and outplay when it takes far less skill to play gp into most melee's than it does for the melee player PLUS the melee has pressure on them to WIN the lane which gp does not have. Spammable cleanse plus heal while also having ranged aoe waveclear and harass plus movespeed and slows combo's to kite out almost any enemy cc and engage means you don't need skill.\n\nThere are certain toplaners who just get too much safety, champs who can avoid being bullied early while outscaling disgustingly who I have no respect for in most cases. Sure it takes a bit of skill to learn one thing on the champ (like gp double/triple barrels) but after that there is basically no skill/outplay required by the player as compared to their opponent - even on a simpler champ like renekton or darius. Fiora, gp, on-hit kennen and teemo, etc. simply farm up safely, outscale most opponents via items and/or champ kits, and actually require less effort and skill to win if no jungler influence is involved than many of their opponents. I take extra pleasure when champs like these get 1v1 destroyed in lane. Or 1v2 outplayed despite getting jungle help.","replies":[{"poster":"GayFluffyUnicorn","date":"2017-06-13T21:22:49.076+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someones mad after getting his ass handed over by a GP? \n \nThe only one intentionally lying and exagerating is you unfortunately. \nSpammable heal?
