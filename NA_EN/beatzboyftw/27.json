If she misses, she will most likely lose any trades that follow. \n\nPre 6 talon needs to land W, but by landing it he will most likely be able to burst his target. \n\nOnce he is fed, he can burst even harder, without even landing his w. \n\nAhri cannot kill if she misses charm no matter how ahead she is. \n\nZed and talon can kill someone without landing w for talon or q as zed when they are ahead. \n\nAgainst zed and talon, you are forced to build zhonyas because of how much damage they do without being too fed. \n\nZed's power is mostly on his autos because of duskblade and ultimate combo doing a ton. \n\nWhat do you mean by talon not being as flexible as ahri? In terms of what? Talon can roam better than she and has more mobility than she and also has a quite strong laning phase and constant kill pressure because of their extreme damage output not relying on a difficult to land skill shot.","replies":[{"poster":"SSW Talon","date":"2018-12-02T22:47:39.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a revolving door, I said that Ahri isn't fun to play vs for everyone and I'm not wrong. Not everyone likes playing vs Ahri just like not everyone likes playing vs Talon, Zed or anyone else for that matter. Personally, I don't mind her much.\n\nZed has one targetted ability which is his ult. \n\nYes of course Zeds autos hurt but you're missing the part where if you let Zed get into melee range of you without so much as ccing him a single time or trying to use an escape, you made a huge mistake. As Ahri you can either charm when he swaps to W and R away or you can charm as he materialises from R and you can R away or sometimes you can even turn on him.\n\nYea, however Talons return W isn't that hard to avoid so he is rewarded for landing it, seems fair enough. \n\nCorrect, once Talon is fed he can just flower combo people extremely reliably (W1 Q R mid Q leap and the sped up auto that happens after Q = bleed proc and usually a kill)\n\nI've seen Ahri kill with just her targetted skills + Q and that's the sort of fed we're talking about for Zed to just kill with R and autos, but Talon is a different story as his quickest combo should execute squishies reliably as long as you don't cc him out of his Q damage. \n\nAnd against Ahri you are forced to build mercs, QSS or Hexdrinker as everyone is human and will make the mistake of getting hit by charm, also she just really hurts, as she should.\n\nZeds power budget is in Q and R. \n\nTalon is more binary, he roams well and kills really hard but he has no cc outside of W return slow and he relies on skirmishing and splitting/picking later on. I respect Ahri relies pretty heavily on picking later on but her poke is better than his and whilst she cannot flank the backline as easily, she is still fully capable of it. However, her capability to get lane priority in terms of shoving/wave manipulation is as good as if not better than his. Coincidentally she is really good vs Talon atm in my experience.\n\nHe also has more bad matchups. I'd much rather be an Ahri main than Talon main rn but she isn't my strongest suit currently haha\nHe only has more mobility near walls so it doesn't apply to lane, anyone with a hard cc can cc Talon out of his Q damage + the bleed stack (yes, Ahri charm can do this as well). Talon W snapback is pretty hard to land but not as hard as charm I concede that point.\n\nThanks for continuing to engage in this discussion by the way, sorry for calling you bias.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2018-11-28T15:23:16.463+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its a whole lot of nothing.

And Jax & Lee can only do the same dmg the other assassins do if they build full dmg themselves. At that point they just explode and dont have reliable escapes like Katarina, LB, Zed etc would've.","replies":[{"poster":"Exin0","date":"2018-12-01T06:43:54.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ankoanko19,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZjqATvyb,comment-id=000a00000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-11-30T16:16:05.021+0000)\n>\n> Well Rengar is an assassin, he&#x27;s one of the 4.

Definitely don't see why Akali got nerfs but I get Irelia and LB.
