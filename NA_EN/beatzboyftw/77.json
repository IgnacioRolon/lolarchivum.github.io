During his 3 second channel he applies stacks of \"Verse of Requiem\" to a target, about 1 per second. At the end of the channel you take damage based on how many verses (stacks) you have. Activating a spell shield, or having a banshees means you will still potentially have 2 stacks giving Karthus some damage for his ult. This would work because theoreticly the application of one of the stacks would pop the shield.\n\nDown side is it will reduce the overall counter play to his ult as the only way to dodge the damage without stasis would be to be Sivir, with a banshees vail, EoN, and a Morgana Black shield on hand... or be swallowed by Tahm, or hit with Bards Tempered Fate (which is still stasis).\n\nUpside is Karth can still do some damage against spell shielded enemies, and it would add a little bit of the idea of \"singing\" to the \"Deathsinger\" champ.\n\nAny thoughts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpiritGear","date":"2016-10-21T11:20:34.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maximum Morde,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AEaAwY8y,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-20T11:19:01.906+0000)\n>\n> Why not just have Karthus ult proc in waves, like a tether.
