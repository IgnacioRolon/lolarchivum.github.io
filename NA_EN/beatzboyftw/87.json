All clear &amp; visual, right?\n\nBut as the game prolonged til around 20 minutes, I began to noticed that my W is just too unnoticeable. Here are the screenshots (_Imgur took too long to upload, so I had to use PostImage_):\n\nNormal:\nhttps://postimg.cc/image/y1iyvdcbh/\n\nWith W on:\nhttps://postimg.cc/image/vk77o6kq5/\n\nI tried to use Replay to review the invisible W, but it turned back to normal for some reason. All I can say is that the bug only happens during the Live game itself. I&#039;m really surprised that this one bug was not even bothered a single bit to be fixed at all, especially when it's one of the most crucial one.\n\n**How to get the bug:**\n\n1) Pick Mordekaiser.\n2) Play out the game til 20-30 minute mark.\n3) Use W.\n4) Invisible W was seen instead of a normal W.","replies":[{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2018-06-03T10:50:30.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should really look at how much bugs mord has, this is one of the 200s+ already listed in details \"mechanics\" where if you are a mord main, you will abuse it to your advantage since rito doesn't want to touch his unbalanceble fiesta of bugs since it may create even more bugs by removing 1, hence this is the true power of bugekaiser.","replies":[{"poster":"L Rayquaza","date":"2018-06-03T13:51:57.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like we need a separate bug report board for Morde","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-06-03T19:22:10.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would require the slightest effort on riots part.
