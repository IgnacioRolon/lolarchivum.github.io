When he did it it really helped with a ton of my runes.  He does a really good job of breaking down his decisions with math, something you won't get from probuilds.  It's one thing to set up a rune page like the pros, but another to know why you are doing it so you can learn to make your own decisions later or at least know why a pro might have chose their setups on probuilds (which I do still look at).  \n\nThe tip I liked best about support runes from phreak is that if you are going for a tanky support (braum, thresh, leona) using flat health yellows and Armor quints gives you more health and armor than using flat armor yellows and health quints.  \n\nSome of his stuff has had the meta shift a bit though for other roles, I know a lot of pros are taking scaling health yellows over flat in solo lanes for example but if you watch the video he breaks down benefits on one vs the other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PodunkTheMighty","date":"2015-01-13T10:34:22.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a caster support (Soraka, Zilean) I just use my AP page.

I play a lot of thresh this season and i'd say ad marks in general are pretty solid for laning with harassy/brawler supports etc, {{champion:201}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:143}} , or u could just go armor, magic pen. For seals, its a pretty standard armor/ health. Glyphs can be preferential. I personally love 6 cdr 3 magic resist, because most supports generally have long lvl 1 cooldowns, therefore starting the game with 10% cdr can mean a lot of cc for that gap between lvl 1 trading and lvl 2 zoning. Quints are either all or a mix of flat Ad, Ap, Armor and sometimes movement speed of course dependent upon the champion. The reason i say sometimes movement speed is because with mobility boots you already have a sufficient amount of speed to rotate to those river or jungle skirmishes. Movement speed is player preference. Gold per level isn't worth it anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-01-13T16:48:25.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would go with NurseFlan's and Valktoria's suggestions; I usually use probuilds to double check builds and stuff (take things with a grain of salt since pros build situationally; look at their match-ups and stuff to try to understand why they're doing what they're doing, etc.). I just watched Phreak's videos yesterday and they're great. I'm personally getting two rune pages for support with the coming sales (I play Braum, Janna, and Sona primarily):\n\n* For Braum: Flat Armor Quints, Flat Armor Marks, Flat HP Seals, Flat MR Glyphs\n * Rationale: Braum is a tank, he scales with tank stats. Flat HP Seals and Flat Armor Quints are more efficient than Flat HP Quints and Flat Armor Seals. Flat Armor Marks since he doesn't really use any other marks too well, plus he scales with Armor; same with MR Glyphs.\n* For Janna/Sona: 2 Flat Armor Quints + 1 AP Quint, Magic Pen Marks, Flat HP Seals, 4 Flat MR Glyphs + 5 Flat AP Glyphs\n * Rationale: 2 Flat Armor Quints gives me ~10 armor, similar to what I've been using (flat armor seals). Magic pen since I'm doing magic damage, Flat HP is just useful (flat stats are generally better for duo lanes since scaling runes don't break even until lvl ~6-8/9 depending on the type, and you're not going to get as much experience in duo lanes compared to solo lanes). Basic theme is sacrificing some defense where I can for some AP, especially since Janna and Sona are ranged have some decent sustain tools (which scale with AP) so it isn't as necessary to build as tanky as Braum.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2015-01-13T16:48:19.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have/am about to have the following runes. \n\nQuints--- Gp10, Health, AP, AD, MS\nGlyphs---MR, AP, CDR\nSeals---Armor\nMarks--- AD, Armor pen, Magic Pen, AS\n\nand on most supports i take Gp10, MR, Armor, and either AD or Magic Pen. people also buy armor Marks and armor Quints as well, and that makes good sense especially if their support is AD.
