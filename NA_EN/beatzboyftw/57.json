Removing it, however, has affected quite a few champions negatively, namely mages, and specifically in lane. Shifting that effect onto Doran's Ring would allow mages to last-hit a little better in view of improvements to their autoattack animations (and I personally believe mage auto animations need an overhaul), and so in a manner that would be conveyed much more clearly.","replies":[{"poster":"The Yetii Rider","date":"2018-02-24T23:06:44.391+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":17,"body":"Yes, you have to read the patch notes to play the game.

And if you can't, does that not make you, by your own logic, one of \"the kids\"?\n\nThe obvious answer to this is: of course not, and even if you personally did memorize all of the patch notes in the game to the letter, it would be insane to ask the same of every other player who plays this game. More to the point, it would not be helpful to players who have just joined, and who cannot possibly be expected to brush up on literal months' worth of patches just to look up one tiny detail that isn't shown anywhere in-game (and I'm not exaggerating; the 5 bonus damage was added on November 8th last year). Perhaps returning players could benefit from looking at least at the CliffsNotes version of the patches they've missed, so that they don't get taken by surprise when they pick a champion that got reworked, but otherwise the game should rely as little on book-keeping as possible. There is already enough to memorize in the game for players to not need to remind themselves constantly that minions take bonus damage, just for the sake of not messing up their last hits, which is why it is good for clarity that that feature got removed in that state. Taking an elitist attitude towards players who want to be able to play the game without having to memorize a dictionary's worth of hidden features helps no-one.","replies":[{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-02-25T01:59:36.993+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":7,"body":"You only really need recent knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"sir d wreck","date":"2018-02-25T03:42:24.542+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure if I can agree with this.

Again, just before this week, a lot of mages had their last-hitting in lane depend on a hidden global passive that was added about three months ago. Way before that, there was also a feature added to minions where they enrage if a team reaches a certain level advantage over the other, gaining massively increased pushing power. This feature isn't indicated anywhere either, and can also significantly affect how teams should play. Similarly, bottom tower also has fewer defenses than the other two outer turrets, and this difference isn't indicated anywhere. Simply looking at the game can't really inform you of all of this, which means that the only players with a full idea of what's going on are those who have suck around for long enough to remember those key patch features, which isn't good for anyone who doesn't do that. This is why I think removing that 5 bonus damage is a good step forward, because there are many more hidden mechanics that have a similar or larger impact on the game, yet are equally lacking in visual or audio cues (just an announcer line stating that \"enemy minions have enraged!\" could already help explain things, for example).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DeusVult","date":"2018-02-25T03:19:53.578+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as I would like to see 5 damage given to Dorans Ring, Dorans Ring is already one of the highest gold efficient items in the game.

If the worry is that mages would _only_ start with Doran's Ring, then making it a unique named passive on Dark Seal as well could allow mages to have that bonus integrated into whichever starting item they choose.\n\nOn top of that, I would personally support cleaning up mage auto animations, because I don't think any champion really deserves to have an unresponsive autoattack, but I would not support AD or AS buffs, because that would increase those mages' harass potential against their laning opponent. If that is the specific intent, then sure, though that would carry some much larger balance considerations, but the advantage to the 5 bonus damage against minions was that it specifically did _not_ affect poking, trading or harassing other champions. Even making auto animations cleaner is going to improve the harass potential of mages that receive that QoL buff.
