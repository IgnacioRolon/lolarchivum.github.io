You know who else he counters? Junkrat because he can block and/or facetank some more damage and lock onto him\n\nMei's meant to control choke points and lock down teams, she screws over ANYONE who relies on mobility, except for Tracer. Know who else she counters? Soldier 76 because he cant escape the freeze combo, D'va to shut down mobility, Roadhog because of self freeze, Lucio for anti-mobility\n\nSymmetra's like Mei but she's more on the static defense side. Know who else she counters? Reinhardt because her 2nd fire ignores the shield and the traps screw over poor melee only Reinhardt, and the other squishy, high mobility hero Tracer because she's really squishy and insta-dies to traps or lazors\n\nSo just like everyone else in the game, Genji counters some heroes, and gets countered by others while the heroes who counter him get countered by other heroes and so on","replies":[{"poster":"Troll for Trump","date":"2016-05-27T17:37:36.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"because they are typically countered by 2-3 other heroes\n\nThey aren't.

Every hero excels in some situations and sucks in others. Every hero excels against some other heroes and sucks vs others.\n\nThe game is meant to work around countering the enemy team so if you see Genji, swap over to Mei or Winston, or even Roadhog. Don't complain when he's picked specifically countering one or two of your team's heroes and then snowballs the teamfight in his window of strength or when he's flanking your backline","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2016-05-27T14:18:14.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played against players like you when I'm Genji.
