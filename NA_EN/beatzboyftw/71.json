Despite the fact that  I've already notified him of the role being taken, he still refused to change his pick at all. Until when the champion select timer ran out, he said \"sorry am I support?\". It's pretty easy to tell that he stalled intentionally just so he can play Zed. And yes, he played Zed support, and it was a real shitty experience to see the enemy Thresh having more presence in teamfights than Zed.\r\n\r\nWhat is the beef with every fucking one of you **not wanting to play other roles besides your main** when it's being called out by someone else? Not just that, why are you SO DESPERATE in wanting to play that champion no matter what role you're in, especially those who chose to one-trick?","replies":[{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2017-03-05T13:55:30.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We should remove autofill from Ranked play.\n\nHowever, Blind Pick being a thing is necessary if only for <30 players. The reason is because you don't unlock Smite until level 10, and even if you did, you can't actually jungle without a few runes and masteries. The actually good junglers? Unplayable in the jungle without full runes and masteries. The playable junglers without runes and masteries are the ones with super safe clears such as {{champion:11}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:2}} , and none of them except Olaf are actually strong in competitive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2017-03-05T12:52:39.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Blind Pick is a trash queue and should just be replaced by Team Builder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sinserta","date":"2017-03-05T12:47:00.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always ask to switch, as, I'm more comfortable in jungle/top.
