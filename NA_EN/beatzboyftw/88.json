Occasionally, yes, at some point he will reconnect back into game during the 1:30 minute, but also realized that his wifi is pure crap and just declines every 30 seconds, which also responds to why he never connected during loading time. So here&#039;s a very simple fix:\n\nDuring loading screen, where everyone has to reach 100% to connect to game, but if there&#039;s one person who stays \"Not Connected\" til the point the game has to start, restart the queue again. That&#039;s it, that&#039;s all I ask. But of course, the guy who never connected will not receive punishment from Leaverbuster. Unless if he did get into loading screen with at least 1% in his waiting time & then never connects into game til the queue rrestarts, only then he will receive punishment from Leaverbuster.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2015-04-14T01:03:31.348+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Actually, I wouldn't mind this so much.

I had days where i literally play 3~5 games in a row and nothing happens then play the next game? random crash out of nowhere... for no reason or firewall error, once again for no reason.
