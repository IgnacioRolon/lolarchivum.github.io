So in this thread, Imma lay it out for you fast &amp; simple on why you're considered to be toxic.\r\n\r\n#1) Asking others to report someone\r\n\r\nThis is useless.\r\n\r\nHaving 9 people to report this one troller/afk/etc equals to 1 report itself, so asking others to report the guy does not help in anything at all. Making a report on someone is literally flagging the guy, just to make sure Riot to take notice of him. And no, making more than the 1 report will not add more flags on him.\r\n\r\nAsking others to report this one individual is considered to be toxic because, taking in account from the previous statement, it is nothing more than asking others to point more fingers on him. Like, how is that of any help?\r\n\r\n#2) gg ez\r\n\r\nI don't care what you think it is, about being only 4 simple letters &amp; all, this is still, and will always, be considered toxic as well. This is basically the short version of \"Good game man, btw, you sucked hard\". \r\n\r\n\"GG\" is acceptable since this is like a text version of two sportsman handshaking.\r\n\"GG WP\" is showing respect to your opponents when both sides tried their very best.\r\n\"GG EZ\" is nothing more than spitting on your opponent's face just for the fun of it.\r\n\r\n#3) whining constantly about a teammates' mistakes/picks/etc.\r\n\r\nI'm talking about one of those chats which goes like:\r\n\r\nblitz wtf\r\nwhy dont yall help\r\nlol wow blitz and mord\r\n\r\nFUC U KAT I SWEAR\r\nfizz shut up man u fed bot and now we losing\r\nkat ur really gettin reported\r\nKAT STOP GOING IN!\r\n\r\nim so donme\r\nfizz ur really bad\r\nnah ur doing bad\r\nJUST FF OMG\r\nU GUYS SUCK\r\nTHIS TEAMS TOTAL TRASH\r\nno\r\nur makin me even more mad renket\r\nOMG!\r\nstfu\r\nman u dont he;lp u fed in 5 mins of the game\r\nlimke ur really bad\r\n\r\nI'd rather you give out useful advice to them instead of bashing them with harsh words like it's helping. Even if that doesn't help, use an early Back ping with your G button for an easy signal. You'll gain nothing from constantly talking down like that at them, plus with your so-called \"im done\" phrase. Like, did you really mean that?\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWhenever I ever come again to yet another permaban threads or the likes in the future(which is most likely), I'll just copy paste this thread's URL to save the trouble. Feel free to take this thread for yourself too if you like, otherwise, update it as much as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Twiggles","date":"2016-03-07T14:14:19.703+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This thread needs to be stickied.
