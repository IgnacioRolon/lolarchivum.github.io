If you paid 2200 gold for one time use item, a banner of command, then you are sacrificing something. \n\n>and by your logic, does {{champion:83}} ult and minions have to be removed now because it does the same damn thing, and it can give him gold for it pushing without him?\n\nHis ult is much easier to kill, its his ulti, he doesnt have option, to buy more usefull ulti into teamfight. Sure I do hate Yoricks ult, and honestly wish all these aids mechanics that reward you for doing nothing (utilizing minions, utilizing turrets, utilizing anything that doesnt require more brain activity than toddler when he is sleeping), but giving his ultimate to any champion(especially tanks and supports) that already build cheap items, and also making it much stronger than his own ult, simply isnt fair. Banner of command is stupid item that should be simply removed. You arent adding any gameplay when you buy this item, you are only making pushing againist it annoying, you are abusing the fact that enemy support did not buy it. Every time I see any strats like ZZ portal sion mid I want to puke. This play style is rewarding you for no game knowledge other than, if i build this cheap item early in the game, my lane opponent will loose tower for no effort at all. All of this stupid items should be removed. You should be rewarded for playing the game, not buffing AI (shit one too) controlled NPCs. This isnt MMO, you arent summoner.\n\n> what does {{champion:74}} sacrifice with his Illuminati turret array?\n\nMana, cooldowns, they are stationary, they are easy to kill. And ye I still want this shit nerfed. But its much weaker compared to banner. + He has to be close to them for them to function. If you had banner, that passivelly buffed minions around you, I would consider that a \"mechanic\" even though this sounds dumb as fuck too. \n\n> I don&#x27;t like banner any more than the next person, but saying {{item:3060}} has no strategy, a large portion of the game becomes &quot;not a strategy&quot;. It is however easily abused, which i agree full heatedly with you on\n\nStrategy requires brain activity. Its not strategy. Rotating top after pushing bot is strategy because someone had to find out that its optimal path. This wasnt even happening before LCS 3 years ago I guess? Now its norm because you wouldnt believe, in order to get better at the game, you can watch the game online. Someone had to come up with idea of making enemy top miserable after rushing your own turret. Season 4, noone rushed tower because everyone wanted to safe farm. Then koreans came up with strat that had 70% success rate. Bam internet came and now its norm. Noone came up with idea that banner of command was a good item. In fact this item is was so dog shit, noone built it few seasons back. Then rito had to come and fuck things up. You read what it does, you buff minion, end of thought process. Yeah buffing enemy minion before baron, requires whole list of thing to consider. Where is enemy laner, when will the minion come to the enemy tower, who is their pushing champion, when are we going to do baron. But if you play tryndamere you do same thing, however you go to that tower yourself, not your buffed up minion for 2200 gold, and you have to push it yourself, watch your team so you can tp if they fuck it up, watch the map so you know when you are going to get fucked. Banner of command does neither of these things.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-06-12T20:29:36.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2200 gold for that?  you're crazy.
