Every person has something called \"Leaver Points\" which add up over time. After you accumulate a certain amount you will be punished. The time between AFK'd matches means nothing, the total amount of times you have went AFK does. This was a stat which you used to be able to monitor on http://op.gg/ which unfortunately was removed around the same time they removed duo queue information. If you AFK 1 in every 100 games after roughly 1000 games you WILL be punished by the system whether you deserved it or not.\n\nI agree with the topic post however I feel his attitude is about as toxic as the rest of the community on this matter. Life happens, yea I understand you lost because someone left but you can't control that anymore than they can most of the time. It's a game, not a job. How about instead of blaming the player you ask Riot why they don't have a better system in place to help teams who have AFK(s)?\n\nBelieve it or not, other games HAVE SOLUTIONS to AFK problems and they work very well. If you player Heroes of the Storm most of the time you barely even notice when someone went AFK because an automated bot takes over and keeps playing right where they left off standing. The problem with League and AFK's is the publisher. Stop venting on the players. Yes I understand everyone is a terrible toxic troll, they leave, they do dumb shit.. that's life and you deal with it. Stop blaming things you can't change and look where the true problem lies.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
