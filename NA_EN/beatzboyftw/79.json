At this stage his damage and surviability is such that he can usually pull off stuff like that and live.\n> \n> Late game, if Lee Sin tries to do a crazy dive into the enemy team (assuming they aren't super far behind) he tends to die before he can pull off his stunt as he always initiates ahead of his team (unless you have a Malphite or something) so he has to build tanky in order to live long enough to survive a lategame Enemy ADC or Mage bursting him into dirt while the support has him CC'd (full AD Lee Sin is amazingly squishy and will die in a 1.5 second stun or root before he even has a chance to flash away).\n> \n> If he builds tanky to survive his dive, he no longer does the LEE SINGA type damage that made him so scary early/mid game and is better off peeling for his carry then trying to assassinate someone (since he no longer has the damage to do so anyway).\n\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n> In a full teamfight, it's really tough to sneak a Q onto a squishy through a frontline, so you generally have to resort to going for an Insec or peeling.\n> \n> Even if you do hit a Q onto a carry, you won't have the damage to kill him before getting peeled off or simply killed, unless you went full damage lee. And if you went full damage lee, you HAVE to find a way to sneak around and instakill a squishy, or you're pretty much useless.\n> \n> Another factor is that most (not all) champions with a relatively low cool-down shield perform better in skirmishes than in full teamfights. In a small skirmish, you tend to take less burst damage overall, so you can generally go through a few uses of your shield in a single fight. In a teamfight, it's very easy to get bursted down very quickly, so you don't really get to keep cycling your shield up for free health. In a 1v1 or 2v2, a champion like Riven can actually be fairly tanky, due to her low cooldown shield. In a 5v5, though? If she gets caught, she's going to evaporate. \n> \n> Lee CAN circumstantially have good teamfighting, if he manages to hit a great ult onto 3-5 people, but it's tough to do and you need some luck.

I don't think any champion in the midlane  is a huge fuck you currently. Sure, {{champion:157}} is probably the most annoying, but it's not like he is completely unbeatable.\n\nToplane {{champion:122}}, {{champion:111}}, and {{champion:14}} are definitely not the middle fingers of top lane. Maybe {{champion:122}} since he's hard to recover from if you fall behind against him. \n\nAs for jungle, I would also include {{champion:104}} because of his ranged AoE clear + tankiness + being able to knockback the monsters.

I'd argue that these champs are in no way huge \"fuck yous\" . {{champion:21}} lacks any real mobility (the don't get touched by an enemy movespeed isn't really enough) and she makes herself stationary with her ult which is either a \"get the fuck out of there\" or \"get the fuck on top her\" type of deal. Both of which are pretty easy. Additionally her only form of decent poke in lane is her q which pretty much means don't stand behind a dying ally minion and just requires a small bit of attention to the minions to avoid getting chunked.\n{{champion:236}} I must say I haven't played much against him and while he's definitely strong early he isn't oppressive enough to be listed as a \"fuck you\".\n\nYou listed all hook supports. There are huge downtimes in lane between there hooks so if they miss you can punish pretty hard. - that is if you're not already poking them down from the safety of your minion wave.\n\nNow I do understand that this is your personal list but from an analytical standpoint none of these champs seem like huge \"fuck yous\" to other champs of the same lane with the exception of maybe (just maybe)  {{champion:157}}, {{champion:122}}, and {{champion:35}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2017-03-19T16:57:24.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your argument is really bad.

(I think he was lowest winrate for at most a month and at least two weeks, but he was still very low on the winrate chart well beforehand.) He was averaging 44% winrate. Riot then buffed his safeguard.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TwinkiePro","date":"2017-03-19T21:24:15.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are mains mains of anybody? Because they enjoy the champ, strength of the champ doesn't factor in. \n\nIf your question is why is Lee played a lot when he is claimed to be weak, that can be answered in a couple ways. \n\nHe's not necessarily weak. That's evident by his powerful early game, however, he falls off far harder than any champ I can think of, and his best chance of winning late game is giving kills to the carries, which can be difficult considering his strength in the early game and likeliness of taking kills. The last nerf on his ultimate only made his late game worse and barely affecting him early Game, making him far more reliant  during that time. \n\nLee also has a very satisfying playstyle, much like riven, yasuo and draven. Playing correctly and executing their skills precisely give the player a higher sense of accomplishment. Their skills also meld together very well, allowing complex mechanics to shine.","replies":[]}]}
