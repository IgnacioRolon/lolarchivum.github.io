It appears on the surface that a champ based around that heavily would be difficult to balance as he can do things like summon a minion instantly to absorb a skillshot and zone/harass without putting himself in much risk.\n\nMake the mechanics of the minions too simple and you get another instance of old Heimerdinger, whether late game is either paper turrets of pattycake if you fall behind or a risk-free third of your opponent's health with the press of 1 button if you get fed. Make them too complex and Yorick will turn into a StarCraft level micromanager whose difficulty turns away everyone not in the pro scene.\n\nThen you have to take into consideration Riot's technical growth over the years. New technology and potential is why no champ is released any more with passives as simple as \"Gain X% of Y stat as Z\" or why champs aren't just bundles of \"Spend X mana to fire skillshot Y (x4)\". Odds are they'd want to  add some dynamic options for him, such as his strength being tied to the death around him which would increase Yorick's power should he decide to farm rather than hover around his team late game.\n\nWish I had more time, but long story short, he's not going to be a small or quick rework.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CubedJustice","date":"2015-04-10T15:38:25.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because full AD lifesteal yorick jungle is silly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZombieNinja War","date":"2015-04-10T14:06:51.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yorick is fine maybe he just needs a new skin and buff :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-04-10T13:46:33.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze's SECOND gameplay update.

Then they snuck in the Morgana Effects update, kind of like how they snuck in the Alistar update while Trisana was being worked on.\n\nSo, they have to plan these things out and which ever ones are closer to being ready they announce as upcoming projects.  With Kassadin being done awhile back, it was then on to Ryze and Poppy should be the one up after that, but hers is of course Sion type level since it's just fully re-building a champion.
