And then our Rengar jungle requests our top laner to switch to an AP champion. See, our top laner was Jax at first, til he switched to Rumble in the end. \r\n\r\nIn late game, our Rumble did horribly &amp; gave the enemy top laner a head start. After that, our Rengar jungle decides to constantly whine &amp; rant on our Rumble for his inexperience &amp; feeding.  I mean for instance, it was HE who requests our top laner to change his intended pick, and second, if our jungler wants an AP champion so much, he should changed it HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSo to players who has the same attitude as this Rengar here, you deserved a bitch-slap.","replies":[{"poster":"youngjake93","date":"2017-02-16T16:27:28.141+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rumble is actually a good Pantheon counter and Pantheon is a good Jax counter lol.

If rumble is focused by the enemy jungler and gets no help warding, he is easily repeat ganked and killed multiple times before lvl 6 or chunked low and forced to miss out on tons of farm and xp. Rumble doesn't have the option of freezing on panth either because he needs to use flamespitter to farm and that auto-pushes the wave. Panth sits back until it is on cd, then farms. When panth is sitting back, he's slinging spears to chunk rumble since rumble shield is a joke of an ability. When rumble is half hp, panth goes in, stun, e, autos, q to finish kill. 1v1 i'm sure rumble can be ok, but he's not going to crush the matchup either unless he's a way better rumble than the other guy is at panth. 2v2, rumble wins hands down especially after lvl 6. But if it's a 1v1 or 1v2 with enemy jungle camping rumble hard early, rumble is screwed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Supreme Senpai69","date":"2017-02-16T23:44:12.644+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Rengar deserves a report but the rumble deserves the loss.

I mean gank multiple times, apply pressure - don't back off just because you are spotted if the enemy is pushed to your laner's tower he's got a long way to run and you can chunk him low and force him to back. Give wards to your toplaner so he/she can play agro when the opportunities are given. Rumble has his ult? Gank top, land a root with empowered e and get rumble a kill on panth. Then make sure he can safely push the wave in and either get top tower or back and buy if that's what he/she wants to do. Worried about ending up 2v2?
