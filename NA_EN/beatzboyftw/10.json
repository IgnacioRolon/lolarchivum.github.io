Cz I really wish it didn't. Nothing exciting about it.\r\n3) Is the new Rotating Game Mode confirmed to be permanent?\r\n4) How are the game modes picked for every weekend?\r\n5) Is the amount of Champion mastery gained on Game Modes &amp; ARAM distributed as equal as the normal SR, or less? (more explanation below)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nOkay, so I have something in (5) that icks me. Imo, I do not feel that it's right to gain Mastery Points in modes other than Normal/Rank SR.\r\n\r\nBecause if it's in Normal/Rank SR, players would tend to carefully play the game out by using strategies/careful champion picks/absolute teamfight timing/etc, whereas in Game Modes, all players will literally spam their champion picks &amp; moves wherever they like. That's nothing \"mastery\" about it, especially in URF. \r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nYeah, sorry I'm asking these questions in a separate thread instead of the main Red thread such as this:\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/announcing-rotating-game-mode-queue\r\n\r\nI was afraid Riot would overlook my comment in such a packed discussion such as this link here.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2016-03-08T18:52:09.655+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Beatzboy~\n\nWe'll be announcing the full schedule of modes soon :) so just hang tight.\n\nThis is a new permanent queue! So the idea is for it to continue to exist, and for us to bring you featured game modes more often! \n\nWe pick the game modes based on a lot of factors, usually focused around timing (what can we deliver and where does it make sense to deliver it), and popularity/reception. We want to make sure we release fun game modes that you guys will enjoy! :)\n\nIn terms of champ mastery, people will earn what they hopefully feel is a fair amount. You're probably not going to receive the same amount of points for an S+ on SR and an S+ on URF, for instance. We're going to be weighting these pretty consciously to make sure that people are earning at a fair and balanced rate. \n\nIt's not necessarily true that there's \"no mastery\" in featured modes, but there are varying degrees of mastery for sure :) And we want to balance that. Personally, I think with the recent tie-ins to Loot and Mastery, it would be sad (or almost punishing) to not give players mastery for playing in this queue.\n\nHopefully this answers most of your questions :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2016-03-08T19:03:16.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Stephiroth,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=zrgZWmqy,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-03-08T18:52:09.655+0000)\n\n>Personally, I think with the recent tie-ins to Loot and Mastery, it would be sad (or almost punishing) to not give players mastery for playing in this queue.\n\nso , TT mastery on it's way (think all queue should have it when the loot go live or the punishing part stay)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2016-03-08T19:25:19.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Our team isn't working on that currently, and unfortunately I don't have any relevant updates about that :(","replies":[{"poster":"Flemman","date":"2016-03-08T19:59:44.313+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"so basically TT community is the new dominion community :(\n\nIt's kinda sad that something who seems so obvious (aka: bring mastery up for all queue at once) is not even bring up at the begining of the work (because I guess they were internal reunion before the start of \"work on bringing mastery on different mode than SR\")\n\nanyway, ty for the answers, I will go back praying TT didn't die in the next year :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jaghatai","date":"2016-03-08T20:10:01.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This makes me upset.

This statement is the perfect summary of how a lot of players who mainly play ARAM feel now that the featured games queue will have mastery enabled, but not ARAM.

I'll temper my expectations for this I guess, though I'm always going to have a small flame of hope that we get this eventually. I do feel like it's a bit of a slap in the face to the dedicated ARAM players to lock them out of an entire feature system (loot and crafting). I'd even be okay if we didn't get any points added to our overall mastery on champs from ARAM, if we could at least be able to get chests from ARAM based on a post-game grading scale.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"cllesh","date":"2016-03-08T18:54:36.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"u respond to a person who breaks the rules by bumping their own thread... calls out Rioters for a response... is this how i should make my comments so i too can get a red response?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2016-03-08T19:25:46.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about bumping or anything :) I just happened to see it.\n\nI don't recommend bumping your own thread.","replies":[{"poster":"cllesh","date":"2016-03-08T19:51:58.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and i love that u comment pls dont think im attacking u or anything, but i dont get why these squeaky rude wheels get attention when some other more bland same exact statement post does not.... is this a [i work for riot but im a person and have my own opinions] thing.... \n\ndo riot employees also have other accounts without shouting out they are riot employees? it puts a red name text next to it, it puts a riot fist next to the thing... how is it not sponsored by riot just by being commented on? \n\nand great that you dont recommend bumping a thread but it is against the rules right? and u responded with the authority of a red response to a thread that violated rules.... is that not a support of the breaking of the rules? more so if u want a response from a riot red?","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Stephiroth","date":"2016-03-08T21:14:00.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not here to debate the mechanics of the forums and when Rioters should/shouldn't reply.\n\nIdeally, we would reply to all threads :) It would be great if we could respond to everyone. \n\nI just happen to be on the forums today in particular, happened to see this, and wanted to engage.

This also includes Ascension, unfortunately.\n\nIf Dominion wasn't going to be brought up to the standards of Summoner's Rift or Twisted Treeline, why should it be acceptable to let such an inferior, unbalanced, unpopular and ugly (Riot's words) game mode come back twice a year?\n\nBetter to let the map die and have the FGM team come up with something else than to give them the lazy option of bringing it back so they don't have to do the work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2016-03-08T19:36:59.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yay ascension.
