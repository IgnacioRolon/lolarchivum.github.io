Thats absolutely OK. Thats their kit. I don't hate them i just see them as problematic at the current power state. \nThis is due to the bias towards going on the ADC. As an ADC you have very little fun atm. You get bullied by supports in lane and when you are just strong enough to survive that harrase mid lane usually starts roaming and deleting you under turret.\n\nAnd here is the problem. I have no other option but to be there and at this time I can't even get an GA. When i reach level 6 on bot and am about to finish my first item the mid does the same but on lvl 7-8. So assassins in mid get a highe advatage over bot lane. They get on with one item and have a higher level and mobility. \nThere is nothing I can do but keep farming, but I can't keep farming because so many high mobility assassins just wait for me to step into the middle of my lane. If the jungler is an assassin this gets even worse, but thank good they are still rarely seen in jungle and if they are junglers they only get on at level 6 so you usual get a bit of time to farm.\n\n\nSo all this is kinda OK I believe assassins are to strong though. And this is where the problem arises. They are in every other game. I get not to have a say in the game I have to play like I am about to die. This is what ADCs usually do, but now it doesn't even matter if I am ahead. And that spoils the fun.\n\nAnaother problem is that for every other role dying is not that horrific. Every other role gets their rotation out and has to wait for CDs anyway so dying ofter the inital burst is ok, for some it even works exceptionally well with ignite. get your rotation out, ignite, die, still get the kill. This leads to games where both mids (most of the time happens with assassins) are 6/6 and just take over the whole game, cause dying is not an issue for them. They don't need to farm after their powerspike. They can one shot you for the rest of the game. These two mid laners now take it out on the rest of the team and snowball it out. The worst part about this is, I lak waveclear as an ADC so both mids show up to have fun on bot and take away the farm with their waveclear tools (if they have any) if they have no waveclear tool they still take huge chuncks of minions while fighting it out or just waiting for something to happen.\n\n\nIt takes the fun away. They are just to strong, need to little gold while to much gold is in the game and also live in a weird economy of \"It doesn't matter if I give away gold by dying, I can one shot the 10/1 squishy in the enemie team anyway.\n\nSo the problem is not that for an ADC they pose a unfun and hard to beat situation, the problem is they take over the game accelerate it and leave only scorched earth. They are not punished for bad play. Every assassin can come back into a game with just one good fight. Every tried that as an ADC?","replies":[{"poster":"Aseraan","date":"2019-01-01T20:18:01.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I disagree only to disagree as much as you  since we all have been in a meta where adc  did the same not  1 but number of times \nArdent meta\nAnd  the infamous Adc in every lane meta.\n\nEven when ppl called the joke adc 2k17 they werent bad.\nSo pls excuse me if i cant feel bad for adc cuz they are the most biased party of all in this game.\n\nAnyway for being moddest AGAIN adc sure feels bad for number of reasons like  you dont hit ur powerspike for lategame where you would shine cuz  we  never actualy reach it anymore.\n\nBut again claming they can one shoot you for the rest of the game is blatant lying since  i already made a comment about that there is no ONE shooting  in the game where you are fairy even out whit ur enemy or ur not going into lane whit 30 fking hp.\nIts always atleast 2-3 thing that deals damage to you what you PROCEED to call one shot.\n\n\nBut thats enough for being moddest for the last part of your comment i agree but not for your concersn but telling you how  fine  i am whit it.\n\nIM FINE whit assasins being here in this meta to shit on adc\nIM FINE whit mage supps shiting on adc\nIM FINE whit anyone shiting on adc\n\nFor the simple reason that is called ARDENT META I WAS THERE 3000 YEARS AGO(kek lotr ref) when you could jump on  the adc whit  anyone and  still died becasue of the r%%%%%ed amount of shiled stacking and the amount of peelbitching JUST FOR ONE ROLE  WAS DISGUSTING and im fine whit lol as it stands now YE damage is fucking high  assasins everywhere  BUT  finaly  the game isnt about  babycaring one fucking role.\n\nAlso fun fact if tanks were viable adc would be a lot better too but thats not my concern.","replies":[{"poster":"DerPunkt","date":"2019-01-01T23:41:21.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The different was, ardent meta was not an ADC choice it was the whole freaking teams playing around it. I dont get why people complain about ardent that much... uh it was so horror... well somebody had to buy ardent and use it on the ADC... I wonder who that was? Yeah it was annoying as hell, but not the ADCs choice. While oneshoting is a something a single champion does alone. \n\nAnd just for future reference. Generally in league, when people speak about oneshoting they don't mean one AA or Spell they mean a time frame. It basically means no time to react not even to press heal. \n\nI could start now with an argument about teams revolvong around the ADC is quite healthy since it delivers a healthy goal. The team that gets the enemie adc protects its own wins etc and how that acutally is some kind of objective centered game play while assassins choosing targets randomly and oportunisticly is no teameffort nor a healthy objective etc. but lets not go there.\n\nAnd just so my words get not used against me. I am not advocating for ADC dominance. When ADCs take over the game gets bland. One player decides the faith of 4. Thats dumb. I am for a healthy balance and wish for a stone paper scissor concept with checks and balances and multiple objectives in fights and not dominant roles that dictate a meta. I hate it ever since different team of the kind of gameplay got pushed away for different powerspike comps. We had poke teams/tank team/ all in teams/fight teams/catch teams/ objective teams. And now we got early and late teams. Thats kinda sad.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Aseraan","date":"2019-01-01T02:04:16.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know that feel yasuo is banned in my games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Seleena","date":"2018-12-30T23:49:28.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron Barian,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=MwRsxHf0,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-12-30T20:13:29.624+0000)\n>\n> If you don&#x27;t have cc, stick near someone with CC.\n> \n> I say this, but I know for a fact that the next adc reading this will complain that they couldn&#x27;t 1v1 a 6/2/2 assassin with a 0/2/1 KDA while avoiding his own support all game.\n\nbut no one says that, most people complain that an assassin who's 0/2/1 only having a duskblade can kill an adc that is 6/2/2 easily..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elixors","date":"2018-12-31T06:53:38.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baron Barian,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=MwRsxHf0,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-12-30T20:13:29.624+0000)\n>\n> If you don&#x27;t have cc, stick near someone with CC.\n> \n> I say this, but I know for a fact that the next adc reading this will complain that they couldn&#x27;t 1v1 a 6/2/2 assassin with a 0/2/1 KDA while avoiding his own support all game.\n\nso people are being forced to play champs with cc now because a champion can be so absurdly busted that the only counter is to CC lock?
