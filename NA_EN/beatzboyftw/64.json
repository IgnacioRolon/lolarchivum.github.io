No one likes looking at themselves in a mirror that shows them what they really look like.\n\nThe whole point of his new ranking system is to better separate skill levels that may overlap. I can tell you without a doubt that most silver 5/4/3 players don't belong in silver (or gold).","replies":[{"poster":"Slash Wind","date":"2018-10-05T11:20:18.564+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How can you not belong in silver? there is not a whole lot of room to go further down, that's like saying oww sheesh this guy is really bad for bronze 5 duh.","replies":[{"poster":"Quiet Dude","date":"2018-10-05T13:15:14.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most people who do ranked for the first time end up in Silver.

So we're putting a new tier in above Master.\"\nThat makes absolutely no sense, imo. How does putting a tier above Master help distinguish the people who _can't reach Master in the first place_, from the people who made it _out of platinum but aren't as good as the people in high Diamond_? Would make a lot more sense, again, from how I see it, to make Diamond harder to reach in the first place so the players in it have proven their skill and those not good enough for Diamond end up in hardstuck **Titanium III** players. \nThat and, Bronze has to be below Iron if they want to use that name. Old Bronze changed to Iron tier, new Bronze tier added below Iron. \n\nor ... call it Wood or Tin and put it below Bronze.","replies":[]}]}
