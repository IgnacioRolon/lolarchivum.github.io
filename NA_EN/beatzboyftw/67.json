Either I have to bait out his E and hope he uses it carelessly, or I have to get another teammate to help force it out of him. Great.\n\nAny suggestion where it involves requiring 2 people to take down 1 person should be a clear sign that the champion is broken.\n\nI don't get how you can say \"don't pick an assassin into fizz\" when Fizz is also an assassin. So he is king of assassins? Also if I'm in another lane, I can't exactly counter for Fizz and also counter for my lane.

That is some way down. \n\nPoint 1. Fizz's E avoids ALL burst and 0.75s of sustained damage. If you are dealing sustained damage, Fizz doesn't dodge much of it at all. \n\nPoint 2. In a teamfight situation, yes, I expect you will need teamwork. In a duelling situation, some champions are better than others. You need to know what fights you can pick. You wouldn't jump on an Annie with a charged stun or a Yasuo with two stacks, so why jump on Fizz when he has E?\n\nPoint 3. Some champions do well against other champions. If every champion did equally well against every other then we would have a boring game. The reason Fizz is good against assassins and burst mages is that they deal all of their damage at once. As such, his E dodges all damage. Against a sustained damage source, the E only dodges a small percentage of the damage.\n\nPoint 4. Good against assassins does not mean king of assassins. Fizz does worse against bruisers than Zed does. \n\nPoint 5. No, you can't counter for both every time. You can't counter against A Zed and a Lissandra at the same time either. Or a Caitlynn and a Jarvan. You pick someone who works well in your overall team comp or against their overall team comp. You also don't need to counter. Just pick someone who does fairly well.

Akali can heal enough to survive his ult, and Diana can reduce enough damage to survive as well, both of them leap to him and delete him even if he E's out of it with their short cooldowns.
