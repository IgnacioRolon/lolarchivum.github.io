Sona, Ali, and Nami all have heals that are just as effective as Soraka's. However, Soraka's heal can only be used on other champions and she lacks both an increase in damage and viable CC, which the previously mentioned champions all bring in addition to healing. Soraka has a giant target on her because she has no real self-sustain, and this results on her being poked out before she can prevent any meaningful damage on her partner. Just like the Sion rework, the Soraka rework is a flop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2014-10-17T18:10:21.094+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is adorable, but no.\n\nUpvoted anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cya In Tribunal","date":"2014-10-19T19:58:57.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish they would add a use to her W...
