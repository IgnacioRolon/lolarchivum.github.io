If anyone knows who else is gonna have the new splash art, or a link of it, please post it here. I would love to see more new splash arts. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Grand Medic","date":"2014-10-20T13:31:52.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far these are the champions that are following the new style.\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:68}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:26}} \n\nAll other champions follow the old style still.  Except for {{champion:268}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:161}} which is in a weird inbetween point.  With following the old style, but could possibly work for the new style.  But I'm guessing that Braum and Vel'koz will get change, but Azir and Gnar might be safe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scynthia","date":"2014-10-20T09:19:27.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can find most of the new splash art changes on surrenderat20.net which is a site for all impending updates and patches that may be added to the live server. I recommend checking this site frequently for more information on balance changes to champion, the new Summoners Rift, as well as splash arts :). The new splashes to Janna, Rumble, etc can be found a few articles down from the first one. As well, check even older articles for even more splash art changes that you may not have noticed :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2014-10-20T09:16:38.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here:\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html","replies":[]}]}
