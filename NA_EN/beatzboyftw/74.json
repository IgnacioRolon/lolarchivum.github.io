I'm guessing he may switch it to the likes of Viktor, as Orianna already has a TPA skin back in Season 2.\r\n\r\n2) As mentioned about Orianna in the first point, is it actually okay to have a champion like Ezreal to have 2 different types of team skins? Still not quite sure myself if it would be okay or not, I can be wrong anyway.\r\n\r\n3) Zac is a good choice for a skin, but do know we're talking about a champion whom Riot claims to have difficulty in making one for him since he's just a fully green blob. I'm guessing they're probably just give him an SKT clothing with no new animations.\r\n\r\nSo I'm wondering what's your opinion on the skins being selected by SKT themselves? Is it good picks, or do you think they could've selected better ones?","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-10-31T18:24:38.038+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just give Faker his Ahri skin already.\n---\n\n\n**Alternate Earth 2018.

Using the latest technology, SKT Ahri is released at a tier higher than Legendary as \"Divinity Tier\" and is the greatest League of Legends skin moneymaker in history.
