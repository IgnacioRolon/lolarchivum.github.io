There's nothing to \"relearn\", her strengths that made her borderline-too-strong still are what make her borderline-too-strong, Cinderhulk just bumps up her flaws as well as complementing her strengths. Her \"obvious weaknesses\" aren't nearly as weak as her defenders would have everyone believe, as is the case with *every* jungler who is about to get nerfed, largely because the jungle functions vastly differently (particularly this season) than any of the lanes do.
