Well, Team Builder Draft is, which - if that's received well - will move into Ranked soon after.\n\n> Main problem, as I see it, is that Lyte should probably not talk about any feature that is not comming out in near future (1 year max).\n\nEh. I don't necessarily agree, but I can see your point, there. I certainly think that if he *is* talking about a feature that's really far out, he take care to be extremely clear about that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-10-26T08:08:46.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lyte has been so focused on the community's toxicity and working on many projects over the last couple of years, like bringing out Team Builder for instance.
