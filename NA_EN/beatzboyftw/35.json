For example, to make Garen better we could make his W also include knockback resistance/knockup resistance. Lets him stick to targets more while also being thematically appropriate that he's a massive chunk of soldier that can't easily be moved. \n\nIn terms of junglers, there are tons of ways you can buff junglers to deal with S-tier junglers currently. For example:\n\nA.) Buffing their clear speed. Increased damage of certain spells vs. monsters, slightly lower mana costs on certain abilities, AS boosts to champions who don't necessarily itemize for attack speed (Naut as an example)\nB,) Defensive increases against jungle mobs/monsters. Maybe \"If shield is broken by a large/epic monster, cooldown is reduced\" ala Volibear bite.\nC.) Mobility improvements are tricky but you could add better terrain scaling such as \"If out of combat, <ability> allows you to go over walls\".\n\nIn general, those are just real quick ideas that aren't 100% \"I would do THIS to fix this champ\" but rather rough ideas that could be expanded upon. One of the criticisms i have for Riot's balance is that most balance changes end up being buffs or nerfs to just raw numbers or how much you can use a spell rather than improving/weakening aspects of the spell that _aren't_ just raw damage/CD\n\nI'm also not going to pretend I got the galactic ascended brain to handle that. Riot's got a team for that who know the game better than I do. The thing is I think they can look into buffing characters without necessarily making them do more damage.","replies":[{"poster":"SociaI Justice","date":"2018-10-17T04:10:50.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"those are actually fair suggestions, i guess you thought this through better than i though. \n\nhowever speeding up the clear speed of all junglers makes the gold in the game go up and would result in more ganks which riot apparently wants to avoid, the issue with \"just buff other champions 4head\" is that its much harder to do right than just nerfing the broken ones, and riot already seems to be struggling with that.","replies":[{"poster":"CaptainMårvelous","date":"2018-10-17T04:13:31.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SociaI Justice,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=zNIXAdXX,comment-id=000f00020000000000000000,timestamp=2018-10-17T04:10:50.086+0000)\n>\n> those are actually fair suggestions, i guess you thought this through better than i though. \n\nHey thanks!\n\n> however speeding up the clear speed of all junglers makes the gold in the game go up and would result in more ganks which riot apparently wants to avoid, the issue with &quot;just buff other champions 4head&quot; is that its much harder to do right than just nerfing the broken ones, and riot already seems to be struggling with that.\n\nDepends. You can tweak clear speed but make it so mobs respawn faster. Granted, that is systemic changes so a different category. However, I think the main point is that you can edit champions/kits without just having to make the number go up. I guess we can add \"You can also change the game around how champs currently are\". If jungle gold goes down, it'll bring back supportive junglers and make stuff like Graves/Kha worse because they can't powerfarm into ganking.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ﬂoo","date":"2018-10-17T14:14:49.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most unfun things about these champs is that you literally pop when you try to fight them if you are no tank.

These changes are all targeted at making clearing the jungler harder. \nGiven he scales like a god, rules the early game like a god, has AOE/single target burst like a god, tanks like a god and then gets to clear like a god. He needs a downfall. He can't be not just good, but god tier at pretty much everything.\nPersonally I favor removal of monster knock back because other ranged jungler don't need it, so why the fk does graves when he is tankier and more mobile than most of them?\n\nAkali: Let's be honest. Very few people will ever enjoy dealing with her as long as her shroud exists as it does. Most of her kit is fair, very fair.\nSo I'd make a few changes: damaging akali while in shroud reveals her for longer than current, successive hits keep her exposed for less and less time. Shroud no longer restores energy. \nPotentially remove the mini stun from R\n\nIrelia: Cap Q damage against minions and reduce the animation speed. She's like 4 times faster than yasuo E and as a lategame hyper carry, she should not be able to last hit so effortlessly so quickly. Are we 30 minutes it? Sure. because most champs can do that. Before that nah.\nPotentially also remove the dmg reduction and reduce the animation speed of W?. Over complicated spell tbh\n\nUrgot: needs no changes. Not an urgot main but the issue is no one understands urgot.\nHe is anti dive. What is everyone picking? Irelia, camille, renekton, jax, noc, eve ect ect.

The missing health damage is a broken stat. There is a reason why {{champion:92}}, has it as a one cast R. Changing it to an upgrade, like her other abilities, would serve as a better purpose. But she must build health to get the stat. I know what Kai'Sa was aimed to be, a versatile ADC with a lot to offer, but with her best stats being when upgraded. It will be a heavy hit, but Riot can buff her Missing Health Damage by a bit to make up for it.\nThe other option is to keep either the invisibility or the shield. I would take away the shield, then make it into an Attack Speed or life steal bonus instead.\n\nThe nerf on {{champion:104}} somehow worked, he is not on the top spot anymore. Maybe hitting him with another AD growth nerf, would do the trick.\n\nI do not see or play Irelia much, so I cannot give a good balancing tip for it.\n\n{{champion:266}} should not be, touched.

She also get's tanky from {{item:3139}} and {{item:3157}} to cleanse hard CC and avoid burst which counter her while retaining the same if not similar damage as aggressive AD/AP items you'd build on her. {{item:3095}} is good on her because she can proc it with an AA before and after E usage too easily early game which makes her proc crital hits far too easily fir cheesy amount of damage, and such damage shouldn't be allowed for a marksman to have early game if their power is focused in scaling to late game. Her W animation is also slow enough for her to proc {{item:3095}} before and after using her W(her W is super quick so she can't use the same trick).\nAs a Kai'Sa main, I suggest nerfing:\n1) Nerfing/Reverting the AP scaling buff on her W, because that's when APC Kai'Sa trend started, and fasten her W's starting animation.\nThis way her W will have less damage throughout the whole game(late game included) while disabling her the ability to proc {{item:3095}}  before and after W in early game so easily.\n2) Decrease the base magic damage of her plasma passive, because with coup de grace mastery she has really high damage in early and mid game, if it still causes problems in late game then adjust her scaling to be tolleratable in late game by having a good damage on hybrid Kai'Sa and full AP Kai'Sa while not dealing disgusting damage on both.\n3) Adjust {{item:3095}} by making it even harder to proc it early game by increasing the delay time between two AA's, while nerfing it's damage for lategame. Then I would.find it toleratable.\nKai'Sa was meant to specialize to be versile and be successful on the rift with amy build you'd want go with, not force her to be an AP 3 shot assasin(even tho she is classified as adc/assasin).\nBring the versile Marksman side of her, that is all I want from them to do.
