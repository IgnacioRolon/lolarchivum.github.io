If they nerfed his overall damage and didn't let him burst someone in 1 second flat. Fizz would be  a piece of shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snarflaz","date":"2015-01-22T03:35:00.897+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is skilled in dealing TONS of damage, like an assassin. If they add this nerf he won't really be much of an assassin anymore.\n\nIf he doesn't have his ult he can't kill anyone, and the opposing team will just target him for free kills. The nerf is just too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unironic SJW","date":"2015-01-22T03:03:26.193+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"so pretty much fizz has to hit a narrow hard to aim skillshot that's attached to his ultimate to actually kill you (as opposed to just needing Q + R then trollpoling away) and if he doesn't hit said skillshot he might as well b because the damage on the Q and W got gutted so hard\n\ndodge the fish or hide behind your tank and spam laugh when fizz does nothing for the rest of the teamfight. They also destroyed his already shaky laning by forcing him to actually activate his W for the missing health amp along with no more GW and the nerfed Q damage. I don't think Fizz has a single winning matchup in mid anymore.\n\n{{champion:105}}  2015: gutted...like a fish. Not that he didn't deserve it, but that's what it looks like to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spinothalamic","date":"2015-01-22T04:13:32.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a substantial nerf to fizz.

His fish still has all its damage, his E has all of it's damage, and now his R has an amp. He won't one shot with just a Q and W, but he'll be perfectly fine. We've seen much, much worse nerfs before. Like Eve's nerfs after S2 World's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Dusteon","date":"2015-01-22T03:01:39.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're saying \"Well, he lost a large chunk of his burst unless he ulted first.

Lol.\n\nAt least he needs skill to land the fish to successfully assassinate. And after that, he won't be able to do as much damage to everyone else beside the target he ulted. So yeah, the nerfs are pretty good and make him kinda healthy and outplayable, and not just one shotting people with Q whenever it's off cooldown even after missing his ult at the start of the fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diostukos","date":"2015-01-22T03:01:30.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I won't mind the damage amp on R at all if they change one little thing:\n\nMake Fizz's Q no longer apply on-hit affects. \n\n\nAll I ask, Riot, and then he'll be fine.","replies":[]}]}
