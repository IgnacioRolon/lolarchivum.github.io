We ended up going with different changes though after testing the change and finding it didn't do what we'd hoped. In particular:\n\n* Tank Ekko still functioned really well, even with reduced slow strength. Tankier builds have an easier time triggering the passive slow, can take bigger risks with the W and, at least at the time, almost always had the IBG slow in there as well. \n\n* AP Ekko by contrast's much more reliant on stronger slows, his fallback pattern (utility for team, even if he can't kill people himself) especially. Putting AP scaling on slow strength therefore made AP Ekko much more feast/famine based off his gold income, without addressing tank Ekko much.\n\nWe do still see tank/bruiser Ekko as having some problems and are planning to do further work on him as a result, with the goal of pushing him towards an assassin or skirmisher playstyle. Current expectation is that those changes will happen in the pre-season patch with the changes to a number of other assassins or champs with strong assassin qualities.","replies":[{"poster":"Cubíx","date":"2016-08-17T19:53:50.417+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will he get any big changes to his kit or mostly number changes?

If I want to play a feast or famine jungler I would rather play Kha, Rengar, or even Kled (who I have had quite a bit of success with despite his ~40% winrate) because AP simply doesn't work in the jungle. Ekko needs way too much money to build AP (he needs AP/Health/resists to function as a psuedo assassin) and just can't get that income in the jungle unless the enemy team force feeds you kills.

The only other thing I can think of is lowering the slow on his passive and boosting the speed up that it gives (Tank Ekko has no trouble sticking to a target, the slow just puts the final nail in the coffin with the iceborn), so that AP ekkos can escape fights more easily while tank ekko's victims would not be slowed down (being able to separate the tank ekko from his allies rather than his victim from his enemies.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2016-08-17T19:54:15.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you guys take a look at trying to disincentivize building tank on Ekko at all?

The passive is built for bruisers (like Jax or Vi), two of the skills are pretty clearly built for tanks (q and w) and the ultimate is pretty unreliable as far as assassin positioning goes while the large heal is very potent for tanks. It seems to me like Ekko's kit is just a better tank kit than it is an assassin kit. The tools he has are just better for locking down large areas and surviving to hit whoever is near him than they are for carefully selecting a single target and removing them from the map. Furthermore, trying to design a champion to be an unreliable assassin seems like a losing proposition. The only possible outcomes are a reliable assassin, an underpowered assassin, or some other class which cares less about the unreliable nature of the skills.
