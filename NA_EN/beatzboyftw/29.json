He literally doesn't have a q if he is trying to fight any minion monster or champion in a 1v1 situation. he needs to be in a 1v2 to have access to his q, even when in the jg on monsters, like gromp..... or a single caster minion....","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-08-12T05:25:00.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uhh why? His current Q is a lot more impactful than his old Q in teamfights, in terms of team disruption & catching people. He honestly doesn't suffer much against single-unit camps like Gromp.\n\nIf you're playing Zac as a duelist against enemy champions, then there is definitely something wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nhifu","date":"2018-08-13T12:47:39.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, Zac fucking sucks\n\nJust a big blob that runs in circles here and there, and outclassed in the tank + cc department by many other champs","replies":[]},{"poster":"FredTheEgg","date":"2018-08-12T12:40:58.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but to compensate for that he clears wolves and raptors real fast now","replies":[{"poster":"Tree Citizen","date":"2018-08-12T23:46:40.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The spell costs 8% of your current hp, which is fine because if used right, you get 2 bloops. but when used in a 1v1 area, it only gives one bloop if you hit, for 8%, used to be 4% like the rest of your spells. and Also his R not nearly as useful at his old one. Old one i could push individual people in different directions and would offer many bloops for many w resets. New one allows him to play a crane game and hope to not snag up darius and drop him in the middle of the team for him to devastate through, or do i drop him out of range of my team, leave myself in the 1v5 to get darius away from my team? is the only reason to have his ult to short cast for some light cc? why have a charge if short cast is the only viable version, for less damage than his original ult was.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
