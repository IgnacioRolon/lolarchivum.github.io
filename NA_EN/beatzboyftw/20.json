My main issue playing HotS are the potatoes you come across and (particularly in lower elo) the flamer who think that they know what they're doing. I assumed that at face-value it seemed less toxic compared to LoL because of Blizzard's more strict reporting policy, the inability to actually insult people (Blizzard caters to a more casual audience and the nature of a lot of their games reflect that; take it as one may =w=), and the lack of all-chat (considering how objective-based the game is).\n\nbtw, I'm stuck at gold 3 in LoL after about like 7-8 months of playing.
