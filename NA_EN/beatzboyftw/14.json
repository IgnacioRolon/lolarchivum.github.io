Taking a mage botlane in Season 3 was game suicide. But due to turret changes, ADC stat changes, certain mage reworks/updates as well as itemization changes, mages can now exist bot lane in certain circumstances. It's not inherently \"good\" or \"bad\". It just is allowed to exist now thanks to these changes.\n\nAlso, bounties aren't a big deal nor the cause of this. While you can get a gold spike for getting a kill, you still have to get the kill. The bigger problem is that Klepto and the Support items (alongside cannon last hitting) allow you to keep pace with gold while last hitting very little, if at all. Removing bounties from CS wouldn't stop this, as the main goal of taking a support item is for the additional wards.","replies":[{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2019-02-18T17:02:01.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> While you can get a gold spike for getting a kill, you still have to get the kill. \n\nI'm talking only about the stupid CS bounties that are not logical to League's core design.

They're absolutely too high right now, yes, but the idea itself isn't a bad one. It's how annoying and fucked up shit like Inting Sion or Proxy Singed get to exist when you don't account for CS: Massive gold income but worth very little for impeding them. DOTA solves this problem by making you lose gold on death. league doesn't so they need another way to punish high deaths but mass farm. Still, as previously stated, it does need to be fixed so it's not quite as absurd. For 30% of a bounty, it feels a lot more like 90%.\n\nAnd yeah, you could go mage bots before. The downside was losing the game. It only is in recent years with the steady nerfs/lower late game power of ADCs that other champions bot lane can flourish. The biggest one being that ADCs were the only class that was good at sieging a turret. Splitpushing, of course, doesn't count as it was more about shoving a lane by yourself and drawing resources to the top. Once mages were able to deal earnest damage to turrets, it was much easier for them to be placed in the bot lane and be a viable alternative to ADCs.\n\nMage bot also isn't the only viable choice, as ADC bot is still the preferred choice and a more viable carry alternative. It's just now that you _can_ have the strategic choice to flex a character like Swain bot lane if you so choose and not lose the game because of it. Your mistake is you assume mages have outright replaced ADCs when in pro play and across all ELOs, ADCs are still the norm. Hell, according to OP.gg, only three non-ADC champions are picked enough to have a presence bot lane: Yasuo, Cassiopeia and Viktor. Cass and Yasuo are 1 and 2 (Albeit with 1% pick rate so they're extremely niche) while Viktor sits at around 49% with a slightly higher pick rate. Everything else? ADCs.\n\nWhile I understand it can be frustrating for new things to emerge and require new thinking and strategy to deal with them, let's not pretend the entire game has flipped on its head. Even with changes like CS bounties, the 1-1-1-2 norm is still the norm. Being able to flex certain things should be seen as an improvement and providing more strategy. After all: For years people complained of the stagnation of the meta. We should be embracing the idea that there are now more avenues to play certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"6KEMBE4ORBA","date":"2019-02-18T18:30:00.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Whatever.\n\nYou're keen on presenting obvious bad design + balance decisions in a good light.

Even then, being so far ahead would net something around a net-zero and/or an incredibly small 50-100g bounty compared to what it is now.
