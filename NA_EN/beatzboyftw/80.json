Any champion with a skillshot dash (such as Leblanc) would try to place themselves in a position where they hit the target while being outside of turret range by utilizing the AOE.  Since Yasuo's ult isn't targeted, but the lead up to it _is_ a skillshot, I think the fact that it _tries_ to place him outside of turret range is actually a good feature that removes unneeded frustration while playing him, especially since his passive (which is refreshed on ult) doesn't block turret shots.\n\nBy assuming that every player is smart enough to have wanted to stand outside turret range while ulting if they had the option it removes a lot of frustration for the players who are skilled enough to do this on every other champion and promotes clutch plays which I think are healthy.  Hurting player's ability to make those clutch plays further reduces the positive impact a solo player can have on the game, which has been a big complaint recently.\n\nSo do I think that it shouldn't be so forgiving as seen in the video above? Yes.  It should definitely place you no further than Yasuo ult normally places you in relation to the target.  However if that range includes a space outside the turret range I believe that letting it place him outside of turret range makes sense, and reduces more overall frustration than it causes.\n\nPersonally I am pretty uncaring about the whole Yasuo issue.  I have never had much issue dealing with him, either in lane or late game.  As a game programmer though this is the one point that bugs me.  From a design standpoint I very much support the way it works, if not the extent to which it works.  As it is also one of the least frustrating parts of his kit, and should the range be reduced would be even less annoying while also providing a large positive aspect to Yasuo player's gameplay (especially for better Yasuo players) I think that focusing it doesn't make much sense over other parts of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"princeblumpkin","date":"2018-05-13T22:36:47.375+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fondling Gems,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uWwYgBnk,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-05-13T15:02:11.141+0000)\n>\n> Honestly I don&#x27;t think Yasuo ult _trying_ to place him outside tower range is a bad thing, I just don&#x27;t think it should let him be that far away.

If I ult an enemy champion, any enemy champions that are both knocked up and within 225 range of the target will also be ulted. 225 range really is not that much; it's just barely longer than the auto range of champs like Darius, Garen, and Xin Zhao, who all have 175 range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-05-14T02:11:57.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why not let yasuo decide where he places with ult exactly like shunpo, so its a skill based and not auto free bullshit","replies":[{"poster":"Fondling Gems","date":"2018-05-14T04:05:51.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are a number of solid reasons actually.\n\nYasuo is able to ult off any knockup/displacement if he reacts fast enough, even things like trundle pillar.  However those knockups are such a short duration that it is unlikely _any_ player could both move their mouse and click twice fast enough to trigger his ult before the target lands.  That is solvable by having it default to whichever side of the target the mouse is on, but once again in almost every situation Yasuo is going to want to be outside turret range anyways, so it doesn't actually change much, or add much skill expression to his kit.  Instead it simply introduces an increased chance of making mistakes, which is not a healthy way to handle these sorts of issues.  Nerfing a champion by making their kit less intuitive is not the way to do it.\n\nThere is also an issue with ulting multiple targets, while this could be replaced by having his ult be an AOE, apply the effect to everyone in the area who was knocked up, this is difficult to combine in an easy to use way with having his ult default to whichever side his mouse is on.  Currently it tries to ult as many people as possible, by having it default to mouse direction you would often end up only ulting one person because your mouse read you as being on the closer side of the closest person.\n\nWhat does this mean:  First of all in 90% of situation Yasuo will be acting exactly the same as currently, which doesn't help reduce player frustration in the slightest.  At the same time it increases Yasuo player's frustration because their ult is no less intuitive, and unlike Katarina placing off to one side or another is far less important for Yasuo, as his ult holds him in place for long enough that everyone is able to adjust to his new position, as opposed to Katarina who can try to catch daggers/jump to champion at strange angles to try and avoid skillshots.\n\nThe only situation in which picking what side you are on is actually useful is when you are near a turret and can still ult the target while being out of aggro, and there is only one decision to make there.  Having the game do it for you is a feel good boost to the user, without _actually_ buffing the champion, as anyone with very basic mechanics who doesn't make a mistake would do that anyways, especially since the mistake can be so devastating; 2 guaranteed turret shots is going to do more damage to a level 6 Yasuo than his ult will do to you, especially since his shield doesn't trigger on tower damage.\n\n--------------------------\n\nChanging how his ult functions wont make the ability feel any different to play against unless you are in the depths of Bronze, which like Challenger, isn't what the game should be balanced around.  In other words your proposed change does nothing to help the frustration of the player fighting Yasuo, while adding the the frustration of Yasuo players, which isn't the answer.  That is why something like changing how far away it can place Yasuo would improve the experience for the first party without severely harming it for the second party. \n\nWhile it may push it to far, Yasuo's ult placement is actually a positive improvement for Yasuo players without harming Yasuo's opponent.  If you find Yasuo frustrating that isn't the cause of the reason, it is simply something to lash out at because it is different from how most abilities work, but that doesn't make it bad.  Balancing games is about far more than just buffs/nerfs/lashing out at the first thing you see.  It is about carefully considering both the positive and negative impacts of each choice for all parties involved and weighing whether it is the right choice to make.  Ultimately this feature of his ultimate is perfectly fine, and if it needed changing the thing to change would be the range as that would provide the a similar experience for users while improving the experience for receivers.\n\nThe thing about it that is triggering isn't that it does that, but the fact that visually he stands so far away from where he normally stands.  The direction he is placed on isn't the thing annoying players, it is the inconsistency from how his ult normally works, which is why nerfing the range would solve many player's issues rather than removing it entirely, because interestingly if it was completely removed he could ult to that range on any side he wanted, because that is his actual ult distance.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-05-13T14:04:55.933+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BeatzBoyFTW,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uWwYgBnk,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-05-13T12:48:59.014+0000)\n>\n> https://youtu.be/CggbSIc8Cfk\n> \n>Remember when diving mechanics were meant to have &amp;quot;risks&amp;quot;?\n\nSure {{champion:23}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:245}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bogdan1945","date":"2018-05-13T14:08:42.453+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"Trynda Ekko and Skaarl are designed at least partially as divers , kayle  , well if you get dived by a kayle you're bad  to get so low, and  fizz when good is usually played as a diver too  , yasuo was supposed to be a melee adc not an unkillable diver","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-05-13T14:19:11.259+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"idk, I feel the same about Yasuo with insane shields he has.","replies":[{"poster":"AmazoX","date":"2018-05-13T15:46:12.431+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScoundrelRuffian,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uWwYgBnk,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-05-13T14:19:11.259+0000)\n>\n> idk, I feel the same about Yasuo with insane shields he has.\n\nThe shield that is gone with a spit.","replies":[{"poster":"Sun Wu Ryuumoku","date":"2018-05-13T16:57:13.182+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"low elo players dont know how to aa someone unless they play a champion aa reliant.","replies":[{"poster":"FullmuteAll play","date":"2018-05-13T20:15:51.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"He stacked shield, uses Q and dive you with ult, when are you going to aa him ?","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-05-13T20:45:45.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another option is not getting hit by the tornado while you are at 1/4 health.","replies":[{"poster":"Hibeki","date":"2018-05-14T02:13:01.145+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">Dodge the skillshot\n\ngame over boys dont matter how broken something is this instantly wins the argument /s","replies":[{"poster":"My Waifu Vanilla","date":"2018-05-14T05:18:17.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The amount of conditions to be met in order for you to get dove by Yasuo AND for the shield to matter are so many though. \n\n1) You HAVE to be be below 1/3 health for Yasuo to ever dive you in lane. He doesn't do enough damage unless you fed your brains out already. It is at this point you probably should just recall. \"but he will just take my tower\" isn't a very good excuse when you are turtling under tower losing half of each wave, get dove, and then lose the tower anyway because you died.\n\n2) You HAVE to get hit by the tornado. Yasuo does NOT have an ultimate without landing another VERY telegraphed ability in the game. That's on you for getting hit by it.\n\n3) He needs to not already have his passive up. Refreshing the shield doesn't do anything if he didn't have it popped to begin with.\n\n4) He needs to actually get hit by you to pop the shield. If he dives you and all you do is throw an auto. You probably healed him as a mage since the shield is bigger than your auto attack and thus caused him to take less damage from the tower. This is relevant because he HAS to take tower shots for this complaint to at all be relevant. If he doesn't take ANY tower shots when he dives you then 99% of the time it wouldn't have mattered if he actually dove you since it means he killed you with JUST Q+R+Ignite thus not needing to enter tower range at all. That means if he ACTUALLY were to go under your tower with his ulti he would need AT LEAST less than 20% health to die since he is taking at most 3 tower shots due to how fast you died. Even less if he were to flash out.\n\nThis argument against the yasuo ult doesn't do anything. The amount of times Yasuo dives you at a health level where him actually being at risk of dying ANYWAY to diving you is so small it isn't relevant. Also, the ult if putting him far enough out of tower range will sometimes just save your life while being dove. If he doesn't kill you instantly (which depends on YOUR health level being fairly small), chances are you are just in the clear since he got placed super far away from you and you can dash or flash out.
