You shouldn't get free help from coding just because you got too greedy and made a bad play. Yasuo players know full well that their ult is going to position them 'on top' of the enemy champ if they use it, so why should they get a free out for making a stupid play that could otherwise kill them? I'm seriously confused by this kind of logic. You can't even try to bait a dumb yasuo player into killing himself by ulting you under tower most of the time due to this dumb mechanic. Yasuo is already known to be a lane bully that can force an opponent under tower due to constant dash harass. He shouldn't be able to make sitting under tower unsafe 50% of the time (depending on how deep they are) as well, due to some dumb code. His ult scales extremely well (150% ratio), it applies CC that cannot be reduced, it resets his shield and gives him 15 seconds of 50% armor pen... and you're saying the downsides of needing to throw himself into the enemy lines greatly out-ways these bonuses?

The hitbox for blocking something is extremely generous and it comes out of yasuo. this means that if even a pixel of a giant spell (I.E nami wave) touches it the spell is removed. Not to mention aiming it is no harder then clicking in the general direction of the opponent. \n\n2. lack of counterplay options\ni'll list the counterplay below and whats wrong with each of them.\n\n\"You can walk through it\"\nUseful if yasuo happens to be running from you but useless otherwise because your walking in melee range of a yasuo. \n\n\"You can walk around it\"\nsometimes. Most of the time as an adc or mage you end up horribly mispositioned in a teamfight because wind wall is obnoxiously large. In lane walking around it leaves you extremely open to a jungle gank or close to yasuo anyways because he'll dash to you. \n\n\"Just wait it out\"\nYeah no. Wind wall has an extremely long duration of 4 seconds. Thats enough time for an entire teamfight to be decided, for your frontline to die because you can't do shit while their entire team is attacking them. \n\n\"Bait it then go in\"\nWonderful. now i'm relying not on anything i do but on my opponent being stupid enough to waste a crucial spell on an autoattack. \n\n3. Wind wall is genuinely an extremely easy and no skill spell to use besides the cooldown. \n\"but yasuo takes a lot of skill\"\nyeah i agree but nothing about windwall involves any kind of skill besides not wasting it.

Your playing Syndra/lux/orianna/fuckinganymage so as malphite is coming in you throw your cc and yasuo dashes out of the way. Malphite ults yasuo but you can't kill him because his shield absorbs too much burst. You throw one more spell to try and kill him and yasuo just wind walls. you could maybe have predicted the dash if you were fucking faker but he would have just dashed the other direction anyways. You could have walked into auto range except yasuo could easily kill you if you got up that far even though he'd probably die to malphite right afterwards. and you could do jack shit about the wind wall except hope yasuo's bad.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2017-10-24T07:52:45.729+0000","up_votes":27,"down_votes":4,"body":"I see downvotes but I don't see anyone explaining why this mechanic is good.","replies":[{"poster":"Glîtchy","date":"2017-10-24T08:25:10.400+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tombdragon,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=f0XHztQ5,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-10-24T07:52:45.729+0000)\n>\n> I see downvotes but I don&#x27;t see anyone explaining why this mechanic is good.\n\nThat's because they don't wanna confirm it's bad, there's no way to defend it to being a good, fair mechanic","replies":[{"poster":"Saljooki","date":"2017-10-24T11:24:07.694+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":16,"body":"When Yasuo ults, he is suspended and cant move or cancel his ult.

When Yasuo ults a target, he typically appears directly behind the champion \"nothing personal, kid\" style. However, if Yasuo ults a target just within a towers range, it will position him on a different side of his opponent so as to not eat a free turret shot while he's stuck in his ult animation. This only works when the enemy is just inside the towers range. A champion standing closer to their tower will suck Yasuo into it just like you'd expect because Yasuo must be very close to the enemy champion during his ult animation: approximately 300 units. It will not ever allow Yasuo to avoid tower shots while ulting someone directly under a tower.
