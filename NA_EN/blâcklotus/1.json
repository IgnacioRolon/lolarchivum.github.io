Removing the stacking item didn't remove junglers from the game that used it. {{item:1419}} {{item:1418}} {{item:1416}} is still here.  So is {{item:3124}} which got Sated Devourers passive but a price increase.\n\nYou got more stacks for ganking sure, but... Why? Why was 1-2 extra stacks worth risking a potential double kill when! Scuttler gave 2 Stacks. 4 Stacks if you got both which most people did, and large monsters gave 1 stack. So let's calculate this\n\n2 Scuttlers - 4 stacks, 6 total large mobs, 6 stacks. That's 10 stacks per full jungle clear WITHOUT trying to go for the enemy jungle camps. And dragon/rift was worth 5 stacks. So ALL together, if you get a dragon plus full jg clear, thats 15, stacks, do it again  and you have Sated Devourer without risking your death to the enemy team. But the problem with that was if their jungler was ganking it was putting them ahead cause they were all getting fed while only you were getting fed. \n\nTo top that off though, once you were fed into Sated Devourer it actually DOUBLED your item count cause every on hit effect triggered a second time every other hit. Build the slightest bit of tank/lifesteal/damage and you weren't able to be killed. It was an easy and dull style of gameplay that made people quit. But Riot removed it cause of that but still Riot said wait, no no.. this was good(Stupid?) And so they put it on Guinsoos Rageblade. \n\nI hate the Tank Meta too, and I honestly hate all the recently released Champions(Taliyah because of her eyebrows and the fact that Riot took her from Avatar shows their lack of imagination in Champions recently --> Look at the next one, its Yordle Rengar riding a Lizard how innovative?.... Not to mention ANOTHER STACKING MECHANIC AND A TEAM GLOBALT ULT AGAIN??) There is too much damage for this game and for the turrets to handle. It's much more fun playing ARAMs than Summoners Rift. And its much more fun not playing this game than playing ARAMs. I stopped giving Riot any kind of money awhile ago.","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-08-02T06:03:28.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phantom Hit is a desirable effect for the game, in general. However, it needs to come at an appropriate price and opportunity cost. With Devourer, the price was not appropriate, although the opportunity cost was (required Smite and time in the jungle) in a vacuum - the kind of playstyle it encourage was not ok, though.\n\nNow, Phantom Hit is on a 3600 gold item. Since it is the ultimate on-hit multiplicator effect, this falls in line with the ultimate crit multiplicator effect (Infinity Edge, 3600 gold) and the ultimate AP multiplicator effect (Rabadon's, 3800 gold).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Axe2Handle","date":"2016-08-02T04:32:42.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because stacking jungle items encouraged less champion interaction and AFK farming the JG.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-08-02T05:04:27.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"removeing a style of play because it isnt exciting isnt right o healthy thats why farming junglers and split pushers are so weak atm when forced into this team fight or lose meta","replies":[{"poster":"BlâckLotus","date":"2016-08-02T05:12:48.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u got more stacks by ganking  and taking obectives though.","replies":[{"poster":"LordGeovanni","date":"2016-08-02T08:24:09.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whether you did or not its safer and more reliable to farm jungle than change feeding your enemies more than your laners are already feeding them and your as long as you control vision your enemy envading you is not much of a problem","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlâckLotus","date":"2016-08-02T04:47:01.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"jg is the second less desirable role in the game,i dont see why riot would remove an entire category of junglers from the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-02T19:33:50.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax is a pretty good Jungler.

Why was it \"never enough stacks.\" Or \"why can't you take a risk on a gank?\"\n\nWhat does Devourer have to compete with? And the Answer I came up with is, Itself. If you were a Devourer Jungler against another Devourer Jungler, You were in this constant state of Attrition, where the first one to stop farming loses.\n\nThat's why I felt like Sated was far better than the Infinity stacking. Because their was an Actual end point. As a Result, a Devourer Jungler who fell behind could still catch up. Which also means, fewer risks trying to pull off a gank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CerealBoxOfDoom","date":"2016-08-02T05:07:12.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because junglers will never leave the jungle even when the nexus is about to explode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2016-08-02T04:39:26.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it does come back I want to see 60%+ stack loss on death similar to {{item:3041}} \n\nPersonally I'd rather not see it came back because more often than not the stacking mechanic caused allies to be super aggro for taking a single camp, let alone accidentally last hitting the dragon.
