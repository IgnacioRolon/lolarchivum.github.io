She still has fantastic clears and excellent sustain which is perfect for season 5 - the tough jungle should have been a buff to her considering how many other junglers struggled initially. But she hasn't been used all season, even when Jarvan, Vi and Lee were the meta junglers. I really think she's just flat out bad.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"excodar","date":"2015-05-12T22:58:13.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Perfect Blue,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=p7N1XobP,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-12T08:31:55.225+0000)\n>\n> Isn't her low w/l because of her really high skill cap?
