This error will usually pop up if something went horribly wrong during either the patching or Client upgrade process. You may be able to resolve this by deleting the **LeagueClient.exe** file inside your installation directory (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and then launch League from the **lol.launcher.admin.exe** file as admin (right-click, *run as administrator*).\n\nPlease let me know if this caused any change!","replies":[{"poster":"PsychicFantasy","date":"2017-02-23T23:34:32.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked !!
