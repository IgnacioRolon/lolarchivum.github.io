It tends to freeze a lot and slow down at random points, but I was playing around 3 minutes into a match when my screen froze. I could still use the cursor, but the screen was completely STILL for around ten minutes, then my computer crashed. Luckily, it saved the League tab and I loaded back into the match, only to have my screen be pitch black. I can also STILL use and move the cursor, but the screen is black now. Help? And is there any way to prevent this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-20T03:26:41.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like League may be encountering some issues accessing or interacting with your display driver.
