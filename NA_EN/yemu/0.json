I'm curious if the person you gift has to open the gift in order to receive the icon, as well as if it has to be opened in the time period... It's been two weeks since I've sent Xayah {{champion:498}} to my friend, and still, haven't received the Gift of Magic icon... I would like to know if I can still get it because my friend opened the gift quite a bit after the time period... Thank you for your help in advance!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T21:20:07.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeeird!
