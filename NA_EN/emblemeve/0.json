I went back to play again, but soon found that I was completely unable to open the game. I open it, and that icon in the center of my screen opens, but the I get a notification saying:\r\n                                                                                                                        X\r\nAnother instance of launcher is running. Would you like to terminate it?\r\nYes                                                                                                        Cancel\r\nNow, if I press 'yes,' it closes the launcher and League won't open. If I press 'cancel', the launcher closes and League won't open. If I press 'X' the launcher still closes, and League still doesn't open. If anybody could help me, I'd seriously appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Eunson","date":"2016-11-13T21:43:31.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted a fix to this but Riot took it down. Are you on Windows 7 or Windows 10? Basically you need to uninstall the game. \n\nDelete all traces of the game including the files found it C:\\Users\\*username*AppData\\Roaming\\Riot Games an any other file you can find in C:\\Users\\*username*AppData*.\n\nIf you are on Windows 10 try running as admin first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-13T00:01:28.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a security setting situation to me!
