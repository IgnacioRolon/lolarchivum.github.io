During Cho&#039;gath&#039;s laugh before you get 6 feast stacks, there is a black rectangle that is attached from the bottom of his jaw to the top, in the middle of his mouth, like part of his texture is being stretched. Is this part of the model, or is it a bug? Its on his original model too, not just the chromas.\n\nYou can't see the bug from the side, so i'm sure its a texture problem:  https://imgur.com/a/CMy82","replies":[{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2018-03-18T16:39:48.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im really trying but i cant see it.","replies":[{"poster":"MetallurgicDread","date":"2018-03-19T00:27:14.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying it in-game, or trying to see it in the picture? Its that black thing in his mouth. If you look at it from different angles, its not on the floor of his mouth or in the back of his mouth, but in the middle. I'll admit, it is a little hard to notice at first. Zoom in at the sideways angle picture, and look at where his top teeth are, and down to the front edge of the tubes, and you can see that it isn't in the back of his mouth. I did check the old skin spotlight of it though, and it was there too, so it probably isn't going to ever be fixed anyways regardless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot OGRigga","date":"2018-03-22T21:56:08.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHHHHHH!!!!
