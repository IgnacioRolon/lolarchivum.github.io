Two games of which in each we had a rude and nasty player who fed and died, and blamed it ALL on us and I was not taking it, so I responded. \r\n\r\nNow I realize that the responses I made in the games were not the most debonair, but this does not warrant extreme toxicity 12 day ban.\r\n\r\nTake note: The J4 I am blasting in this quote description went afk, talked trash, was very rude, attacked several teammates verbally, and was the epitome of toxic. \r\n\r\nThe Darius of the enemy team decided to attack me for making my mood toward J4 known and I responded to his quip sarcastically about our lane history.\r\n\r\nNow, for this ban, Riot sent me 2 game chat histories when I asked where is the context of what caused me to get banned. \r\n2 chat histories for 2 games. I could understand if this was 10 games and with a higher level of toxicity, but 2 games?! TWO games?! And for this mild amount!? Come on!\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\n\r\n[19:10] Kaowru: Syndra \r\n[19:16] Kaowru: ur seriously going afk because you got caught? \r\n[19:33] Kaowru: Yes it is \r\n[19:35] Kaowru: J4 i wanna report u \r\n[19:41] Kaowru: u never help your laners \r\n[19:49] Kaowru: you bad mouth syndra and we NEED her to be strong \r\n[19:53] Kaowru: wow \r\n[19:56] Kaowru: massive hypocrite. \r\n[20:00] Kaowru: \"I wanna report syndra for afk\" \r\n[20:18] Kaowru: Getting report and getting punished are two different things \r\n[20:31] Kaowru: I mean now u pretty much guarantee a banhammer \r\n[20:32] Kaowru: lol \r\n[20:37] Kaowru: u dont know the chnages they made do u? \r\n[20:46] Kaowru: lemme tell u all the things wrong with ur plan J4 \r\n[20:48] Kaowru: okay \r\n[21:19] Kaowru: Cuz he is a massive scumbag jus tlike i thought \r\n[21:23] Kaowru: doesnt help his lane \r\n[21:24] Kaowru: talks *** \r\n[21:30] Kaowru: and goes afk when people are done putting up with him. \r\n[21:38] Kaowru: Nah blitz \r\n[21:41] Kaowru: he made up his mind \r\n[21:45] Kaowru: lets just let the loser lose. \r\n[21:53] Kaowru: We can get this lp back easily \r\n[22:14] Kaowru [ALL]: Report J4 \r\n[22:17] Kaowru [ALL]: Sitting inside the base \r\n[22:21] Kaowru [ALL]: And typing \"hahahahah \r\n[22:29] Kaowru [ALL]: Not only has he been no help to laners \r\n[22:31] Kaowru [ALL]: But he talked *** \r\n[22:43] Kaowru [ALL]: awww, is somebody salty they threw their advantage away in lane? \r\n[22:57] Kaowru [ALL]: And became inferior really quickly? \r\n[23:08] Kaowru [ALL]: Pretty much \r\n[23:16] Kaowru [ALL]: uh huh \r\n[23:28] Kaowru [ALL]: Suuure \r\n[23:36] Kaowru [ALL]: Lost? \r\n[23:39] Kaowru [ALL]: I won lane pal \r\n[23:45] Kaowru [ALL]: U got two early kills \r\n[23:51] Kaowru [ALL]: Threw me a kill because ur a reckless idiot \r\n[23:54] Kaowru [ALL]: Then died 2 more times \r\n[24:00] Kaowru [ALL]: I play fiora because 1. She does massive dmg. \r\n[24:11] Kaowru [ALL]: 2. She has no counterplay \r\n[24:44] Kaowru [ALL]: Also, not invincible. \r\n[24:49] Kaowru [ALL]: Just untargetable \r\n[25:04] Kaowru [ALL]: so yeah, anybody who isnt darius please report J4 \r\n[25:10] Kaowru [ALL]: If not, well I hope u get paired with him next. \r\n[\r\n26:11] Kaowru: Learn to play* \r\n[26:12] Kaowru: period \r\n[26:26] Kaowru: Blitz, people? \r\n[26:30] Kaowru: He needs to learn to deal? \r\n[26:33] Kaowru: he was *** talking us all game \r\n[26:45] Kaowru: Legit all i said before this whole ordeal was \"HELP ME TOP PLEASE\" \r\n[26:52] Kaowru: and even so, i still managed to take my advantage back \r\n[26:56] Kaowru: both ways? \r\n[27:01] Kaowru: what a sanctimonious *** you are. \r\n[27:14] Kaowru: Cuz unlike him, im not screwing the unit \r\n[27:33] Kaowru: and you have been filling our game with mediocre support play \r\n[27:51] Kaowru: Ive been last pick \r\n[27:57] Kaowru: still did legions better than you. \r\n[28:03] Kaowru: idunno \r\n[28:08] Kaowru: guess im flooding your chat \r\n[28:16] Kaowru: Since u wanna take that dbags side \r\n[28:55] Kaowru: So obvious... \r\n[29:18] Kaowru: Tbh ive grown sick of u \r\n[29:26] Kaowru: what r u talking about? Ur totally taking his side \r\n[29:33] Kaowru: u have been defending his actions all game\r\n---\r\n\r\nI seriously do not think I deserve a ban for this. I mean this is legit not toxic here. At this point, telling somebody \"I don't like you.\" in League may very well classify as toxic.","replies":[]}
