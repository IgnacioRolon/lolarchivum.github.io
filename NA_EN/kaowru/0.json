{"poster":"Kaowru","date":"2014-11-02T02:42:04.739+0000","title":"You know something, this whole thing is bogus.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":20,"down_votes":25,"body":"Some of us deserved our suspensions, but some of us didn't and nobody is questioning why we are suspended, but they just think \"Suspended therefore deserve it.\"\n\nTo people who don't deserve suspensions\nThey troll us, they trash talk us they talk down to us, they are legit acting like cancer and yet WE deserve to be banned? \n\nWhat's that? We are suspended so it's okay to downtalk us? Well, I was suspended for talking back to an afker / rager not once but twice, because I'm \"making things worse and not helping the unit.\" \n\nNevermind the fact that I NEVER call out people for being bad, I never tell people to stop feeding, I don't curse people out, I don't verbally assault people. I mean, I may throw snark and witt at them if they start raging and dragging us down, but no one deserves to be suspended for that.\n\nPeople downvote everybody with a suspension thread, even the guy who was suspended for playing Jungle Nidalee.\n\nSeriously, this is getting out of hand. The way riot is currently working suspensions is irresponsible and a betrayal to a good portion of its playerbase.\n \nI don't care how many downvotes or boo's I get, I know what I did. I am of sound mind and body and I was righteous and did not say anything to anyone unless it was fair reciprocation. No one should be banned for reciprocation, especially when the team is already losing. \n\nWhat's more, these people who downvote and attack me on the threads, how is this any different from the verbal abuse and \"toxic behavior\" that some of you admonish. Heck, one guy ZeroKuro was sneering at me with his nose pointed at the sky and then I started questioning him and piercing his armor in doing so. He cursed at me like a sailor and gave me the : You deserve it because you were suspended. Logic. \n\nHonestly, the way you people act is like something out of 4chan, I owe you no apologies because I did nothing wrong. And now you are going to say. \"Oh, he thinks he did nothing wrong, he deserves a perma-ban!\" Or maybe I'm well-minded and mature enough to know when and when not to use snark, but that clearly doesn't count for this paper-skinned community.\n\nI mean, you don't even have to be above calling people n00bs, or curse at them or verbally abuse them. All you have to do is refuse to put up with somebodies shit for a game or 2 and that constitutes a ban? That is bullshit, and nothing you say can convince me otherwise.\n\nI mean, you have a character: Akali who taunts the opponent and calls them n00bs.\n\nYou have Darius whose Dunkmaster D skin was coined from the phrase \"Get Dunked!\" Something said after securing a kill and gloating. \n\nYou have people who blast laughter after surviving or killing somebody and abuse this to the point of being obnoxious, but they don't get banned. \n\nYet somehow its wrong to talk back to the bully? I was suspended for talking back to the bully? I'm being punished for deciding to not be a victim? What kind of crap is this!?\n\n\nA lot of you children are going to post \"LOL SMITE REKD\" or downvote this or just sneer at me with your noses upward with zero ability to convince me that I did wrong with something other than \"You're wrong because you're wrong.\" Well, you are wrong, you cannot convince me otherwise, you still haven't convinced me otherwise. Because I was offered LIMITED explanations as to why I was suspended if any at all besides the standard copypasta anti-toxicity message.\n\nIf you have a company throwing a copy-pasta message as its justification for disbarring somebody, you know something is wrong. Or at least I do, you people seem to have only one brain and that one is between your legs. \n\nLet the record show that I have not been chat restricted for this, and I sent a support ticket to Riot to ask why I was banned or at least for chatlogs. No response at all. ","replies":[]}
