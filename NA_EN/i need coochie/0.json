After that it retries to open it again automatically and it fails, filling up my entire screen with bugsplat windows. Sad to say restarting my computer wont help and I also attempted to reinstall League of Legends but that didn't fix it either.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T23:24:59.471+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow that's a lot of bugs!  A reinstall can help, but your issue could also be caused by overzealous security settings causing installation or access problems.  Run through our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide just to make sure league has proper access.\n\nThen run through our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide to make sure this isn't being caused by other factors like driver issues.
