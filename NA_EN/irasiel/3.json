Personatly, i dont play league of legends to boost random people egos. Dont see why they would require any form of appreciation from me to play better, i assume they want to win as much as i do, and if everyone are doing their part to archieve this goal, then every did great (time to time i praise good plays at post game screen, regardless of the team the player was in. feel thats what that screen was made for, otherwise pings and small instructions and timers are good enough.)","replies":[{"poster":"IcyPepper","date":"2015-03-10T06:10:41.169+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":">you find it annoying that you are complimented for a multi-kill?\n\nYes, because to pull off a multi-kill typically requires an advantage (like having snowballed) or a mistake on the opponents' part that you take advantage of.\n\nThe compliment itself isn't annoying, it's when the rest of the team who contributed get no thanks. I thank junglers who gank and give me kills. I thank supports when they find the right millisecond to cc the out-of-position opponent that I pick off. I see this going on, and I'm doing my job just as much as they are, so why do I get all the credit?\n\nPeople don't like supporting anymore. In team builder, it takes forever to find a support (typically, but there are people who enjoy it like I do on occasion), but queuing up as a support takes two seconds to find a team. There is a reason for this, and it's not just carrying teams. The support is an important role, and people don't treat it like such. So, well, I try to make people enjoy supporting. \n\nDuring the laning phase, it's my job to get as much cs as possible and stay ahead of my opponent, keep up map awareness, and occasionally poke the enemy with an autoattack or spell. The rest is up to the support, because most adc's don't have the same level of utility. They are the playmakers. They are the boss of the laning phase, and when they do a good job then damn am I going to tell them.\n\n.\n\n>Dont see why they would require any form of appreciation from me to play better,\n\nI've been watching player behavior for a long while now, and I can say that people's mood can and will affect their gameplay. If I make sure the support is enjoying themselves and let them know when they're doing a good job, they're more likely to keep up the good work. Another effect of that is the support and I are more likely to be in sync, since we're getting along, and won't likely argue if one of us makes a call and get it done. Supports who like me also tell me what they're doing so I can adjust my gameplay, instead of just doing whatever (trust me, if an adc is being a brat, then the support will find a reason to be useful elsewhere). If they need to help mid, I'll free lane at turret. If they need to recall, they let me know first. Communication is a lot more open when you got two allies, rather than a \"carry\" and \"support\" hierarchy going on.\n\nI hope that makes sense, but think about Bronze elo with all the \"bad teams\" complaints. That attitude doesn't win games, so I strive to do the opposite. And it works. \n\ntl;dr: when I play adc, I know the true carry of bot lane is the support.

They can still knock-up and stun and grab and shield and while more AP, mana and CDR are certainly nice things to have, not stomping the lane early on doesn't necessarily render them useless.\nRiven on the other hand only really works if she's ahead. If she's lacking a decent amount of AD while also having to share XP with her ADC, she will quickly end up being outscaled and can't afford to go for her all-in playstyle anymore.\nAshe does at least have a little bit of utility, but since she can't protect anyone and lacks hard CC and/or engages outside of her ultimate, I can't see her ever becoming meta either.\n\nI'm not saying that risky off-meta supports never work (heck, thousands of viewers could witness Imaqtpie and Gosu getting defeated by a [support Katarina](http://www.lolking.net/replay/na/1755132139) (and Heimerdinger and Udyr) yesterday), but it's probably safe to assume that those picks will never be more than odd 1-in-a-million picks that can lead to a lot of distrust in SoloQ - and for a reason.\nIntroducing an AD support item would reinforce those issues in lower elos while higher elos and competitive play in particular wouldn't benefit from it at all.\n\nSo much \"in defense\" of \"the support meta\".","replies":[{"poster":"TheRainInSpain","date":"2015-03-10T13:08:55.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said, a rebalance of the Spellthief line (which is heavily in favor of an AP scaling Support) should solve the problem of not having ANY ranged AD Support.

WE LOST HARD.  Now no one will say that was a good idea!\"\n\nI'm not saying it will magically allow ranged AD champions to become a somewhat meta choice for a Support, but it would open the gates for later development on rebalancing some of the existing ones to be better at potentially supporting, as well as the addition of Supports that Rito intentionally makes AD and Ranged.\n\nSo something like this:\n\n{{item:3303}} \n+2 gold per 10 seconds\n+25% base mana regen\nUnique passive: Tribute I\nBasic attacks and spells deal 15 extra damage (+X% bonus AD and bonus AP) and return Y gold on hit once every Z seconds.

And maybe Varus (Teemo works in some cases, though the lane quickly becomes a kill lane for Teemo if he's any good).  The problem is that Rito will need to reinvent the wheel and deliberately make a ranged AD Support from the ground up as virtually all other Marksman are unfit for even a slight rework to be more supportive.\n\nAll other kinds of champions, including full blown melee carries (Yasuo) can fulfill the support role better than the average Marksman because of how little utility said Marksman actually brings to the table.  The few Marksmen that actually have utility are either some kind of hybrid (Azir, Gnar, Teemo, and Kennen), or immobile (Ashe and Varus).\n\nAs for Ashe, her kit is outdated and I believe feels somewhat counterintuitive (passive that discourages attacking, lackluster slow toggle, stupid eagle vision thing).

The supports that use Relic Shield are usually melee, for fairly obvious reasons, and as such, they often have to expose themselves whenever they want to execute.\n\n****\n\nAs an example of what can happen when no one lets the support use the stacks though;\n\nI had a pretty terrible game once where **no one considered the stacks. *At all.***\nSure, we won the game but... In a game where all my teammates made 13-16k Gold, and all my enemies made 11-14k gold, I was sitting there as a Braum with a measly 9k gold for building tanky items. That is *not* a lot of items, and it left me pretty much useless beyond the CC on my ult, and despite the win, I felt absolutely awful afterwards. So please, **CONSIDER THE GOD DAMN SUPPORT.** They need a bit of gold too.\n(This little rant about one of my terrible games wasn't really directed at you specifically by the way. It was just an example of what happens when no one lets the support use their Shield stacks.)","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-10T07:35:16.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You obviously haven't been playing support very long.  I can remember when they routinely had less gold than that, and spent most of it on wards.  Items are a luxury for a role that isn't going to have as much gold as everyone else even in the best circumstances.  That is why most supports have to be considered good without items at all to be viable for the role.\n\nIf you have Relic Shield, yes, you should primarily use it when the heal will benefit both you and a nearby champion.  If you have max charges, you should use one charge to prevent potential charges from going to waste.  Beyond that, you should be holding on to the charges.  If you or the ADC die to a last ignite tick or other dot, or one long range auto that you almost got out of range for, and you spent all your charges too fast when both of you were at full health, then congratulations, you just cost them their life.\n\nThe SUPPORT is supposed to consider everyone else, first.  If you can't handle that idea, then don't play the role, because that idea is in the very name.","replies":[{"poster":"Castanean","date":"2015-03-10T14:31:41.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually started playing in season 4, so I've not experienced the time when supports had no gold at all pretty much. I DO know they were much worse off with gold before though, and I DO know sightstone is also a fairly new thing and that supports had to buy every ward seperately before. Trinkets are even more recent than Sightstone as well, so now is a pretty good time to be a support. \n\nWhile, yes, it *is* the supports job to do exactly that, *support,* you kinda have to remember that the support is a human player too, they too want to have fun. If they have stacks they want to use, then let them. It's overly frustrating for the support when your Yasuo decides to instantly waveclear the ENTIRETY of the next 6 waves before you can even attempt to stack just a single one of them, despite already almost being in melee range, which I believe is what this thread is mainly about. It's also part of what I mean when I say \"Consider the Support.\" The support has certain things they need to do, and you should probably let them do those things. One of those is to allow them to use their shield stacks when they need/want to. Not only for the support's enjoyment of the game, but also because it pretty much literally *doubles* that minion's value. And after you get Targon's, you're gonna have too many stacks to use on Siege minions only, so then you should let your support stack on the melee minions.\n\nAnyway. I know that being overly prideful and/or arrogant is the way of the Bronze player, so I'm not gonna deny the possibility that you may have more experience than me, and I will take your posts as advice. Although, to be honest, some of the ways you worded things gave me the impression that you were being kind of a jerk. No offense intended, so please don't take it as an insult.","replies":[{"poster":"LeeDark","date":"2015-03-10T21:09:08.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the Yasuo is at a point where he can clear an entire wave with a single Q, that's pretty late in the game.  Doubling the value of a single minion at that point is not actually worth that much, compared to the things your team SHOULD be doing then.  Clearing as fast as possible to either siege a tower or rotate to another objective is going to be worth more at that point.  Also, if you upgraded to Face of the Mountain, it is more important for the shield, and the heal then scales with your health.  Look for opportunities to kill a minion while you are peeling or something, because an autoattack from the support will generally do more if it heals someone like that than if it takes 40 health off of the enemy fighter who's diving your back line.\n\nNow, that said, if your team is significantly behind and trying to make a comeback, they absolutely should be letting you use as many charges as you can.  Of course, they should also be letting the waves freeze as much as possible to make the gold they can get from a lane last.  If they instantly waveclear, the wave pushes into unsafe territory very quickly.\n\nMuch earlier,  your ADC should be letting you get last hits with it.  Hell, if I'm playing ADC, I usually ping a minion for them to take.  Relic Shield has a cooldown of 1 minute, and the respawn time of cannons that early is actually 1:30.  You should upgrade to Targon's Brace before the 20 minute mark, when the siege minion respawn is 1 minute, and your cooldown becomes 30 seconds, so until 35 minutes in, the siege minion respawn will not be in sync with your cooldown.  The cooldown, however, also means that if you try to use it both on cooldown AND for a siege minion, you'll run out of charges.\n\nThe first wave of minions spawns at 1:30, and the first Siege Minion spawns at 2:30, so you can safely use a charge on the very first wave and the cooldown will max you out for the first Siege minion.  After that, the next Siege minion spawns at 4:00, but your cooldown finished at 3:30.  If you used it on a wave as soon as it was up, you'll use your second charge on the cannon and be empty until the wave that spawns at 4:30 reaches the lane.  I would personally consider this a poor choice if neither of those two charges provide the heal, because between 4:00 and 4:30 is prime ganking time.  However, by that point, the heal should be useful, so most of the mathematical preparation is merely theoretical here.\n\nMostly, it is important to simply keep track of the siege minion waves.  Not only because that is the best use of the charges, but because that is also the best time to ward for safety and put some damage on the tower.  Making sure your ward won't time out until AFTER a siege minion wave is good, for example.  When you return to a lane, with both you and the ADC at full health, when the heal won't be useful for a minute or so, just look up at the clock as you walk back, do a quick calculation for the next siege wave.  If it is the next wave, you are probably better off saving the charge.  If it is not, then you should use a charge on a melee minion.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2015-03-10T16:06:50.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not practical for the long term, but an extra 80 HP with the  {{item:3302}} Relic Shield with full stacks, 150 with {{item:3097}} Targon's Brace, or 240 minimum with {{item:3401}} Face of the Mountain plus its shielding can help a lot at the right moment.

I just find it silly to prioritize the heal over pretty much literally *doubling* a minion's gold value. The Relic Shield line would still be 100% viable even without the heal just because of that, but that's not to say the heal isn't useful. \n\nAs I clarified in my response to LeeDark's response, I *will* be taking it as advice to hold on to some stacks for those moments where the carry gets himself hurt. Though, I still think it's silly to save *all* your stacks *all the time,* only ever last hitting if its a Siege Minion *and* you have full stacks, especially after upgrading to Targon's. IMO, a Support with Relic Shield or its upgrades should ALWAYS get the siege minions, even with just one stack up. Doubling a Siege minion is quite a bit of gold. I still definitely see the use of that little extra health early though.","replies":[{"poster":"Lost R","date":"2015-03-10T16:56:27.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I have a stack, I'm probably going to try to burn it immediately, mostly because I'm never certain when I'll be next given the chance to do so.
