The balance team makes changes that are so healthy for this game and then they do this shit that's just completely uncalled for.  If there was a Sion that got too \"big\", it's because the enemy team didn't deal with him correctly and they let him spiral out of control.  He is not unique in this way, many other champions have a specific way you must counter them to keep them from becoming too strong.  \n\nThe fact is that the LoL community hasn't seen Sion very much until recently, he just burst onto the scene and instead of taking stock of his strengths and weaknesses, they all cry OP and QQ on the forums.  The balance team forgets what makes Sion balanced because all they hear is nonesense and they don't stick to their guns.  Just look at that comment on the 5.6 Patch Notes about Nidalee.  They felt like they had to specifically cater to the crowd of Nidalee haters on these forums because they don't have the wherewithal to do what is necessary despite what others think.","replies":[{"poster":"Thefriendlyorc","date":"2015-03-25T22:02:07.779+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I loved how we had videos of how garbage sion was for months until Dyrus started using him in the LCS.

Do you realize he is one of the squishiest champions at the beginning of the game?  He's squisher than Shaco.  His base defensive stats are so low because his damage and late game potential are all he has going for him.  \n\nAnyone who knows Sion's strengths and weaknesses should know how to completely cripple him in lane.  The guy can't all-in worth anything until he gets 3-4 tank items and a good deal of farm.  Furthermore, all of his abilities are skill-shots and any champion with an ounce of mobility can get out of the way, unless you're in a team fight.  If you're in a team fight before his survivability spikes, you just focus him and you kill him because he is the least useful tank in the game until his power spike, which is half-way through a match.  \n\nWhen the enemy picks Sion, I can't wait to face him now.

So by the time that I back for the first time, I'm already ahead of Shaco in passive health.  Once cinderhulk is built, I'm the tankiest character in the game.\n\nSion's biggest weakness is his early game.  You need hella good positioning to gank a lane.  He can survive in the jungle extremely well despite the nerfs, so you're pretty much power farming until you hit 6 and start ganking from the tower.  After that, Sion becomes an unstoppable monster if you haven't starved him of farm by counter jungling or shutting him down.  It will take about 10 seconds and all 5 of your team to take down Sion, and that's implying he doesn't knock all of you up or ult to get away.\n\nI am not saying Sion is OP, but I am going to say that you sound like the textbook old Sion whiners that you can't just point and click to blow somebody up with full AP Sion anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-25T22:02:30.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to be distracting you away from my point and I don't know about any specific scenario you have been a part of.

Select JUNGLE tanks who synergize really with CInderhulk (AoE + HP scaling) are doing really well. Which doesn't mean a whole lot considering those same tanks were doing really well before. Nothing, absolutely nothing, has been done for tanks (as a whole) to make them better than they were a patch before. \n\nCounterplay is counterplay. It doesn't take Diamond level understanding of the game to realize that if you don't clump, Amumu/Malph/Sej ults won't matter. I'm not disagreeing that tanks aren't easy to play, but this idea that they're hard to counter is absurd. They're the most easily countered class in the entire game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nihil1ty","date":"2015-03-26T03:55:22.407+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just love how riot says they want to promote diversity, yet they have no clue how to balance at all.  They nerf all mid and top laners, nerf all early game junglers,  nerf snowballing, and call that diversity. All theyre doing is making it to where your team is at a disadvantage if you don't have a tank jungler that can utilize cinderhulk. Basically, all youre gonna see now are tank junglers with heavy cc. I've pretty much given up on this game ever being completely balanced","replies":[]}]}
