I can deal and learn how to deal with a single broken thing, not when almost everything is broken at the same time.

SR now cascades in one direction for about 10 minutes before laning phase even finishes, which is enough to make about 90% of players quit, apparently, as soon as the 20 minute mark hits. I can't even PLAY sr, for all intents and purposes, because the good part never comes. For me it was all about testing your mettle with calculated builds in late-game teamfights... which no longer exist now. Thanks Riot.\n\nI would take an enemy ninjassassin-warwick in SR any day over an SR that essentially isn't a game anymore.
