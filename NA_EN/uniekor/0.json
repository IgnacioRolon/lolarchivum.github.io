I recommend using the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help strengthen up your network and restore that connection.  This sounds more of a connection issue, and not necessarily trying to connect from your physical location.
