Have try a lot of stuff since yesterday and even uninstalling and reinstalling multiples times plus using their hex-tech repair tool to no avail. Please Riot any help will be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T00:56:43.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patcher Kernel Errors are usually evidence of certain administrative privileges not being assigned to League that it heavily relies on.

Heck i actually manage to enter like 3 times yesterday but didn't even wanna play a game out of fear it would crash and me unable to enter right away. My only guess is something with the patch 6.22 since on other groups on Facebook a few people seems to have the same issue and the only few that have kinda fix it all they do is switch to the alpha client.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-14T22:09:46.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you're still having issues and the common solutions didn't resolve this, I'd recommend we escalate this to our tech team.
