While the practice does not necessarily give all the korean teams an insurmountable edge over the rest of the world, it does give them an edge. \r\n\r\nThe Bo3 adds a different depth to the game, do you play your absolute best champion that was unbanned or do you pick one you are extremely good with but just below your best champion? It could make a difference. \r\n\r\nEven if this is completely off base, which it might be these are only my opinions, the fact that you have 3 qualifier seasons for a championship tournament and one of them uses a different format just seems to be odd, especially when the championship tournament uses the odd man out format rather than the one that the 2 LCS use.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegas Dad","date":"2015-03-09T05:08:06.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beleive so was going to make a post on this that LCS teams get very little experience making adjustmed  because they never play double or best of 3 only 1 match at a time, also requires a longer duration of focus. I do beleive it puts lcs teams at a disadvantage and lcs should change to a set mode for the season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thrawn922","date":"2015-03-19T20:00:18.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fears seem to be unfounded, in light of IEM.......it still is weird for there to be 4 regions and 3 different formats for one grand tournament","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-03-09T15:54:36.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have always said that Koreans, and even to a lesser degree Chinese teams have a superior setup to Western Teams.\n\nLCK (God I hate this and want OGN back), allows for practice of adaptation and optimizing the game at the very beginning (pick/ban).\n\nLPL does somewhat similar but Series of 2 seems a bit gimmicky. As has been shared on this forum prior, some teams don't  try both games. Either Game 1 or Game 2 (after a win) will be completely troll.","replies":[]}]}
