Did Riot changer her W in a way where we can&#039;t see where her W circle is?\r\n\r\nI do not use quick cast, I like to use the normal features where I can see my skill shots before I use my skill shots. For example, before I use my Nami&#039;s bubble, her Q, I am given her range and also a small circle indicating an aim or skill shot.\r\n\r\nTaliyah used to have the same circle for her W, but whenever I use Taliyah&#039;s W, all I see is the range of her W, but no circle. Is this a bug or perhaps Riot changed Taliyah&#039;s W? If it is not a bug, can you bring it back? I am a lv 7 tier Taliyah and I have not been performing well with her ever since this strange occurance.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-08-27T02:42:31.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also bothering me greatly, the ability seems to always cast in in the wrong direction, directly reverse of where i intended, and has no range indicator..\nThis has been since the change to casting mechanics several patches ago.","replies":[{"poster":"The Grand Idea","date":"2016-08-27T03:26:19.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you using quick cast? if you are, then you don't get a range indicator. unless yours is super bugged.\n\nI still get my range indicator, I don't get the circle where her W will pop up","replies":[]}]}]}
