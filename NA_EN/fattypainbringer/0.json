We'll see what's going on.\n\nEDIT: \n\nOkay! \n\nSo, I spoke with the audio guy, and the VO that plays when you buy items is intentionally set to only play a percentage of the time, so it's not always going to play. \n\nHope that clears things up!

It seems a bit odd.","replies":[{"poster":"FattyPainBringer","date":"2015-02-11T23:40:57.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actuly all the other champs who say things when you buy items like braum, karthus and now tristana say it everytime you buy the item that's why i bothered making this post. It's bad when you pay 15 dollars for a skin and it fails to say the cool VO's you enjoy where as champs you can get for free says their VO's for items every time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
