If more movies focused on the story instead of explosions and flashy images then their overall quality would drastically increase. Anyone who disagrees with this is either delusional or has never seen them before. I myself have seen the entire saga at least 3 times. I hope one day I can sit with my children and watch them together so they can see what real quality is like instead of the 50th installment of transformers.","replies":[]}
