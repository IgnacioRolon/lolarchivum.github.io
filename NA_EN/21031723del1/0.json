His old passive energize made so much sense and made Skarner a incredible clearer but now its replaced by a stun that doesn&#039;t help your clear time and forces you to build tanky. His e used to be a heal which allowed him to sustain and be played in top lane. \r\n\r\nThis is merely a opinion and would like others thoughts on this topic.","replies":[{"poster":"Muted Summoner","date":"2015-04-19T06:58:28.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"skarner just to easy to pick against thats the problem imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoScout","date":"2015-04-19T05:31:00.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mechanic wise yes, he's boring to play except for his ult","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T04:31:23.881+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like a platinium main Skarner, I can say that Skarner is in a \"balanced\" state, right now the jungle\"tank\"  Skarner its strong, and this is in great part by: {{item:3800}} \n\n{{item:3800}} combined with the 25% bonus health of Cinderhulk and the strong engage active part, make Skarner a true nightmare, he can easily run with W and {{item:3800}} to catch a key target with Impale, his passive stack in AoE, so you can stun and damage targets at the same time also peeling your adc, honestly its a good passive and for me, its a very good passive to clear the jungle too, his old passive remains on his Q, so I don't know why you say that its no longer...\n\nFinally his E recently received a dmg buff, its a utility skill, can be used to init the gank, peel your adc, disengage, if you land a good E, you can easily put a Q, and you only need a second Q to put the stun and then the kill, with {{item:3800}} you can secure the kill. the % slow its strong and hit various targets.\n\nA good build are:\n\n{{item:3025}} or {{item:3078}}, {{item:3110}} ,{{item:3800}}  + Cinderhulk + Boots + MR item like {{item:3102}} {{item:3190}} or {{item:3091}} can be a good _**STANDARD**_ build on him, you need a {{item:3057}} early to solve the mana problems, and amp your dmg too.\n\nSkarner its a strong pick and balanced IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Predatorator","date":"2015-04-19T10:17:50.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd rather the damage buff to be on his Q, because his E is all about utility","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sightless66","date":"2015-04-19T06:54:13.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's balanced. Pretty strong actually. I don't think people argue that anymore. It's just that he's really, really dull. Used to be my absolute favorite. Now, even if I win more often with him, I'm just not having fun when I pick him. It's annoying that CDR can't improve his stun's uptime, the stun isn't as interesting from a gameplay standpoint as the permaslow, and the E is a strong contender for the most boring skill in the game (which is impressive considering how stupidly strong it is).\n\nI'd love to see him on the rework list again. Last two didn't turn out great. Third time's the charm.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HopsinIsDope","date":"2015-04-19T03:36:04.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea freakin rex sai is like the new scarier this days","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Soulforged","date":"2015-04-19T02:48:20.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. \nSome abilities like his e just feel so out of place/weak right now.","replies":[]}]}
