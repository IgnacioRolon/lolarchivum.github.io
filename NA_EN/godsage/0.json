Each time I press it a message pops up saying: \"can't open the app 'league of legends' because its not compatible with this type of mac (OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5)\". to open the launcher I have to go to contents/LoL/play league of legends. I also have the problem that my new league alpha client is not updating. please tell me why is this happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-16T02:33:33.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which icon are you having issues with?

I've never seen this issue before. I suspect it may be linked to a corrupt installation of League, and I believe a clean reinstall could resolve this. You can complete this by grabbing our [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367), launching the app, then checking the boxes for *reinstall* and *clean uninstall* before hitting the **start** button. After the tasks have completed, launch League to complete patching. \n\nLet me know if this helped!","replies":[{"poster":"GodSage","date":"2016-11-25T14:45:53.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked, thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"5yV0T5IEUR","date":"2016-11-16T04:00:12.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same for me but neither of them will open it even though earlier today i had it open","replies":[]}]}
