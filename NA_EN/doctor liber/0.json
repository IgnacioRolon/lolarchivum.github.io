When i noticed that he is Bronze 2 in Flex Queue i just couldn&#039;t understand how the **** can this just happen. Can Riot Games please tell me how is it possible for a Bronze 2 FlexQ and Silver 4 SoloQ to be matched with a P2 FlexQ and D4 SoloQ during my promo ? Can you please tell me ?\nLove\n\nEDIT: This is not a flamepost , but since a lot of us play Your game ( and I do it frequently ) is it possible for you to make clear what actually happens when we start Matchmaking ? Can you take some time to talk about how is Your game working ? It's more than 3 years that i play this game and still i can't understand how certain things in this Game work.","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomSpirit101","date":"2019-01-01T21:29:21.368+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"They try their absolute hardest to make League climbing experience hell for you by trying to forcefully shove 50% win rate at you.","replies":[{"poster":"Scrai","date":"2019-01-02T02:08:48.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i thought the same shit when i was gold 1 legit zooming to the moon with a 70% winrate now fking tanked down to gold 3 with 49% without tilt just wack as players more afks and toxic than ever as soon as winrate was high didnt get it now its so bad now on another account","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2019-01-01T20:48:32.436+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost respect for the matchmaking system long ago: 3v3, me and my premade got matched with a random 3rd person.\nThat person played well, and we wanted to include him in our premade group.\n\nWe couldn't, because his rank was too high compared to my premade.\n\nHow can we even get matched with someone, if we can't play premade together?","replies":[{"poster":"Doctor Liber","date":"2019-01-02T08:37:38.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> How can we even get matched with someone, if we can&#x27;t play premade together?\n\nThis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flawless Fetus","date":"2019-01-02T06:57:19.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3s matchmaking is absolute aids.
