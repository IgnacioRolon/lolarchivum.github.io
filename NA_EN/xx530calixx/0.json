Then league says it needs to restart to apply an update. Launcher restarted but then gave me the error that it had an issue updating so it had to restore to an older version. I keep trying to restart the launcher to update, but I keep getting the same error. What can I do to fix this? Do I need to delete a patch log? That's worked in the past but I don't remember what to delete.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-12T22:56:42.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We had quite a few reports, and the issue was investigated towards a fix.
