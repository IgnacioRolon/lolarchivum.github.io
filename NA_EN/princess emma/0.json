But I'd be saying the same thing as everyone else. So I'll name what I do wrong:\n\n**Poor decision making** - Bad Baron/Dragon calls, allowing myself to repeatedly die when behind, getting overconfident when ahead. Or the worst one, following up on an action that I consciously know is a bad idea.\n\n**Poor knowledge of matchups** - I keep my champ pool fairly wide, so I can't be banned out of any role. But this results in being put on a comfort pick in an usual situation. Yeah, I can play Hecarim, but I don't know how to play him against Garen, for example.\n\n**Failing to work with the team** - I agree that it's hard to work with people who listen to me. I consider myself to be a decent shotcaller. But it's soloq, everyone's selfish (including ourselves). If the team won't listen to me, I have to start listening to them. Even if they're making what seem to be bad calls, we're at least playing as a team. If I think Baron is a bad call, but I'm not the jungler, I might as well follow the jungler if I deem it's safe. (If not, I retreat and recommend they do the same).\n\n**Little early game impact** - I've adopted a fairly safe playstyle. I prefer to let the enemy make the mistake, but that leaves me vulnerable to early game aggression. I'm also a Warwick main (subject to change though).\n\n**Overconfidence based on last game** - This is a big one. If I just carried a game, I'll pick the same champion, expecting to win. That's basically the biggest noob mistake in the book.","replies":[{"poster":"SecretAgentHulk","date":"2015-04-08T21:19:03.947+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bingo.

Occasionally it's possible to salvage those, but one shouldn't obsess over them.\n\nSecond, we're all constantly missing opportunities that we don't know how to look for. That is the nature of the game. That's half the difference between how we perform and the dumpstering that would go on if a challenger player was in our elo.\n\nBeyond that, I'll list a couple of reasons I lose:\n-Playing teamfights horribly. I really ought to look at the teams every couple minutes and make a plan for the next fight, but sometimes I'm tired and my contribution as the tank/bruiser will just be to wade in and try to kill a carry. Most of the time, it's better to not give the enemy carries an easy time killing you; either get on them and destroy them, or stay at the front line and make them work for the damage they do to you, while you peel and tank all 5 enemies.\n-Not tracking objectives. I have fairly good dragon control, but I still occasionally forget it when other things are going on. More of a problem when the rest of the team goes to farm top while our 5th dragon is spawning, which will happen pretty often if you're constantly telling them when it's gonna spawn.\n-Limited champion pool. Sure, usually easy to dodge when this becomes a problem, but I at least need to pick up an AP jungler for the games with Zed mid and Nasus top or w/e.","replies":[{"poster":"slipstreem","date":"2015-04-09T04:30:12.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddle, Sejuani, and Amumu are all fairly easy to pick up but with sejuani frequently banned right now, I suggest learning fiddle and getting used to red trinket and carrying pinks around to sweep out the areas you want to ult from.

She is TONS of fun in the jungle right now and a really safe clear.  \n\nAnother really fun off meta pick is jungle poppy as your damage to champs will be pretty mixed between magic and physical even if you build full AD(your Q/tri-force procs do the bonus damage as magic damage I believe) and Poppy is amazing when the enemy team only has 1-2 threats on their team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-04-09T04:17:00.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
