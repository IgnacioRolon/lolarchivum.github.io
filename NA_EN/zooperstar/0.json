They aren't a guaranteed drop, but you have a chance of earning them anytime a key fragment might have dropped for you. They replace the key fragment, but also give fragments themselves so it's a pretty good trade off. With that being said, once you've accumulated your 12 fragments for the cycle, you won't be getting fragment or capsule drops until they refresh.","replies":[]}]}
