It's that simple. Everyone knows it. Who doesn't? You keep it in mind when you face an Anivia in lane. It's like knowing LeBlanc has insane damage at lvl 2, so you avoid her and keep a distance as soon as she hits 2. You can't let Rito point everything out to everyone; part of the experience with LoL is to memorize these things, and \"learn the game\"... Don't be that Zed that tries to duel with me at lvl 3, and upon dying and Anivia egging, call out \"Lame!\". Part of climbing the ladder (in other words, becoming better at the game) is to learn, know, and memorize each champion. You can't just put a label to everything in the game.

It's that simple. Everyone knows it. Who doesn't? You keep it in mind when you face an Anivia in lane. It's like knowing LeBlanc has insane damage at lvl 2, so you avoid her and keep a distance as soon as she hits 2. You can't let Rito point everything out to everyone; part of the experience with LoL is to memorize these things, and \"learn the game\"...

It also costs a decent amount of gold and costs an item slot that in most cases could be better spent on a more effective item. Flash is arguably the most effective summoner spell, especially for immobile champs, so 9 times out of 10 people are going to take it. It doesn't even compare to something like the egg.\n\nPlease keep in mind that this game needs to be fun for everyone, not just fun for you to play cheese champs and roflstomp on low elos. If you're going to whine and complain about giving Anivia a particle, then you need to take literally every other particle out of the game in order for it to be fair.\n\nEgg baits are only a part of Anivia's style because she doesn't HAVE a particle. It's not what makes her unique, there are tons of other \"bait\" champs out there, as you yourself have mentioned. IMO the only people pulling \"bait\" plays like this are ones that CAN'T burst a carry from 100-0 with a single rotation which is on a relatively short cooldown. \n\nIn the case of Voli baits, you basically just have to burst him hard enough. It's possible to kill him through the regen, and any grevious wounds item will counter it. You can counter voli's passive with an item's passive ability which, if his passive is proccing, has already applied it's debuff to him.\n\nZac's baits split him into four relatively weak pieces, totalling 48% of his health, and REDUCING his resistances.\n\nStarting at level 12, Anivia GAINS resistances in egg form, and has 100 PERCENT of her natural health. Not only can she do crazy burst damage, but you have to kill her, at which point she gets a full health bar again and added armor and MR and you have to kill her AGAIN, and if you don't you can bet that 6 seconds later she's going to pop up and destroy you with a q-e combo.\n\nAnivia's \"egg baits\" are overtuned.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Preymster","date":"2016-02-10T12:45:52.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i think this is a great idea. but since its a giant gameplay element that she works around it should only be visible to her teammates.\n\ni think you could EASILY get away with replacing the ult indicator on her icon in-game with an egg icon that fills when her passive is on cooldown. her ult is on a 6 second cooldown already and i cant really imagine an actual need to worry about when her ult is up. in most cases im worried that she doesnt have mana.\n\nit would give much needed clarity to her team, especially the jungler when he goes to gank middle lane because they can work around her passive as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2016-02-10T09:11:34.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say yes, just give her a small buff for lower Elos in return.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirWoofy","date":"2016-02-09T17:17:16.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"While this would be helpful to a lot of players, it would be a nerf to anivia.
