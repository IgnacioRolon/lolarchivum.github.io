Bought the skin, got a massive error pop-up. Checked to see that, the skin&#039;s unavailable but RP WAS deduced from my account. Do I own the skin or not? It&#039;s hard to tell, even though the shop says I do but it&#039;s unavailable when I click on Miss Fortune. :o","replies":[{"poster":"Riot TuxedoBear","date":"2015-07-30T03:25:24.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Krys Teare Star, I'll look into this and see what I can find. In the meantime, go ahead and submit a ticket with Player Support so that we can track the progress of the issue and make sure other players aren't having the same problem. We'll do our best to have you strutting your way back to the Rift with the Captain as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2015-07-31T02:02:09.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It turns out I do own the skin, fortunately.
