The only reason Soraka&#039;s been so out of hand is due to Grievous Wounds no longer affecting her healing for her allies, and Windspeaker Blessing adding to this frustration. As such, Soraka has received nerfs after nerfs. A lot of them, but they make sense due to how Grievous Wounds functions now. There&#039;s no possible way of making Soraka healthy without Grievous Wounds to put her in check.\n\nIf Grievous Wounds does go back to its old functionality, however, Soraka will feel ***HORRIBLE*** to play as. The HoT provided by Starcall will be minimal, her nerfed heals will be much weaker, and her ult will be shut down since Wish no longer removes Grievous Wounds beforehand being applied. I love Soraka a lot, and I miss playing her to my heart&#039;s content.

A simple auto attack will keep the debuff on everyone. This will reduce a single champions overall effectiveness by 40% on top of the many nerfs over the past several months.\n\nMost people agree Soraka was in a good spot before the Grievous Wounds change. Below or around 50% win rate. This is because I feel ignite (GW) alone and her old kit from a year ago were balanced because there was counter play.\n\nI understand why Riot would nerf and rework her to such an extent due to the Grievous Wounds change. I dont understand why Riot would then revert the change several months later but not revert the numerous nerfs that were because of the change in the first place.\n\nI want Soraka to be balanced so I can play her again to my hearts content... but this feels like a bait and switch.

Which would not only empower her healing, but also empower her ally's self-healing, be it their own kit, Bloodthirster, Heal, etc.\n\nWell think about it, it can only be applied to one target at a time.  Keeping that in mind, lets look at Bronze and Silver players, a Soraka player at this tier will not be utilizing Rejuvenation effectively.  At the same time, no one would be buying Executioners calling anyway, they didn't before and they won't now.  So this effect on the majority of the games population would be balanced and in the majority of cases, just downright useless.  However, a player that knows how to utilize an Executioners, or Morello would be displaying a level of knowledge higher than average player.  On the same coin a Soraka player knowing how to minimize the effectiveness of GW would be showing qualities of higher elo play.  \n\nNow looking at Gold to Plat, you can expect people to be purchasing GW consistently, you can also expect that a Soraka player will be able to position well, and manage her Rejuvenation heals better.  Also keep in mind that Rejuvenation only lasts for 4 seconds, and Mortal Reminder applies it for 5 seconds.  Treating it as immunity to the effect of GW, not the application, if Soraka were to change her healing focus, it would leave an ally vulnerable.  Which in turn could give the enemy team opportunities to take advantage of a Soraka changing targets.  Or missing a Starfall (Q) as she won't be pumping out any Rejuvenation heals for at most 5 seconds.  Also, since her healing is focused more on Rejuv, it will require Soraka to build more AP than she needs to currently, since her base scaling on heals won't be as high/bursty with minimal AP.  Forcing her to delay tanky items, and in general be less tanky.  And this will become one of her weaknesses as being less tanky will leave her more open to being dove and killed.  A tactic that higher elo players are proficient at.  \n\nAlso, GW immunity does NOT prevent someone from being bursted, and with Rejuv focused healing, a Soraka would not be able to out heal, say, an assassin's burst on their ADC.\n\ntl;dr\nSoraka's balance will be determined at each level of elo. Bronze players that don't manage Rejuvenation well, can still do fine as it is less likely to be a mistake that the enemy will capitalize on, where counter-play would be GW.  Diamond players however, will be able to capitalize on and take advantage of Soraka's mistakes, making counter-play advantageous, or focusing the Soraka.  Forcing the Soraka player to manage her Rejuvenation correctly, as well as knowing which ally will need the GW immunity, while keeping herself at a safe distance.  This creates a skill curve that follows the progression of skill within the game, which create an exceedingly well balanced champion.  An example of this would be Azir, or Kindred.  :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dessem","date":"2016-04-13T09:41:20.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer the 15% movement speed, since it helps me trade better and provides peel for the ADC whenever I heal them in the form of movement speed... and I already slowed the enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2016-04-13T09:44:02.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like it much personally, because it encourages Soraka to interact with the enemy team less.

However.  I think with the return of GW cleanse from her ultimate, and implementing a few of my ideas might help create a balanced state of play for her.  \n\nMy ideas are the following;\n\n* Buffing her rejuvenation mechanic while slightly reducing base healing from her Astral Infusion (W).\n* If she heals a target while she has rejuvenation, it not only applies the HoT (Heal over Time) effect to the healed target, but also makes them immune to GW for the duration of the rejuvenation (only applicable to Rejuvenation applied with Astral Infusion (W) and limited to one target at a time).  \n* In addition to giving her ultimate GW cleanse, you may consider giving her ultimate 20-25% higher base heal, and replace the increased heal for being under 40% health with a Rejuvenation effect to all allies healed under 40% health.\n\nShifting focus towards her Rejuvenation mechanic, takes the focus away some of the burst healing that has been making Soraka such a large issue.   Turning her into a more sustain oriented healer.  In affect, by applying immunity to grievous wounds to, say an ADC with lifesteal, the lack of burst healing from her kit would not mean that crucial targets couldn't heal themselves with her extra indirect sustain utility.  \nAlso, by adding more focus to her rejuvenation mechanic, it creates a complexity within her kit/design, that would separate mediocre Soraka players from great ones.  Creating a curve that would self-balance her throughout multiple different levels of elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"lildyo","date":"2016-04-13T09:08:27.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iE8Gjkmu,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-13T08:22:41.768+0000)\n>\n> She might, not at the same time the reversion goes out though (it's looking very likely at this point we'll go with that change).
