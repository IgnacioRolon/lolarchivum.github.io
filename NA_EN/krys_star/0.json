I've been kicked out of League twice now in the past week, with the message saying that someone else has logged into my account from another computer. I've never shared my account with anyone, as far as I know I don't have any keyloggers so I don't know what to think.\n\nI just recently changed my password, but I'm worried Riot will see this and think it's suspicious activity (sharing account, etc.) and that's the last thing I want since I just got back into League in the past month and I primarily play Ranked.\n\nWhat sucks is this forced me to dodge champion select right as the game was about to begin, which incurred LP loss and a 30m dodge timer. Should I be worried for my account's safety and possible actions taken by Riot? Pls no :(","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T23:53:33.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eeeee that's no good!
