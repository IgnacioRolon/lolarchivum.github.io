It almost clashes with their Arcade versions, almost, and the two already have way too many skins as it is. There are many more champions who could&#039;ve benefited from the skin line: Sivir, Karma, Lissandra, Taliyah, Leona, Sona and hell, even Taric.\r\n\r\nBut from the bottom of my heart, thanks! I was just telling myself a few days ago I&#039;d probably never buy another skin from Riot, since the latest skins aren&#039;t appealing to me at all, but this did it. Now I have to buy three of these.

This was a common discussion among us in development.","replies":[{"poster":"Krys Star","date":"2017-08-10T23:35:28.566+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It just feels like Miss Fortune was a redundant choice for the skin line. She's already got the magical adventure, hearts and stars and vivid colors going on in Arcade Miss Fortune. Same with Ahri. I'm honestly lowkey livid that you guys chose Ahri for the legendary and not Soraka, the ***STAR CHILD.*** Ahri may deserve a legendary, but not of Star Guardian's variety. That solely belongs to Soraka imo.\n\nPotential was wasted on Ahri and Miss Fortune when it could've gone to so many: Karma, Leona, Sivir, Taliyah, Irelia (launching star orbits at your enemies for your ult!), Taric, Sejuani, Lissandra and even Vi.\n\nI don't mean to come off aggressive, but it's just really aggravating how much Riot caters to Ahri. Her balance condition, her inclusion in skin lines. I understand you guys are doing this as a marketing strategy because of how much people love Ahri and how well her skin generally sells, but it just feels unfair for many, many champions who barely have more than three skins, some two.","replies":[{"poster":"2ManyJons","date":"2017-08-11T14:19:13.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would have loved more than anything to have had a Star Guardian Leona. And Raka did deserve the legend skin on this one, not Ahri.\n\nAs far as MF goes, I think her Arcade skin does bright pink and sparkles better than her Star Guardian will. Even though it looks super cool.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2017-08-08T22:50:55.611+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ezreal annoys me.
