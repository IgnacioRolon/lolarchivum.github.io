Typically these bugsplats mean that some game file crapped out on you, and the client didn't know how to handle it which caused the actual bugsplat. Usually, a repair should do the trick, so if it happens again try that and test it in a custom game if you're able to!","replies":[{"poster":"TTK Dreadnought","date":"2017-11-20T06:55:52.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, what really hurts is that even though the client repairs itself, LeaverBuster isnt set up to track if that's an issue. You cant track the difference between an AFK or an accidental loss of connection, but when the client repairs itself, its annoying that it counts because thats my primary issue for my DCs. had to sit through ten 20min queue timers this week because of bugsplats causing me to not load the game in time and my team decides to remake and i get slapped for it.","replies":[]}]}]}
