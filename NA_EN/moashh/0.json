I can here what's going on and all, but i can,t click anything or move. I've tried to uninstal-re-instal, i've used the hextech repair tool and all the simple stuff. Can someone tell me if i have to delet some files or do something special.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-06T17:40:38.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black screen can happen if a connection issue is struggling to download game assets.  Reinstalling in this case wouldn't do a whole lot because it focuses on game files, and not your connection.  Instead, I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot whatever is blocking you from accessing the game server.
