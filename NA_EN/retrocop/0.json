If NA and EU teams try to play top tier picks against them, they're just going to get rolled over constantly because they know those match ups inside and out. \n\nNA and EU's best bet are to play as many pocket picks as they can to force them to adapt out of Korea and China's comfort zone because they simply will not win in a standard match up. It's not about top tier as its more about making the opposing team uncomfortable. NA and EU won't ever win using just top tier picks. It's just as simple as that. \n\nPerfect example is support Zyra: her win rate is insane at worlds right now, but that's because she's such a different outside pick most players don't know how to handle her. She by no means is OP, pros just haven't gotten a handle on realizing she's literally the squishiest champion in the entire game coupled with zero mobility. \n\nBut you bet that once team start to understand her weaknesses, she will fade before worlds is over. Even now we're seeing some of the problems of picking Zyra, if there's a Syndra on the other team, Zyra is basically a free kill. If there's hard engage upon hard engage, it's a free kill. Hecarim and Rumble combo would have a field day on an enemy Zyra, but its just a matter of time and experimenting for the teams playing at worlds.

When they both stomped strong teams in quarters? \n\nYou're telling me that Samsung Galaxy is on the same level as H2K at a mechanical level after the absolute curb stomping they've done the past few weeks? Yes H2K has won all their games in the same time frame but it was no where near the same dominating fashion Samsung has put forward and it was against arguable more impressive teams than H2K did theirs against. Tell me more about how I have no idea what I'm talking about. \n\nH2K also stomped in quarters, but it was hands down against the weakest team of the group, it means little to nothing. \n\nI'm more surprised that you'd even try to make an argument for Korea not being better than every region when they have three teams in the semi-finals compared to EU's 1 team and NA's 0 teams. In addition to that, last year's pathetic showing by NA and EU as well in comparison's to Korea's region have equally as much of a stranglehold over the play off back then. \n\nI REALLY like you to tell me just how Korea isn't a dominant region over every other region in the world, because there really isn't a legitimate way you can explain that. The proof is in the pudding. All three of their teams are still in the running for championship. \n\nNot to take away from H2K's success, they're definitely a solid team and deserve to be where they are with the way they played in week two and against ANX, they've played insanely well the past few weeks, but when it comes to playing Korea's team, they MIGHT have a chance v.s. Samsung if they show up poorly, but whoever wins in ROX v.s. SKT's match up will slaughter H2K with ease. \n\nKorea is arguable the toughest region at this tournament and unfortunately, H2K has no experience v.s. any Korean team yet this world and they played against ANX who was the weakest link coming into the quarter finals. That's not bias, ANX themselves knew they were the weakest link and said their best chance of making it to semi was through H2K, the second weakest link. \n\nIt's not even close. SKT is a near perfect team in every aspect of LoL, ROX is just barely behind them in that regard. Never mind considering Samsung's team. \n\nAs for China, I said to a some lesser extent. EG and RNG are both teams that recognized as powerhouses from their respective region, however EU and NA are definitely capable of holding their own v.s. China. But on any given day, anyone with an unbiased opinion would take RNG and EG over any team from EU or NA, barring MAYBE TSM (And that's a big maybe).

Your ability to judge team's strength is abysmal. You think that SKT, Rox or SSG are in semis because their players dominate other teams on mechanical level? Have you even watched SKT in the past? SKT is nowhere near as good, as they used to be a year ago. Bengi mechanical prowess was never that great, he's a smart jungler and also he was always Faker's third summoner spell, that's why he's still in the roster. Blank is better mechanically but doesn't understand map as good as Bengi. Duke is a good top laner, but he's not a monster when it comes to mechanical skill. In those three Korean teams there are FOUR players that are amazing mechanically, and that's Smeb, Peanut, Bang and Faker (and Gorilla to some extent). That's it. To win games you need a good understanding of a macro game and Korean players have always been the best at that, and that's the reason they're winning. SSG are at worlds, even though KT, Jin Air, Longzhu and even Afreeca have better players when it comes to mechanical prowess. And China? Just look at LGD, and how they played throughout the year. So yeah, you saying, that mechanical skill of individual players is the reason for Koreans winning, is a proof, that you don't have idea about how the game is played. And I can tell you haven't even touched an LPL game this year, but you speak of an unbiased opinions. What's your \"unbiased\" opinion based on? A wild guess? Stop pretending you know anything about that region - most of their games are a clusterfuck, and the better teamfighting team wins. And it just happens, that EDG has the best understanding of the macro game in LPL and so they dominated the split. RNG you saw in games with TSM was an aberration I tell you. They NEVER play map that good. Never.\nAnyway, you can't just put 5 mechanically gifted players together and expect them to win with ease. Times have changed and it's not about outplaying your opponent 1v1, sometimes it's not even about winning a teamfight after teamfight. It's about playing the map better. \n\nAlso, when it comes to mechanical skill of western players vs Asian, you can go and see how they ranked during bootcamp in Korea, this year and 2 years ago. Solo queue is the place where most mechanically gifted players sit on top, and you'd probably be surprised, that a lot of Korean pros are in D1 or D2 in Korea, and those players are usually the ones that aren't as great mechanically (like Bengi).","replies":[{"poster":"Leon Etoile","date":"2016-10-19T04:30:33.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, SKT's both junglers suck but look better due to their teams macro play.
