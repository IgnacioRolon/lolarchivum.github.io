Shoot us a quick [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting us know that you're okay with Swain being removed from this account. \n\nI'm curious though, which parts of the rework don't you like? I've got some opinions myself but I still can't quite decide if I prefer this over the old style. Gotta admit this new look is sweet though xD","replies":[{"poster":"Gipsy Rogue","date":"2018-01-26T06:28:01.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want it too :/\n\nWhy? I like UNIQUE champs,  my fav champs actually are:\n\n{{champion:22}} - Her story about how she becomes on queen of Freljord i love it, is not like if she was looking it from beggin, in fact, she was the less favourite, but she was getting popularity even when Sejuani was stronger and Lissandra was the heiress to the Freljord throne.\n\n{{champion:89}} - She is awesome, and I think who she want to be in peace with Diana, is strong and was love at first sight.\n\nthis ones are my fav champs actually, and Swain use to have a place close to they, in fact actually (untill rework) I love him.\n\n{{champion:50}} - Was a common man, who out of nowhere, to take the command of Noxus, in regular Noxus terms, he should be dead, but he knows to play his cards and won.\n\nand is not just the story, each of this character have something about his design and skills very unique. Swain dont gonna have anymore Beatrix and he is not gonna transform in a giant humanoid crow, he gonna loose that part because now, he is half demon, what if we remove Tibbers from Annie? can we call that our beloved dark child? what if remove the rage in Tryndamere R. \n\nBut well... lets gonna say who I accept all this champ, what he got?\n\nStacks? - {{champion:203}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:412}} \n\nNew Q? - Is not anymore strategic, where is our master tactician is just spam damage like {{champion:103}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}}  and almost any other mage. And dont forget about the Starwars Emperor Im really tired of see Starwars in any place -.-\n\nNew W? - is a bad version of SauronÂ´s Eye, bad because is slow, and you dont get any of use it, you ll gonna be spending mana in JG to see if you find someone in an specific point?\n\nNew E? - This is Zoe but with Stun is not Swain, MY Swain our Swain.\n\nNew R? Yeh... I guess who he still does same than before, but chage it to a demon instead of a crow and just  wings instead of a full transformation... just feel like another generic mage of any MMO.\n\nand the worst is who he looks like Vladimir but a litle older.\n\n\nI dont want a refund, I just dont want the champ, see it there, in my pool champ... gonna be painfull, see what he becomes, and remember what he use to be, and dont know -.- is not my Master Tactician anymore just another Saruman, another Merlin, just left put him the iconic hat of mage to make it complete .\n\n\nPD: Sorry for my bad english","replies":[]}]}]}
