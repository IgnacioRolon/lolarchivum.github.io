From what i found in a Google search, that error indicates a motherboard software issue, BUT this error has ONLY happened when i play League. I played Civ6 for 5 hours the other week and this issue didn't happen once. \r\n\r\nI do have Windows 10; i can post specific device details when i get home.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T02:12:06.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my research as well, it points towards a driver or hardware issue.
