However, this does not hold up when one actually looks at the Noxian champions.\n\nLet's list the champions from Noxus (or affiliated with the nation at some point) real quick:\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:8}} \n\nNotice a similarity between them? \n\nOn one had, the varyious champion lores indicate that many of these champions rose from humble beginnings to become respected mass murderers (Swain, Darius, Draven, Riven, SInged, etc.), but if background truly doesn't matter, where are the nonhuman, or even non-white Noxians? It would be one thing if Noxus was *just* a city where everyone happened to look the same (unlikely), but Noxus has military and political influence over much of runeterra. If the Roman empire easily incorporated Gauls, Africans, Persians, and other various peoples into their armies, why can't Noxus? Otherwise, Noxus comes across just like the Empire from Star Wars, just with more women.\n\nAll i'm saying is if Demacia can have {{champion:78}}, {{champion:102}}, and {{champion:5}}  to break up the monotony, it would be nice to see the same from Noxus. Maybe someone who looks Ionian? A creature whose species is from Targon?  Heck, why not a Yordle?! I'd love to read about a yordle who somehow ends up in the Noxus military.\n\nPS: It is nice to see Noxus give so many opportunities to the disabled ({{champion:69}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:6}} )","replies":[{"poster":"Sneak Dog","date":"2014-12-12T16:47:26.395+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noxus is actually quite xenophobic.

They can still climb up in rank as such is the Noxian ideal. Anyone can work their way up if they are strong (or rather, competent).\n\nThe roman empire just assimilated any other country in their empire and stole anything from their culture they thought useful to have. I don't think it's entirely fair to compare Noxus and Rome honestly, they are very different.\n\nI'd like Noxus to be portrayed a bit more like 'strength above all' (though really it's more like 'competence above all' I believe, ah well) and less evil and honourless.

And mind you that while Draven made a sport/show out of the killing, he wasn't \"killing for sport\". He was killing because those were his orders/duty (as a soldier and later on as an executioner) and he made a show out of it to become famous.\n\nAlso, as a small side note - he actually gave those prisoners a chance, compared to what they would have with regular executioners.

He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it. \n\nChaotic neutral characters like to indulge in everything. This is the insurgent, the con-man, gambler, and high roller; the uncommitted freebooter seeking nothing more than self-gratification. This type of character will at least consider doing anything if they can find enjoyment or amusement. Life has meaning, but theirs has the greatest meaning. According to chaotic neutrals, laws and rules infringe on personal freedom and were meant to be broken. This character is always looking for the best deal, and will work with good, neutral, or evil to get it; as long as he comes out of the situation on top. The chaotic neutral is constantly teetering between good and evil, rebelling, and bending the law to fit his needs. \n\n**The following actions are honorable for this alignment:**\nDirty Fighting\nFleeing a battle that's obviously going poorly\nGloating over a victory\nPerpetrate humiliating prank on enemy\nRefusing a fair contest/challenge\nTaunting an enemy into fighting\nWalking away from a challenge\n\n**The following actions are dishonorable for this alignment:**\nAllowing a disarmed enemy to pick up his weapon\nAllowing the enemy to attack first\nBeing taken prisoner\nKilling a host who has provided you food or shelter\nRefusing medical treatment for the good of the party\nSurrendering\nTreason\"\n\nMost of that *SCREAMS* Draven.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2014-12-12T20:17:20.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fair enough; i stand corrected. alignments seem to be tricky and open to interpretation","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2014-12-12T16:29:09.303+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed is from Zaun, not Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2014-12-12T16:34:03.405+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LungDrakkar,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=XRwK8x2G,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-12-12T16:29:09.303+0000)\n> Singed is from Zaun, not Noxus.\n\nyou know something, i told him that but he just ulted and ran under his turret and spammed laugh at me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aeolian Melodies","date":"2014-12-12T21:57:38.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But he works and fights for Noxus, that's like saying that Xin Zhao isn't Demacian because he was not born there.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSunNocturne","date":"2014-12-12T22:10:25.784+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aeolian Melodies,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=XRwK8x2G,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2014-12-12T21:57:38.978+0000)\n> But he works and fights for Noxus, that's like saying that Xin Zhao isn't Demacian because he was not born there.\n\nSinged is from Zaun and works for whoever pays him, Noxus is paying him nicely.

It's more of a community construct that didn't want the portrayal of Noxus and Demacia to be so black and white. I guess it caught up.","replies":[{"poster":"Xulsigae","date":"2014-12-13T23:24:19.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I get that, but I think it's unfair to say that merely because Demacia is a monarchy and can be strict with its laws it is somehow worse than a place than Noxus, which has public executions as entertainment, champions that espouse killing for fun, is built in the shape of a skull etc. Some how being claimed to be a meritocracy (which it doesn't really show well because there is nobility in it and only those with the strength to kill seem to rise) erases all that. A monarchy isn't automatically bad, see King Arthur and King Boomy and Queen Ashe and such. More a problem of Riot's writing than Demacia.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Matezoide","date":"2014-12-12T22:53:24.804+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot: Noxians arent the bad guys, guys!\n\n\n*Proceeds to write Noxians as bad guys every single time*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-12-13T17:31:13.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Political Correctness doesn't scream \"NOXUS\" to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2014-12-13T23:20:26.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"true, but IN THEORY, they're 'Equal Opportunity'","replies":[{"poster":"Wheatloaf","date":"2014-12-13T23:39:46.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Equal opportunity, sure, but you have to fight for your opportunity, and I have a feeling Noxian immigration policy is something along the lines of \"If you can make it past our borders without dying, welcome to Noxus!\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Der Lindwurm","date":"2014-12-12T19:38:03.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"With the way the lore is currently, you've got to love how Morgana decries Kayle's tyranny but then sides with the most tyrannical faction on Runeterra.","replies":[{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2014-12-12T19:44:42.648+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"who even knows what Morgana's and Kayle's lore is right now","replies":[]}]}]}
