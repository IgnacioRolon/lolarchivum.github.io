I feel that will cause headaches.\n\nWhat's that?  Bad DM stories?  Oh yes, I have one of those.\n\nWe were playing a game with a new DM, and we should have known something was going on when he brought _every. single. source. book._ to the table.  Like, ones I'd never heard of - obscure 4th edition books with very niche spell lists and prestige classes.  Our group, who had played a little bit before, was significantly more laid back than that, and created a fairly tame party of non-min-maxed characters.  The fun for us was in roleplaying, after all - not being a super-obscure psyonic-ninja from the plane of brokenness.\n\nThe game started, and we were looking to get our airship ready to fly (simple search and rescue mission) - but apparently we needed some hirelings to crew the ship fully.  Oh, what a mistake that was.  I was the captain of the ship, so we went to the local guild to interview possible recruits and, I kid you not, there was only one available person to hire.  No-one else.  Only this one kobold warlock with a personality problem.  Despite disliking his attitude, we roll with it and hire him.  Off to adventure!\n\nBut no, this GM-run NPC then proceeds to override every command his captain gives him, and dominates every fight and encounter.  He's got a bit of 'Pun-Pun' in his DNA so to speak, and while we're doing respectable lv1 amounts of damage in a fight, he's one-shotting things on an 8+ to hit roll.\n\nFinally, I ORDER this kobold to stay with the ship, 1 mile out of range, while the rest of the party goes on on foot.  I tell him in no uncertain terms that if he disobeys this order, I will bind and gag him, and throw him off the ship no matter where we happen to be at the time.\n\nWe get to the clearing where the captives are being held, and the fight goes badly.  It's a tough fight, but there are two of our party still conscious and there's a non-zero chance that our desperate plan to outwit the enemies will succeed!\n\nWhen all of a sudden, the airship comes screaming into the clearing (note - airships don't scream) with the kobold stood on the prow, firing bolts of killing magic at all the enemies, wiping them all out in one turn.  Our DM turns to us, thinking that we'll view his kobold NPC as a hero.  Instead, I order the first mate to bind, gag, and toss out the kobold onto the ground, as promised.\n\nWe didn't play with that DM again, after that. :(","replies":[{"poster":"SSJTribe","date":"2015-12-07T21:17:01.300+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is amazing!

Fate Core (by Evil Hat) comes to my mind, but also things like Apocalypse World, or Trollbabe.\n\nRequired time investment can also vary a lot: a D&D campaign usually goes on for at least a few months, playing weekly for 3-4 hours.

While I mostly played characters there was one game where another person on the forum needed someone to help them run the game and so I volunteered. My partner was more of the person behind the counter setting up the puzzles and plot while I was the retail clerk that played the role of making things fun and nudging them along through the puzzles while playing my own character. \n\nApparently a lot of folks thought I stole the show a lot, but not in a bad way but in an entertaining kind of way. My role actually ended up being my most remembered one out of all the games we played on the forum. Now that picture up above has renditions of all the characters that were in the game, can you guess which ones mine? The two rabbits. My best and most remembered role is that of two computer AI's that represented themselves as lovestruck rabbits based on King Arthur characters. Not my most dramatic characters, not my serious ones, but my goofy antagonistic duo.\n\nMan I'm actually tearing up remembering that game... that was a fun time for me.\n\nEDIT: If anyone is interested in seeing what we got up to in the game, I also actually copied the entire thing from the forum to some google documents after we finished it.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1JKQd9s2CXRdkQOF8K8HmxuW7BC5-m2QlktL_Bh3vVPc/edit","replies":[{"poster":"Siachi","date":"2015-12-09T07:14:03.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp I read through pretty much the whole thing in one night; I did like how you played the characters, though not sure how to explain why.

Or maybe they just remind me of the dancing couple from Majora's Mask (Sky is literally falling around them, they're too busy being lovestruck to notice at all).\n\nObviously, I'm reading through it after everything's said and done, and since I'm not used to these kind of games, I had the expectancy of some overall, finite resolution. But I guess with how these games are, things could have turned out much differently (Character [A] deciding to behave in a different way, the characters failing to solve puzzles, or they just flat out do something completely unrelated to the plot and drive things off the rails).

I wanna join in!\n\nDuring my first serious 4e D&D sessions, everything before hand was either small snippets or joke campaigns, we started in this desert town, mining away in the caves beneath looking for anything valuable to sell to fund our poor lives, until we come across this sealed in cave with a tower in the middle. After we dispatch some local monsters, we decide to enter this dark tower.\n\nOnce we enter, we see bookcases everywhere, as we treaded upon a creaky wooden floor. Almost all of us ascend up the staircase across the room, save for the assassin, who just checks out the books. The rest of us rise up the stairs to find this Hectagonal Crystal... and the first thing our minotaur fighter does is touch the thing. One second later, we all end up in a dimension full of ash with nothing but darkness... except for the Assassin.\n\nOur assassin ascends up the stairs a tad later, seeing nothing but the dust and our footprints leading up to this crystal. So like any other sane person, he touches it and we all reappear from this Ash Dimension. The assassin decieded to keep his finger on the crystal however, so seconds after our Minotaur and Elf ran from the room, we're all transported back to the ash place. \n\nThey decide not to touch the crystal but to wrap it up and carry it with them, as they climb out the window. As they approach the tunnel we came in from, they heard the sound of crashing wood, and a giant black demon starts to emerge from the tower, and chase after them through the tunnel. Our minotaur carrying the crystal survives but the elf is grabbed and is tugged back to the creature from the tower. The minotaur gets back to base, traumatized from all this.\n\nAfter a while, with many people asking where the rest of the group went, they ask about the crystal. Knowing not what it does, the minotaur asks if there is anyone around this city who could figure it out. Turns out a wizard known as Bromash (pronounced Bro-mosh) lives somewhat nearby, and should be able to figure this crystal out. So the minotaur departs to find this wizard.\n\nWinding the crowded streets, he finds the corridor that leads to the wizards house. Unfortunately, this area is stalked and watch by bandits, who leap down, all 9 of them, and proceed to attack him. He puts up a honorable fight, but he is pushed to the ground, and is then executed by this Halfling rouge. Sad death.\n\nThankfully, our DM plans well, and in the event of his death, a group of people living nearby rush out to scavenge the remains. Why the bandits didn't take any of it, we don't know. The people proceed to touch the crystal, teleporting all of us back to reality. We ask what happened, and they recount to us the story. After planning a bit, we go outside, and fight the very same bandits who killed our friend. We bury his remains and say a few words, but we eventually move on to the Wizard. \n\nWe finally meet up with the wizard, Bromash, who turns out to be this Half-Orc, who sells this measly looking trinkets. He acts and looks like a normal street merchant, really fat and unimpressive, until we drop the crystal on the table and ask what it is. He immediately drops his act, and tells us of someone who pays well for things like this. Liking the sound of getting paid, we agree to this plan he presented, but one thing remains amiss. To get to this guy, we need to cross the desert, avoiding the various bandits and sandworms. Bromash just points upward, revealing a giant ass ship, just hanging 200 feet above. \n\nWe proceed to board this ship, while Bromash rotates the crane towards a slope; our best chance of hitting the desert. He releases the lever, and with the wonderful magic of physics, we start sliding down a ramp, once used as a loading bay, now full of shacks and merchants, making various Skill Checks along the way to keep things from falling apart, or us falling off. We all get creative with what we have, but our Paladin who was proficient with History, Religion, and Medicine hasn't a lot to work with. \n\nSo he does what any paladin does. He prays to his god, Bahummat, asking to keep him safe. He then proceeds to get hit by an entire building, taking 38 points of damage, knocking him prone. After the paladin getting healed, and then getting hit straight after again, we make it to the sands where we take off. We ride for a while, but night starts to fall and we anchor up near a flat sheet of rock. What happens the next morning is priceless. \n\nAfter we wake up, we feel tremors rising up, like many feet marching around. We look over the side of the ship to find A LOT of giant beetles marching around the ship, and soon climb up. We hear ruckus downstairs, Bromash dealing with his share of beetles, but we're soon overrun by beetles on top of the ship. We fight them off as well as we can, but more keep coming. We thought we were doomed, until we heard the door bust open. \n\nBromash, this man who we had thought to be a common enchanter, emerged in blood and fire, throwing out his trinkets, that we had thought were measly small pieces of bent metal. Turns out Bromash had enchanted these with various magical effects, our DM rolling a D20 for each trinkets effect. He starts chucking these with no regards, summoning random acid splashes, fire balls, magic missles, and a giant Crystal from the sky to assault these bugs, accidently hitting our paladin in the process. \n\nWe no longer questioned his magical ability. His trinkets have saved our lives many times over, from clearing a horde of snakes, to hurting us a bit, when a trinket gave this Giant Boss a fire aura around him. Sadly, we soon returned back to the ash dimension, against our free will, and try to figure a way out. We find a giant temple, with a blood ooze who kills our Assassin, and a bunch of puzzles. We split up, which ends up being our deaths, to do two different puzzles. Bromash, the hamadryad (me!), the orc and one other person I forget, decide to enter the maze room.\n\nThis complex maze room was well made by the DM. Tiles on the floor were watched by Owl statues that dropped the tiles if you crossed their gaze. I find out a small path to follow, sooner or later, and realize we need to rotate statues to open up new paths. I ask our Orc, who was still near the door, to move to his left to try and turn one. The Orc was really dumb, and his player roleplayed him well too, so when I asked him to go left, he didn't stop when he reached the Owl Statue, because I had never specified to. So, he drops down into a pit filled with bones, and 7 carrion crawlers.\n\nUnable to get him out, our paladin and Bromash jump down to help him. The Hamadryad stays on top because shes ranged. The fight was meant to be with a full party, and since we had split up, it ended really badly. The orc and Paladin die right after each other, leaving Bromash along with 6 Carrion Crawlers. So he does what anyone who's doomed does. He slowly wraps his string of trinkets, 30 of them, and proceeds to crush them under his foot, releasing a devastating explosion that kills anyone who was down there. \n\nOur DM was so sad with this. He loved making Bromash, and his trinket shenanigans, his personality, so we held a moment of silence. We ended that session there out of respect.  RIP BROMASH.

Love these.\n\nBest time I ever had was doing a Iron Kingdoms Campaign (steampunk high sorcery, so flintlocks and magic, really fun and based on 3.5), and really messed with the party's head.\n\nSo I had them looking through some old tunnels below this town, trying to figure out where a bunch of undead were coming from.  Was a lull in the combat, more of an exploration thing.  As they were exploring, there were the large alcoves off to the side of the tunnel they were traversing, so their rogue decided to take a peek inside.\n\nLooking inside, there were skeletons that were just piled up on top of each other, had him make a spot check, and he noticed everyone had an amulet around their neck.  Being the thief he was, he went and snagged one, but when he picked it up, I asked him about his fortitude save (the one that was how well your body resisted physical stressers, like poison and disease).  Rolled behind the Screen and told him all was good, but there was some writing on the amulet.  One quick decipher script later and he was able to tell that it was an ancient language that said one word, \"Plague\".  Freaked the player right the hell out.\n\nWhen he went out to the rest of the party to tell them what was up, as soon as he was within talking distance, asked them all about their fort saves, wrote them down and rolled behind that lovely DM screen (it's a fantastic tool for any DM out there, being able to fudge the numbers so the story you're laying down for your players isn't botched by you rolling 5 20's in a row.  Had this happen to me before, and would've killed the whole damn party if I didn't fudge those numbers), and just told them \"carry on\".  \n\nSo there was some metagaming happening with the group, they were freaking out because they were all really low lvl, and the cleric didn't have access to detect disease, much less anything to cure it.  I also was feeding the paranoia a lot by rolling a handful of dice every minute or so in the backround, with slightly less dice each time.  They were pretty much rushing at this point, trying to get through these plague tunnels as fast as possible, while trying to keep a distance from each other.\n\nIt got so bad that the Gunslinger (Fighter/Sorcerer with gun only feats mechanically.) almost blew the Cleric's foot off, because they got too close to each other.\n\nOnce they explored the tunnels enough to know for sure that the undead problem wasn't coming from here, they went back to the Cleric they were working for and begged him to cleanse him from plague.  He cast his spells, and just looked at them funny and said \"What plague?  There's nothing wrong with you.\"\n\nSeeing their faces at this moment was priceless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silver Fluffenbu","date":"2015-12-08T05:12:16.171+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, you literally told the DM you would, as captain, throw him off your D&D crew if he continued with his kobold shenanigans; what else could he expect to happen? but I guess if he was the only DM recruit, you run the gamble of having a Braum DM+player","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2015-12-07T20:04:49.678+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, we tried it once.\n\nNever\nAgain","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2015-12-07T20:13:17.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is sometimes good to have an escort character.\n\nIf only just for your party to sacrifice them to Asmodeus.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-12-07T20:16:54.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it once.

You're like Jareth in Labyrinth (without the bulge, maybe).\n2. Always give yourself and the players an 'out'.  If they roll really terribly, but they've been playing awesomely, then sometimes it's ok to save them in a suitably cool way - but make them work for it.  If they get 'rescued' by an unexpected intervention when things seemed at their worst, then make them owe their rescuer a favor.  Use it as a plot hook later!\n3. Don't remove consequences from the game.  If your players do something properly stupid, then they should suffer the consequences - they've not got plot armor.\n4. If a player is mucking around too much, then try to find out why they're acting out.  Maybe they're bored?  Maybe they were hoping for a fight-heavy game, and the game is all political and they're trying to entertain themselves.  Maybe they just want a moment of comic relief after too much serious business.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Laereth","date":"2015-12-08T19:37:04.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=EM8oB9IO,comment-id=0000000000000000000100000000,timestamp=2015-12-08T04:31:47.087+0000)\n>\n> 1.
