When doing skin concepts we always try to flesh out our alternate-reality lore, whether it's a world where more champs ended up in Bildgewater or one in which they all attend school together, because it helps the designs feel cohesive and resonant.\n\n   \"How this motley crew met up and formed an alliance\"\n\nI think the clue here is in the name of Garen's skin. \"Rogue Admiral\" suggests that at one time he was an admiral, perhaps of a Demacian fleet, and that he has since abandoned that post to pursue more selfish interests. He probably stole a ship and set sail for Bildgewater where he then decided it was a Slaughtership Captain's life for him - enough to earn some decent coin but not attract the attention of anyone who might recognise him as a deserter. From there he assembled a crew with a few star characters; a corsair with a knack for harpooning and a pet bird that serves as a lookout for sea serpents, a sea hunter familiar with the seas around Bildgewater that swims as a living lure for the monsters of the deep (like in Waterworld!) and the newest addition, a hulking automaton that can handle the serpent carcasses and defend the crew at sea and in port dealings.\n\n    \"How this Garen runs his ship\"\n\nYou can see from the splash that these are some bad ass operators at the top of their game. You better believe they have their own private Bidgewater wharf, secret island base and probably know of a much dingier and more dangerous tavern than the one you go to.\n\nGaren is clearly in charge at port and on the sea, with his years of experience and rippling abs no one short-changes him and no one second-guesses him. He's in this for the money and the privacy that comes with running your own Slaughter ship (which he does better than most), but he looks out for his crew because he knows they are more valuable than just their raw talent. He probably explains to them that he's just 'protecting his investment' but I think in every alternate world Garen has a heart of gold.\n\nQuinn is probably the closest thing to a first mate on the ship. I think Garen trusts her intelligence and they're likely seen splitting a bottle of rum and swapping stories. She keeps the crew working hard as either she or Valor always has an eye on them, and when the time comes to harpoon a serpent she is the one that both literally and figuratively pulls the trigger. Being a lookout she's also probably entrusted with recruiting any promising candidates for their operation.\n\nAatrox was conceived as a character similar to Queequeg from Moby-Dick; a merman native to the region who has a remarkable ability to go fin to fin with the gigantic serpents and bring them to the surface. Many ships have harpoons and captains but Aatrox is a rare prize for the ship as he can dive deep and coax out rare and exotic serpents of enormous value - a fact that he uses to his advantage to avoid mundane duties in favour of star gazing and scrimshaw. I'm sure Garen isn't happy about it, but Aatrox has proven his loyalty many times by venturing off the boat and into Bildgewater to save his comrades.\n\n   \"Who built that Malphite?!\"\n\nMalphite is a welcome addition to the crew, providing the incredible raw power needed to haul larger serpents and dissuade would-be assailants. He is a magical automaton who hates swabbing decks and is suspected of keeping a pet wharf rat somewhere in his hull. I'd say Garen, seeing an empty spot in his crew, stockpiled gold for a year to commission the construction of this awesome strong-arm. As for who built him? It's true that a certain bildgerat has tinkered with similar mechanisms but considering it was Riot Earp that did the concept, and that Riot Earp also illustrates all of Zigg's game mode designs it might have been another yordle inventor?\n\nI'm really glad you are interested in knowing more. Skins 'lore' is nothing official but for our team it's really important and we talk about it all the time. When players notice little things we put in or really feel the story elements we weave into the designs it makes our day!","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-09-18T14:53:58.284+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically with this we know MORE about non-canon malphite than canon-malphite, amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-09-18T18:06:00.264+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Celio Hogane HD,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W1smZWIk,comment-id=00050003,timestamp=2015-09-18T14:53:58.284+0000)\n>\n> So basically with this we know MORE about non-canon malphite than canon-malphite, amazing.\n\nAnd you know more about cannon-malphite than non-cannon malphite :S","replies":[{"poster":"Celio Hogane HD","date":"2015-09-19T14:14:46.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok you won because iwas going to make that joke but i dedided it was too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icestar1186","date":"2015-09-18T18:19:48.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beat me to it, I see...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2015-09-18T15:29:35.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair, what's there to know about canon Malphite?

What other groups have a backstory to them? I'm curious about the playing card set.\n\nRiot Penguin worked on the 'House of Cards' set (he also pioneered Marauder/Warden) although I helped with the idea of a royal court. We were trying to figure out what, beyond card suit motifs, would give these skins appeal and character. I brought up the Knave of Hearts from the new Alice in Wonderland (played by one of my favourite actors Crispin Glover) and from there we hit upon the idea of a Medieval court where the various Game of Thrones style players are identified by the card corresponding with their level of influence/power. Their proximity to the throne in the splash art also reinforces this idea of who hold the power in this court.\n\nI've worked on a lot of the sets this year, starting with Guardian of the Sands, then Samsung Galaxy White, Prehistoric, and most recently Academy. I also worked on Arclight Vel'koz which expanded the skin line from just Varus (and now there's Vayne too). Something I'm actively interested in is taking old skins that we've done in the past, finding the value in them and then expanding that into a skin line for a few champions while building a bigger story. So Arclight Varus was initially just a one-off version of Varus inspired by kid icarus with light magic but then I distilled some design language and thought up a loose story line about them being holy avengers uplifted by a gigantic golden-tentacled god (so in his splash Vel'koz is testing the faithful and Varus and Vayne are supernatural zealots that passed that test and ascended). Blood Moon is another example that the skins team were already doing before I started; taking some old skins and developing them into a modern skin line!","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2015-09-20T15:03:38.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what's the world of the Guardians of the Sands?

That last part isn't necessarily bad, but a little disappointing from me.\n\nFrom the Gaurdian of the Sands launch:\n\n>Deep in the sands lies an arcane temple forsaken by a ruined kingdom. Deep in that temple lies an imposing tomb burnished with mystic runes and emerald scarabs. Deep in that tomb lies an ancient being of treacherous power.\nThese guys guard the temple next to that one.\n\nAnd Risen Fiddlesticks:\n\n>The sands rise at his command. The guardians fall to his power. The scarabs flock to their master.\nEveryone else just runs like hell.\n\nThis copy was written at the beginning of the year without much context from the concept artists and reminds me how much we've improved this year. Now we try to ensure that the initial ideas follow right through the production to ensure the final skins feel really thematically cohesive and the overall impression is strong. When I did the concept for GotS Kha'zix I was a freelance artist working from home and I only had a Shurima style guide to work from without much communication to drive story so I focused on creating a cool design that was basically 'What if Kha'zix was like Nasus and Renekton'. From what was written at launch I see the Guardians kind of like Nasus and Renekton; standing watch over the tomb that sealed a dangerous enemy of Shurima. In this case instead of Xerath it was Fiddlesticks, in a world where he is an all-powerful mummy commanding an army of scarabs. I often referred to him as feeling even more ancient than Azir and wanted him to have a custom taunt about how Azir may have ruled Shurima, but he **built** Shurima. I like to imagine him as the cursed return of the first emperor of the sands! *obligatory reminder that this is not canon*\n\nThe Shadowfire Kindred skin would suggest that there is a balance between forces of light and darkness, so I see skins like Gatekeeper Galio and Infernal Nasus as being the opposing force to Arclight. But where Arclight are organised under the all knowing eye of the might Vel'koz the Infernal seem to be more chaotic, serving themselves and bringing destruction without purpose. I guess Infernal are the disease and Arclight is the cure? Justicar comes from a time when skin names carried less weight; Justicar Syndra could have been Arclight perhaps and there really isn't anything that ties Syndra to Aatrox which makes it very difficult to even understand what the theme of Justicar is. We talk about it a lot internally because, while it's funny to joke about it (Arclight if the name starts with 'V' otherwise call it Justicar), it does point out the importance of a name and also to put thought into colour/shape/materials when fleshing out a skin line to ensure we meet player's expectations.\n\nThe original Bloodmoon skins were from 2011. I'm not sure any concept artist on the skins team now worked on the skins team then, which means it does happen that very old notes can get overlooked. From the launch of BM Thresh/Elise:\n\n>A sanguine moon stains a canvas of stars as two figures utter an ancient oath, swearing allegiance. They murmur the final words. Bloody light surges from their bodies. Power courses through transformed veins as masks materialize in their hands. Thresh and Elise embrace the Blood Moon. Join the ranks of an ancient sect with Blood Moon Elise and Blood Moon Thresh...\n\nYes the new skins aren't lore, but there's still this idea of performance and the Blood Moon night. Only instead of being part of the performance in the Serene Gardens, they are being initiated into an evil Ionian cult. They still however retain some theatrical elements as the cult has as much ritual and performance as the other events happening throughout Ionia on that evening:\n\n>We the animators decided it'd be cool if their recalls were related to traditional Japanese culture in some form or another. It just so happened that Kabuki was a strong influence on Kalista (which I also animated) and Thresh. For Elise I wanted to do something else that played off the more beautiful and calm appearance of her human form as well as the lore of the \"Jorōgumo\". -Riot Whist\n\nAs Riot Ant in Oz has said, BM Kalista is very much how she would be portrayed if one year at the Festival of Fire they told her story. Finally BM Zilean is considered to be linked to Thresh and Elise and is the Grand Master of the secret Blood Moon sect. His splash depicts him descending upon a crowd and absorbing their blood magic into his 'moons'. But is it his loyal followers or a hapless audience during the festivities?\n\nSo these skins all share some themes; Japanese folklore and Kabuki theatre, performances in Ionia on the night of the Blood Moon. However you are right they are loose ties that allow us to design a skin that best plays up the chosen champion. For example if we made BM Diana would she be a member of the cult, herself dressed as a hero from Ionian lore, or an Ionian representation of the Lunari from ancient times? That flexibility is very desirable in design.","replies":[{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2015-09-22T06:33:04.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W1smZWIk,comment-id=0005000400000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-09-20T21:56:17.519+0000)\n\n> These guys guard the temple next to that one.\n\n\nThis still makes me laugh, LOL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-09-21T00:58:30.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W1smZWIk,comment-id=0005000400000001000000010000,timestamp=2015-09-20T21:56:17.519+0000)\n> Arclight if the name starts with 'V' otherwise call it Justicar\n\nArclght Volibear confirmed? {{champion:106}}","replies":[{"poster":"frigginmurlocs","date":"2015-09-21T20:00:25.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arclight Vi confirmed?","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-09-21T20:03:32.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arclight Veigar confirmed!","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2015-09-21T22:14:33.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arclight Viktor confirmed!?","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2015-09-21T22:47:45.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arclight.\n\nVladimir.\n\nConfirmed.\n\n:^)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thales","date":"2015-09-20T08:10:37.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed that recently when looking at Arclight Vel'koz's splash art!

The Slaughter Fleets are groups of rival ships that hunt enormous sea serpents for the value of their carcasses. Yes this is a downward career move for an admiral for sure but he also doesn't have to obey a king. He sacrificed office and prestige for freedom! Also as you can see on the new GP (who wears the leather hide of serpents and a gilded serpent head on his shoulder) certain exotic serpent's bodies/bits are highly desirable in Bildgewater for their rarity, displaying wealth and status like diamonds and gold do for us. They are also used for medicines, materials etc. so a skillful Slaughterfleet Captain can become quite wealthy, which is for many more appealing than the respect of military command. There's a bit about Slaughterfleet's here on the event page: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/bilgewater/#act-2\n\n2.

Whether or not some of them can change their tail into legs I don't know, it's a common magic ability in stories about merfolk and in MtG some merfolk have legs instead of tails depending on the plane they inhabit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2015-09-18T19:27:56.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kindlejack,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=W1smZWIk,comment-id=000500020001,timestamp=2015-09-18T18:04:36.711+0000)\n>\n> Well Nami is one of the Marai, which is a race of merfolk that I assume has males.

Myself and the other artists all talk about One Piece a lot because they have really wonderful characters. Such skill has Eiichiro Oda and we can all learn from his character design.
