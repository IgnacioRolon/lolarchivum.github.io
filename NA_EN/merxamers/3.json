I like the small amount of silliness, and the overall lighter tone of the skin :)\n\nAnd let&#039;s be honest, he&#039;s kinda adorable when he choo-choos into his ult.\n\nEdit: Check out the Illoai taunt at around 8 minutes in; it had me rolling XD","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2016-03-22T21:26:03.474+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad you enjoy it!

This just looks like an action figure/transformer which was never something I liked in the past. I think it would look good next to Toy Soldier Gangplank.\n\nThe particles look nice but the model doesn't appeal to me. 1 thing a lot of people complained about Mecha Malphite was that he was brightly colored unlike his splash so he looked like an action figure. I guess \"action figure\" is just the direction riot wants to take the Mecha line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merxamers","date":"2016-03-23T13:22:00.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man, to each his own.
