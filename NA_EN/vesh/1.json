Please be aware that this is SUPER experimental and not something we're shipping right now. I really want to get your feels feedback and start tuning this to see if it's something we would want to keep.\n\nCurrently if you attack move in this situation, the Annie closest to Vayne will be attacked. even though the cursor was clicked right next to (but not quite on top of) the other Annie:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ni6jghj.png\n\nWith this change, you will instead attack the unit closest to your cursor when clicking attack move, within specific constraints: \n1. The enemy must be within 250 units of your cursor click\n2. The enemy must be at least within 50 units of your max attack range (If the enemy is between your attack range and 50 units past your attack range, you will only \"run backwards\" to hit them if your cursor was within 50 units of the enemy out of the maximum 250 scan)\n\nAttack move will still work the same in any other case that doesn't meet the above two criteria. The idea is to capture your intent when it comes to attack moving. Were you actually trying to click that guy four pixels from your cursor who had two silver bolts on him? Instead of attacking that minion near your feet, you will actually attack what you intended. \n\n\nHere, Vayne is attacking the bot that is directly next to her cursor instead of the one closest to her. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/qBl82VM.png\n\nHere, Vayne is prioritizing the Annie that was closet to her attack move click instead of the minions directly in front of her (note that Annie was the closest thing at the time Vayne clicked, but she moved a bit before this screenshot was taken):\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qMh1F9T.png\n\nThis is a pretty big change, and it's highly experimental. I want to try to tune it more to make playing ADC feel less clunky, so ADC mains especially please send feedback this way! I will be making a feedback post in PBE as well when the feature goes live to that environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Drunk Rummate","date":"2015-01-22T21:44:36.474+0000","up_votes":90,"down_votes":27,"body":"I like it a lot.

Good, our main purpose of attack-move is untouched.\n\n- Assuming a certain inaccuracy the following could happen. Let's say we have champions A,B,C. A has 550 units attack range. The constellation is A---550units---B---50units---C. A wants to attack B and uses the new attack-move on B, but misses by >25units towards C. The new attack-move would make move A towards B and C. Not good.\n\n> You will only walk forward a maximum of 50 units (this is almost nothing in league)\n\nI disagree on Vesh's statement about the impact of 50 units. For example, even small range changes (e.g. 550units -> 525units) had a big impact on a marksman's performance. Yes, I am kind of comparing apples to oranges (couldn't think of a better example right now), but I stick to my point. 50 units must not be underestimated.\n\nIn the end I really like the concept of improving attack-move's \"accuracy\" by introducing a tolerance, but I don't think the \"walk forward\" mechanic is a good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Y0 PIERRE","date":"2015-01-23T00:30:38.861+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:429}} YES PLEASE","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heal and Forget","date":"2015-01-22T22:15:43.374+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a nice QoL change and I can't wait to try it with a ranged DPS champion when it hits PBE.
