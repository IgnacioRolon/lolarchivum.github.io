Maybe 5 games is enough to learn how Sona works, but I've played 5 games on Lee and his combo is still finicky. You're going to run into people who play 5 beginner bot games on a champ and then run into ranked or something like that. And then you'd merely get people going 'why do they let people who only played 5 games on that champion to pick them in ranked!?' and you'd raise it to the point no one can play anything.\n\nI do wish they prevented new champs from being in ranked for a week or two though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jimmylism","date":"2015-04-28T13:06:03.018+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"There was 1 punctuation in that whole thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sergeant Stephen","date":"2015-04-28T18:41:33.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion Mastery, maybe?","replies":[]},{"poster":"yukonl","date":"2015-04-28T02:16:56.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[This thread.](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQxgBc7kMwylV1Ox_frAwrpM4efHxg7vUpWmOVMXe5gY6M6de-6bOPPvPv2)","replies":[]},{"poster":"djjomon","date":"2015-04-28T03:07:53.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What of smurfs?

I mean sometimes just playing the game is nice, and if I can grind to the rank I want to get to with teammates doing whatever, then why shouldn't I be allowed to do whatever once I get to that rank? If you're still climbing it sets you back a game and you play through it, if you aren't then it gives you something to blame other than your skill for why you aren't climbing and makes you feel better.
