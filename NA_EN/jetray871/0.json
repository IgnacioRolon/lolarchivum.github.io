This does not happen all the time, but it happens so much, that it really irritates me. The game goes well for the first 15-20 minutes, then the screen freezes. I cannot click on anything, or even alt+del+control out. My I also cannot alt+tab out. I know it might not be the computer because the chrome in the background still plays my music. I have already updated my graphics cards, and I have also re-installed my computer. But the problem is still present. Can somebody please help me and find a way to fix this? Thanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-25T04:36:42.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be case where some of the damaged game files are causing those crashes, but every time you try to uninstall those files stick around and cause issues again later.
