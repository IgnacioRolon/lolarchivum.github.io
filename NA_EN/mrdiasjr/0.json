Buying +health itmes to worsen your passive was really strange.\nBut those new numbers seem way too high and {{champion:14}} dies much faster now.\nSo @RiotScruffy (or any other Riot employee who knows it) - **was this increase in passive decay intentional?**\nThat is really the only thing that interests me here, rest of post are just numbers.\n\nIf numbers are required:\nI will only evaluate initial tic, as tic increases are scaled nearly similarly. Previously, you were taking 0.5% of your max health, now it's 2 times level. So, for new passive to be better than old one, you have to have 400 times your level max health. \n1 level - yeah, here it happens\n6 level - 2400 health\n12 level - 4800 health\n18 level - whooping 7200 health! \nSo, of course, you can achieve 2400 health in a single match, and you can achieve 4800, though it seems ulikely to get them so early. But 7200...Now, I mostly play bot games, where, as a rule, Sion passive works way better and you also get more money. And even with this conditions, I've only once had 5800 hp on 17th level({{item:3207}} , ~600 health from passive, {{item:3083}} , {{item:3143}}  and some other items). That is STILL 1000 short of optimal amount for 17 level(6800)\n\nLeaving level scaling but decreasing first tic coefficient to 1.5(and adjusting tic increases accordingly) seems like way more achievable thing. It requires one to only have >300 times his level in max health (1800 for 6th level, 3600 for 12th level, 5400 for 18 level - those numbers look more realistic) to get any benefit.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2014-11-09T22:06:32.313+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, we're on the same page that the current health decay numbers scale too steeply by level.

His new model and voice are utterly boring, and more than that, they took away the Ahnold voice.\n\nBut yeah, reworks are almost always failures and intended to make a champion worse. The few successes were either accidental (and swiftly nerfed), there was nothing there to work with in the first place, or they barely changed anything gameplay-wise (like Sejuani, who was also swiftly nerfed into oblivion).","replies":[{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-11-09T22:48:40.918+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Screw the old Arnold voice, it's not even original!

First disrespecting the Arnold voice, then claiming Sion fits any niches that aren't \"Bad champion, do not pick\", and then thinking that Cassiopeia's shitty rework passive is something that should be kept.","replies":[{"poster":"DocRedgrave","date":"2014-11-10T03:55:18.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, he's a strong jungler who can run people down with his ultimate for a gank post 6. What's not to love about that? Plus, originality in a champion's personality and voice are far more interesting than a few lousy references to Arnold movies dating back to the 90s. \n\nAs for that Cass passive, the old one was so fucking misleading. The reason why you rarely saw her played was because any amateur Cass player would throw their lane by spamming and missing their spells in lane. It was just so freaking stupid it had to go.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Remlap1223","date":"2014-11-10T01:51:50.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Look, I love new Sion for actually being a character you can take seriously, but I actually liked his AHNOLD voice.  I would've at least liked the option.  I think half of the reason why I like playing as Gangplank is because he says stupid pirate shit every 5 seconds.  I loved old Sion because he was cheesy in a fun way, and as much as I think new Sion's voice is amazing and very reflective of what his character really is like, I do miss the cheese.\n\nEdit:  I was talking about a Traditional skin bruh, no need to just downvote everyone you disagree with.
