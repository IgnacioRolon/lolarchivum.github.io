Also the HUD, champion levels etc. have been looking really blurry.

The first is likely bad game files causing this kind of blur.  If you haven't already try a repair or reinstall with the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367).  Double check your drivers as well and make sure they're up to date to help smooth things out, our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide can help with that.","replies":[{"poster":"LW Cholle","date":"2017-12-29T08:34:37.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Repaired the game, installed the drivers (well ''partially'') and it still does happen. ALSO, what I should've said is that, it does not happen every single game, it happens somewhat frequent but it doesn't have a particular order  in which it happens or any particular number of games. \n\nAnyways, the drivers are perhaps the problem, I've been trying to install them since yesterday, I don't get past the ''partially installed'' message after the installation. My drivers are kind of hard to download since I can't really find any specifics about my graphics card, it's AMD Radeon(TM) R5 Graphics, but that's about it. \n\nSo if there's anything else you would suggest besides those two, please do.","replies":[]}]}]}
