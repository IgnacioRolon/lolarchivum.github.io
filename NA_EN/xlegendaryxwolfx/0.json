It's telling me a problem caused it to stop working correctly but no solution, nor was a clue as to WHAT stopped it from working was given. Any ideas?\n\nEdit: I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times as well, the problem still keeps occurring upon opening the launcher.\n\nEdit #2: I ran it as an administrator and it fixed the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-02T20:44:31.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running as administrator worked in this case because the patcher was being blocked from launching, which results in the kernel error.  Running as admin may be a temporary workaround, meaning you'd have to run it that way each time.  For a more permanent fix, I also recommend going over our [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to configure your OS settings to allow access.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
