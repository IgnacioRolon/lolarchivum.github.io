Most played champions, first Pentakill of the season, Which of your friends you played the game most with. Even a chart that compared our stats to famous pros in our roles. It was something in depth and cool to look at. I remember coming into the new season with more motivation because of said review.\r\n\r\nSo am I missing it or has Riot said anything about it? It would suck if we&#039;re not getting it this year, but i can understand the reasons why.","replies":[]}
