Not working as a team from the start.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Okay so I'm sure a lot of you have had the pleasure of being in champion select of  a ranked draft pick game.\r\n\r\nSo here's my MAIN issue (above trolls/\"lane or feed\"/no communication):\r\n\r\nWhy do people feel like pick order is more important than working out picks with your team first?\r\n\r\nI'll be honest here. I can't play support or jungle. I don't enjoy those roles, I don't play those roles, and I really don't have the spare time to learn those roles. So when I get last 2 picks in a ranked draft pick game, I make sure to immediately tell my team that I am terrible at those two roles.\r\n\r\nNow, if we were working as a team, we should be willing to discuss our strengths and weaknesses with all the roles, and figure out which teammate goes where. But instead of this, the typical response I receive is:\r\n\r\n\"don't play ranked if you can't play all roles\"\r\n\r\nUh, okay. Thanks for the advice. Except... right after they say this, they proceed to take all the roles I can play, leaving me forced into the 2 roles that I just explained I'm terrible at.\r\n\r\nWhere is the logic in this? You just got done preaching about how I need to know all roles, and then you proceed to not fill for me (assuming you should know all roles)\r\n\r\nWhy do people place such an importance over pick order, to the point where they are willing to LOSE A GAME BEFORE IT STARTS just so they get their comfort pick?\r\n\r\nWhenever I see this sort of behavior, I want to dodge (and sometimes do) because all it tells me is that this person is not a team player. They don't care what is best for the team, only what is best for THEM.\r\n\r\nSo then why? Is it really just that people are selfish? I thought winning the game in ranked was the number one priority... Not getting your favorite champ in your favorite lane, even if it means another loss.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't think I'm the one burdening my team here. I mean, everyone has strengths and weaknesses. You can't expect a person to be great at everything. I'm great at top/mid/adc and I can push towers like a god. (average 4-5 towers destroyed by myself per game, last game I took 7 towers and an inhib) But I am terrible at support and jungle. I just don't have the time to practice them. I want to play ranked because I feel those games have some value for my time (I can compete for LP and rating) whereas playing 100 games of support in Normal feels like a huge waste of my time, considering I don't even like the role and it will just cause me to lose skill in the other roles I'm actually good at and enjoy.\r\n\r\nBut how can you say \"play every role\" and then proceed to play your comfort role only?","replies":[]}
