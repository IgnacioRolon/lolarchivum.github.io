Why \"ELO hell\" is real","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":8,"down_votes":37,"body":"League of Legends is a team game. Your ELO ranking is 100% determined by your Win/Loss record. Absolutely none of your own personal skill at the game is taken into account. Therefore we can determine that at any given time in a LoL match, you make up 20% of the team at most.\r\n\r\nSince each player makes up 20% of each team, each player has a maximum potential of 20% contribution, and a minimum of 0%.\r\n\r\nIt's not hard to do the math here... 20% of 100% means you are not contributing enough individually to make any difference. You can't be guaranteed to win more than 50% of the time even if you play at maximum performance as you only contribute 20%.\r\n\r\nA typical game might look like like this:\r\n\r\nYou = 20% full contribution\r\nTeammate A = 15%\r\nTeammate B = 10%\r\nTeammate C = 8%\r\nTeammate D = 3%\r\nTOTAL = 56% contribution\r\n\r\nOpponent A = 20%\r\nOpponent B = 14%\r\nOpponent C = 10%\r\nOpponent D = 12%\r\nOpponent E = 9%\r\nTOTAL = 65% contribution\r\n\r\nTherefore, even though you played your best, you lose the match. It does not matter what ELO you are in. This could be a bronze game or a challenger level game. If you contribute your 20%, your team can still lose the game for you.\r\n\r\n\"BUT KONIDIAS!\" you say, \"You can help your teammates do better and get them fed! That's how you climb!\"\r\n\r\nTo this I say, you are still only contributing 20%. How? Because any effort that you take away from your own performance in order to help others is just merely shifting your portion of contribution elsewhere. So instead of 20% you contribute 18% and you shifted 2% of your contribution to a teammate. In the MICRO scheme of things, this might seem to help you in a match... your struggling teammate is slightly better off and not struggling so much... but at the same time, you had to sacrifice something to get them there. In the MACRO view, this means you really didn't change the scales at all. Had you taken the kill for yourself instead of giving it to your teammate, it would not have made a difference.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has ever gotten their ADC fed only to watch the ADC play badly and get caught out and deleted can attest to this fact.\r\n\r\nSo lets debunk some things... First off, I know people will reply with \"well challenger players are better than bronze players... it's pretty obvious\" and you'd be true... to some extent. See, as a person climbs in ELO, they also improve their mechanics and knowledge of the game. I'm not saying people in Challenger don't deserve to be there. I'm saying there are people in Silver, Gold, Plat, Diamond, etc that deserve to be there too.\r\n\r\nBut how could this be? How could someone with Challenger level skills be stuck in SILVER? It all goes back to that 20% contribution factor. You can only contribute 20%. No amount of outplaying, CSing, map awareness, etc... is going to put you at a level above 20%. You are only one person of five. For proof of this, just go find a game where a Challenger or Diamond level player lost during one of those \"climb to challenger\" attempts. You can clearly see Diamond+ level players losing at Silver/Gold level games... because they can only contribute so much.\r\n\r\nSo now I might get the common response \"well if you play good enough, you will eventually climb out of your ELO\", but everyone forgets one crucial thing... What about the other people who also should be climbing out of that ELO?\r\n\r\nDo you think when you play at your current ELO that every person you are playing against (or with) belongs in that ELO? This is a common misconception.\r\n\r\nYou aren't being put up against AI that is programmed to play at a specific level. You are put up against the entire skill spectrum of players. From feeders/trolls to Challenger level smurfs.\r\n\r\nI'm going to use myself as an example of what I mean:\r\n\r\nI'm currently Silver 1. So if you were Gold 4 and were to play against me, what would your initial thought be going into the match? \"Oh I can beat this dude, he's only Silver 1\", most likely.\r\n\r\nExcept... I'm not _really_ Silver 1. In fact, I've been as high as Gold 3, and I've beaten players who were at Platinum 3 before. Like I've literally dominated them in lane. So maybe you go up against me in lane when you're Gold 4 and you get whipped... You lost to a lowly Silver, and my team does decently and we end up taking the match. So now you drop a bit of LP and are ever closer to reaching Silver yourself. But you should have won, right? I mean you were put against a Silver player...\r\n\r\nThis is just one of the many reasons why ELO doesn't matter. For every one game you get against 5 people who are actually worse than you, you get countless matches against people at your level or above your level, or whatever... You get countless chances of teammates that afk, feed, troll, or perform poorly.\r\n\r\nThe old rule of \"well you have 4 chances of afk/troll/feeder on your team and 5 chances on the enemy team\" just doesn't hold up. Given that you actually have just as much chance of 1 out of those 5 opponents being at your level or above.\r\n\r\nSo what does this all mean? It means that right now, ranking in LoL is of no real importance. It proves nothing. If you take two equally skilled players and put them in Silver 5, one might climb out really fast and the other might struggle for months. It all depends on luck. In fact, the game even takes the luck requirement a step further with promo and series matches. Because it puts all of your chance to climb on the luck you will have in 3 to 5 games.\r\n\r\nYour ELO can skyrocket if you just win the games you need to win at the right time. Most people can climb to 100 LP in any division they are in, eventually... but most people aren't going to get promoted because all of that hard climb is determined in a handful of games.\r\n\r\nSo what needs to change for a fair system? The game would need to take your own contribution into account more. It would need to base your ranking not only on your team's performance but also heavily on your own personal performance. Unfortunately, I don't think this will ever happen, because basing everything off Win/Loss gives players an opportunity to get carried or win games they shouldn't, and luck plays a large factor in the popularity of games.\r\n\r\nConsider most home board games... the most popular games have a large element of luck layered over the smaller skill elements. This gives everyone a chance to win, regardless of skill. Of course, skill plays a small role but not large enough to consistently win these games.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to state that the higher ELO you are in, the more your skill level matters. For example, at low ELO, you could play like garbage and still get carried to a win. Because it's highly likely that someone else on the opposing team is playing just as bad or worse than you. Just due to them being inexperienced, or learning the game, or whatever.\r\n\r\nBut the higher ELO you go, the more your skill matters. Other players at high ELO are going to make less mistakes, they are going to know the game better, etc. So outplaying them matters more. This is why I feel the soft resets on ranking each year are extremely unfair to newer players.\r\n\r\nRight now we have Challenger/Diamond players who have reached that ELO merely because they got lucky several years ago. They only get soft resets, meaning they will start in Platinum with people who know the game well and where their skill matters more. They won't ever get placed in Silver ELO where their skill has less of an impact overall. This is great for those players (which is why it's done) but awful for everyone else.\r\n\r\nI honestly believe there are Challenger level players who are forever stuck in lower ELOs, because of wins/losses being the deciding factor for determining skill level.\r\n\r\nThen there are games where you \"carry\", and these are easily explained. See... you are doing 20% contribution while the enemy team is actually ALL lower level. This rarely happens, because it means you are actually being matched against people who belong in their ELO... But how often does that really happen? Not that often, when you consider just how many smurfs and players stuck in ELO hell there actually are.\r\n\r\nThe ability to \"carry\" becomes more important at higher levels of play, but at lower ELO, carrying just means you got lucky to be faced against 5 people who are below your skill level. With so many factors working against you, it's no wonder people have difficulty winning consistently.\r\n\r\nThoughts? Questions? Comments? I'll be happy to debate with anyone about this, because honestly if anything I hope that this thread enlightens a few people and maybe... just maybe... gets Riot to change the way they determine ranking.
