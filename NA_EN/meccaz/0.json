Lets take this Example, not that it would often actually happen or ever.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m playing talon. I throw my level 1 W, the first part of it kills a minion which causes me to level up. somehow before the W starts its journey back, i manage to level it up to level 2. On the way back, will it have the damage of level 1 or level 2?","replies":[{"poster":"Bradley Dragon","date":"2017-03-23T16:20:08.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1690032\n\ndepends entirely on the individual champs programing","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2017-03-23T16:16:02.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always assumed it was based on the level at which it was thrown which would make sense but this is easily testable in practice mode.  If you test it can you post the results here?","replies":[]}]}
