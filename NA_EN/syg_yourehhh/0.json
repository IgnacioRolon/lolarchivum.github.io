Somewhere it stated that  i had to send a pic with my IGN and server name on a piece of paper, together with the code. So i did and send riot supp the picture, but that was almost 12 hours ago. I came back from pax west today and i really want to play with the sivir skin since im a hardcore sivir lover. Is there someone here who has to deal with the same issue? how long did it take for them to respond? also, if you're a rioter, could you help me out?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-04T03:22:51.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That ticket will be the best way of getting that code redeemed since it already has all of the info we'll need to check. If you still haven't gotten a response, no worries. Sometimes the queues can get a little backed up and we might be seeing a lot of those PAX related tickets right now!","replies":[{"poster":"Arab Skydiver","date":"2017-09-11T12:39:00.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I still haven't got an answer and the code expires tomorrow.. any chanche that I wont lose the skin?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"panda luv bamboo","date":"2017-09-09T20:05:49.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm hi i think i have been waiting for my skin too i sent a ticket to riot but still no response it has been nearly 17 hours now yet no response.
