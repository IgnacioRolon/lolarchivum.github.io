Plus, they're high, but they aren't ridiculously high.

Hit them with your Q (100% AP Ratio), or if they have an escape or gap closer, W them (70% AP Ratio), get a few auto attacks in if you need to (25% AP Ratio, I believe) and then finish them off with your ult (70% AP Ratio and deals true damage instead of magic damage).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RIP Tahm Kench","date":"2015-06-03T09:31:15.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The silence can be changed to 1.1-1.5 seconds and I wouldn't really care, just don't touch the Ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-06-03T08:23:14.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho is in a good spot imo (ignoring the needed VU :P ) but I would say that once you get big it's annoyingly difficult to judge your ability ranges.
