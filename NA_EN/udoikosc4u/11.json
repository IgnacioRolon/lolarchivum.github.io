He's not broken freelo, but he's not unviable, either.  He has a design that some people really enjoy, and it creates a following of players that want to master him to do well with him.  \nI'd say that's an excellent champion design...he was just out of control on release.  (Before all the nerfs/balance changes.)\n\n**Kalista, however, is an inherently broken design.  I definitely agree there.**\n\nHer passive counters melees with the infinite kiting...but it also counters ranged champions by giving her incredible skillshot-dodging.  What? \n\"Point and click CC\" isn't even a \"weakness\" of hers...It's just the only remaining thing she isn't incredibly strong against. \n \nFor example:  Targeted CC is only said to be her weakness because she is practically immune to skillshots - **not because Targeted CC actually hurts her any more than other champions.**  \nIt's just equally effective on her as it is on everyone else.  \nSo it's not a weakness at all.  It's just the one thing she's not near-invincible to.\n\nTo really drive that point home:\nAlmost everyone gets locked down by point-and-click CC (except maybe Irelia, Olaf...) but unlike most champions, Kalista has some of the best chances of hopping off to safety once that CC wears off.  And movement speed slow-stacking won't meaningfully reduce the distance of her hops either.  \n*That means she's even strong against her one \"weakness.\"*  Finally catch her out, then watch her hop away to safety.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2015-06-30T17:11:34.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=killd0zer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wtJtpYGb,comment-id=000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-30T11:16:32.201+0000)\n> \n> Yas is garbo unless played to near perfection, in which case he's good against ranged squishes, and loses to pretty much everything else.\n\nI disagree,he is comparing yasuo's hard counter mechanics to that of kalista,which makes sense,he forgets that there is a cry out every time yasuo becomes a dominant pick,so the logic is fine,the premise is wrong: we(well,I at least,seems to be more whenever yasuo becomes a serious pick) want both yasuo and kalista gutted,we aren't fine with yasuo. \n\n> That's a testament to how shitty his design is.

If she can't just ram her head into an Udyr and kill him every time he enters her field of vision, why does he HAVE TO be able to do that to her?\n\nThe minigame is in manipulating positioning and coordinating with teammates so she can't escape easily. It's like chess - you don't just align your rook with a king and deliver checkmate, you manipulate your pieces and the enemy's available moves to create a scenario that favors you.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-30T14:38:48.230+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes because every match of League is a premade with close friends who you know the weaknesses and strengths of.\nCasual non-rank soloQ League is very dissimilar to chess.

I think past all the blind rage about Kalista, her passive is just awful design.

Got a Riven running toward you?  Stun her.  Udyr's trying to run away?  Slow him down.  Kalista's kiting you?  Snare her.  My basic understanding of Kalista's strengths and weaknesses looks something like this:\n\nPros: Incredible kiting, high burst at the end of trades, strong team-fighting and AOE damage, vision via Sentinels, scales well with flat AD and attack speed, %HP nuke on a short cooldown.\n\nCons: Back-loaded damage (need extended trades to win), cannot cancel AA, doesn't scale well with crit, feels clunky early game from lack of attack speed, less effective if binded ally is disconnected or not near you.  Lack of built in steroids.\n\nAlso, how is her last hitting very difficult?  Her E resets (and refunds some mana too) if you kill at least one target so I can't imagine its incredibly difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"Noctius28","date":"2015-06-30T14:53:27.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":7,"body":"Trust me even with refund her E uses ALOT of mana so you can't use that for last hitting for long\n\nAnd where does she have aoe damage?\nShe is as good at team fighting as any other adc, why do you believe she is better?\n\neverything else I agreed with you","replies":[{"poster":"Orbv","date":"2015-06-30T16:29:03.030+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's really not hard to last hit with. She still attacks better than Swain, Annie and Quinn.\n\nTeam fighting revolves around targeting the nearest enemy and killing them before they get to you. She is one of the best for teamfight because she doesn't rely on a support defending her the entire time. She can literally jump in circles away from any possible threat. Also she can save her Support from dying by ulting. Teamfighting with her is very safe.\n\nSivir is also good at teamfighting because of AoE. Jinx because of AoE and range. Tristana because of resetting leap. Graves because of AoE.\n\nBut she has good mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-06-30T16:54:31.957+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:34}} {{champion:30}} \n\nThe gods of crappy cs.","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-06-30T16:57:58.556+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sammystorm,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=wtJtpYGb,comment-id=0001000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-30T16:54:31.957+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:34}} {{champion:30}} \n> \n> The gods of crappy cs.\n\nREPLACE KARTHUS WITH SWAIN OMG KARTHUS IS THE KING OF THE FARM","replies":[{"poster":"Shrek Luigi","date":"2015-07-01T17:06:36.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This, karth is the undead god of last-hitting under turret","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-07-01T03:20:28.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My impression of her having AOE damage is from many Kalista's purchasing Runaan's Hurricane, allowing her to E multiple champions at once (provided they are within range of the primary target).\n\nThe reason why I believe her teamfight is strong is from her Ult and the AOE damage that results from her most popular build (BT/Hurricane/Bork/LW/Situational Item/Boots), and ease in escaping pursuing melees.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
