If he jumps on you in the first place, he has either a good reason to believe he can kill you or knows he can do huge damage and run away, since otherwise he uses Q as a poke with no need to follow up.","replies":[{"poster":"TomA3X","date":"2015-02-16T00:58:45.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Rozzeta","date":"2015-02-16T01:35:40.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"First, Lee's skillshot is a 1100 attack with energy cost. All Veigar's point and click attacks are 650 (not sure how much his new Q will have). Of course that doesn't really matter since neither is a poke champion, but bear in mind he can initiate way beyond Veigar's reach. The only follow up Veigar can do to a long range Event horizon would probably be Dark Matter alone, since it's range is 900 (Veigar would still need to walk a little to be in position, so a Lee with Mercury boots should be able to get away before it lands)\n\nSecondly, the passive for Veigar's AP gain is from Q. Kill a normal minion with Q for 1 AP. Kill a big minion with Q for 2 AP. Kill a champion with anything for 1*Q's level AP. The irony here is that this passive gates Veigar out of competitive play, since there is not enough mana to farm Q and harass at the same time, and his overal short ranges and Dark Matter's delay make it very hard for him to hit anything without landing Event Horizon first, otherwise he runs the risk of getting melted in seconds.\n\nThird. Veigar's role in the game is nuke. He is one of the so called immovible mages, one that is specially designed to counter other mages by using his ultimate. His champion archetpe sacrifices mobility and has high mana costs in exchange for high damage potential. If caught, he has little chance to live (and Veigar is particulary weak to the \"in your face\" assassins which are popular nowadays). Lee Sin is, on the other hand, is an early game assassin and late game bruiser. he has quite a lot of damage potential thanks to % hp lost second Q and the absurd base damage of his ultimate, a point and click insta cast skill. What is he trading for that? Because if it's only the fact that is melee, on a champion whith a 1100 range skillshot that serves as gap closer and while having a 700 range escape skill which can be used to a ward you place yourself, then it doesn't really seem like a fair trade.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Graves III","date":"2015-02-16T03:35:32.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">The irony here is that this passive gates Veigar out of competitive play, since there is not enough mana to farm Q and harass at the same time, and his overal short ranges and Dark Matter's delay make it very hard for him to hit anything without landing Event Horizon first, otherwise he runs the risk of getting melted in seconds.\n\nThe real irony is that this is a design feature in his kit.\n\nVeigar is supposed to have a dumpster tier early game so that he can bloom into full supervillain mode late game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TomA3X","date":"2015-02-15T15:36:12.078+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TomA3X,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=A3LU87Y8,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-15T15:33:01.256+0000)\n>\n> \n>~~ Couple of things you missed btw. ~~ Patch notes 5.4\n> \n> 1.
