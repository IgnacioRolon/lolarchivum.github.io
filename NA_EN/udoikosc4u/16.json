Assassins by contrast tend to flank, have extremely high target selection and burst, low team utility, lack constant survivability (instead relying on other tools like mobility, untargetability, stealth etc) and are usually great targets to kill if you can focus them. Combining those two categories risks creating very tanky, mobile champions with high CC/utility that set up their own kills, are extremely hard to take down and will happily chew through an entire team. {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:64}}","replies":[{"poster":"femmé","date":"2015-01-04T19:25:03.451+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":12,"body":"they nerfed kha because he needed to be nerfed since he had high damage that could instagib you before you knew what happened and pantheon because of his dragon soloing.
