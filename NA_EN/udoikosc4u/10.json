In his respective position, he's far, far less broken. And at the very least, he isn't getting buffed right now (not like Vayne got the Q buff that made it tons more forgiving if you do not the shot, or Lee getting the passive rework that makes it even easier to use AND the ultimate buff).\n\nHe's actually far worse than both of them,at least they had a period where they weren't in the meta,thresh has always been alternating between top tier and broken tier,he is by far the biggest offender against variety in this game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TotalJerk","date":"2015-08-23T16:33:15.154+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop bullshitting.
