His q is a Sound wave so hitting an enemy apparently bounces sound off them giving him vision NOW this is where it gets thrown off because suddenly EVERYONE can see that person which is the part that makes no sense.. If only lee can see them if would be a nice touch to his Kit. Other part is Lee suddenly defies gravity dashing a really long distance and curving mid air ( yes some other champs do that but i mean come on its a game). Now his e is more of a tremor which why HE specifically needs TWO methods of being able to see stealth champions I HAVE NO IDEA.
