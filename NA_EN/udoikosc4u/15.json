Just replace the  99% slow with a snare of the same duration.

It should also be renamed hamstring.\n\nAll {{champion:6}} needs is for his shield to scale with his maximum mana instead of AP, and for his Q to return mana when he gets a kill with it ala {{champion:1}}'s Q or {{champion:69}}'s E.

I was playing some ashe the other day, and a jax jumps on me. Does ashe have a dash? no. Does she have any real skill shots? no.  I only had 2 options, to keep autoing while he had his e up and get stuned, or option 2, to run and still get jumped on and stunned. I died pretty fast, but keep in mind this jax was 0-9. and i was 5-2, with enough farm for the time of the match. \n      \nI'm not saying jax is op, but he didnt need his recent late game buffs. Any adc with a dash isn't weak to jax. If jax q's first they dash away before the stun hits. If he saves his e they will dash away anyways.
