They're not **The** on-hit passives.\n\nLet's take this example:\nMiss Fortune (or Ezreal) has Wit's End for some reason and she (he) casts a Q. That Q will have the 42 magic dmg from **Wit's End's passive**, but the Q itself is **not** the on-hit passive, it's just a way to access it. Phantom Hit does exactly the same thing, it applies the \"on-hit passives\" pool every \"other\" basic attack. \nThings like Poppy/Nasus'Q/Sheen/Triforce get procced and consumed on the basic attack, so they're not applied to the Phantom Hit.\nJinx's Q is just a modified auto-attack that deals more dmg, has splash and greater range. It's not an on-hit passive.\n\nShyvana, on the other hand, is a very interesting case. Her Q applies 2 basic attacks, both of which have on-hit properties (access to the \"on-hit passives\" pool). Which means that, if:\n\n1. You use a regular AA and then Q (applying 2 more basic attacks), you will apply one Phantom Hit and your next AA will also proc a Phantom Hit.\n2. You would apply on-hit passives 4 times in a quick succession - one from first AA, two from Q and one from the Phantom Hit. Your second AA will also apply 2 on-hit passives - one from the AA and one from another Phantom Hit.\n3. Assuming Phantom Hit applies the \"on-hit passives\" from Shyvana's Burnout (W) and Flame Breath (E) that's a *hitton of damage.\n\nThrow Wit's End and/or BotRK in the equation and we're talking insane (ALL on-hit passives are applied **SIX** times) dmg just off of an AA>Q>AA sequence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-06-30T19:56:57.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Empowered AAs get no benefit.
