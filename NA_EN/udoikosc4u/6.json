On top of being able to hide his bitch ass behind a wall of turrets, if you even manage to get a hit off on him, his massive health regen will heal it right back up.

I put up my AD scaling sheild and animation cancel burst you to death because I bought Last Whisper and Yomumu's, despite your 5k health.\n\nI play the donger who has the highest HP5 in the game. You play Sion. You try to 1v1 me.  I stun you, fire my rockets, let my turrets take you down, Zhonya's, but because you're playing Sion and have built a ton of MR because you're Sion, you survive with 500 health and kill me because I couldn't regen fast enough.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you regen 100 health per second if you're insanely squishy and have no defensive abilities.  Someone will be able to burst you down, or have enough DPS to do enough sustained damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jDVL20eCYs","date":"2015-07-07T08:52:49.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"no","replies":[{"poster":"UdoIkOSc4u","date":"2015-07-07T08:54:36.225+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ekko or feed,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=M3oLzYgX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-07T08:52:49.335+0000)\n>\n> no\n\nthan tell me why?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OverpoweredSoap","date":"2015-07-07T14:29:43.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they keeps Heimer's passive just because it keeps him from doing anything crazy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Random Task","date":"2015-07-07T09:04:12.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol.","replies":[]}]}
