I haven't done the math, but it feels like the IP/BE accruing process is much slower now, and the only way to speed that up seems to be through missions.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else faced this issue? Is there a reason for it? Please help, i'm really tired of spending so much time with very little reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainboom","date":"2017-11-17T01:21:26.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep! They covered a FAQ about the Pre season Here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ\n\n They also explained that the FWD would be a daily mission \"...we’re going to turn the First Win of the Day into a more substantial daily mission that gives bonus XP. It’ll give you a big burst of XP, and subsequent games will kick out a little bit less...\"\n\nBE gain seems a bit slower but we also no longer have to spend it on runes. I'm sure they'll add missions for different events, as they have in the past (i.e Star Guardian) that will probably give BE.\nFWD will help leveling be a bit faster -> getting BE from leveling.  Don't forget about Honor Capsules, either, which can drop for being a good sport (keeping that honor level up)!\n\nHope I was able to help! {{sticker:sg-kiko}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-17T02:22:39.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only mission going on right now is the first win of the day, so that's normal.  I know many players have strong feelings about how the new BE system is working, and we absolutely need to hear those concerns. The best place to post that feedback is over on [**Cactopus's post**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/hAaYMrEs-leveling-and-rewards-early-impressions-and-adjustments) where they've been discussing all the finer aspects of the new system.","replies":[]}]}
