How ever I look at na.op.gg and saw my match history and it showed games that i played , I know no one that knows my password besides me , which means someone probably hijacked my account and got my account banned due to them begin toxic, I really hope the admins can hear me out , and Unban me from LOL , I will make sure this never happens agian , and I also spent so much money on this account PLEASE urban me , Thank You","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-21T05:53:05.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yikes that would suck to come back from a temp suspension only to see you're perma-banned. It looks like this ban wasn't placed until *today*, and you were able to play a few games before it happened, so it might have only been placed due to something from one of today's games. If you aren't able to see a reform card for this, you're always welcome to reach out to our player behavior team for the full context of what happened in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"IDontPullOutBlvd","date":"2017-11-22T18:02:48.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is 11/21/17 was the first day I open LOL client since the 14 day Temp suspension , and right when i logged in I got the message , haven't played since then","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 FÄ…ker","date":"2017-11-21T00:33:47.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really sucks my guy, Hope you find help  Best of Luck","replies":[]}]}
