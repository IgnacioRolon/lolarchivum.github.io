Local instabilities and even your ISP changing how you route to us could be causing the increase in  ping.  Your internet might be okay elsewhere, but you can still run into trouble reaching some services.  Just in case, I suggest going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to rule out possibilities.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"X Wing Fighter","date":"2017-07-08T15:39:10.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if indeed my ISP has changed routes to you is there anything i could do about it? I cant play League at 70 ping.  League is the only thing affected by ping increase and i can confirm its none of the connection issues listed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iMoca","date":"2017-07-05T22:17:57.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well me and  alot of friends which i know also confirmed that  ping got increased from nowhere and without any known reasons  , i had normal ping 78-80  now my ping is  200-250  and thats only happened after last patch 7.13 ..  hope riot check that problem asap because we almost cant play .","replies":[]}]}
