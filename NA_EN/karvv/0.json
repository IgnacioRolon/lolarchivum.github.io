I&#039;ve always been casual and LoL has always been a background game to me, while I play other games like WoW, overwatch, AAA titles, etc. While I&#039;ve &quot;played&quot; for many years, most of those years have had maybe 20 games max, with months in between. I&#039;ve maintained silver in ranked for most of my seasons played, but as I return I definitely have not retained much of my playing ability. \r\n\r\nTo put it short, I suck.\r\n\r\nI should easily be bronze, and yet the game decides to pair me up with silver, gold, and even some players with the plat border from last season. In the last 5 ranked games I&#039;ve played, the majority of players were in gold.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s infuriating.\r\n\r\nEvery game I have played in the last 2 days has been me sucking, everyone on my team getting angry at me, and then we lose or I get carried. People have cussed at me, berated me for every mistake I make, and most frequently just said that I&#039;m terrible at this game. I understand that this is the community and not Riot&#039;s fault, but I&#039;m sure they wouldn&#039;t be as angry at me if they sucked too.\r\n\r\nI play video games on my days off to unwind, relax, and have some fun, and yet league of legends is constantly and consistently a game that frustrates me to no end. The wins are barely euphoric enough to make you want to play another, while the losses can be nearly enough to make you want to punch a hole in your wall; especially when people are as toxic as they are in ranked.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not blaming Riot for me being bad. I know it&#039;s up to me to improve. But it&#039;s heart wrenching when I literally can&#039;t do anything but be a weight on my teams back, even in ranked where I&#039;m supposed to be on a level playing field with other players. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure there are other people as bad as me in Bronze, and I would like to see a way to intentionally reduce my rank without losing 50 games in a row. I would like to be able to reset my rank to bronze so that I have fun playing the game as soon as I try to pick it up again. It would have the added benefit of no one in high silver or gold having to deal with me on their team until I work my way back up to that rank through practice.\r\n\r\nAt this point, my only solution is to make a whole new account that has no characters unlocked just to reset my rank, or continue to feel useless while playing this game for another 20-50 games until my rank normalizes to a level that&#039;s actually fair for me.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nConor.","replies":[]}
