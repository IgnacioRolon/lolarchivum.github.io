If it was a one off thing and everyone within the game was experiencing the same lag, it's very well within the realm of possibility that there was an issue with that game server.  If it's something that's happening consistently or if other players in your game aren't experiencing the same type of lag, then I'd say it's more likely to be an issue with the connection between your individual network and our servers.\n\nBest next step would be to use our [Log Reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) which should help to identify where/what the problems are as well as some steps for how to fix them.
