Its so weird because yesterday I was in my account all day without any errors. It doesnt say im banned, It doesnt say wrong pass or name, It just says Unknown error and that they send a report and then again the forever logging on box. The weirdest part is that I can log in to my other account. I did send a ticket to riot and I am waiting. it got fixed after some hours","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T21:27:02.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange.
