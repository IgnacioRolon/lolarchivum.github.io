I try my very best to stay positive, but there&#039;s just no way with constant harassment and trolls to take it seriously. So I guess I&#039;m done with this game now, very disappointed in Riot for letting other players get away with ruining the experience for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Qzply76","date":"2017-06-05T00:25:48.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lataa bitch","replies":[{"poster":"GUWOP1017LAFLARE","date":"2017-06-05T00:27:30.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And it's exactly people like you who ruin this game for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-06-05T00:28:18.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how exactly did they provoke you?","replies":[{"poster":"GUWOP1017LAFLARE","date":"2017-06-05T00:35:52.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was blind pick, I called top and someone playing Vayne started claiming that they called it first when they didn't, otherwise I would've been fine. The whole game the kid just tells the whole team to report me claiming that I autolocked, pinging me whenever I died and telling people I was inting even though he died significantly more. Needless to say I reported him after the game but he'll probably still be free to play. All I want to do is enjoy this game and it's just impossible.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BigRedDawg","date":"2017-06-05T01:45:05.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried other games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-06-05T01:36:34.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the only person responsible for your own actions.

You might have been provoked by other at times, but it was your decision to retaliate (likely on several occasions) that led to your permaban.

It's just hard to stay silent when someone is constantly annoying for invalid reasons, I really tried to follow the rules, but muting pings and chat makes the game even harder to play. It's so unfortunate that I can't even play the game anymore on an account that I managed to put hundreds of hours into without being banned and suddenly I get banned because of people who set out to ruin the game. Such a shame.","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaGuy69","date":"2017-06-05T01:19:05.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have mentioned in this thread, just mute the toxic players. Even if you have to mute everyone at the beginning of the game and communicate only through pings if that's what it takes for you to get through the game. Also, if you're tempted to unmute the players to get into an argument with them, then hit the Enter key on your keyboard, and drag your chat off your screen so you can't see it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"This Is Your Dad","date":"2017-06-05T01:15:50.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Muting gives you peace of mind but it is a lonely path.
