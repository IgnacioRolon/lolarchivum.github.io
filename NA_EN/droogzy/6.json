If I only care about objective balance, why would I nerf him? The players that're losing to him are losing because they're making mistakes, not playing well enough. Not because Yi is overpowered.\n\nWhereas if the opposite is true, and he dominates pro play but is useless at any other level, then I have to nerf him for the sake of balance. Because when played optimally he's much too strong, and the players who aren't succeeding with him are failing because they aren't good enough, not because the champ isn't op.\n\nDoes that make sense? \n\n\nAlso, I think your whole premise is pretty meh. If pro play exists, of course Riot will want to balance around it.
