One of the big draws of these two roles is the notion that these two roles are largely about play making and game decision skills which to me appeals me far more then sitting in a lane last hitting incessantly (Exaggeration I know, but you get the point.)\n\nThe other half of why I enjoyed those roles is because I like being a defensive player. Especially in a game like LoL where 90% of the players are so god damn offensive oriented that they can&#039;t even bother to buy a QSS or run cleanse v.s. a Lissandra, or something of the like. \n\nI get that the Aegis, when its strong, its STRONG and becomes the auto buy of Junglers/Support. But the other half of why it was the often go to is due to how a very high number of laners, particularly squishy damage dealers, have some of the worst itemizing decisions of any player in the game.\n\nAegis was/is the one and only item that allowed for you to fill in the gaps for defense when you were dealing with a bratty laner who refuses to buy an MR item because &quot;muh damage tho?!?!&quot; (Despite the game handing both MR and damage to you in one item on a fricking platter.).\n\n Similarly, the frozen heart also allowed for you to cut the DPS of certain AD champions, another means of mitigating damage by decreasing their combat effectiveness as oppose to the Aegis increasing your defensive effectiveness.  \n\nIt&#039;s not bought exclusively because it is such a strong item. But rather the stupidity of some of the players on your team is too strong. These items at least allowed for some leeway with correct mistakes in item building for damage dealers. \n\nNow unless you're creating an item which has an aura or active that allows me to take over the item build  of a laner despite their bitching and complaining, removing the Aegis' aura effect is going to be difficult to replace.\n\nPersonally I would love that item, but something tells me it won't fly with the rest of the game :p","replies":[]}
