If this is in the wrong forum, please let me know. (Wasn't sure where it should go! :) )\n\nTo give a little bit of backstory for my recent Shyvana game:\n\nThe game I had with Shyvana, the game started, the opposing team had a Kha&#039;Zix jungler and I was playing Shyvana jungle. Naturally, Kha&#039;Zix likes early game pressure ganks, not surprisingly, he starts ganking lanes about 7 minutes into the game, and he was not doing amazing per se. Registered a few kills but also gave up several deaths. He left the laning phase 6 and 5 with no assists if I remember correctly. \n\nBeing Shyvana, I got my devourer/Cinderhulk and proceeded to power farm for the first 20 minutes, only coming out of the jungle to counter jungle when I knew Kha&#039;Zix was in the bottom lane when I was top, or vice versa. Or if not that, to provide pressure on to a lane that needed help pushing the lane back in their favor. I left the laning phase with no kills and no deaths, getting flamed for the lack of provided kill pressure in the laning phase, yet nonetheless, I still maintained a lane presence (I will digress, not as strong as I would want.) \n\nMeanwhile, Kha&#039;Zix had around 50 CS when I had 80 CS, I did not take any lane creeps at all during this time, so this is purely jungle CS. Not only that, I slowly, but surely was gaining level advantages over him very quickly. \n\nFor those you that are junglers, you know how big of a CS advantage that is for junglers, for those that don&#039;t, its quite massive, each CS for a jungler is worth approximately 30-40 gold overall? I could be wrong, if someone knows the exact answer let me know. Point being, I had easily several thousand gold over Kha&#039;Zix as well as two levels.\n\nIn other words, despite the lack of kill pressure in the lane, I was destroying Kha&#039;Zix and his team in gold income and the lanes overall were not doing too badly, despite the ganks. Nonetheless flaming was occurring telling me I am a terrible jungler etc, quit the game etc, you get the idea.\n\nFinally, after farming for around 25 minutes, I had 4 and half completed items, item wise, it was clear I had the highest gold income out of everyone by several thousands. Most had JUST finished their third item, with the exception of our WW who had a beautiful double kill on their top lane Irelia and their jungler Kha&#039;Zix early on in the game to start his snowballing. \n\nAt that point, I came out of the jungle to start fighting. And to end what is turning into a long story, proceeded to destroy the opposing team for the final 7 to 8 minutes of the game, racking up 7 kills, 13 assists and only 1 death, and tallying a much higher kill participation than their Kha&#039;Zix. Despite the flaming from the team, I ended up carrying my team incredibly hard. I tallied a grand total of 226k damage done overall. The next closest person tallied only 168k of damage done overall. \n\nMy game as Udyr occurred a few weeks ago, which was what originally prompted this idea for the thread. Similar start and similar end. Was first to reach full build, proceeded to split push the entire game and force the entire team to come towards me to save their tower in complete vain. In other words, carried that game, got flamed for lack of early game pressure. \n\n\nSo what&#039;s the point I&#039;m trying to make here?\n\nThe point is, for you folks who prefer to stay in the lane: please understand the type of jungler you are working with. Not all Junglers are the same in the way they play the game and how/what point they are strongest at. \n\nTo use Shyvana as an example, if you are playing with a Shyvana, understand that Shyvana is at her strongest when she&#039;s allowed to power farm, in the jungle, she is capable of reaching full build the fastest out of pretty much any champion with a consistent time. \n\nIf you let her do that, what do you get? You get an unstoppable Dragon who is going to completely be near unkillable and impossible to deal with 20 to 25 minutes into the game. In order for that to happen, laners need to understand that kill pressure will not be strong from her, and play accordingly. Do not play overaggressive and allow for opposing junglers to snowball off of a few kills and allow her to farm like crazy. You let her do so, you have a strong chance of winning.\n\nVice versa if you&#039;re up against an early game jungler, play accordingly. If you do not hand over any kills to someone who is an early game jungler, you&#039;ve won the jungler v.s. jungler battle. \n\nTo use another example, if you are playing with a Shaco or a Lee Sin, understand they are at their strongest when they applies lane pressure in the early game. What that means is to capitalize on the plays they make in the early game to maximize their contribution to the overall game. When late game comes around, they will not be as dominant of a force. Shaco will be at his strongest split pushing and Lee Sin is at his strongest peeling for his team or setting up plays. \n\nSo when Shaco goes to start split pushing, there should not be any flaming for the lack of team fight presence: his team fight presence is not strong and better served split pushing else where on the map.\n\nThis same message applies to Junglers with laners as well. Understand the lanes you are working with. If you have a lane which has a champion that has a poor laning phase, work to help mitigate the experience of that laning phase. If you do so, you will most likely get paid off with a champion who has a strong late or mid game series. Or work to help a strong lane destroy their lane so they have no chance of coming back whatsoever. \n\n\nTL;DR : Understand the other damn 9 champions you are playing with, understand when they are strong, understand when they are weak. Understand what they excel at doing, understand what they are sub par at. AND PLAY ACCORDINGLY and do not flame because someone does not play the way they want you to play, and they are playing the way that best suits that champion.\n\n\nThat is all.","replies":[{"poster":"RouterSmiter","date":"2015-05-25T20:38:02.970+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Power farming for the first 20 minutes?, and you had 80cs wat...","replies":[{"poster":"aaronconlin","date":"2015-05-25T21:17:12.802+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RouterSmiter,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-25T20:38:02.970+0000)\n>\n> Power farming for the first 20 minutes?, and you had 80cs wat...\n\nJungle cs and Lane cs are a lot different","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meanie40","date":"2015-05-25T21:58:24.414+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's see ... jungle monsters are on a 100 second timer, scuttle crabs 3 minutes, buff monsters 5 minutes, and dragon 6 minutes.\n\nCompletely clearing your jungle the instant it is up, the most possible CS from half of the jungle and both Scuttle Crabs at 20 minutes is 161 CS.

Op made a fantastic point about understanding the dynamics of the champions involved in a match. Different compositions want and prioritize different things. A nunu jg, shyv jg, eve jg, sej jg, and lee sin jg are all very different things. It's important as a player to understand the synergies champs have as well understanding the gamestyles they play and what moments of opportunity those styles will make available and when.\n\nThe rest of ops post and game specifics should be ignored as they aren't relevant. The premise of the post is quite solid and a wonderful observation when viewed thusly. K, back to reading your post.\n\nAgree whole heartedly with respect to a jgs primary required attribute being awareness. As a jg you need to be the most aware person on the map. 2 reasons. One, you are the only member of the team who has travel time involved when it comes to acquiring cs, and you should be using this time to check up in all of your laners and the opposing teams visible and predicted actions. 2, you are the swing man. You are the person who can changes the odds and make an even fight an advantageous fight, or an uneven one even. You need to know when to be where doing what. Awareness is key.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-05-26T02:16:27.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vfactor95,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-05-26T01:54:07.260+0000)\n>\n> Not ganking is no excuse for lack of early pressure.

What if I hadn't finished 4k gold above Kha'Zix? Game may have turned out differently. You're going to get games where that 6/0 Kha'Zix shows up, when they do, best thing to do is play accordingly. \n\nAt no point did I really insinuate that I made the game a 5v4, I showed up in the lanes multiple times throughout the game, when I say I went 0/0 in laning phase, it was not because I didn't show up in the laning phase at all, its has to do with Shyvana having zero kill pressure and also being difficult to kill herself. Jungle creeps don't spawn fast enough to sit in the jungle all game anyways. \n\nI did counterjungle, and I also warded when I could, I showed up to lane when I could, obviously it didn't result in kills, Shyvana is not known for her kill pressure prowess during the laning phase. \n\nPoint here is many people do not understand the dynamic behind some junglers, such as power farmers. It is unfair to leave your team in a 4v5 situation because you want to power farm, I agree wholesomely. But equally, it is unfair to expect a champion that needs to power farm to hit his/her power spike to constantly be in your lane providing assistance which tends to be the case more often then not.","replies":[{"poster":"jaymc1130","date":"2015-05-26T19:05:31.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Shyvana is not known for her kill pressure prowess during the laning phase. \n\nThis is precisely what top lane shyv is known for.

The addition of chilling smite gives her an early option tho, don't discount it. Most jgs should take chilling for the early game kill potential, laners who take smite want skirmishers for mid and late game duel potential.

What I do know though was I crushed their Kha'Zix in CS score completely and by the 25 minute mark, I forced him back into the jungle since he could no longer compete with me in team fights. I probably should have put a little more thought into figuring out what my CS score was at the proper time. I didn't think it was too relevant to the discussion, that's my apology. \n\nAs for time, again, I'm just guessimating, could be higher, could be lower. Was just trying to get a synopsis of the game across and get to my point I was making. So if something sounds off, it most likely is, again, my apologies. \n\nThis is the link to the game which I was talking about:\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1830712592/217428635?tab=overview\n\nEDIT: Come to think of it, it was most definitely before 7 minutes. WW got first blood at around 6:30ish minutes in, and Kha'Zix had already been in the bottom lane twice before he was killed by WW. \n\nI do appreciate the support for the basic underlying message I'm trying to get across. Next time I try to recall a match, I'll try to be a little more accurate :p \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Onimus Terlain,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-25T21:39:53.531+0000)\n>\n> Shyvana and Kha'zix as the two junglers?\n> \n> Did this happen 5 months ago?\n\nIt's quite recent in my game history actually.\n\nCheck the second Shyvana game from the top down. \n\nEDIT: Check above link for it. \n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Budupops,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-25T23:20:10.215+0000)\n>\n> oh so your that jg who literally never ganks/communicates and then starts splitpushing at 30 min in, sound like me s4 with d godyr{{champion:77}} {{item:3154}}\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is all champions have their strong points and weak points. If you get an Udyr or Shyvana as your jungler, they excel at hard core farming, then coming out ahead above every and wrecking havoc through sheer level and item differences. If you flame or force a jungler who plays in this manner to constantly gank, you're going to lose on the biggest value of said jungler. \n\nMuch like if an early game jungler does not gank early game, he's losing on the value of his jungler. Same principle. Just because you do not get paired with someone who likes early game pressure, does not mean you are automatically going to lose. It just means lanes need to be a tad more map oriented. \n\nIf anything, early game pressure junglers are losing more and more favor now, since games are now consistently going later and later.\n\nThere's a difference between lane pressure and ganking imo. Shyvana can not gank for shit. But she can apply lane pressure quite well. Of which I did plenty of during that game.\n\nMake no mistake, I didn't just sit in the jungle the entire game (The jungle creeps spawn timer is too high to be able to do that LOL) \n\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LifeCyclesTWA,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-05-25T23:25:59.981+0000)\n>\n> I've made this same thread many times.

So yeah, farm the damn jungle, and make your laners feel like pros when they get double-triple kills when the other team's starved under-leveled jungler tries to force a gank.\n\n\nYeah...Shyvana is one of my favorite to play in the Jungle too :\\ along with Diana, Skarner and Cho'Gath, none of which are known for their early game pressure. I've used Rammus a few times when I want early game pressure since he scales nicely into late game as well.\n\nI get flamed often for not pressuring early game, but my 60% or so win rate speaks for itself. What people don't realize about power farmers such as Shyvana and Master Yi is that if you allow them to power farm, they come out of the jungle incredibly scary, for Shyvana, nigh unkillable, for Master Yi, an unstoppable killing machine. \n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=manliestdino,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-25T23:50:55.544+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, I know certain junglers are better for farming and I tell my team they will make an impact.

I can't stand early game/pressure junglers because come late game, which so many games go to now since the introduction of Cinderhulk, you feel useless. Rather play with a mid or late game jungler now and sacrifice the early game strength.\n\nI absolutely hate playing against Shaco these days, not because he's strong or OP because his early game is super good, just like you said, he becomes useless late game, but because teammates generally don't seem to understand that an early game champion which has the ability to magically appear right behind him means they shouldn't push the damn wave so far up, or at least get a damn pink ward if you plan on playing aggressively. \n\nSeriously, when I say I have experience playing Shaco and that you should play safe for the duration of the early game, and they ignore me and proceed to flame me when I don't gank as often as Shaco, it irritates me. News flash: Shaco's only good period is the first 10 minutes of the damn game. Don't give him any kills in that period, he becomes weak. He can't power farm his way to Tiamat/Shiv.

Jg shy rather lacks the cc and can't trade over extended periods to whittle them down for kill pressure. It's why she's a better laner than jg. The addition of chilling smite gives her an early option tho, don't discount it. Most jgs should take chilling for the early game kill potential, laners who take smite want skirmishers for mid and late game duel potential. Understanding how to maximize the efficiency of everything you do is also key to moving up, from proper synergistic picks in lobby, to proper builds according to situation in game.\n\nShyvana is definitely better in top lane, that's for sure. However, I'm terrible in solo lanes, but excel in jungle, which is why I reside there :p\n\nI'll give the chilling smite a whirl next time I'm playing her, that makes pretty good sense.

I am, fortunately for you, an avid eve player for several seasons. This seasons eve I've found can be particularly effective ganking at lvl 3 after a partial clear or lvl 4 after a full clear. Her greatest strength lies in the ability to use her strategic invisibility to get into position to gank when other champs cannot. There is no such thing as a lane eve cannot gank, no matter what it's status, pushed, frozen, or pushing. If you are having trouble with early ganks then try this out: clear your first 3 camps for lvl 3 and back. This should only take about one minute of game time. Purchase chilling smite upgrade. Grab your next buff and head to which ever lane looks like the easiest opportunity. Get in position for the pincer move, clamp down, save smite for when they flash, pop w, secure first blood. Congratulations, you have just begun an eve snowball. Proceed to gank other lanes as long as you have a red buff, farm when you have a blue buff. If you cannot be successful on your very first gank as eve at 4 and a half minutes then eve is not a champ for you. Eve is a champ for those who like to snowball lanes, or herself, and is a very technical champion since her weaknesses vary dramatically at different points in the game and according to how she is built.","replies":[{"poster":"Clockwork Madoka","date":"2015-05-26T21:20:00.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jaymc1130,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3buQJFcI,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2015-05-26T18:55:38.914+0000)\n>\n> I didn't see this game I can only offer general advice.

W/ those numbers you're not talking damage to champs (that's usually between 20-50 k), and someone who farms heavy should ALWAYS have he most overall damage, bc they were doing damage the whole time to stuff that doesn't fight back. If you are gonna talk carry damage, then you need to reference damage to champs. Overall damage is a pretty pointless stat since CS/gold is more important for farming damage (doesn't matter if you damage stuff and don't get gold from it), and damage to champs is the stat that defines team fight damage. I definitely agree that a farming jungle is a different style and laners need to understand that IF the lanes are going mostly even, then the early game pressure jungle is getting out farmed and out scaled, and is thus losing hard. Similarly though I would say that jungles need to understand that when you pick a farming jungle and fail to apply any pressure early (obviously it will be less, but you can apply a little), then lanes getting crushed by their opponents when the enemy jungle ganks well and applies that early pressure, is not the lanes losing and letting you down, but the other jungle capitalizing on their power spike and beating you hard. It's like picking Nasus in top lane.

Understanding this and knowing how to adapt to it (which takes a lot of time and practice) is crucial to being good at the game.\n\nProblem is though, in the rest of your post you make the classic LoL player's error: assuming that you're the only person who can carry the team to victory. You're essentially saying; \"Why don't my teammates understand that if they just leave me alone and let me farm, once we hit the 25 minute mark, I can win the game for us?\" (And if that's not what you're saying then by omission you're essentially saying \"I picked a champion who is practically useless until late game, why don't my teammates understand that?\" which opens up a whole nother can of worms.)\n\nWhile you make a valid point about \"My teammates should know that if I get a lot of farm as Shyvana I'm unstoppable late game\" you also have this expectation that they're on board with you being the one carrying the team and don't mind altering their playstyles to set up that exact scenario. Furthermore you assume that the enemy team doesn't start winning lanes (possibly with the help of their early-pressure jungler) which could prevent you from farming even if your team was on board with it. TL;DR for this paragraph - You're making too many assumptions, and the thing you're really complaining about is lack of communication. Just checked your link, this was a team builder game, meaning you had the opportunity to tell your team how you were going to play before committing to the match, you should never expect your teammates to be psychic.\n\nIMO the jungler is the most important person on the team because they have the ability to control the pace of the game, and can make game changing plays, or game changing throws. (This is why I really don't like to jungle, I don't like the responsibility, although I love a lot of jungle champs.) But effectively since you control the pace of the game, by spending a long time powerfarming without ganking for your team, who are probably used to and expecting help from you so that they can achieve some early-game win conditions, you're essentially saying; \"I'm not ready to be the hero and carry us just yet.\" In effect you're holding your team hostage. It's not surprising that they'd be unhappy about that.\n\nYou also need to remember that the average LoL player is probably thinking the same thing about themselves; that they're the hero who will single-handedly win the game for your team. I personally think it would be great if we could erase this mentality altogether, but we know it won't ever happen, and sad to say, as important as the role is, the jungler is not usually the person who's \"expected\" to carry, they're expected to selflessly aid their teammates in much the same way as a support does. It's therefore not surprising that a teammate who sees a jungler farming instead of ganking might think you aren't interested in getting the win, or are at least selfishly looking to keep all the glory to yourself, then they might logically think you're a bad teammate.\n\nThis isn't a criticism of your skill or game knowledge, both are probably in a good place, but I feel like your communication is probably sub-par and your expectations of your teammates are probably too high, which actually could be solved with better communication. It'd be great if everyone had the same amount of game knowledge and could make certain assumptions based on certain things like champion selection, but that'll never be the case so sometimes it's just best to tell your teammates what you're doing.","replies":[]}]}
