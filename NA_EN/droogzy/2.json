Period. I know he fulfills the quote for LC$Bigplays, but its grown to a point where when I see someone play it, I just want to clap sarcastically and yell &quot;yaaaaaaay&quot;. I don&#039;t like when he&#039;s ahead, I don&#039;t like when he&#039;s behind. He&#039;s a terrible champion to watch and play against. At least LeBlanc, while kind of BS, has counter-play and requires thought process and thinking to do well. \n\nAnd this G2 v.s. OG game 3, at the end of the game, Graves, a fucking ADC has 3k health whereas the Maokai, a massive tank has 2.7k health. I understand resistance is important too (FH) but how in the world is this considered okay/balanced that an ADC can achieve 3k health while outputting a ridiculous amount of damage? This is just absurd. SoaZ wasn&#039;t exactly starved of gold either.","replies":[{"poster":"Hayaishi2","date":"2016-04-17T18:08:07.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc has counterplay and Zed doesn't? what?","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-04-17T18:16:34.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her damage and ability to kill you is tied to her gap closer, force her to use it to clear waves, she has no kill pressure on you and window of opportunity to harass opens up immensely. \n\nEither she has to use her gap-closer to wave clear then she loses kill pressure, if she doesn't use her gap closer to wave clear, you can use the minions to dodge her chains, she's pretty manageable actually in the right match up. \n\nNot only that, because she has near no wave clear, the classic strategy of forcing her under her turret so she can't roam is actually applicable, unlike Zed. \n\nThat and I've never seen a Leblanc regularly kill a tank a much as Zed. Her ratio and damage is contingent on landing everything to kill a squishy, whereas Zed can miss half of his shit and still AA someone to death. If Leblanc misses even half of her combo, then she doesn't get the kill, simple as that. Barrier really fucks her over. \n\nYeah, she's kind of BS, but she's most definitely capable of being dealt with if you understand the match up, I don't play midlane much/ever, when I do, I play Karma, but I beat a Leblanc the other day with freaking first time Zyra for shits and giggles cause they banned my Karma out. \nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/55482673#matches/2159599947\n\nShe's used frequently in LCS, but honestly I don't see her appeal. You can item build against her in this meta EXTREMELY well currently. If you're AP, you have access to abyssal scepter and zhonya and rylais to handle her, whereas for AD, you have Steraks and Maw on top of life-steal and god knows what else. Good luck trying to kill an AD with Leblanc in this meta. They seriously deserve the assassination if they are capable of doing so. \n\nShe has the ability to take out a carry the quickest of any champion, but that's her one and only function, you can use other champions who can take out carries, albeit not as efficiently, but then function well in other circumstances. \n\nYou take out a carry with Leblanc, what exactly are you going to do as Leblanc? Your objective taking is piss poor, your split pushing is piss poor, your turret seiging is piss poor. The only thing she has for her outside of her carry killing efficiency is good base AA damage. You literally can't capitalize on a kill with Leblanc unless you rely on other people being alive still. \n\nJust my two cents on her.
