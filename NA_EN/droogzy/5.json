It's not \"Support players should be the ADC's bitch\", it's \"People should work with their teammates if they're going to do something like duo-jungle Nunu\" - especially since such a tactic left a bunch of ADC's at a disadvantage because they were up against two people with practically no help for the first few minutes.\n\nAnd they're not consistently banning off-meta strategies, either. I mean, I don't see anything big popping up about some Malz Support being banned, do I? Singed and Nunu are edge-cases, it's not consistent, nor is it for the reason that they were off-meta: It's because they made their teammates miserable for the sake of winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PPPPPPPPPPPP270","date":"2017-02-28T19:16:32.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue of the current support champions is that supports have more income and slot efficiency. This makes the flaws of the role from previous seasons less noticeable and create supports that can scale well with items. You would never see a Zyra support in season 3 with actual AP items. Now you see rylais/liandry Zyra supports all the time and manage to get highest damage in the game with the least amount of gold.\n\nThe problem is normal traditional supports never really benefit with more AP or stats in general. They tried doing AP ratios on utility spells, but they were fairly insignificant or blatantly OP.\n\nRiot tries to fix this by adding super impactful active items like Zeke's Harbinger but it ended up being outdated the next season. Then this season introduced redemption and locket which is pretty much a must buy as the actives are insanely strong. While the stats they give are very lacking it made those actives more impactful than the actual support champion itself. \n\nMy idea of an ideal support champion is one that doesn't really need items to function with bad ratios but good bases. This way supports can be stronger than an ADC early game but not end up outperforming everyone else in terms of damage later on. Have spells be focused on more interesting effects instead of generic CC or shielding/healing. Items for supports would only function to give them a few extra options in team fights that isn't just use this active during a fight. Have it require actual timing to make it work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-02-28T18:11:56.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about making the intended champions of the support role more attractive. \n\nThe support is meant to support their team.

But there's something to be said about Riot's pigeonholing supports into the bottom lane and making it pretty much a bannable offense for someone to leave it just because the ADC doesn't like it.\n\nThere are more ways then one to support your team. Is it the best way? Not necessarily, but it shouldn't be a bannable offense that you want to support your team in a different way. Just as it shouldn't be a bannable offense when I used to run tankarma mid a few seasons ago (even though many people threatened to report me). \n\nNow full disclosure, I understand the reason behind the Singed ban, the guy was just being an asshole, this on the other hand, I'm just confused by. It's not a good look for support role to ban two players who are playing in support position in an unorthodoxed manner.
