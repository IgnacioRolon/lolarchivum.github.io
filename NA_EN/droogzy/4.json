The mistake Riot is making is far far worst then anything WoW and RS did. With those two games they just generally fucked up the game by not listening to players. No one was targeted in particular, it was one giant fuck up. \n\nRiot has specifically targeted a certain demographic of players in LoL, being solo players. Players like myself, and have essentially told all of us that we can fuck off and they do not give a rats ass for what we think.

Why play a worse version of champion select. That is why you see more ranked plays. If you had this new select in normal it would be one thing but they don't. This new select is only for DQ. So if I have 2 iPhones but one is the first version and the other is the newest version. Which version do you think most people will want if I start giving away the iPhones. \n\nOdds are the new version since there is only 2 to choose from. People always want what is new and fancy. This follows the same type of logic people will fall into DQ more cause they enjoy the new select system over the old one. Almost get 100% chance of getting your role if you que with 3-4 friends. Why would they not do that. Over even a 50/50 chance of getting your role if you solo unlike normal games. Why would people again not take the better que system. \n\nits like comparing a pile of shit to a cake with ice cream on top.
