Interrupting crucial targets with a well-timed Un-burrow is the kind of high moment we want the queen to have in her games, but its generous range often catches people it appears it would otherwise miss. She&#039;ll still have all the elements of a dominant jungle-beast, but will need to demonstrate higher precision to get the same results.\"\n\nThe thing that caught my eye in particular was: \"Rek&#039;Sai&#039;s found resilience transitioning into a knock-up machine once teamfights begin.\"\n\nYou know who this reminds me of? Elise, we all know what happened to her, she&#039;s pathetic right now. (Shout out to all you Elise mains, I don't know how to you deal with Riot's BS over her kit.)\n\nYou even acknowledged that she transitions into a knock up bot, if that is the case, the problem isn&#039;t that she is too powerful, the problem is, she&#039;s shoehorned into not being able to do much with her kit in the later stages of the game. Shouldn&#039;t that suggest she needs a power shift then? Not nerfs?\n\nRek&#039;Sai was not in the slightest overpowering, I don&#039;t make these comments because I play her, I haven&#039;t played her since her release even though I have her and I&#039;m a heavy jugler. \n\nIf anything, she was the first S-Tier jungler I&#039;ve ever seen whom when I see she is on the other team, but not only did I not mind, I enjoyed playing against her and enjoyed keeping track of where she was on the map, she was fun for both sides of the team.\n\nIt&#039;s a damn shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Profirix","date":"2015-07-08T00:22:55.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was really upset when I saw these nerfs. My anger is justified because Rek'sai used to be good at pretty much everything: damage, engage, survivability and she was rightly nerfed early on. What I think Riot is failing to consider with these constant nerfs is that Rek'sai is a very simple champion that now only does TWO things: knock enemies into the air and vision. The pros play her constantly because they can coordinate better than the rest of the community with their teams and utilize the repeated knock ups. Other than that, Rek'sai brings virtually nothing to the team. Her damage has been cut so far back to the point where the pros build her 100% tank (Not her initial design by the way! She was meant to be a tanky bruiser). \n\nShe is the one case where the win rate does not actually equal how effective she actually is. Too many games have I played where the team that picks Rek'sai loses because it is effectively a 4v5 because Rek'sai gets deleted before she can even get close to the team to utilize her short-lived knock up. Come to find out that they are nerfing her knock up radius even further. \n\nThe one thing you may not know is that the knock up radius is actually a double-circle. The outer radius is a shorter knock up, the inner a longer knock up. I am curious to know whether they shrunk the circle concentrically to shrink both circles or just the outer radius. Either way, I doubt she will be as effective in the LCS and I do expect her win rate to drop significantly, despite this being a seemingly minor change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Play Darius","date":"2015-07-07T23:28:43.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, Rek'Sai is going the way of Elise.

She was constantly on the move in the jungle and you had no idea where she was subsequently. \n\nAnd the reality of the situation is that beside the map pressure, which come teamfights, is somewhat not relevant, that's all she becomes, a knock up bot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-07-08T02:54:55.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SaltyKracka,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EIW5oeUy,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-07T23:33:05.608+0000)\n>\n> It's inevitable, really.
