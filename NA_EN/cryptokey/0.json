My idea is to receive extra rewards when earning Mastery's 8, 9 and 10. \n\nI understand that these goals do need to be tweaked a little so please, If you have any suggestions  leave a comment and please vote in the poll below. \n\n___________________________________________\n\n**How to reach Mastery Level 8?**\n> In order to reach Mastery Level 8, you must have the following requirements;\n\n> **75,000** Mastery Points or more \n> **4 S/S+** Mastery Tokens\n> **4500 Blue Essence -OR- 1 Champion Shard -OR- Permanent.**\n  \n> You must be Mastery Level 7 to advance to Mastery Level 8.\n\n\n**Rewards for Mastery 8:**\n\n> Earn new mastery badge emote, loading screen border flag, and announcement banner.\n>\n> **NEW: Earn an exclusive Mastery Icon for that champion.**\n\n> (Note: This Icon cannot be bought with RP/BE.)\n\n____________________________________________\n\n**How to reach Mastery Level 9: **\n> In order to reach Mastery Level 9, you must have the following requirements;\n\n> **150,000** Mastery Points or more \n> **5 S/S+** Mastery Tokens\n> ** 5100 Blue Essence -OR- 1 Champion Shard -OR- Permanent.**\n\n> You must be Mastery Level 8 to advance to Mastery Level 9.\n\n**Rewards for Mastery 9:**\n\n> Earn new mastery badge emote, loading screen border flag, and announcement banner.\n> \n> **NEW: Earn an exclusive Mastery Ward for that champion.**\n\n> (Note: This Ward cannot be bought with RP/BE.)\n\n____________________________________________\n\n**How to reach Mastery Level 10:  (Max Level)**\n> In order to reach Mastery Level 10, you must have the following requirements;\n\n> **300,000** Mastery Points or more \n> **6 S+** Mastery Tokens (Note: Not S, only S+)\n> **5700 Blue Essence -OR- 1 Champion Shard -OR- Permanent.**\n\n> You must be Mastery Level 9 to advance to Mastery Level 10.\n\n**Rewards for Mastery 10:**\n\n> Earn new mastery badge emote, loading screen border flag, and announcement banner.\n>  \n> **NEW: Earn an exclusive Mastery Skin for that champion. **\n\n> (Note: This Skin cannot be bought with RP.)\n\n____________________________________________\n\n**EDITS/UPDATES:**\n\n\n>**March 13th, 2017:**\n>\n> **UPDATE:** I understand that this is A LOT of stuff. I did see some good suggestions like maybe only 1 reward at level 10 and you get skin + icon, which is way more reasonable. \n>\n>Thanks for all the suggestions everyone! \n>\n> ____________________________________________\n>\n>**May 18th, 2017:**\n>\n> **UPDATE:** Removed Chorma-Packs, moved Mastery Icon to Level 9. I agree that this was a \"little\" too much. For level 8 you just win the normal rewards; mastery badge emote, loading screen border flag, and announcement banner.\n>\n> **UPDATE 2:** Decreased mastery points on level 8 to 75,000,  level 9 to 150,000, level 10 to 300,000.\n> ____________________________________________\n>\n>**February 19th, 2018:**\n>\n> **UPDATE: Added Exclusive Mastery Wards to Level 9 and switched Mastery Icons from Level 9 to Level 8.**\n>\n>**UPDATE 2:** Forgot to change BE values since IP was replaced with BE. New values are more corresponding with mastery's 6 and 7.\n\n\nMight as well delete this thread with the announcement of Eternals. Riot decided to take a different and questionable approach.

In the interest of submitting something useful about rewards though:\n\nat level 8 you could unlock a summoner Icon that pulls the splash from your current skin (they already have this feature in the HUD)\nat level 9 you could unlock a ward skin that looks like your champion doing their dance animation\nat level 10 you could unlock a mastery skin that is a slight recolor of the classic skin.  Maybe just make the colors a little extra deep, like when you amp up the saturation on a picture.\n\nAll of these could be done with relatively little effort on Riot's part, and I would honestly pay actual riot points for all of these.","replies":[]},{"poster":"L0LOL0LOLOL0L","date":"2017-02-01T03:15:00.885+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"maybe just no rewards until 10 and have an icon","replies":[{"poster":"CryptoKey","date":"2017-03-13T12:28:38.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, these might just be to much for Riot.
