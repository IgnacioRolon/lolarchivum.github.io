It was overshadowed by Evelynn's rework and Zyra's release though, both had happened in the same patch as Twitch's rework...\n\nMost people like to say every rework is a failure regardless of it actually was. Cass wasn't actually a failure since prior to her rework, she was a niche pocket pick that got destroyed by anyone who bought boots since while her Q did 80% of her AP with the same base (Currently does 45%, though rework had nerfed it down to 35%) it had a delay between .25s and .6ish second. It was unreliable and if anyone got boots, it was dodged easy, though most will complain anyways because it was like the old Nidalee spear, though a hundred times less reliable, BUT if you hit with that poison, it by itself would half life anything really and she still had the same E that she does now, so she had an 80% on her Q, 55% on her E, and her W had more base damage and did 5% AP per tick more back then. Her old passive was useless and her new one is now amazing. Honestly though, people just remember when she was reworked, the Cass that was brought had almost no damage and her passive was just playing Farmville by W'ing at minions then E'ing them for last hits to stack it. After she had her Q reliability fixed and it's AP ratio buffed, her E given a static ratio rather than 30%-60% based on ability level, plus her passive reworked again to be incredible and reward her for interacting with her enemies, she's been amazing. One of my friends mained Cass pre-rework and post and prefers the new one, but most would rather complain and demand the old 80% ratio so they can spam poisons from a distance and never have to worry about pressing W or E, just Q'ing and walking away. >>\n\nMorde is considered a failure just because of how toxic his kit is. It's got no CC, so playing solo with him is just... it's horrible since he has no mobility either. He's slower than hell and needs a Trinity or a Luden's PLUS a Rylai's to keep up on his target or else he's just Q'ing a minion twice then flashing over to AA+E+R for the kill on a squishy, which is as toxic as it gets. There's nothing satisfying about the new Morde other than pressing Q and then flashing at a squishy for a one shot. That's seriously it. He's got nothing rewarding in his kit for any kind of plays other than Flashing and landing the 3rd Q. Seriously. His kit sucks.\n\nKarma was considered a wonderful buff and also a failure. Why? Well, she's perfect kit-wise, but we lost the fans. Literally. We lost the fans. x.x We all miss the old Karma's fans and even though we love the new kit, we can't get over the loss of the fans. QQ\n\nEvelynn was considered a success at first, but as time has gone by, I'm pretty sure we can all agree we'd rather have the old 5 sunfire and Evelynn than the current one that's been nerfed every damn season since late season 2.\n\nI'd mention Trundle and Sej, but those were mostly visuals and we'd all agree they were successes.\n\nSion was a huuuuuuuge success.\n\nHeimer and Xerath are debatable. Heimer was well off before and now he's even more well off, so I'd say a success. Xerath before was a bit overly immobile and his passive gave him armor for AP, which was near worthless unless you were against a Talon, but even then you weren't doing so hot. So, I'd say a success.\n\nDarius, Garen, and Skarner are all doing incredibly well and just need number tweaks rather than a whole new kit (Cough, Morde, cough.) so I'd say they're all very, very successful. \n\nMiss Fortune had the world's worst rework to have ever been done. She was already at a low pick rate, but after they 'reworked' her, she became garbage tier and stayed at garbage tier until they finally added an AD ratio to her R. It took a year, but we're all pretty happy it finally happened again, though AP Miss Fortune mains will stay hate their life and wish for the old MF since there's still no AP ratio on the W. AP MF Mid will be missed. RIP SivHD AP MF.\n\nKatarina had a good rework. No one really complained about it, though we still get the backlash of people complaining that she's too easy and OP as heck, etc. etc., but I'd say compared to the old more AD looking kit, she's doing pretty well.\n\nAshe's rework was obviously a success... so much so that everyone wants the other ADC's to have her crit mechanics....\n\nJax never had an actual rework, but the loss of dodge was sort of a rework in itself... So, a success since he's still played?\n\nRyze has been reworked twice, so... I mean... Obviously one of the reworks was a failure, but I wouldn't say the new Ryze is all that great. He does really well, but eh.\n\nViktor's rework was so good, most have called him the Sleeper OP and have been waiting for huge nerfs. We haven't seen the nerfs, so a success so good that Riot hasn't acknowledged it yet?\n\nSona sorta got reworked and considering she's been nerfed to hell and back and hasn't seen much play at all, not even when her ultimate skin was released, I wouldn't say it was a success...\n\nSo... Well... The big reworks like Xerath, Heimer, Sion, Ashe, and Viktor, I'd say were successful. Their smaller ones though were mostly good, with a few exceptions like Morde who really wasn't reworked, he just had his E nerfed, W gained a heal, and his Q does a ton of damage while his entire problem, not being able to stick to a target or even get near it, wasn't fixed on purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Dalthine","date":"2015-10-23T15:15:12.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zair Umbras,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E07ldIdB,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2015-10-23T12:24:06.013+0000)\n>\n> [Cass's] old passive was useless...\n\nI mainly wanted to speak out about this. Her old passive was amazing, because once you had a tiny amount of mp/5 and fully stacked it, you basically never ran out of mana until you went in. I had a setup so that I could use q literally as soon as it was off cooldown from Lv.1 and not run out of mana until the first 10 minutes had passed. It also fit more into her original theme because it was more of a cadence and a dance until you went in, casting constantly to keep it stacked. \n\nAnd theming is one of the reasons Cass rework was considered a failure. They completely threw out her character, in addition to shifting her play style focus. \n\nTheming is also why many people consider the Karma rework a failure. Originally, all of her abilities gained a dual nature from being empowered by her ult. Support spells got damage, and damage spells got utility. Now much of that duality feels lost. There was also the \"living on the edge\" aspect of her passive, where she was strongest near death. \n\nThe other reworks people consider a failure as a whole are Sona and Morde, which you covered at least decently well. I would consider those two reworks on the same level as Heimer or Ashe though. They were not minor changes. \n\nBut people tend to fear reworks in general because people who like a champ do so for what they currently are. Nobody wants something they like to suddenly and massively change. There's the general dread of ruination that comes from reworks like the ones mentioned here, but you can see the general dread for it in the original post here. It's unknown what exactly will happen, but it's that very lack of knowledge that scares people. \n\nFor me, I'm probably more wary than most considering two of the failure reworks are champions that were some of my favorites before.","replies":[{"poster":"ElBoob","date":"2015-10-23T17:04:20.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also Trundle.

You were able to Q for days to half life the entire enemy team without even having to touch your W or E unless you were doing Dragon or Baron, which meant she not only could kill with her fishing ability, but she also could take objectives with her E and W. W does a surprisingly large amount of damage, pre-nerf and post-nerf, but getting things to sit in it is a bit difficult. Objectives like to stand in things, so she was able to 1v1 things like Dragon and Baron pre-rework with a WotA or with the old AP jungle item.

Of course he'd choose the original creator's design over what people had titled her themselves. Brackhar always wanted her to be the type to land a spell and quickly go in for the kill, destroying her targets rather than just fishing with the Q from range. I'd guess since Brackhar had left May of 2014, he kept it to Brackhar's wants as a respect thing. I know I'd do it.

But instead of choosing one identity or another, they just decided to make him a CC Tank.\n\nMany people regard this as one of the greatest reworks Riot has done.\n\nMany people would also have never played Sion pre-rework and, thus, don't really have grounds to judge the change so much as what we got from it.\n\nTo those who really liked playing AD Crit Sion pre-rework, the rework completely missed who he was previously.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2015-10-25T01:29:45.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Sion pre-rework.

If I was being generous, I'd say they kept 20% of his kit. And I'm fairly certain that Sion wasn't defined by his exploding shield.","replies":[{"poster":"Kaeblen","date":"2015-10-25T03:04:14.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new passive is also based on his old ult (toned that down a bit, hehe).\nThey gave him _**A**_ stun, but not the one he had before.\nConsidering new abilities that are **similar** but not matching raises the percentage a bit, but I'm guessing nobody was going to argue by saying his play style is the same as before.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2015-10-23T21:15:11.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blade of Justic,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E07ldIdB,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-10-22T22:32:02.499+0000)\n>\n> \"We feel that, much like with Sion, Shen has a weak identity.

Yeah, that's exactly what they did in that case, lol. Wish more people would realize that. New Sion is fun to play, but he's nothing like Old Sion. That's why I'm super worried about champions like Poppy, Urgot, Taric, and Yorick, who were all said to be given Sion level reworks in the near future. Thanks for explaining though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2015-10-23T16:43:16.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF MY MAIN CERTAINLYTRASH {{champion:98}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jixx","date":"2015-10-22T18:26:53.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are going to try to stick to his theme and keep everything but try to change the Q and W a bit, make it a little more interesting.
