[Zoom-Out Functionality]","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Please seriously consider allowing players to zoom out further by default akin to Xerath and Jhin&#039;s ultimates.  I&#039;ve considered the pros and cons, as seen below. \r\n---------------\r\n**Pros**\r\n\r\n- Helps out locked camera players to an incredible extent. I cannot stress how much it would help. I know people usually have no sympathy for locked-screen players, but there are many who just can&#039;t adjust to the camera system, and this would be a kind gesture which does no harm to the rest of the player-base. This is a significant limitation for me, and some others when it comes to the LoL experience. I&#039;ve been playing locked-screen since Season 3. \r\n\r\n- Presumably not difficult to implement. We&#039;ve already seen it applied to Xerath and Jhin&#039;s ultimates. I assume you&#039;d just change a few camera-related global variables to bigger numbers. \r\n-------------------------\r\n**Cons**\r\n\r\n- Takes out a certain perceived difficulty or challenge. It&#039;s a skill to maneuver your camera properly and balance it with your mechanics. That said, it&#039;s a pretty artificial difficult. It doesn&#039;t arise from the game-play, it&#039;s a by-product of the interface. I believe it would just come down to some older players feeling slightly cheated \r\n\r\n- This quote from Riot jinxylord - &quot;Zoom outs can only go so far before things start looking bad, FPS goes down, and possible buggy stuff gets more prevalent.&quot; The quote is taken from a thread where somebody wanted Xerath&#039;s ult-range increased. From the quote, it appeared that zooming out up to a range of 3500 (Jhin/Xerath&#039;s ultimate range)  is acceptable for current technology, but not more. I&#039;d appreciate the zoom going as far as possible, but it doesn&#039;t even have to be 3500 units, just increase it to whatever you feel is fine in terms of textures/FPS/bugs. Just increase it, please. \r\n---------------\r\nThis topic is brought forth from time to time, but is never really considered because there isn&#039;t enough demand for it. According to statistics, there isn&#039;t much demand for the customizable item-sets either, but wouldn&#039;t it be nice to cater to certain niches of the community?  I&#039;d be able to fight properly in the jungle, and actually see what&#039;s going on in team-fights. More so than mechanics, or map awareness, or strategy, this would result in the biggest improvement to my performance in games. ** Please seriously consider this matter. It would be the single most important improvement to LoL for me, and some others.** Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"463","date":"2017-02-13T15:24:40.270+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a personal issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Cynical Rain","date":"2017-02-13T15:29:19.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a personal issue, but the topic has been brought up from time to time throughout the years.

This zoom-out feature has significantly less demand, but it does exist. You can search google for threads like this, and you'll see many over the years. I made one years ago as well, but gave up on it since people argued against it, just like they're doing now. \n\nThis difference this time around is that Jhin/Xerath's ultimates have been implemented. When I first suggested the idea, even that wasn't there. Now there's a concrete idea of what it would look like. It's pretty depressing how people shoot down something as long as it's not relevant to *them*.

If you're not against that then I no longer have an argument.  Your champ would basically at least need to constantly have a red range indicator on the ground.\n\nJhin and Xerath are rooted for the entire duration and there is a ground indicator telling the entire enemy team through FoW where they are if they want to jump them while ulting.\n\nThat's why Nami and Ashe are picked so frequently into them.  Both are basically yelling \"free long-range skillshot hit through FoW here!\"\n\nYes, it sounds dumb and excessive, but that would more than likely be the gameplay cost.","replies":[{"poster":"Cynical Rain","date":"2017-02-13T16:08:59.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand any of the comparisons you just made with champions.

I wouldn't stay zoomed out all the time anyway, only when I need to. Imagine zooming out like Jhin's ult and trying to play Yasuo. You might misclick minions for your dashes, you wouldn't be able to estimate whether or not your q will hit because the range at that zoom is too small. Nobody is going to stay zoomed out forever.

As seen in Jhin's and Xerath's ultimates, fog of war remains when you're zoomed out.

They'll be so entranced by it you'll probably be able to walk right next to them without them noticing.\nAnother example is let's say you're playing mid and ping \"missing\" but your laner still roams bot or top and kills them.

You need to ping missing on mid and then danger at the very tips of both rivers for them to actually notice the roam.","replies":[{"poster":"Cynical Rain","date":"2017-02-13T15:56:17.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing since S3, so about 4 years.
