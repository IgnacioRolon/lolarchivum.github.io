From what I&#039;ve noticed, people who are toxic tend to care more about winning. There are exceptions obviously but this is what I can tell from my ranked experience. As long as someone pulls their own weight I don&#039;t care if they&#039;re flaming, so long as they don&#039;t just start inting. Mute exists for a reason.\r\n\r\nPeople who play bad are whatever, it&#039;s just a bit annoying losing due to 1 or 2 players playing poorly when they clearly could have played better.","replies":[]}
