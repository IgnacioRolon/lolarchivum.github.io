What she&#039;s melee? that doesn&#039;t really count at all.\r\n\r\nAdd to this she never really has a weak point at any point in the game, champions like poppy etc are know to have powerful late games but in return have a weak early game or vice versa, with champions having strong early games but weak late games.\r\n\r\nBut with Riven can you honestly ever say she has a super weak point? only thing i could ever think of is if early game vs a ranged champion but even then she would do better than some such as Garen, etc that have no way to do anything to a ranged top laner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRiven could really use with a rework or major tuning cause at the moment its not fun to have a champion that can dash almost constantly and then insta kill you with no clear counter-play or weakness, and really needs to be tuned and weakened or opened up to counter-play with which to go against her with.","replies":[{"poster":"68636949_DEL","date":"2015-08-06T21:45:38.759+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":46,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Prospector Pete","date":"2015-08-06T22:10:14.183+0000","up_votes":29,"down_votes":4,"body":"Oh.

You won't run away without burning flash and it's super hard to chase with him. Meanwhile, Riven can easily avoid skillshots, enter teamfihts easily after tanks engage with her mobility and CC, can easily get away even without flash and has superior chasing potential.

We cannot assume perfection outside a tournament. \"She out-trades everyone with few exceptions\" why are you purposely dismissing counters with this statement? There are skill match-ups, like Jax, and Olaf (yes, even now). Then there's people that straight screw her up, like Garen until his rework, Renekton, and Darius until his rework. Then there's the non-melee champions (beceause top isn't melee-only like some top-laners want it to be) like Lissandra that Riven can do fuck-all about, and who has much better teamfighting on top of that. \n\nThis is the game of outplays. You win or you die. Riven punishes mistakes, but she can't do near as much against better play, or countered play. She is made of glass and sand, with her sword being the only steel object about her. If you want to willfully dismiss counters and counterplay options by saying \"But a good Riven can circumvent it!\" then you can go ahead and do that, but remember that just about every champion in the game has ways of circumventing weaknesses.

If she uses her cooldowns on you (she will) then now YOU dictate where the fight will go. If you want to start killing her at this point, all she has to try and say otherwise will be auto-attacks. Most champions that she counters can't deal with the damage in the first stage of Riven's assault, however, if someone could do so then they would have complete control over her cooldown phase. She is melee, and blew all of her dashes and 90% of her damage on you just a second ago. Punish her for it. If you let her walk away after she bursted you then of course she's going to win. \n\nShe is completely and utterly reliant upon her mobility to accomplish anything at all because all of her abilities have fairly short range. Ki Burst has fairly low base damage (170 at Rank 5) and has a .75 second stun on 125 range. That is extremely short. If she can't auto-attack you, she can't Ki Burst you. It is 200 range under the influence of her ult, to keep in line with her AA distance. The knock-up on her third Q is in a 150 range radius (225 under the influence of her ult). That is, again, really, really short. If you can keep away from her even through her mobility then you'll have very few problems with Riven's damage because that mobility allows access to 90% of her damage. The alternative is to be able to out-trade her, and while fewer people can do that, more people can keep away from her reliably enough to she can't do much to them. \n\nShe is literally made of glass. If she builds tanky, her base damage is just barely par for the course. If she builds glass cannon, her damage is high but she is squishy as all hell, as damage dealers are wont to be. She has to be in your face to do that damage, and the mobility and shield help her to do that. Her shield is her main form of defense, and it only lasts 1.5 seconds. Wait it out, then, again, dictate the fight afterward. She is a front-loaded champion. Wait for the front to pass you buy and take out the unarmored hind section.\n\nNot only is all of this important, but she's also combo reliant. If you can keep her from reliably using her Q combo on any single person then nobody will take significant damage, thanks to it only doing 90 (+60% AD) for the individual hits. Hard CC screws with her in a way unique to champions like herself and Vayne, in that CC screws with them, as it screws with everyone, however, because they don't have instantaneous damage then a CC allows whoever is being targeted to reposition themselves and force Riven to try to find someone else to hit with the remaining now-lackluster damage, similar to how Vayne will have to find someone else to proc Silver Bolts on. This is part of why Garen can fight her so easily: he silences her, disrupting her combo and flow of the fight, and deals damage continually, even when she has him CC'd. You can't stop Justice.\n\nNow, on to people that can fight her given these weaknesses: Garen, Olaf, Kennen, maybe Teemo depending on how the match-up plays out, Darius, Renekton, Cho'gath, Irelia (skill-based, again), Lissandra, and a few more I'm sure I'm forgetting. \n\nShe has weaknesses.

I've only seen here competitively twice, once by Fnatic and once by NME, and those are NA and EU teams. Riven doesn't have low cooldowns, she achieves 40% cdr through items and masteries. I guess she doesn't have a weak point during the game if it only last 25 mins, but once you actually reach a real late game and have to compare her performance to champions like Nasus and Jax late game, I'd say she pretty weak late assuming you have an actual front line. She might get nerfed when the weaker armor items hit live, but a rework I doubt it.","replies":[{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-08-07T13:57:55.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weaker armor items will be an indirect buff to Riven because she build damn near full AD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VDc0zCqe0w","date":"2015-08-07T17:01:08.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YCitizenSnipsY,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Xp7RvJBl,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-08-06T23:16:10.622+0000)\n>\n> Who's running Riven in the LCK or LPL?
