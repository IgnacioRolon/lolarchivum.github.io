Remember also that he is more of a mage than a bruiser(in most cases). Don't let his larger-than-average health bar scare you, he is still very weak to strong dps and being picked off. Oh and he has no scaling mr, so your apc should melt him. Morello's hurts him too.\n\nIn lane you should be punishing him before he gets WotA. His sustain isn't actually that great at just revolver. His q isn't maxed out and he has no cdr, meaning he can't keep up his e stacks without hurting himself. Pushing him in early can force him to use e when he can't afford to early.\nYou can bait his pool and just walk away when he uses it to win a trade. It's health cost is pretty big.\n\nYou can counterpick him with champs that have strong kill potential in lane, such as Jax, Wukong, Irelia, Riven, Cho'Gath Pantheon, Xin Zhao(absolutely destroys Vlad) or tanks that can brush off his poke and scale well, such as Maokai, Sion, Malphite, Nasus, Hecarim, Mundo.\n\nIf none of this helps just pick Swain or Malz.

Are you trying to win lane, or solo kill him?\n\nIf you are trying to solo kill him, having someone with an extreme amount of burst early on is going to be a good thing. Rengar's level two burst is nearly unmatched, if you run AD runes and 21/9 masteries. Someone with sustain and sustained damage may also not be a bad idea. The first two that come to mind are Trundle and Fiora, since they can just repetitively all in Vladimir again and again.\n\nIf you're trying to win lane, then all you need to do is survive, be more useful, and come out of your lane stronger. Any champion that can farm safely away from his poke will be a good idea, as well as anyone that can out sustain him. Since a majority of my experience is with Rengar, I can personally attest that you can win lane by rushing a Spirit Visage and maxing W first. You out sustain him, out trade him, and roam better than him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Martyrofsand","date":"2015-06-05T13:12:24.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst damage.
