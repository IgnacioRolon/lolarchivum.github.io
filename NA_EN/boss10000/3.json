Silence doesn't stop a spell mid-cast delay; try silencing/stunning/suppressing a Ryze while he's going through Overload's animation, and the spell will still complete. Try blinding someone when their basic attack animation is finishing, and the attack will still land.\n\nThis is systemically *normal.* This is *supposed to happen.*","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"General Elephant","date":"2015-04-19T04:08:28.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will I escape a hard leona engage as corki? Right,now his W can be cast as she snares you and procs stun mid flight and you still travel the full distance, and the stun duration starts mid flight, so by the time you land, the stun is almost done XD\n\nTbh though it is a bit unfair because it means leona has no way to get her full lock down combo in before a corki uses valkyrie, and even if she gets the AA stun it is basically worthless because his flight is uninterupted","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-04-18T23:48:56.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this. Champions are already harder to hit when dashing, yet CCing them mid-dash just causes them to eat up a portion of your crowd control while still moving. Catching an opponent in the middle of a gapcloser should feel rewarding, and should waste the dash rather than the CC.","replies":[]}]}
