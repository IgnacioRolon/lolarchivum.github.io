So, I'm not able to say if there is/isn't a new Twitch skin in the works (Sorry!)\n\nKingpin Twitch is a legacy skin, which means he will come back periodically, although, I don't know when he's coming back next. Keep an eye out for him the next time the Legacy Vault opens.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have plans to bring back Medieval Twitch. He's a limited skin that was earned via Refer-a-Friend (RAF). Players had to refer 5 friends who reached level 10 or higher. [Here's](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/refer-friend-retires-thirty-days) a bit more context on the retirement of the skin. Similarly, Grey Warwick was also retired during this time, and is also a limited skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellpyre","date":"2016-06-22T17:18:01.003+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I referred all my friends back when you needed 350 for medieval twitch T.T","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-06-22T17:28:37.204+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"O__O","replies":[{"poster":"Rude Name","date":"2016-07-15T04:48:34.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will there, uh, be another way to get this skin?\nIt's taunting me, because I have slowly, after several years, accumulated all the other Twitch skins.\nI tried my hardest to get the skin whilst the opportunity was there, but missed out.\nI know there's no plans, but when there are, could you keep in mind how hard is is for some people to get it?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-15T22:55:50.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, there isn't another way to get this skin. I can't speak to what may happen in the future, but at this time, he's locked away. We do realize that some content is harder to get than others, and that's a tricky line to walk. \n\nWe have made steps towards trying to walk said line, both trying to make players who already own x content, while also allowing newer players to obtain the skin - Championship Riven, for example.\n\nWe are working on a plan to bring Championship Riven back for Worlds this year. \n\nSpecifically, we are looking for a solution that satisfies both existing owners and players who love the skin but were unable to get it the first time around. This is tricky because while players love the skin for the content, while others value it more because she’s rare. \n\nWe've discussed a handful of options but haven't settled on one.","replies":[{"poster":"Rude Name","date":"2016-07-19T09:47:36.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome! I suppose that makes sense, and it's fair enough. Twitch is a darling champ for me, and I will do a lot for that skin. Personally, I believe it's better to err on the side of rarity, which you have been doing, which is admirable. \nBecause ultimately, if people want a skin really badly, **they should be willing to go to lengths much further than others**.\n\nJust out of curiosity, how do you think this applies to the Hextech loot? \nSome people poured in countless dollars and hours to grab the Hextech Annie/SS Vayne, and now that it's become a bit easier, would those who worked for the skin be upset about this? \nThen again, those skins are always available, so rarity isn't so much a factor as is time invested.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-20T19:26:49.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree - I think it's cool to have something that's a bit more rare. It's neat to load into a game with something you feel is special. :)\n\nHe's currently not available in Hextech/Loot. In fact, no limited skins are currently available. \n\nIt's not a matter of who worked on it, it's more a matter of making it fair to players who earned the content prior v. fair to players who want the content, as I'd mentioned before. \n\nI do think it'd be interesting to see something like Medieval Twitch in Hextech because he was available to players via a system as well. This would be an interesting conversation to have, actually. \n\nYou're right - SS Vayne and Hextech Annie are always available, it's just a matter of obtaining them through a system.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Presently Absent","date":"2016-06-23T02:27:07.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exterminator/Fumigator/Hazmat Twitch pleeaaaaasssseeeeeee pretty pretty please with moldy cheese on top <3","replies":[]}]}]}
