When it happened to me I was in a 5 man team on ARAM. Unlocking the BOOST didn&#039;t allow me to lock in the PROJECT: Zed, instead just locked me Shockblade.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-09-10T18:39:41.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sapphire06,\n\nWhen you purchase a skin boost, a skin is selected at random, you're not able to pick the skin yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-09-11T22:14:19.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this something that can be changed? It's pretty dumb to be honest that you can't choose.

We'll take a look into this. ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sapphire06","date":"2015-09-11T02:28:23.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Katey!!
