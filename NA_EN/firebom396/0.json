I usually would get 90 - 100 fps during the game and im not sure how to fix it. I have tried all the options on fixing fps drops from the league of legends like updating drivers, making the video options lower etc. I think its the game that is bugged making the fps low.","replies":[{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-07-18T22:03:02.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did the update turn on vsync when you previously had it turned off?","replies":[]}]}
