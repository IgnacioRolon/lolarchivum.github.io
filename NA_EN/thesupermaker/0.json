When i launched this morning I hoped right into a ranked game because I didn't expect anything to happen. I got through the champion select perfectly fine but when I got into the loading screen i would see if for a brief second then it would be replaced by black flashing bright and dark. I tried restarting my client but when I joined again the problem still continued. I tried restarting my computer but no fix. I then uninstalled and reinstalled league of legends but even that did not fix this problem. I don't know what to do. I have never had a problem like this in my life before so please help me out because I am totally lost for what to do. I use windows 10. I don't know what else to say. Please help!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-15T17:48:58.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be caused by a number of potential issues.
