Most of the time, packet loss is either caused by local network settings that conflict with League or a routing issue before your connection hits our servers. Before we take a closer look at your route with a detailed traceroute, I recommend going through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local settings are fine.\n\nLet me know if this caused any change.","replies":[]}]}
