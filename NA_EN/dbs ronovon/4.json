I buy skins. \r\nLets say another person doesn't have any money. Do they buy skins? \r\n\r\nIf I buy skins, and the other guys doesn't, then are we equal? \r\nDid both of us pay equally, and is that a class system because I bought things and supported Riot financially?\r\n\r\nWhere do people get this crap mentality from where everything has to be equal, and there is no thought behind it?\r\n\r\nSo, if I were to get banned, and the penniless guy got banned, guess what, I would lose money, and he wouldn't. \r\nSo, how would that be any different than implementing a fine system, where Riot locks your account for being dumb, and you can make THE CHOICE to pay it, and unlock your account, JUST LIKE YOU MADE THE CHOICE TO BUY SKINS!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nYou spend money either way. \r\nNo one is equal. \r\nAn account with purchases isn't equal to an account without purchases, because money was spent! \r\nunless you think money doesn't matter, and riot doesn't want any of it, and they will stop selling skins, and we can all get them for free and be equal together magically, because that is equality right?","replies":[]}
