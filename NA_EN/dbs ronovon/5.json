Fanboy defined.","subforum":"General Discussion","up_votes":2,"down_votes":18,"body":"This is supposed to be a forum, but really its a popularity contest where everyone thinks they are supposed to get up votes and likes, so they \n(fanboys)  just prevent any real critical discussion about whats wrong with league of legends including the: \n\nchanges in gameplay\npenalties ( extreme, shouldn&#039;t be in a game period )\nMMR (Both lack of transparancy, why, and its unfairness) \ncompetitiveness (or lack thereof completely) \nLPQs (for the game breaking at no fault of the player)\nnerfs &amp; buffs to champs\nchanges in the landscape (jungle fruit) \ncomeback mechanics ( i.e. Shut down gold) \nThe Honor system ( underhanded motives )\n\nSo instead of having real discussions, people just call posts about these things trolling, or flaming, and they pat each other on the back ganging up on people who don&#039;t love, support, and only have positive things to say about the game, Rito, and the developers. What? Am I supposed to grovel at their feet for playing the game and buying tons of RP and skins and seeing the game sucks and isn&#039;t fun because of the aforementioned topics? \nNo way jose. \n\nI can&#039;t stand the &quot;fanboyism&quot; its not something that should even exist on a real forum, because it only detracts from the forum and the game as well. The funny thing is, all you fanboys are making the game worse by allowing the Devs to get away with being lazy and hurting the players by catering to the small select group of people who want to have their little buddy club on League. Good job guys/girls. \n\n\nHere is how you know you&#039;re a fanboy:\n\nA person who carries their fandom outside of a normal sphere. \nThey allow their fandom to define them as a person.\nThey allow their fandom to determine who their enemy in life is.\nThey refuse to rebut, they defend blindly.\n\nA fanboy treats their product like its a person. \nThey defend it like its a child. \nThey become aggravated when the product is attacked.\n\nThey have gone beyond liking something, to letting it define them.\n{{champion:45}} \n\nhttps://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/832/495/454/","replies":[]}
