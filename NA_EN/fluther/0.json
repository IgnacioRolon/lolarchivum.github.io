He cant see the club he started from when clubs just came out, called Desu Desu Desu club tag POMF!. His Ign and presumably login name as well is ihackettu. I believe hes had this problem for most of the time clubs have been out, and hes trying to get 5 members for a new club but that just seemed like alot more effort than writing this to help fix it","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2018-01-12T00:54:16.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I've tried to sync the club to see if that helps.

I don't know exactly when it happened, or why. I believe the club name was \"Hawaiian Style\" or something along those lines, and I don't remember whether or not it had a tag. I didn't have anyone else in the club other than myself. What exactly is his problem? Is the club no longer there, or is he unable to access the Clubs tab?","replies":[]}]}
