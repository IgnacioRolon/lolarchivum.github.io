{"poster":"Unnamed Feeder","date":"2018-01-22T16:33:01.879+0000","title":"The boards is not serving its intended purpose, and both Riot and the players are responsible","subforum":"Discuss the Boards","up_votes":109,"down_votes":13,"body":"The boards were meant to be a place for constructive discussion. They were meant to be a place where players and Rioters alike could discuss gameplay, the game&#039;s story, memes regarding league, or have discussions in general. They were meant to be where Riot could take genuine feedback and change the game accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis is nothing near the reality of the boards.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the boards consist of circlejerking, unsupported complaints, and even personal attacks. The boards, excluding the memes boards, has earned an extremely negative reputation as well (both within boards and outside of them), where the gameplay board is memed to be nothing but circlejerking, upvote farming, and whining.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Riot responses are scarce at best. The majority of Riot posts are in the story or memes boards, where they generally can&#039;t get negative feedback. The biggest problem, is, however, that Rioters _avoid answering controversial questions_. It was part of Hashinshin&#039;s rant video as well, and I personally feel that it&#039;s very true. Last year, out of the thousands of threads that complained adc and support items were too strong, several hundred of them actually had very valid points. I only remember one or two actually getting a red tracker. To name a more recent example, in Meddler&#039;s QGTs in January 19 which talked about counterplay, I asked him what he thinks the counterplay to adcs are, because I was genuinely curious on Riot&#039;s stance on that. Again, no response. It&#039;s almost as if I have to choose between getting a Rioter response, or asking a hard question that I really want to know the answer to.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the problem comes in: **a lot of very constructive and informative posts also get completely ignored.** A somewhat recent example is this one, which talks about how CertainlyT&#039;s champions are very toxic and how the poster thinks he&#039;s not fit for champion design:\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/iZ7MG70x-i-personally-think-that-certainlyt-is-not-fleshed-out-for-the-leagues-design-philosophy?sort_type=best\r\nI myself commented on this post, hoping that with how constructive this original post was, it would get a Rioter response on how they would act according to this feedback. But, alas, it didn&#039;t. Granted, it was close to new year, but I personally think it wasn&#039;t approached because it talked about a very controversial thing: CertainlyT&#039;s unhealthy champions, something Rioters almost NEVER admit. To see how it didn&#039;t get a response just because it was a hard topic is just sad to me, and shows how the boards are not fulfilling their purpose.\r\n\r\nI personally think that both the players and Riot are responsible for the current mess of the boards. Based on observation, both their faults creates a horrible downward spiral that just gets worse and worse:\r\n\r\nThe players want a controversial topic answered. However, since it is a controversial topic, Riot doesn&#039;t respond to it. This makes the players agitated and angered they don&#039;t get a response. More and more threads follow, and the threads turn less constructive and more angered and sometimes offensive. And now, because Rioters fear they are going to get witch hunted or quoted as the official &#039;stance&#039; of Riot, they will avoid answering even further. And so this spiral continues until it gets worse and worse. This could be seen quite clearly regarding the topics of adcs mid season 2017, ardent censer, and the rengar rework.\r\n\r\nSo the player&#039;s fault in tl;dr form is that they get agitated and the content turns more offensive and less constructive. This causes Rioters to stay away, as the circlejerkers will cause a witch hunt on the Rioters no matter what.\r\nRiot, meanwhile, is justifiably afraid of some players witch hunting them and using their comments out of context, and (this is the problem) avoids answering the hard questions, even in threads that provide nothing but constructive criticism and supported opinions. Ultimately, a lot of very good discussion potential is wasted and the boards are not serving their intended purpose.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the best we can do to solve this issue is to provide a more welcome environment, using less combative language and keeping all criticism constructive and not too offensive, even if the topic itself is quite controversial. Perhaps that would encourage them to speak out more. And it would be best if the good players appropriately discouraged others from abusing Rioter responses.\r\n\r\nAnd if this post is read by a Rioter, my plea to Riot is: please respond more to the controversial questions. The boards are the official website made by Riot to DISCUSS gameplay; we should be able to have discussions on adc strength, game pacing, CertainlyT champion pool, and so on, as long as we keep discussion civil, constructive, and within the boards. Honestly, I would prefer responses like &quot;We understand how the boards feel, but based on surveys and foreign servers, a large majority of players think adcs are very balanced&quot; (if it actually IS the case) over not being responded to at all. I would guarantee you that a lot of people in the boards are good people, and that the intention of the boards is not to publicly humiliate Riot.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my read on the current state of the boards, and I hope over time, it can be what it was originally meant to be.\r\n\r\ntl;dr the boards are not fulfilling its intended purpose. Riot is justifiably scared of their responses being witch hunted and abused, so they avoid difficult questions. Meanwhile, the players get agitated about the lack of responses and the posts become more offensive and less critical and respectful. This tragic spiral lead to this suboptimal state of the boards today.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-01-23T00:04:57.118+0000","up_votes":54,"down_votes":5,"body":"Okay here is a possibly controversial personal opinion from a Rioter perspective: \n\n**I don't think it's ever appropriate for a Rioter to comment on another individuals' work.

And among the 'constructive' posts, the two are then categorized into 'constructive normal' or 'constructive strong language', where the latter posts offer critical and positive feedback but using stronger language. In my opinion, Kasarana's post regarding CertainlyT champs linked above would be categorized into 'constructive normal', while this post itself would be categorized into 'constructive strong language'. Although I say in my original post that combative language is bad, strong language that criticizes gameplay and gameplay alone (and NOT Riot directly) is fine.\n\nI don't have a lot of boards experience so I'm not sure this would work, and it would be a bit more tedious, but that's just my quick thought.","replies":[{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2018-01-23T05:20:30.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on it.

You have the \"Classic\" style, or the \"bump\" style, which is what the old forums followed. Then you have the \"Reddit\" style, making use of the Upvote/Downvote system.\n\n*Both* of these do not offer a good environment for what the Boards are trying to accomplish, for they both favor favoritism. If you like a thread, you either bump it, or upvote it. If you don't like it, you don't comment, or downvote it. As much as we want people to upvote based on the discussion, it simply will not happen. I have upvoted threads that I have disagreed with, but I will admit (as I'm sure everyone else will as well, including you, Kempyrean) have abused the system to try and keep a thread they don't like from getting to the front page.\n\nSo.....in order to accomplish what the Boards want to do, we have to develop a system that promotes discussion, but can't be manipulated........which is a hell of a lot easier said than done.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to fix, and it will need alot of brainstorming from several people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Calad","date":"2018-01-23T02:00:49.546+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree on the whole.

The red tracker helps for in the boards and the red tracker extension for browsers helps on reddit but there are other places answers are given that some players may never see. A decent chunk of the posts could be removed from the boards just by having the answers more available to the playerbase. That alone may reduce the hostility of the boards.\n\nRegarding controversial topics I do think Riot does answer them or at least look at them but the responses given too them are either too late or too far past the point where the topic has turned hostile, or the other reason is the topic is brought up internally and then forgotten by the team to answer it due to taking too long to find an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBurst","date":"2018-01-23T13:30:38.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a lose-lose situation for Riot.

Now if they are going to be answered or responded to in a large manner like Ask Riot down the road, that's great, but if they aren't it seems like a bit of a problem that it isn't answered.\n\nI think there are three other problems with the way the boards as a community and a webpage works right now that weren't mentioned (at least directly if at all).\n---\nTldr on this section: People don't know who does what, or what your title mean all the time (or even what all departments there are). The boards also doesn't give us a clear or easy way to contact the right Rioter. Also some questions are hard to know on who to ask department-wise.\n\nThe first is that Rioters keep saying we can't comment on this particular post because it isn't our department. And that is fair. The problem with this however is that many players don't know which specific Rioter does what field. I couldn't even look up all of you and figure it out with the wiki or something if I wanted to spend that time. Figuring out if that Rioter uses the boards is another problem too, not to mention the chances of them seeing my particular post/mention. I don't think it is quite fair to keep saying that without acknowledging that your webpage does not allow for an easy method of directing questions to certain departments or people. I've noticed the addition of titles next to Rioter names, and I'm guessing this is a step towards that direction, but I would suggest taking it a step further. One option to use as a start for an idea (although maybe not appealing) would be to make those titles hyperlinks to another boards page (like gameplay, memes & games...) for that department and allowing people posting on the boards to tag that department.\n----\nTldr on this section: People don't have strong emotions for nice posts and thus they don't get as much visibility, from the community, or Riot.\n\nAnother issue is visibility. What I mean by this is, as has been noted by either you, the moderator in here, or the creator of this post (can't remember, and a little lazy right now), making posts with a negative/angry tone always creates higher views and more responses. This in turn causes the non-negative views to just be sort of ignored and left at 2-5 upvotes and is never given the chance to get anywhere near the front page and be viewed by a Rioter. This too feeds into this vicious cycle we have here on the boards, where new players wanting to give constructive feedback are dissuaded because people don't upvote nice posts here, in fact some people downvote any non-toxic post. And this problem two is two-fold. On the community side of things, people aren't willing to acknowledge a nicer post as much as they would if it was a bit meaner. And on Riot's end, it seems that not many Rioters pay attention to the new feed. \n-----\nUnfounded speculation time: This may be due to Riot not wanting t spend a lot of time on the boards and thus focusing only on the hot feed posts, which if the case sucks because that would mean they aren't giving the time to an outlet they gave the community for talking to them, and/or so few are willing to look at our posts. Which again, exacerbates the problem if Riot isn't willing to put forth the effort to look for better posts. (again speculation, I just think if this is even remotely true, it needs to be said).\n------\nTldr on this section: Don't forget to respond in a timely manner if it's a valid concern/point, don't forget to pass it on to others who can answer better... etc.\n\nThe third issue not mentioned is specifically on what you have just said (and have been noted by Kobold who also responded to this comment). A lot of times it feels like you plan to do this, and it gets talked about, and responses are planned... but it just never gets back to us. Other times a response takes too long. For instance Rengar. There was a lot of questions about it on the Rengar mains subreddit (or so I've been told) for a while after the assassin update. They kept asking and asking about him, and giving criticism about how different he felt, and how he didn't feel like Rengar. For a while they were seemingly ignored. In reality it may have been that Riot was planning an internal discussion, or waiting on data... etc. If I'm not mistaken, they waited a few months asking like this before they got a response. That brings up the first issue with this case, it took way too long to get a response out. As noted by others here, naturally the longer someone has to wait for a response on something they are passionate about, the angrier/more agitated they will become. Then the response they got was in a mocking tone, calling their requests/questions/feedback memes. Now that's a completely separate issue of a single Rioter making an inappropriate response, but you can see with this that also the longer you wait to respond, the better of a response they are expecting. If that had happened the first month after the assassin update, it probably wouldn't have gone over as badly. That example isn't from the boards per say (although it did spill out into the boards from reddit as well), but it's a good parallel to the board's behavior I believe. I would also like to say this isn't me trying to rag on that, it happened, its dealt with, we all learned a bit from it. What needs to be further noted though is that responses need to come quicker for large things (problems like this others have noted are ADC 2017 and Ardent) and no matter the size, if it's a valid concern it shouldn't be ignored (or else it could grow into a full community rant like Rengar again). I think Riot handled this pretty well and at a reasonable speed with the pre-season comments/complaints about game pace.\n------\nAll in all, I can see that Riot is trying to do things better on the boards, and I really appreciate it. But going forward keep in mind that from the community's point of view (however skewed it may be) they are seeing fewer and fewer Riot responses, less large-topic replies, and more replies seem to be along the lines of We have plans(TM). While I'm certainly not saying every Rioter needs to come on and scrounge for posts to respond to and spend 2 hours a day each answering/responding. It would be nice if there was a more expansive group of Rioters responding, more of a focus on getting bigger/long standing questions answered, and less of a focus on only responding to the the hot section posts.\n\n---------\n\n--------\n So as a bit of a point and to try to get visibility on some of my questions I've been asking for ages... (and since I'm also trying to make a point, I will put the number of times asked, in what I believe to be a non-aggressive manner next to them, along with date of first question)\n**Shameless question time to whichever Rioter can answer:**\n\n* When will Riot return to the Item Set Tool and finish giving us the functionality it had in the old client [11](6/16/17)\n-I think this falls under Riot Sparkle's knowledge. Here's two of the posts I made that combined probably cover everything I want to know: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/rRcVvhmP-item-set-creator-still-has-a-way-to-go\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/sWTUOAIn-riot-on-the-item-set-creator\n* **[Answered already]** Nunu Bot's arm lightning is missing [8](~10/19/17)\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/5tOkWAo4-nunu-bot-skin (first boards post)\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/qlmEsu8x-project-vi-border-isnt-lined-up-properly?comment=000000010000 (response, 12/4/17)\nI put this here to just to add the point that I've seen others noting recently. Riot responds/checks the boards seemingly so little now that bug reports aren't even looked at if posted here. After making 5 posts/comments about it, two in the bugs section where you're supposed to post bugs to get them fixed(and I also did the client report on live and pbe), it took almost 2 months for Riot to be even aware of the bug. In my opinion, that shows a problem (although the current topic and this problem might not be related).\n* Are the gold-generating-support-items going to offer something to make me choose one over the other that doesn't feel stat checky? [3](1/10/18)\n-I'm actually grouping support item change questions together here, I had another I asked about twice(which is where the 3 comes from), but I don't so much care about that particular question anymore.\n* Wanted to know thoughts on strength of: Zilean, Warwick, Heimerdinger, Kog'maw, Nasus, Brand, Shyvanna, Xin Zhao, Veigar, and Skarner currently and if Riot thinks any need nerfs/ are looking into them/ have plans for in 8.3.

As a company, Riot may centralize its own information and communications, and so may be able to keep good track of what they posted on whichever online space, but any regular player is going to have a much harder time doing the same, since there are quite a few platforms out there and keeping track of them all as an outsider is rather difficult. I don't think this should mean dropping all platforms just for the sake of the Boards, or repeating the same statement across multiple different spaces each time, but I do think it would help to have some kind of resource players could access that could point to developer responses across all of these platforms, kind of like an extended Red Tracker. At the end of the day, even if Riot answers more questions than players on the Boards may be aware of, the fact remains that Riot doesn't really answer that many controversial questions on the Boards specifically. The fact that this is perceived as a lack of communication, when a Rioter did in fact communicate elsewhere on whichever issue that wasn't answered, just means there's unnecessary negativity and miscommunication being generated, which is detrimental to both players and Riot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rayjay Redfang","date":"2018-01-22T17:30:02.569+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well, you are correct in that there is a lot of circle jerking.when you look at posts, you see more shit posting here, than another place such as Reddit,  which feeds into the circle jerking and pollutes the attitudes of people on the boards.

Someone posts a polarizing opinion, often an emotionally loaded one, and then everyone who agrees with them and reads the headline piles in to agree and upvote.  Moreover, when I read these posts, I just shrug and sigh and give up hope of trying to reason with such people, figuring they will either be too convinced or just be nasty to me.  That’s not a discussion.  That’s not healthy.  That’s not what the boards need.\n\nIf Rioters or moderators are going to reply to threads, then they should drop by these and mention that the thread is becoming an echo chamber and that people who disagree should chime in.  A mid should then watch the thread for dissenting responses.  If none appear, then the thread should be locked for just being an upvote farm.
