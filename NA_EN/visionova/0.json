I just can't win period anymore.\n\nI got it in my head that I'm not allowed to be bad, though, because my friends are plats/diamonds. It makes me feel like garbage to be so far below them.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-06-08T20:54:14.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brother, I play with some very good players and you had best believe I don't compare favorably to them. But that doesn't matter, because we play casually and nobody cares when I tunnel vision and accidentally go in 1v3. What's more than likely going on is that you're going through a period where you're tilted even before starting a game, so you're already predisposed to doing poorly. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is to do something that'll let you unwind and get this monster losing streak off your back. Whether that's a game outside of League, some early-level smurfing, or whatever, this bits gotta be on your own.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-06-08T20:53:26.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll get good games when you get better.\nThere are a lot of moving parts that intertwine that you can improve in league.\n\nLook at your positioning, map awareness and decision making. If you work on these you'll get caught out less, be ready for engages and start better fights.\n\nPositioning: Where are you in relation to enemies/allies, minions and terrain near you at all times.\n\nMap Awareness: Can you see all the enemies on the map? If not, where might they be? Wards.\n\nDecision Making: A lot of things go into decision making. League and other games have a lot to do with decision making big and small. A specific example, you're in bot lane, enemy adc is alone, is the enemy support in the bush or did you just see him on the map roaming around mid or top? If he's not in lane, you can probably get aggressive and take the 2 v 1 against the enemy adc.\nAnother example: If you're pushing a lane and hitting the enemy turret alone. If you see four enemies top trying to catch your singed up there you can probably make the decision to keep hitting the turret. If you look on the map and see two enemies and three are missing you probably should make the decision hit the turret a few times then back out.\nSome simple examples you probably have a good grasp on I know.\n\nNext up. Your CS, Runes/Masteries and Items. \n\nCS: Making sure you're last hitting, if your lane opponent leaves lane and you're not following to counter roam if they roamed. Push in to deny xp/gold to the tower.\n\nRunes and Masteries: Making sure they're what you want in your situation. If I toplane against a tank I usually take teleport instead of barrier or ignite and more defensive runes and masteries because it's going to be harder to all in a tank and get the kill than other champs.\n\nFinal: Knowing your champ (spell combos and power level.)\n\nThese ones are really just playing a champion, and getting to know what limits you can push, how aggressive you can go in because you get a feel of what your champion can do and what their power level in any given situation and matchup,  as well as what you can do in duals or teamfights.\n\nAnother helpful tip. Aim to improve first, and win second. You may have lost, but are you learning from your mistakes and are you improving? This isn't to say not try to win, but that even if you lose don't get down on yourself, find out what you did wrong and correct it.\n\nA lot of this is easier said than done, but good luck out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Verxint","date":"2017-06-08T20:40:17.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The more you think about how much you're winning or whether you're going to win that match, the less brainpower you have dedicated to actually playing well.\n\ntl;dr you're probably in an anxiety feedback loop.","replies":[]}]}
