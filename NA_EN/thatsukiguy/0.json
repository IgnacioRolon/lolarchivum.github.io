I sat in the lobby for 5 minutes waiting for something to happen until I finally left. I logged back in only to find that it counted as a loss toward my series, this is unfair to me because I had no choice but to dodge the match. Please help, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-09-27T02:14:03.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send in a support ticket at https://support.leagueoflegends.com","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-27T22:00:45.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Granted, you can submit a ticket to Player Support.  However, I want to provide some further detail to what occurred:\n\nFirst, I want to sincerely apologize that you experienced this issue that counted as a loss towards your Promotion Series.  Please keep in mind however, that this is intended functionality.  If a player dodges during Champion Selection while they have qualified for a series, that dodge will count as a loss towards the series, rather than losing 3 LP.  This was put into place to prevent people from endlessly dodging games until they get their \"ideal\" team composition, without penalty.  While I understand that this was not your intention, please keep in mind that our PvP.net Servers are unable to tell/detect the difference between an intended, and un-intended disconnect.\n\nIf you consistently experience connection issues in PvP.net, or Champion Select, please do submit a new ticket to us here in Player Support.  We should be able to investigate why this issue occurs.  If you do submit one, make sure that you include the following information:\n\n1) Network Analysis: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20103436-obtaining-a-network-analysis\n\n2) NetworkInfo Log: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132863-obtaining-a-networkinfo-log\n\n3) Process List: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/20132988-obtaining-a-process-list","replies":[]}]}]}
