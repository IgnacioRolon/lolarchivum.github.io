I changed all the in game settings and settings on my computer and still couldn't play. So fast forward to now, i just got a new Dell Inspiron 15, 7000 series and my FPS seems to be working okay yet, i will get in a game for about one minute and the game disconnects and then won't let me back in. This has been a long and drawn out process, which i figured getting a top of the line brand new computer would resolve, someone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-30T16:50:02.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your you're having a network issue staying connected to the game server, so it may not necessarily be with your new PC.
