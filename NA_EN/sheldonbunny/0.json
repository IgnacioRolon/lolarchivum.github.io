I rolled Brand in ARAM. I&#039;d never even tried him out in a custom before. Near the end of the game, I pentakilled with him. I even had amazing teammates who made sure to pull back and let me have the final kill.\r\n\r\nSo fellow GDers, anyone pentakill the first time playing a champion before?","replies":[]}
