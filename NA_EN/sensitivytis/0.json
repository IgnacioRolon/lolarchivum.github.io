I was thinking about buying that mission pass for 1300 rp, but it says that it will be available only until 06-29 and it's already 06-20. So it's only 9 days. Is it still worth? Am I still able to get all those icons in those 9 days? Also I've read that event or something ends in 07-24, so what about that? Until which date I would be able to get all the mission pass advantages? Until 06-29 or 07-24? I'm just confused. Sorry for bad english :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-06-21T22:03:31.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome back! So you have missed quite a bit when it comes to the VS event, but if you wanted the pass it would be a good thing to grab still. You have several days to complete missions, obtain orbs, and unlock some cool icons as you already saw. I would suggest taking a look at the [VS FAQ ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/vs-2017)and get the run down. That will allow you to dive deeper into the event and sway whether you want to buy the pass or not.","replies":[]}]}
