I heard Ashe was a good champ for beginners, while the range is nice, I find her to squishy for my playstyle. I tried Garen next and found that his armor and damage was fun to play around. Any other similar champs like him?\r\nI heard Warwick is also similar to Garen and easy to play?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-21T00:20:20.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Warwick can be a little similar to Garen I suppose, being that they're both melee champions with some survivability. Warwick is better suited for the jungle role so he may not be the best choice for a beginner. \n\nPersonally? I'd check out Darius or Mundo if I were you. A good tip I like to give new players is to check out twitch streams as well. They have added functionality where you can goto watch League and then choose which champion you'd like to see streamed as well! That way you can see how others are playing champions, and get a little insight as to how the champion works. \n\nHere's a great youtube link to our Champion Spotlights as well-> https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbAFXJC0J5GaVjPNNw_i-oLNKc7bVQcFk","replies":[]}]}
