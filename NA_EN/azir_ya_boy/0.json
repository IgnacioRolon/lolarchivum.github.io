Please use the [PBE boards](http://pbr.pbe.leagueoflegends.com) to report issues occurring on PBE - it better helps us keep track of where issues are occurring. :) You can also drop bugs (and feedback) in a skin's [feedback thread](https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/YT9ix8ef-pbe-bugs-feedback-thread-project-jhin)!","replies":[{"poster":"Azir ya Boy","date":"2017-11-12T09:29:31.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well for some reason my PBE boards site doesn't work.
