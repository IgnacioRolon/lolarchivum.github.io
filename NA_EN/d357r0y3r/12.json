This feels the extreme opposite of the foundation of League. If I wanted that, I would play Dota instead...\n\nI can see tho why most of these changes would reflect this philosophy. However, there are a few things I think you kinda overlook:\n\n1) Leona is mainly played as a Support and she is mostly laning against ADCs which attack a ton of times with minimal damage for most of the game, so it makes sense to give her Damage Reduction to survive against them.\n\n2) Ahri used to stop Dashes with her Charm some time ago (which received a lot of backlash from the community). Returning it is basically a revert.\n\n3) Poppy basically traded one skill that was most of the times relevant at negating only one other skill, without really giving any reward to it. People with multiple mobility tools could basically try to engage and if Poppy W-ed, they would run away with their other tools, barely punished by a good Poppy W. Plus, I doubt she has room to be buffed in her other skills since I think she is almost good.\n\nBut I completely agree with you that Renekton, Blitzcrand and Kled changes are part of this new philosophy.
