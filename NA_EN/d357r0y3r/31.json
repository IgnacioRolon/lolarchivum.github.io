Hey guys, an enchanter able to make you tank physical damage aggression every 20 seconds is toxic, let's change it to a heal bot champ that has almost no downtime until they have no hp.\nWe removed Maokai's ult damage reduction for his team\nWe removed Jarvan's armor aura\n\nAnything that made your team tanking more damage got removed, instead we have spells that completly nullify agression like {{champion:201}} E{{champion:223}} W (very fun design btw).\n\nAnd tanks? What did Riot do with tanks since they had to make them useful?\nThey all got reworked into toxic CC bots\n\nIt makes sense, since defense should get blantantly ignored by offense after 20-25-30 min, how can we make tanks good? Make them able to remove a champion from a teamfight for 4 sec straight with knock ups AND BUFF THEIR DAMAGE.\nThis is what happened with {{champion:3}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:154}}  and all \"modern tanks\"\n\nYou can't tank anymore, so now you either have a bruiser lvl of damage like galio/gragas/ornn\nOr you get to CC for I don't know how much time, with new displacements that appeared from no where like ZAC, galio, gragas\nand old tanks like {{champion:54}} are losing their niche for no reasons\nRemember when Malphite used to hardcounters Jax and Irelia? LOL THINK AGAIN\nThink fucking again because if you can't remove jax or irelia from the game for 4 sec now, they're going to shred you so hard\nSoon, malphite's attack speed slow will get changed into a knock up like {{champion:20}} \n\nand this made tanks so shit in soloq, but so op in pro play because their coordination can make use of their insane engage and insane cc\n\nSo now, to make them good in soloq, they want to turn {{champion:516}} into a bruiser, by nerfing his cc and giving him 73% max hp damage\nand it's the fucking truth what the fuck\nit's just the truth, even {{champion:113}} is getting the same treatment\n{{champion:14}} Look at his current damage after that they buffed his damage\n\nDefense doesn't matter anymore, it's all about damage and cc now\n\nand bruisers?\nwhat about bruisers?\nWell, Riot thought that those poor melees need to be viable in the game, you would think that they would trade range for defense?\n\nAgain\nThink again\nNo, they need to PIERCE defense, even more\n\n{{champion:122}} had 25% pen armor for years\nsuddenly, in season 8 we increase it to 30% then to 35%\nwe introduce {{champion:164}} who's able to deal 1k true damage every few seconds\nMelees are ignoring more and more the defense of this game, {{champion:114}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:157}} , and now {{champion:266}} {{champion:6}}  gets SO MUCH %hp damage passively.\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:39}} gets to either pierce shielding, or reduce healing\nWe gave {{champion:75}} {{champion:86}} % armor shred\nThis is league in its purest form in season 9\n\nA game where tanks will either deal bruiser lvl of damage, or have bullshit cc\nA game where bruisers will ignore almost all of your defense\n\n\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d183ebf734af3e3a5965f291925aeba8.jpg\n\nSay anything about season 2, but in that season you had much more strategy\nnobody even the few assassins straight up oneshot you in high elo\n\nBecause in pro play or high elo, mages or adc went for TWO defensive items\nADC build was like boots+IE+PD+Banshee+GA\nAnd you had no way of ignoring this defense\n\nBut riot was like \"uhu duhu, defense is boring guys\"\n\nEven when you had mages and ADCS picked as much as bruisers and tanks\n\nyou had as much bruisers and tanks played, currently the only bruisers played are either hypermobile or have bullshit ranged spells (Aatrox Urgot)\n\nYou buff Darius's armor pen, and he doesn't show up even when he can straight up ignore your defense\nWhy?\nBECAUSE DARIUS NEEDS HIS OWN DEFENSE TO MATTER FFS\n\nYou think by giving {{champion:75}}  35% armor pen, he's going to be  good when his ult armor/mr won't matter at all?\nYou can give him a gamebreaking buff that is 50% cdr on Q under ult, it won't change anything\n\nRiot game\nYour issue was thinking that buffing damage non stop on anyone could fix the game or fix balance\nyou just ruined the fun for the people that loved long trades\nthe people that loved strategy, and loved to abuse window of powers \n\nNow, your designs are all \"ahahaha you didn't dodge skillshot, get fucking destroyed lol\"","replies":[{"poster":"OneMustFall","date":"2018-11-25T11:55:13.376+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":91,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"King Braum","date":"2018-11-25T12:26:18.288+0000","up_votes":149,"down_votes":5,"body":"Too be fair, if silver, which makes up of nearly 50% of the entire playerbase on it's own, doesn't enjoy the game.

A game in which carries eventually get to break through even very durable tank walls is a game that won't go on endlessly, but right now, the problem is simply that everyone is given too much damage, and damage is the only thing that's valued on the map as well. Durability's been actively discouraged for years, to the point where even tanks over time have been pushed to buy damage stats instead, and that's simply added a whole new layer of bursty champions with tons of CC, which has made the game even less stable and fun to play. The state of damage right now is so out of wack that I'm not sure Riot even has an idea of what would constitute reasonable damage, and even if they did, they don't seem at all intent on fixing damage either.","replies":[{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2018-11-25T17:37:48.152+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"And every tank that does get buffed gets MOAR DAMAGE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hi lm Zoe","date":"2018-11-25T11:52:36.157+0000","up_votes":57,"down_votes":5,"body":"And this is the reason Zoe is back in business.\nBecause nobody can now tank her fuckin' dmg\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Malix Farwin","date":"2018-11-25T17:54:38.446+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hi lm Zoe,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=625rzeP9,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-11-25T11:52:36.157+0000)\n>\n> And this is the reason Zoe is back in business.\n> Because nobody can now tank her fuckin&#x27; dmg\n> {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}\n\nI'd say its more so because of Dark Harvest ATM lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Míellá","date":"2018-11-25T12:51:54.898+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":65,"body":"So we're going to ignore the time of tank meta?\nI'm 100% sure they introduced those items cuz of that toxic meta.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-11-25T13:12:43.718+0000","up_votes":52,"down_votes":5,"body":"Did you read the thread?\nTanks dominated because of broken CCs and initiation, not because of a good defense that allowed them to tank\n\nCombined that with Riot believing that defense shouldn't matter and giving %hp damage to all tanks {{champion:31}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:154}}{{champion:98}}    then how the fuck do you not get a tank meta\n\nIf you want to talk about season 2 meta, then explain to me how we had bruisers and tanks played in the same game?\nLiterally the game in the screenshot had Rumble Yorick Jax Maokai Alistar banned\n\nWe had tanks, bruisers, and even Vladimir/Rumble being gamebreaking with spellvamp\nwhat else do you want more?

This was the final nail in the coffin for this game, it spiked the damage creep to unseen levels (and they were already getting bad, remember when ADC's were just A-clicking on the other side of the map and 3 shotting everything in between?)  \n\nYou give a burst oriented champion, designed to jump in and deal a huge burst of damage then jump out, a Rune that upon dealing their burst gets additional instantaneous burst without any possible counterplay? So you are rewarding the Assassin for landing their abilities? Is the reward for landing your abilities not already the damage they do? Why do they need more damage?  \n\nPeople say this brings diversity, certain champions are now viable... Yeah you are right it brought X champion back into the light, but it pushed champions A B and C who were already in the light and Top Tier into God-tier... now they are busted beyond repair... So did it really bring that champion into viability if everyone is still playing A B or C because they are busted? Just because you can play champion X without insta-feeding? I say no...  \n\nThere is no diversity in Rune paths anymore, they are all just damage... Classes are all taking the same shit with some exceptions. The only tree that I feel is good and redeemable is the Inspiration Tree (with the exception of Kleptomancy, free Gold is just a different reward to damage but still with the same lack of interaction). This Tree is designed around AUGMENTING HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME, meaning how you use these Runes differs from player to player and champion to champion.

This was the final nail in the coffin for this game, it spiked the damage creep to unseen levels (and they were already getting bad, remember when ADC's were just A-clicking on the other side of the map and 3 shotting everything in between?)  \n> \n> You give a burst oriented champion, designed to jump in and deal a huge burst of damage then jump out, a Rune that upon dealing their burst gets additional instantaneous burst without any possible counterplay? So you are rewarding the Assassin for landing their abilities? Is the reward for landing your abilities not already the damage they do? Why do they need more damage?  \n> \n> People say this brings diversity, certain champions are now viable... Yeah you are right it brought X champion back into the light, but it pushed champions A B and C who were already in the light and Top Tier into God-tier... now they are busted beyond repair... So did it really bring that champion into viability if everyone is still playing A B or C because they are busted? Just because you can play champion X without insta-feeding? I say no...  \n> \n> There is no diversity in Rune paths anymore, they are all just damage... Classes are all taking the same shit with some exceptions. The only tree that I feel is good and redeemable is the Inspiration Tree (with the exception of Kleptomancy, free Gold is just a different reward to damage but still with the same lack of interaction). This Tree is designed around AUGMENTING HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME, meaning how you use these Runes differs from player to player and champion to champion.
