This is because Quinn was reworked with the idea of being played mid instead of bot; the fact that she plays top instead is irrelevant. \n\nAs far as a small pick rate, the only thing I feel like that should be taken into account for is the general feeling of people who actually *play* bot lane. If they're currently only picking the only marksmen that are good and feel rewarding to play instead of picking the five or so mages that are destroying the lane, that's a clear sign that what people who actually play botlane want to play *is* marksmen and should be taken more into account than what people who play mid, top and jungle have to say. Play rate means zero in the face of the fact that I'm an ADC main; I want to play ADC's. If I had wanted, at any point during the time I played league, to play a mage/bruiser/tank/assassin, I would have gone out of bot lane and went to play mid/top/jungle. But I didn't do that; I stayed playing *botlane* on *ADCs*. Because that's what *I* want to play. Nerfing everything I want to play to try and give me diversity that I, honestly, already had isn't going to make me suddenly play mages/bruisers/tanks/assassins. Its just going to piss me off and make me feel like I'm not privy to this game.\n\nAnd finally, sure, OP.GG listed this picks as being \"top tier\" but at the same time, many of the picks just have high play rates; Ezreal has a *negative winrate* but people still play him because they still just *like to play him.* Kai'sa also has a negative winrate but people still player her because they like to play her; that and she is a very flexible ADC that can play a multitude of builds. Jinx just got buffed but she's still doing less well than Swain or Yasuo; Swain has both a higher pick rate and higher winrate than her while Yasuo's pick and winrate are on equal footing to hers. \n\nMiss Fortune is the only ADC champion on that \"tier list\" that I would consider harshly over tuned and its only because she actually *likes* Stormrazor and it synergizes very well with the rest of her bursty build.\n\nMy point is that just because the champions are picked more often or not does not mean that they are good. They are just the champions that people who play bot lane *actually* want to play and this forced diversity is actually just restricting the people who play bot lane more than ever.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-30T22:46:04.888+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":25,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L6EyAf5t,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2018-06-30T22:37:33.393+0000)\n>\n> Quinn is in the same boat as Corki and Graves,\n\nand both are marksmen uhuhu\n\n> \n> As far as a small pick rate, the only thing I feel like that should be taken into account for is the general feeling of people who actually *play* bot lane. \n\nNo, no and fucking no\nSmall pick rate champions are close to irrelevant, their low sample makes them garbage and and i don't know how your \"feeling\" can be bad when all of them combined appears in 2% of your games which means 98% of the time you play against other champions and in a minority of it you play against non marksmen\n\nFurther more all those champions are horribly xp dependant unlike marksmen, once again proving how garbage they are but since their sample is low it fluctuates too much\n\n> \n> And finally, sure, OP.GG listed this picks as being &quot;top tier&quot; but at the same time, many of the picks just have high play rates; Ezreal has a *negative winrate* \n\nEzreal is beyond fucking broken, any top tier adc player successes on him any good adc would successes on him this champion is ridiculous when it comes to balance between dealing damage and safety.\nhis win rate is low because of the amount of games he's playing which means people with no hands will eventually play him\nHistorically anyone with 49% win rate and top number pick rate was broken and nerfed\ncaitlyn last season\nLucian last season+right now\nlee sin for multiple seasons\nthresh for multiple seasons\nazir recently\nelise for multiple seasons\njhin last season\njinx 2 and 3 seasons ago\n\nall of them without a single exception\n\nof course some adcs are underperforming but overall the class is doing perfectly fine.\nIt's just that some people can't afford of thinking they are possibly playing the game in a bad way , and instead of either stop caring or getting better, they blame other factors like their class being unviable when the majority of people are doing very good.","replies":[{"poster":"Speeedy","date":"2018-06-30T23:49:43.384+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"you have some very obscure views about the role of marksman (not only this post but your presence on the boards)\nquinn, corki and graves are not marksman anymore and haven't been for at least 1.5 seasons now. \n\nwhat a lot of people are afraid of is crit marksman getting the left in the gutter for an extended period of time like bruisers did when runes reforged came out.

Champions that were too prevalent in pro play, yes, garnered nerfs and a handful of the ones you mentioned literally fall under that umbrella. Specifically:\n\nLee Sin, Azir, Elise, and *maybe* Jinx though she was popular in season 5 when I was just starting league so my knowledge on that is fuzzy.\n\nA few champions with negative solo queue wr's that did get nerfed despite it that you didn't mention also include Ryze and Galio.\n\nCaitlyn, in my honestly opinion, was unfairly nerfed. She was never broken, she has very clear counter play in that she placed a trap there? Don't step on it. She is also largely immobile and lacks an AS steroid, meaning she doesn't scale as well as other hyper carries; what carries her in the midgame is her range and utility, much like Ashe. She got nerfed because a bunch of people gathered around and circlejerked until Riot said,\"Okay fine, whatever. STFU.\" and gutted her. She had a high play rate but despite that she never, *never* broached pasted a 50% winrate. \n\nLucian was *actually* broken in previous seasons and usually gained nerfs because his WR was above 50%. He was never nerfed when he had a negative WR. \n\nWith all of this in mind, Ezreal is not currently broken; he was weakened heavily but further stat nerfs. As a skillshot based ADC he has clear weaknesses in that if he misses his skillshots, his damage is gone. The only thing I personally find frustrating about Ezreal is that his Q hit box is *not* very clear or clean, making it hard to dodge at times, and his E is honestly too short a CD for just *how* good it is. I wouldn't consider him over tuned at present time; just a league favorite, especially of *Korea* where OP.GG takes its stats from.\n\nAlso, how the people who actually main a role/lane feel about changes to their role or lane should matter and take precedence over the people who don't. Its like me suddenly deciding that midlane is too diverse and then making changes so that only ADCs can play there, something that has been steadily happening over the last season. I don't play midlane; why should I decide what is actually *played* there? Before patch 8.11, I wouldn't have magically started playing midlane either just because they make the ADC I like playing good there. I could still play them bot. Now if they decided to make changes for ADC's to be good midlane, sure, I'd play them there in a heartbeat because the place I used to play them was made systematically unfriendly toward them.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-30T23:31:32.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":9,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OtterlyLost,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=L6EyAf5t,comment-id=00020000000000000001,timestamp=2018-06-30T23:21:07.504+0000)\n>\n>Champions that were too prevalent in pro \n\nprevalent in pro because good players could manage to break the game with high skill champions like lee sin\nremember release Yasuo with 44% win rate  but was picked in pro and had 30% pick rate and got nerfed over and over? yea he was definitly balanced\n\n> \n> A few champions with negative solo queue wr&#x27;s that did get nerfed despite it that you didn&#x27;t mention also include Ryze and Galio.\n> \n> Caitlyn, in my honestly opinion, was unfairly nerfed. \n\nyea, in your opinion.

You're just incapable of reading because I know I've proven you wrong enough that you had an entire thread deleted to avoid people seeing that I proved you wrong. .-. When you were adamant that Varus was \"fine\" and \"viable\" just because Uzi was playing him in professional play. My argument then is the same as it is now; professional play and soloqueue are *not* comparable and the two should *honestly* have separate balance patches. What is good in Professional Play will *not* be good in soloqueue 100% of the time. Professional teams are organized, make *real* goddamn team comps, have communication with their team(who they live with, train with, and play with EXTREMELY REGULARLY), and generally value different things in champions that people in soloqueue do.\n\nAnd Yasuo is a shitty example and you know it. He gets nerfed over and over again because people flat out don't like him and he's got an extremely toxic kit. He could have a 0% winrate and I'd still want the bastard nerfed because he's obnoxious and unfun to play against.\n\nA better example is, again, Ryze, who had, at one point, a 40% WR but still received a nerf because, guess what? He was still too good in pro play. His ult and the fact that he had a team around him that could *specifically enable him* meant that he was *far* too good in a professional, organized team setting. Because they could play around him and make good use of his ultimate.\n\nAnd Caitlyn never invalidated half the roster. I played against her regularly during her Flavor of the Month time frame and regularly destroyed her and this is on a variety of ADC's. It was only after she got needlessly nerfed into the ground, as well, that botlane became about Hyper Carries, which everyone on the board had more issue with. What an idea; you nerf one of the best lane bullies who generally does fall off, and the people she countered get insurmountably stronger. I miss the days where she was actually viable and good because she did a fair job of checks and balances bot lane.\n\nAnd I still disagree with them refusing to buff her due to feeling she'd \"oppress botlane diversity\" or whatever malarky while ignoring just how *oppressive* duo mages botlane are.\n\nAnd ADC wasn't broken for a year; Supports were and this has been supported by several people across the entire board.

And furthermore, this is completely taking what I said out of context and not even addressing what I did say which is that midlane/toplane/jungle have no right to say what should be played botlane considering they don't even *play* the role.\n\nSomeone else said it and I have to agree; all you do is cherry pick for whatever suits your agenda. Even worse, however, is that you do it under the guise that you're an ADC main but your account hasn't seen play for ages and the champs that you played on it, according to OP.GG, weren't even ADCs.

You do sometimes build comps around specific champions or with what specific champions can bring. If you want a pick comp, fuck yes, you're going to pick Thresh and Elise and use them. And yes, you would build a team around a Lee Sin if you wanted someone capable of easily invading the enemy jungler and controlling them while also being a real damage threat and someone who could make easy flanks and likely knock an important target out of position.\n\nThese are all things you would build a comp around; just because they aren't the main carry or anything does not mean that you're not building a comp specifically around what they can and cannot do.\n\nAnd your reasoning for Yasuo is so half assed its painful. There are multiple threads from people of multiple elos who all say they hate facing Yasuo specifically because he's unfun and unenjoyable to play. Not at all because he's broken; a champion does not have to broken to be annoying.\n\nAs for why you should care, you really shouldn't.

How dare ADC's scale into the relative late game. Notice how they've been nerfed but games are still only 25 minutes long? That's because Riot made the games shorter; its only fair to expect *every* champion to spike earlier than they normally would. Many currently do in fact; just look at Fiora, Irelia, Jax, Veigar, Nasus, etc. All champions that were considered \"late game\" but now spike in \"midgame\" because midgame *is* late game. 20 minutes in the current meta and climate *is* late game. \n\nAnd need I remind you that Lucian got nerfed multiple times because he's the kind of champion that finds and abuses a variety of build paths, making him far better than he should be normally? If he was doing worse than those ADCs it was because he had been nerfed down multiple times after abusing things like BoRK and Lethality; in fact, he was *the* poster child for the Lethality ADC meta and was incredibly over powered during it. \n\nAnd you don't want to show your main account because you either A.

Quinn goes top and mid and has a 54% winrate top and admittedly a low winrate mid at 47% but she still has the option of top lane and probably could still jungle. Wukong can go top, jungle, and I have seen him mid where he did pretty damn well as full damage; in top he has 58% WR and in Jungle he has a 49%. Veigar can play mid and support; he has a 48% winrate mid and a 44% as a support and is the first one that I would consider a \"refugee thus far.
