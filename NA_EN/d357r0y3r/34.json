Winrate should have gone down, instead we get 57%, at the time the tenth highest in League history, including Beta, from that one effect.  Then came the Gangplank and Fiora reworks, and the advent of Class Updates, and 57% stopped being impressive.\n\nNow it's the same deal: she was underpowered after they removed the speed and added Charm amp back, so they made a couple minor Quality of Life changes to Charm; the increased duration was meant solely to help land Q's return, since players would rather put points into E to help Q than level her underpowered W.
