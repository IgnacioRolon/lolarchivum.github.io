Do enemies really need to memorize 20 different skills and even more combos just to play against one champion? Not to say they dont just need to memorize what the champsion does, but his weapons too, otherwise there is no way to tell what the weird purple sphere does compared to that shuriken he throw at you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Spicy Rice","date":"2019-11-25T21:37:30.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"ITT : People who are complaining about Aphelios because players need to learn what his kit does, like every other friggin champ in the game","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2019-11-25T21:48:26.847+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"No\npeople are complaining about aphelios because he requieres MORE time and effort to learn what his kit does than any existing character","replies":[]},{"poster":"PaffWasTaken","date":"2019-11-25T22:46:32.629+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People are starting to understand that the bigger a new/reworked champion's kit is, the harder it'll be for Riot to balance it.
