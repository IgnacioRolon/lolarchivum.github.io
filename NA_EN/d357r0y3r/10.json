Damage is practically non-existent unless you build 3 AP items, at which point you don't function well enough as a tank despite doing subpar damage as a bruiser\n\nYou don't live long enough as a tank unless you build 4 tank items, but at that point, you haven't done damage all game, and you won't for the rest of it, relying on everyone else to win (If your team sucks, you are fucked).\n\nRiot needs to move Galio from one role to the other. Tank, or AP bruiser. None of this half and half bulls**t.","replies":[{"poster":"Khristophoros","date":"2018-06-04T00:26:15.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if you want to main him you should always duo with a carry player. His ult is insane if you have somebody who's coordinating with you. His CC is also generous even as far as tanks go. His damage isn't half bad, like when I play support Galio I get kills easily.\n\nLike you don't even need to be playing with a full 5 man team for him to be a good champ. You just have to not be playing solo.\n\nIt's too much to ask of Riot to make him good for pure solo play and also balanced for more organized duo strats and also balanced in organized 5 man (pro and clash basically)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2018-06-03T22:09:10.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't care about pro play.\n\nThey just want to be able to play a champion they love without handicapping themselves or their team.","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-03T22:09:40.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they don't\nbut riot cares about $","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fear the Kayn","date":"2018-06-03T22:09:33.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"It's time to a 'pro' server where champions are balanced entirely differently IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-03T22:12:40.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[]},{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-03T22:22:44.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"let's divide the community\n\nsure","replies":[]},{"poster":"Step Sis Lux","date":"2018-06-03T22:15:50.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what would be the point of LCS?
