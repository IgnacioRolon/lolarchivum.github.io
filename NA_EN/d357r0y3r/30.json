Its just that because you have more max HP, it simply looks/feels like you are healing less than you are since the HP bar never gets bigger.\n\nIf anything, heal is already better on bruisers since they actually build defensive stats to make the health from heal worth more in total.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-06-06T16:22:22.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If morde had a 60% wr he would be the best champ in the game","replies":[{"poster":"D357R0Y3R","date":"2018-06-06T16:23:05.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"he has a very very low pick rate which increases his win rate by a lot\n\nfortunatly becaus he's fucking cancer","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"webstar1108","date":"2018-06-06T15:39:57.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:6}} {{summoner:4}} \n{{item:3146}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}
