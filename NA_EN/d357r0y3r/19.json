People should consider the other option, APC -ability power carry. \n\nPut Heimerdinger down bot-lane, ignore your ADC after it get crushed back to next week and take over the lane and show them what you got. And Yasuo can go mid\n\nThat's only reason champs like Yasuo work out going bot-lane anyways, there is almost ALWAYS a champ support that can be APC down there, something like Yasuo is just there to kill stuff and flex his EPen","replies":[]}]}
