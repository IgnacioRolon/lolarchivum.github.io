All I see is one screenshot of two different dummies on practice tool with different amounts of damage/DPS done to them, but I see no comparison at all of old IE vs new IE.\n\nAnd the person you are responding to has the same maths I have seen.\n\nGoing from 80% crit and a 2.5 crit multiplier gives you an average of \n\n.80(2.5AD) for crits + .20(1.0AD) for non-crits, giving you 2.0 + .2 or 2.2 total AD scaling on average.\n\nNew IE doubles crit chance, so with 1 zeal its 60% crit chance, and with 2 its over capped beyond 100%, but you lose out on the 50% extra crit damage to instead convert 20% of the crit to true damage.\n\nso with 1 zeal its .60(1.6AD) physical damage + .60(.4AD) true damage for crits + .40(1.0AD) for non-crits or 1.36AD physical damage and .24AD true damage (1.6 AD ratio, with 15% of the damage being true damage).\n\nWith 2 zeals its 1.0(1.6AD) physical damage and 1.0(.4AD) true damage, and everything ever is a crit.\n\nSo, like them, all I can see is the difference being -200 gold, + 10 AD and being far better against every single champion in the game, who all have more base armor than the break even point.\n\nThe difference is 1.6-2.2AD physical damage + .4AD true damage.  This simplifies to -.6AD physical damage to .4AD true damage.\n\nWe set them equal to each other.  .6AD physical = .4AD true.  this occurs when the physical damage multiplier is .6666_ (pretend that underscore is a vinculum)\n\nThe physical damage multiplier comes from armor and is equal to (100/100+armor) if armor is a positive number.\n\n.6666 = 100/100+x.\n\nThe two solutions to this are x = -100 (which doesn't work because our armor formula is a piecewise function, that actually changes if x or our armor value, is negative) or x = 51.5151515_ (another vinculum)\n\nReally, this means new IE will be better at 52 armor or more.  Every champion except Thresh has much higher base armor than this and he gets .75 per soul anyway.  Ashe and Cait have just over 80 armor at 18 for example, and almost no one is below 70.

As we have not defined the time table, and ADCs can get 2.5 attacks off per second (or even more with PtA and new items coming in).  If the burst window was defined as a 1 second interval, which is about the lowest it can even make sense to limit it to, that still allows for ADCs to get off between as many as 2.5 and 5.0 attacks depending upon the set up, or in mid game, a more realistic 1.5 - 2 times.\n\nIf we set it at 2 seconds, or the length of a moderate CC, then the ADCs could conceivably be attacking from 3 times at the low end, to almost 10 times at the upper end with PtA abuse.\n\nIn all of these scenarios, literally any scenario with above 1 attack happening, that difference in critical strike chance really, truly matters, as it functions as a multiplier of crit damage, attack speed, and AD, worth exponentially more the more of the other stats you have.  You're effectively ignoring a fifth of their entire damage potential by not factoring in the difference between 80% and 100% critical strike chance.\n\nThis is probably what the previous poster meant when they were saying you don't know what you're talking about, and don't understand the maths involved.
