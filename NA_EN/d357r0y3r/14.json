But that's not really \"fixing\" anything or even balancing.\n\nAnd no game is good at balancing or fixing. If anything, Riot is ahead of the curb there. Their game's decline rate is infinitesimal compared to other modern games, their sales exploded to rates unseen by any other modern game, and their innovation and marketing is FAR more active than other games. Everything you see on this website is a form of marketing. New champs are marketing. etc.\n\nMost games begin a major (13-20%) annual decline per year after their first month. League's has been about 3-5% annually... at least by search rates.\n\nBy Revenue, they've been exploding, rising, and concurrent player counts were on the increase at least until 2016 (we don't know 2018 numbers yet).\n\nMost games do not have post release marketing in large amounts either. They are built to earn spenders and burners. And then move on to the next game.\n_**\nIf you're going to cite games which \"fix problems\" actually cite them. I know of many who attempt to try, but end up creating far more damning problems, and often don't actually fix the problem.**_\n\nUnless the problem is a Glitch or Bug, most attempts to solve problems are not scientific. The live release is the only real way to gain statistics on the \"fix\" and see if it actually was one. And like with League, that's always an ongoing process.\n \nLeague has a major advantage in dealing with this though:)\n\n1) Third party nonassociated sites have taken to tracking and creating statistics which players and Riot can use to bring attention to major abnormalities (minor abnormalities can often be just attributed to player base collective decision making)\n\n2) Riot has Loader texts, selections as stock data to use without extensively datamining the game. This reduces the burden of interpreting data in behavior, champ selection, popularity, bans, etc.\n\n3) Riot has a finite set of actions players are allowed to make in game, which helps make their in house stats more retrievable.\n\n4) They have the PBE (A lot of games do have a Beta server, so this isn't entirely unique, but they do update it more frequently and often than the vast majority of other games, and they do know how to read the data).\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nI heavily suggest you take a semester, go to college, and take a class in the Economics department called \"Game Theory.\" It's the science of determining the best outcomes for decision making.
