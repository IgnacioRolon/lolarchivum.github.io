Also the galio rework was designed to be a tank that is not my opinion it is a fact galio was given lines and a story that sets him up to hate magic and again he was played as a tank for the majority of season 7 if they wanted him to be a ap champion at the start riot would of done it sooner. Also the majority of people do not want galio to be a bruiser when he was a tank he had a constant play rate and it was higher then now but after riot made him ap people stop playing him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Axzarious","date":"2018-12-23T00:14:21.413+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you ask me, they should have taken a page from his older self and given Galio lower AP ratios, but have him also given his damage spells scaling off of MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Ragnaveil","date":"2018-12-24T05:19:20.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His job use to be anti-mage, but nowadays with this rework he's either anti-everything or anti-nothing.

Since when did win rate become the deciding factor of how strong a champion is?\n\n\nOP talk about high elo, its really different than the usual [insertxnoobstomper] thread. And then he use wr cause on this board low elo players only \"understand\" this, but cause he's not dishonest he also use pickrate.
