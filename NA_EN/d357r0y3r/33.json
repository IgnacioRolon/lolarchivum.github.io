But In a team fight his healing on his allies is no where near Soraka's level. Don't even try to act like it is. A good chunk of his healing comes from his ult(does a fuckton of damage and drains for 100% of damage dealt) if you would read his abilities, not to mention he could have taken vamp runes. \n\nThis thread is a meme.
