I did several tests on PBE but since it&#039;s PBE we can&#039;t know exactly how it will be until it hits Live\n\nThis thread will not list the changes that were done because I assume everyone knows what will happen since it created a huge fiesta recently about how adcs are going to be &quot;buffed&quot;\n\nBut there is something I need to talk about, something **really important that everyone needs to know**. It&#039;s about patch 7.9\nlet&#039;s talk about patch 7.9 and how the game was before.\n\nBlade of the ruined king was extremely broken, it made lucian tier 1 and the best adc in the game. Crit was shit or at least underbuilt, blade of the ruined king and black cleaver were both built on every adcs that could build them\nIn march 2017, SSG Ruler made an Ashe build extremely popular where you built blade of the ruined king into black cleaver\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jol3dIjvwBA\nCrit was deemed underwhelming because it essentially took a long time to spike, when i say crit i&#039;m talking about IE and IE+rfc/shiv combo\nPD used to cost 2550 gold and was built EVERYTIME, Runan was mandatory because it was simply overtuned\nLethality ADCS were the only thing played along Varus and Ashe with BORK, other adcs who could use BORK like kog were played but due to ashe and varus utility being stronger they overshadowed him.\n\nThen patch 7.9 arrived\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ba03b23b8e47b88d5cd397cdca6dbd5f.png\n\nIE received a 200 gold buff which was the most important change, 3400 gold IE completly broke the meta IMO and on a smaller scale 1200 gold zeal.\nWhat you do on every adc right now is: BF---&gt;zeal----&gt;IE----&gt;RFC/shiv----&gt;RFC/shiv\n\nbut wait, there were more:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/e2ecab4d0042c1d3eed1737975c9f20a.png\n\nBlade of the ruined king received a 100 gold nerf, which may seem nothing but made the item extremely undertuned, it&#039;s really bad right now\n\nAnd after this patch the meta changed completly.\nCait became the most obnoxious adc in the game, achieving a 100% pick/ban rate in pro, twitch was suddenly played, kog fell out of favor until Ardent+guinsoo meta.\n\n\nNow why am I talking about that?\nbecause in next patch {{item:3031}}  is getting a 300 gold nerf which is BIGGER than the buff it got last year\n{{item:3086}} is getting a 100 gold nerf, but the crit chance it gives is also being reduced\nand  {{item:3085}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} {{item:3046}} are having 200 gold nerf which is something that was not changed last  year\nAND AT THE SAME TIME {{item:3153}} is getting a 200 gold buff which is BIGGER than the nerf it got last year\n\nI can&#039;t help but think that the game is basically being reverted to 7.8 but harder, Ashe Varus Lucian meta with BORK the only thing that changed is that runan is being more expensive\n\nBut wait there is more.\nI tried to test the difference of damage between new IE and old IE\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/797401fb370d401644bb47b9a255e87b.jpg\n\nthis is damage on live, 435 crit damage on a 100 armor target\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/5f3ea1f724a08e093185ffeb21198b59.jpg\n\nthis is damaage on PBE, 329 crit + 64 true damage\n\nnow before you  point out &quot;UH DU 100% CRIT&quot; ashe **cannot crit due to her passive**, her passive removes the RNG it makes crit simply becoming DPS than burst, so if you want to compare DPS you should directly use Ashe as an example, 100% or 80% crit her AA will always crit and deal a bonus damage based on the amount of crit she has.\n\nso I was curious about what was the armor threshold were you deal more damage\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/b1eec131945992481ae07a93e702721a.png\nsomeone on the french boards discord posted this and apparently it&#039;s 121 armor\n\nBut wait there is more: New infinity edge only deals bonus damage to champions, which nerfs marksmen&#039;s ability to take baron and dragon\n\nThis is a change that i totally love because it does increase the diversity, marksmen are right now too good at taking objectives which leaves you no choices but to play a marksman\n\nIn the end, crit will become terrible compared to other options that are:\nlethality {{champion:202}} {{champion:21}} \n**WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT STORMRAZOR WAS A GOOD IDEA**\nRiot, if you wanted to design an ADC item you designed the wrong item jesus\nThis item is pointless on so much adcs, you really have to admit that you only wanted jhin to build this item\n\nAnd speaking about lethality, {{item:3036}} is total armor penetration now, I was able to oneshot a half hp vayne with {{champion:202}} {{item:3009}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3036}} 4th shot, and before you ask, no crit jhin cannot do that with 2 items\nLike, I really hope you all remember what lethality jhin was when viable, or lethality miss fortune. I didn&#039;t try but i&#039;m pretty sure you can oneshot someone with a miss fortune Q with stormrazor +lethality + LDR since her Q can crit\n\nThe last thing I wanted to talk about is what will happen to marksmen&#039;s base stats and fleet footwork (FFW)\nnow, as an ADC main there is something I knew since a long time: marksmen are way too overpowered in lane. Ranged manaless damage that is point and click is rewarded by so much for no risk at all and this is something you should use in lane: abuse your range\nIf you play Ashe you should know that having 600 range, most adcs cannot reach you in lane and if they&#039;re about to CS you can wave a free AA to win a trade.\nIn league, Range just does not come with enough drawbacks. I never realised before the base stats nerfs how marksmen&#039;s stats were high actually\nAs a reminder, Yasuo has 60 AD and 30 armor \nCaitlyn has 62 AD and 32 armor while having 650 range it just makes no sense considering how overpowered range is in lane.\nMy point is that with -4 AD -5 armor and -2 hp regen Yasuo might be able to lane against adcs.\nthere are some Yasuo mains who are already able to bring him botlane, with -4 AD adcs will poke less, **and they will sustain less from doran&#039;s blade **. with -2 hp regen they will sustain less and doran&#039;s shield will be weaker on them, FFW healing is also being reduced after lvl 1 and the bonus movement speed is being nuked by 50%.\n\n**_To summarize what is going to happen_**\n\n{{champion:81}} will need a nerf. Already op with muramana+seraphin, but now crit is being nerfed and bork (that he already builds) will be buffed\nI can see new essence reaver (ER) being good on him. Additionally he does not use FFW.\n{{champion:236}} will make a come back, one of the strongest user of {{item:3153}} +{{item:3071}} combo, and ER will be strong on him. Additionally he does not use FFW.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNoyiugLmV0\n{{champion:202}} absolutly broken, LDR total armor pen+lethality+stormrazor is insane, everyone who has access to PBE should try it.\n{{champion:21}} Did not test her, but the same thing should happen on a scale that i do not know.\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:110}} from crit to BORK, I assume the same thing will happen to {{champion:145}} \n{{champion:51}}{{champion:498}}  nerfed in every single way, they both scale too much with crit to have their power remaining the same with BORK\n\n\nthe changes that I support for the sake of diversity:\n-base stats nerfs\n-FFW nerfs\n-IE bonus damage nerfed against baron and dargon\n-Crit powerspike reduced, IE not giving flat crit+zeal crit reduced\n-ADCS burst against squishies reduced\n\nthe changes i am skeptical about:\n-LDR total armor pen\n-BORK being stronger than before 7.9\n\nthe changes i am totally against:\n-stormrazor, very bad idea\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Nqqc2FHf9Ug?t=68","replies":[{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-05-09T17:00:45.876+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":13,"body":"A well thought out critique post?

You could all very well be reading literally every thread on Gameplay, and we'd still have no way of knowing, because there is strictly no indication out there when you do so, whether it be on the Boards, in the Dev Corner, or in the patch notes. Whenever a Rioter says that the devs do read the Boards, we can only take them on their word and whichever red post they left on a particular thread, and that's just not good enough.\n\nThis isn't to say that you don't read the threads or comments in this thread, but if nothing else, it would help to work towards a way of keeping us in the loop when you do read through a thread, even if you do engage. With just the tech at hand, a simple comment like \"hey, I've read this thread\" could already go a long way. With just a bit more short-term work, some sort of other icon that automatically shows up next to threads visited by a Rioter, with perhaps Rioter name and timestamp, could also help tremendously. If implemented that way, you would not even have to do any extra work to signify to us players that Riot does in fact go through the threads we write, as we'd have more than just assurances with little further acknowledgment anywhere else.\n\nOn the subject of engagement, though, while it's understandable that the devs may not want to directly interact with an environment that's often quite hostile to them, that still doesn't justify not engaging with players at all. At the end of the day, Riot is a company, and interacting with players is a job that someone has to do in order to maintain positive relations. The lack of engagement has made itself felt, and damaged the way players regard Riot on the Boards, and across the internet in general. Riot engaging with players is a necessity, not a luxury, and if it is being treated as the latter, then nobody has any business praising the game on its communications, even if they were great five years ago.\n\nHowever, because interacting with players on spaces like these is a difficult and time-consuming job, it's also not really fair to put that responsibility on you specifically, or other devs, because you already have a job that takes up a huge amount of time and energy. It might therefore be better to have dedicated Rioters act as direct relays between players and the rest of the company, using their own knowledge of the game and Riot to speak as experts and bring devs in on particularly relevant topics. I know that Riot has stayed away from this due to not wanting to create distance between devs and players, but right now the net result is very much the same, in that devs simply don't have the time to deal adequately with all of the players League has amassed over time. I suggested this to a Rioter in the past (I think it may have been Riot Sparkle), and got a positive response; has there been any internal work on this in the meantime already?","replies":[{"poster":"Fearless","date":"2018-05-10T01:58:26.773+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":15,"body":"First off, some real talk: If you'd like more engagement, work on communicating concisely. \n\nSecond: This reply implies that there is value in the simple knowledge that a rioter has seen a post.

In the end, we still have no developer response on the topic of player feedback regarding the marksman changes, nor do we even have any proof that a Rioter actually picked up on any of the points brought up in the OP here. The only evidence we have is of a Rioter trying to save face, and coming across as personally offended at criticism that was directed at the dev team collectively, without singling anyone out.

I&#x27;d love to spend more time on boards, but I do so currently with a big hit to my ability to speak with players effectively.\n\nI'm sorry, Tumblr is a communications channel for Riot now? Twitter is a proper communications platform for player feedback? The only social media you mentioned that has any relevance relative to the Boards is Reddit, and Reddit isn't as negative because criticism and design discussion has been actively moderated out of the space, in favor of pro play highlights. How do you justify spreading out across all of these channels, all save for _Riot's official discussion boards?_ This is a space designed, owned and managed by Riot: if you really don't like it, change it.\n\nWhile this may not be worded in the nicest way, when it comes to negative feedback, you guys really do have to suck it up. Sure, straight-up abuse is not okay, but that's what moderators are for. No matter what you do, you will always get criticism, and that criticism will rarely be voiced by people who are perfectly even-headed. This is not unique to the Boards or to Riot, it exists for literally every game, and literally any in-game forum is filled with negativity. Let's not pretend the Boards are a special case. Moreover, I keep reading that Riot devs have \"a thick skin\", but what I'm seeing are a bunch of people who got so burnt by generic player complaints that they have chosen to remove themselves from their own boards, and instead hide in safe spaces where they don't need to deal with difficult questions or comments. If you really don't want to communicate properly with us, go right ahead, but then don't claim to value engaging with players. Whether you agree with my proposals or not, I think we can both agree that Riot's communication with players is not at its best, certainly not on here, and needs to change. Would you agree with this last statement?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Fearless,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g32KQLxU,comment-id=000600000000000000000001,timestamp=2018-05-10T01:58:26.773+0000)\n> \n> Lastly, I don&#x27;t personally like the idea that we&#x27;d have assigned forums folks.

Unsurprisingly, I think it&#x27;s important we get the incentives right, rather than forcing anyone to do something that isn&#x27;t beneficial to them.\n\nWhen will you put in the work? The Boards have been dysfunctional for years now, and not a single thing has been done to fix them. I joined the moderation team last year specifically to push for the Gameplay community to become more constructive in its feedback, and saw an in-house environment rooted in apathy and inertia. Nobody was willing to put in the time, effort or resources to meaningfully improve the Boards, and what little constructive talk that did happen led to nothing. While I understand that you may have good intentions at heart here, it feels like I'm getting the same excuses again, with little in the way of constructive responses and ideas. \n\nAt the end of the day, the main problem here is one of ambiguity: we don't know which threads Rioters read, we don't know what Riot's overall communications strategy is, if there is one to begin with, and we don't know when/if the Boards will ever see the improvements they so desperately need. Your company has built an utterly shoddy discussion space that innately pushes its community away from constructive discussion, yet you still choose to blame us players, rather than push for solutions. I don't think that's okay, and I think we need to stop antagonizing each other if you want to regain our trust. If you want us to remain engaged, you will have to engage with us, one way or the other.\n\nEDIT: One more thing I don't get: you came to this thread to supposedly give praise to a player for writing a lengthy, detailed feedback post, but when another player takes the (proportionately smaller) time and effort to also give you respectful and constructive feedback... you lash out at them? Suddenly, my oversized post is the reason why you refuse to communicate on the Boards entirely? Perhaps that wasn't your intent, but I feel your reply came across as fairly rude and dismissive, considering how I came to you politely with both a problem statement and a proposed solution.","replies":[{"poster":"Coltrane","date":"2018-05-10T08:35:52.267+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"The problem is not the length of your post (not only) is that you are salty.

Sure, I'm not entirely happy with the state of League, or the Boards, and I have plenty of criticism for both, but in doing so I am trying to _help_. Criticizing something and suggesting improvements is a natural part of any kind of process involving an ongoing system, and it is only by ignoring that part that the system dies. I'm not here to call Riot names, or to just bring the atmosphere of the Boards down, I'm here to do my part in giving feedback on how the game and this space can improve over time. If giving feedback about a problem is being \"salty\", then we could use more salt, provided of course it is formulated constructively.\n\nI also think you should probably elaborate on what you mean by \"entitled\": at the end of the day, League is a product that demands a heavy commitment in time from its players, and is designed to foster long-term engagement. It is a game that needs its players much more than the players need it, and while it is indeed free to play, it nonetheless pressures players to spend money on content, including gameplay-related content. Players do have a right to make their voice heard, and while certainly nobody should expect the entire game to revolve around them, it is perfectly valid to give criticism even if you haven't yet made a monetary purchase. One should not have to spend money just to be listened to, and free-to-play games that do implement that policy tend to be rather short-lived.\n\nFor sure, League is a popular game still, but it has changed in many ways that a great deal many players have disliked, and while Riot's communications have been good a few years back, they absolutely aren't anymore, as evidenced in this very thread. Arguing the contrary by repetition does not make those any truer, and to attempt to suppress that kind of criticism is to do Riot themselves a disservice, as it deprives them of a valuable resource they should be using to grow their game and themselves.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ultîma","date":"2018-05-10T15:24:35.841+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fearless, I appreciate the input about Rioter engagement and player communication but what are your thoughts about the points OP raised? \n\nIt's responses like these that single out a negative player comment rather than addressing the topic that generate this perception that Riot will not respond to, or care about player opinions and analysis.

The latter allows for dialogue and properly works with a medium in which at least two people are conversing. By contrast, the former is completely one-sided, and does not really bring in anyone else on its own: Meddler could very well be posting that stuff to an empty audience, and that much would be the same amount of \"communication\". He does engage with players thereafter, but rarely do his responses produce anything conclusive (S@20 generally only finds a half-dozen useful posts at most, and they typically discuss only what'll happen next patch, or tentatively the patch after).\n\nRiotRepertoir I think has done a better job of two-way communication, mostly, but my issue with his own posting schedule is that it's completely inconsistent. One week, Repertoir's answering literally over a hundred different comments, including over the weekend, and then right after he's gone for two months. If we had devs rotating on doing this kind of thing, so that there'd be no downtime, things might be better, but a few other Rioters have also pointed out that Rep can do this because he personally can afford to commit a ton of personal time to communicating with us. I don't think we can expect this of every developer, nor should we enforce that on people who already work intense hours every week on their main job. The very fact that these people are the ones expected to also do the communicating is precisely what's contributing to these deficiencies.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Son Foku,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g32KQLxU,comment-id=000600000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-10T01:48:58.746+0000)\n>\n> I also see them comment here and there, and I don&#x27;t really feel they should have people full time engaging the player base in forums.

There is always discussion to be had, whether it's about the short-term impact of a recent patch, or the long-term design goals of certain mechanics, champions and systems. League is a game in ongoing development, and as long as there is something to improve (of which there are hundreds), then there is always room for discussion, which happens consistently on here.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Son Foku,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=g32KQLxU,comment-id=000600000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-05-10T01:48:58.746+0000)\n> \n> But then again, at the end of the day you&#x27;ll just have everyone on the boards saying they&#x27;re hitting &#x27;select all&#x27; and stamping them.\n\nSure, though having a specific Rioter name and timestamp associated with the stamp function could alleviate that by giving us specifics. In the end, though, if there really is no truly observable difference between Riot actually reading our posts, and only pretending to read them, then Riot is simply not working with our feedback in a manner we can clearly see. Rioters pointing to more threads, player comments, etc. could help significantly in this respect, as it would be at least proof that they acknowledged what we wrote.\n\nOn that note, I think a good example of a Rioter communicating with players is jinxylord: when he worked on reverting Rengar, he not only posted a detailed list of design goals, implementations, and so on, but also chatted with a whole bunch of PBE players, including quite a few Rengar mains, to discuss some of his ideas and which ones to implement. When he did that, he truly brought us on board the development process, and the element of player participation was undeniable. It was possible to pinpoint exactly which posts led to which changes in Rengar's revert/rework, and that I think is one of the core reasons why the project turned out successful. Ideally, every change to existing features in the game should include this kind of process, at least for champions, but in the meantime there are still some baby steps Riot can take to show that they acknowledge our feedback.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2018-05-10T15:31:30.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you'd like to see more posts like the one the OP put up then engage with that topic, not reply to some wangrod (my /r/mattcolville is leaking) bitching about engagement while not engaging with the topic at hand yourself.

Stormrazer definitely seems a bit busted particularly on unintended users.\n\nMy biggest complaint in this game at the moment is still how high all the damage is and how hard it is to be actually tanky even as a tank.  You essentially get punished for doing the thing you are supposed to do, which is build defense against a high damage threat.\n\nI'm hopefully optimistic.  This season definitely hasn't been as fun for me.  That's not nostalgia speaking either.. I started in season 4 of Rengar Khazix meta and it wasn't that great.  My favorite meta thus far was last season tank meta because it lead to more interesting (and longer) team fights.\n\nFor me it would really help if they cleared up what issue they are having with mages/tanks/adc's/supports.  What is it they are supposed to be doing and not doing?  I feel like they keep nerfing the parts of these characters for things they are SUPPOSED to do.  Like mages have always had strong wave clear, but less ability to roam due to less mobility than assassins.  Tanks not being able to tank things just seems strange...  they keep adding true damage, nerfed the overall HP in the game twice, have multiple anti tank runes and items, and most of the Resolve tree is gated behind building up over the course of a game (Overgrowth, the passive HP in the tree, Conditioning at 10 minutes etc).  ADC's have been a bit too strong for almost 2 seasons, but they seem reluctant to remove power from them despite making large changes to remove some power from the support role by taking away all the support specific active items.\n\nCrossing my fingers waiting for the next meta shift.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electro522","date":"2018-05-09T21:38:33.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another Ashe main here.
