Urgot doesn't have much to say about a landed Roar -> Decimate. Good Sions will space it out to where Urgot can't just flip him during his Q.\n\nAlso, Urgot guzzles mana *way* faster than Sion, who can essentially spam E and Q haphazardly.\n\nAdditionally, should Urgot ever kill Sion using his E and Q, he has no way of avoiding a good 300+ damage from Sion's passive.\n\nWhat's good here though is that Urgot scales immensely with level vs high health immobile melee targets. Gaining tons of max health damage from his passive and having access to a 25% health true damage execute. Black Cleaver helps too. But Urgot's power vs Sion comes after the laning phase, not during it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EloElXDee","date":"2018-12-02T21:16:12.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're high af if you think those are counters.
