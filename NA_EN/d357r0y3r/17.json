Eve's Q is a skillshot yknow, in fact Evelynn is literally Ahri if she required skill. Because she is literally a harder ahri. Evelynn is much easier to counter as well, because a control ward has the ability to ruin the entire game for an eve. Like as long as you invade + ward the enemy evelynn early game she is done. This is why Eve is hard to play, you need to form a strat around avoiding this. Also if ur skillshot misses, chances are you will not get your charm.

Her charm, E, also hits the first enemy hit, so winions are a bitch and a half for her. \n\nAnd her only source of saftey, with the removal of Q bonus MS and now converted into the passive(which is only a 20% MS bonus for 3 seconds), for a micro Phase Rush, is her R, and if her R is down, unless she lands a perfect charm, she's very open to being harassed if she doesnt 1) have R up 2) doesn't have her passive active. \n\nso my tip(s) for fighting ahri, is \n1. * find someone who can out damage/harass her, or assassins. i struggle so fucking hard when it comes to champs like brand, lux, yasuo, zed, talon, fizz etc.  if you have someone who can outmobilize her like yasuo (bonus, yasuo can block all of her spells, and her E has a delayed launch time, so it can be predictable), or maybe irelia even, even leblanc too, or even dodge her spells like fizz playful/trickster etc.\n2. * you can use the minions to block her charm (another tip, her Q is slightly longer than a minion wave lined up, while E is slightly shorter.) and if she misses her charm, punish..the...fuck...out...of...it....with her new charm, if she lands it, she gains 20% bonus magic damage in her spells. so if she misses it, shes an awkward sitting duck. And thats another thing. \n3. * let her outplay herself. she has quite low cooldowns (Q=7 W=9/8/7/6/5 E=12), but her mana costs are quite up there as well (Base mana: 418-843 Q:65-85 mana W: 40 Mana E: 70 Mana EQW lvl 3 combo=165 mana or, 36% of her total base mana at lvl 3.) And from playing other ahris, a inexperienced ahri will spam a lot of spells constantly. so if they keep on spamming Q, they would be oom by 6 Qs. And heres the major downside to her style of her kit\n4. * her Q E and R are all straight lined skillshots, R being the fastest, but used mostly for repositioning, E being slightly fast, but has a very short charge up time (i think 0.4 seconds?) and Q being somewhat slow. so shes not only very predictable, but also very easy to dodge if youre smart enough\n\n\nSo to recap:\n\nPassive: \n1. it's a mini phase rush. gives her 20% MS for 3 seconds\n2. this only activates if she hits 2 abilities on a champion. good for poke\n\nQ:\n1. her main power. \n2. can reach a full wave but has hard time clearing it until rank 4-5\n3. its a semi-slow straight skillshot that deals true damage on its way back, so the easiest way to dodge it is 1) know its distance 2) step to the side\n4.  Watch an ahris patterns. if she likes to spam the shit out of it, she will waste mana early game VERY fast, especially in her Q. left click on her to see how much mana she has. if she has above 155 mana, she has enough for a nasty EQ combo, so wait till shes down to less than 130. that way, she wont be able to connect her Q if she lands a E. Punish heavy mana use\n5. every enemy she hits, she gains a stack, max 3 stacks per Q. at 9 stacks, she can heal herself for 3 / 5 / 9 / 18 (+ 9% AP) for every enemy hit\n6. does not reveal enemies in bushes, but will still add stacks if it does hit them. good for face checking\n\nW: \n1. still useless rito plz{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}} \n2. its basically still RNG. the weakest of her kit.\n3. the fox fires will prioritized whoever ahri Auto attacked, elsewise, it randomly goes to 3 nearby enemies\n\nE:\n1. one of her most important non-ultimate spells in her kit. miss this, you're dead\n2. charm increases in duration by rank, 1.4 / 1.55 / 1.7 / 1.85 / 2 (i personally like to max this second)\n3. charms the first enemy hit\n4. Does not reveal target, but will still cause sound effects if it does land. good for safe face checking\n5. if she hits it, her W and Q and R can deal an additonal 20% magic damage\n6. prob one of the best teamfight starters, so avoid it as best as you can\n7. did i mentioned she hates to charm minions? eew gross{{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} \n\nR: \n1. unlike old ahri, new ahri is now extremy dependant on her R for mobility\n2. consists of 3 flash range dashes, can use in a duration of 10 seconds, with a 1 second gap inbetween\n3. the best way to counter this is to watch her movements and to \"dance with her\" around minions. remember her combo is usually R E (ahri....aR..E...get it....*sigh*), so if you dance with her fast enough, and she misses her charm, her R2 and R3 will be awkward or sloppy, and Q wont be as crazy powerful.  her R is very straightlined, but fast. shes not unstoppable, shes not invisible\n4. mostly used for repositioning.\n\n\n\nthis is as most as i can think of. she's pretty squishy, and shes unsafe without her passive or ultimate, and you gotta land that dang charm, but it hits the first enemy hit, so use your minions to your biddings. thats...honestly all i can think of tbh. theres prob more, but oh well. im only 167K Mastery points on her, so im not all that great, but these are just some ideas on how to fight her. ya gotta revolve around when she's least safe (without E R or mana) Hope this helps you a bit on how to fight the seduction of a gumiho~\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} {{sticker:sg-kiko}} ","replies":[{"poster":"TempName54846","date":"2018-08-16T07:23:42.084+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":">miss this, you're dead\n\nomegafuckinglul","replies":[{"poster":"Kitsunes Lust","date":"2018-08-16T07:26:03.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TempName54846,realm=EUNE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pYMl6w4i,comment-id=00180000,timestamp=2018-08-16T07:23:42.084+0000)\n>\n> omegafuckinglul\n\nXD eh in a sense its true. without her E she kinda opens herself up without use of R, and it decreases her damage output as well...*shrugs* i aint meanin no hatin, just trying to at least give some form of ways to deal wit her is all :/","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2018-08-16T15:17:30.525+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"someone posted a week or a few weeks ago, a video of an Ahri killing a full Hp Sona after missing every skill shot and dealing damage with only R W auto attacks, electrocute and ignite.\n\nand it had lots of upvotes.
