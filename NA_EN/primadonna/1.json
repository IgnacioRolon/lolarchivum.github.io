It&#039;s safe to assume I was banned because I said %%% twice (the ban came instantly after the game). It&#039;s funny because I didn&#039;t even think twice about using it because gay people say it to each other all the time lol. Regardless, no excuses, that&#039;s fair, I&#039;m not saying I didn&#039;t deserve the ban. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I know it&#039;s very thin ice going forward, but _how_ thin is it? Should I just stop talking on League for the next year? I&#039;ve put a lot of time and money in this account and will do whatever it takes to keep it. I&#039;d be devastated if I lost it over using some stupid word me and my community use everyday. This is my first punishment ever, and I&#039;m surprised it&#039;s this serious. I&#039;m also surprised they permaban players this easily... \r\n\r\ntl;dr: i&#039;m shook","replies":[{"poster":"iamthegoatofwar","date":"2017-11-23T15:25:32.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your usage of the F word likely triggered it.

I suggest you leave communication to only things you need to say  \"enemy jungle is on way to 'insert lane' \"   \"mid headed towards 'insert lane' \"   \"I am going to try and gank 'insert lane' \"  and for saying gj when somebody gets a good gank off or secures a kill that would otherwise got away or rescues an ally from being killed.  \n\nOr your other choice is to not talk at all in game chat and just use the ping system, you have a lot of games to do this for before you will drop down from your 14 day ban so it will be hard work but I am sure you can do it so your account isn't in as much danger as it is now, good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Primadonna","date":"2017-11-23T07:56:58.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Or your other choice is to not talk at all in game chat and just use the ping system, you have a lot of games to do this for before you will drop down from your 14 day ban so it will be hard work but I am sure you can do it so your account isn&#x27;t in as much danger as it is now, good luck.\n\nWhat if I go like 0/15 in a game?
