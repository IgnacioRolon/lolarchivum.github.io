Always around 60 Fps under 50 ping. The thing is recently (around patch 7.4 ish) my whole computer started crapping up whenever i get into a game. I get into game and BOOOM my screen freezes for like 1 min i get back, go into lane BOOOM freeze again and for the first 10-5 min of the game i keep freezing as the game goes it gets better. Is anyone else dealing with this and is there a solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-11T22:45:49.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've seen some reports like this for some mac players, and we've discovered a potential issue with the shake mouse to locate feature.
