One of the most important things to know if you want to climb and not be an ass to your team is how to lose lane without inting your face off. Smurfing in low elo its almost shocking how different losing lane is vs high elo. People in gold and below lose lane and die 10 times, in higher elo they lose lane with 2-3 deaths and a cs defecit. Climbing in game you will inevitably end up in a lane you simply cant win be it a bad matchup or jungle shenanigans and knowing how to take a controlled loss that your team can recover from is super important. New players need to learn how to sacrifice cs/xp in order to not feed. A game where you lose lane dying twice and being 30 cs down is far easier to win for your team than a game where you keep trading and trying to cs while behind and feeding 8 kills to an irelia or some other bullshit champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2018-07-19T10:57:55.066+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make them face 'Terrible Bot'\n{{champion:6}} that has a free flash every 1 second","replies":[{"poster":"Chembaron Yamada","date":"2018-07-19T11:54:47.142+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And no cooldown on his shotgunknees!\nDoesn't matter where you stand, you will eat 3 shotgunknee procs per second!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PyroLux","date":"2018-07-19T13:13:02.896+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"\"Smurf\" you're not fooling anyone buddy, a simple opgg shows that you have a 45% wr in gold","replies":[{"poster":"Highwiseene","date":"2018-07-19T14:02:58.468+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh... even though he has a bad winrate and terrible KDAs it could be possible he's like a low diamond OTP playing offroles on this account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ISLAMICWARRIOR99","date":"2018-07-19T19:48:27.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2018-07-19T21:34:54.228+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Unless you think my 0/37 raka game was just a bad game\n\nLol Riot thinks it was XD","replies":[{"poster":"ISLAMICWARRIOR99","date":"2018-07-20T02:56:23.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bob the Toastr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ZuxABypi,comment-id=000200020000,timestamp=2018-07-19T21:34:54.228+0000)\n>\n> Lol Riot thinks it was XD\n\nNah they gave me a 14 day timeout :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TempName54846","date":"2018-07-19T18:08:43.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver players smurf as well, whats your point","replies":[]},{"poster":"StillHittinLicks","date":"2018-07-21T01:43:44.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAOOOOOOOOOO","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"remakoro","date":"2018-07-19T12:20:59.757+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well...

What all of the abbreviations mean. Various pings your teammates might give you and what they mean. How to ping. When to ping. What to do for different pings.
