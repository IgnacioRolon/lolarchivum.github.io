Also wondering why I get punished for reports made by teams who queue together, gang up and bully, feed, but hey since there's 4 of them and only 1 of me and because the tribunal encourages people to always punish no matter what I get sanctioned for doing nothing but defending myself from a constant barrage of insults for 30+ minutes. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-01T22:55:58.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you just need a little nudge to make this boards account sync up with your Summoner Level on the client. Looks like this did the trick. \n\nOn the top of people ganging up on you with reports: having everyone report you in the same match doesn't mean you're more likely to get punished. Also, Tribunal does not exist any longer and hasn't for quite awhile now. Also, always keep in mind that you have the option of simply not responding and then reporting them in post game. That's the best method of protecting yourself while alerting us to any bullying or feeding that happened.","replies":[]}]}
