I own the NA club for eve mains that started since clubs released. I fell in love with her for what she was back then. While I can&#039;t deny the aesthetics look great on the new one and she has the bad@$$ factor now, I just can&#039;t find the same level of satisfaction I had with her old kit. Say what you want about level 1 stealth or an ult that didn&#039;t make sense, the fact is you removed my favorite champion and replaced it with a new one and made it look similar. Every time I queue with her trying to learn her new style I feel resent and disappointment. Seeing my profile with the high mastery 7 is a reminder of how crap I am of the new one compared to the old one. I will never reach the same level of satisfaction or skill with the new one. I&#039;m just not mechanically gifted for assassins, nor patient enough to wait for fights to start.... simply put, I&#039;m not meant to be with this new Evelynn. I accept this fact now, and I&#039;ve started the search for a new main. maybe I&#039;ll play her from time to time, but all that I request is you do me solid, and just take out the mastery 7 and change it to 5. I really don&#039;t want to feel this way about old evelynn anymore...\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll still keep my custom evelynn phone case though, new eve doesn&#039;t have the same splash.\r\n\r\nThx,\r\nRae","replies":[]}
