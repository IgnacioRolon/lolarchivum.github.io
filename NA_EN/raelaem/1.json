Sure I&#039;m happy shes getting reworked, and yay shes getting her base model revamped....\r\n\r\nBut how come Shen gets the golden treatment with skins/spashart... the works... and you only commit half way with zyra... Her in game models are absolute SHIT. I have endured quite a bit of neglect from you. Why create a champion only to ignore her because &quot;it takes too much time&quot;?... Why invest in a champion when you have no intention of treating her just as fairly?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then to add to the pile of salt I have built up, you preview the infernal Diana skin https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-20JEbfMqm_0/VwQZHz2oryI/AAAAAAAANDI/uTgXImIP13EQF9BWo15f_lWLR7lrCSgMw/s640/dianaturn.jpg\r\n\r\nWhat a major slap in the face, holy shit... I&#039;m sorry, I know I&#039;m coming off rude and childish here... but lets be real here.... Infernal Diana was only known since All Stars.... Zyra rework has been known for much longer.... are you telling me that you are willing to make another skin just to ignore one you all ready made on a different champion just because you know Zyra is not as popular as Diana?....\r\n\r\nI am livid, and pissed the hell off... At least give me some hope and say its being worked on and might take a bit longer after the rework, but to completely dismiss it is a huge mistake to a rather loyal player base.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t believe me, go ahead and check out our Zyra mains reddit page.","replies":[{"poster":"Nanuk Pihoqahiak","date":"2016-04-07T09:43:32.007+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":5,"body":"What gets me about the Inferal Diana is that at a glance, I thought it was an update to Zyra's skin.

I don't look at them as a particular perk towards a champion, and if you don't follow the teams, which a lot of us don't, then they mean next to nothing. Why would you walk around with a big logo on your champion if you don't follow esports or like that particular team? Those skins are less for the fans of the champions, and more for the fans of esports. \n\nIt's just a regular Zyra base with an SKT T1 uniform. I don't think the 750 RP price has anything to do with it. Riot has shown us that they can make amazing high quality 750 RP skin that rivals some of their more expensive ones, look at Order of the Lotus Irelia that came out last year.\n\nWhen I look at the new Diana skin I'm underwhelmed. Like someone else said here, it looks a lot like Wildfire Zyra, and I don't even like Wildfire Zyra. They're both pretty lackluster, and the similarity to Wildfire Zyra skin would be off putting if I played Diana. Both skins should be fixed, but again the concepts are pretty dull to begin with.\n\nI think the regular excuses Riot throws out are wearing a little thin when it comes to Zyra.

Mostly because updating the texture on a champ skin doesn't mean you have to also update all the plants and stuff. I mean, nobody really gives a shit about the plants. They're already kind of ugly, and they have a short duration when they're not killed immediately, anyway. Plants take too long? Ok, then just ignore them and make the actual skin part of Wildfire not terrible.\n\nMy first thought about this Diana skin was \"Great, first LeBlanc and Kha'zix get improved Zyra base skins, now Diana gets an improved Zyra wildfire skin.\" It is pretty irritating when other champs get skins that are basically better versions of you.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of skins that share similar themes and aesthetics, so it seems pretty irrational to be like \"wildfire Zyra looks like ass, so you can't make any new fire-themed skins that look better!\"\n\nI think the root issue is more that Zyra players are generally bitter as fuck about being a literal red-headed stepchild. When she's not nerfed, she's ignored. When she's not ignored, Riot just bullshits about her (that plant AI \"buff\" that was supposedly so strong it would need to be monitored...LOL). And now that she is getting some work, Riot is balancing her as support in the biggest \"fuck you\" I've ever seen. Then add to it that she hasn't had a non-esports skin (which Katey has said many times aren't counted in the rotation) since **October 2013.**\n\nIn the League of Mobility Creep, power creep, AD overlords, juggernauts, hypertank carries, and magic resist given out like mana from heaven, Zyra's still moving at 325 MS with junk-tier base stats, dumb-as-fuck plants, delays or animation locks on every ability, and is a \"cc mage\" whose cc is outclassed by half the roster.

Not sure how you can be both. But regardless, there are totally different Riot employees that work on skins from the ChampUp team. Shen got a REWORK so he got new splashes and art because that's the quality that they are committing to with any rework. Zyra is getting attention in the MYMU for some of the gameplay issues she suffers from, and they are doing what the can to make progress on her one step at a time. She gets her base skin updated texture wise, but it is so much work to recolor and work on every texture she has to do her base, Wildfire, Haunted, and SKT if they felt all the skins needed changes. I think only her base and Wildfire look off from normal Riot quality, especially for a champ multiple years old.

Bro I get the different strokes for different folks but as a ex zyra mid main since end of season 3 the way she looks should be the last thing on the list. Like I have sadly, bitterly and angrily watched over the seasons as Zyra has been nerfed into the state of a full support. I'm not calling something she should of originally has a buff (good ai on her plants) and even if I did recognize it as such it was just stripped away. I've made this post about Zyra needing help or needing buffs more times than I'd like to count. What the hell was the point of \"reworking\" her when she has to depend on such a random uncontrollable mechanic (passive) to be strong only for riot to nerf it and then nerf her damage once again and then nerf her ONCE AGAIN for a role that is a secondary one until she finally has been forcefully pushed into that role and is no longer viable mid? I really hope those that play and love Malhazar are watching because if you don't stop playing him support what Riot did to Zyra is going to happen to him. If you want him to stay a mage and not a support stop taking him bot. She was my favorite champ now I don't even look twice at her in champ select. Before the last patch I almost found a way to make mid zyra work but the patch took that away from me before I got a chance to experiment further. Zyra has low base speed, depends entirely on plants being nearby from passive to do any significant damage and is ridiculously, laughably squishy. Why does Riot hate her so much?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crystallux9","date":"2017-02-14T09:37:54.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have literally been playing Zyra since the day she was released. She was the one champ I absolutely fell in love with before she was even released, enough to buy the bundle. And I never looked back. I've seen her go through a ton of changes: from being a powerful, over dominating mid later who one shots her opponents with her incredible burst, to the much needed nerfs, to being a not as viable mid laner, and then a pretty okay support. So of course, I was ecstatic about the rework. It was much needed and put my favorite champion back on the map again. But I repeatedly get frustrated  (and I think every Zyra main will agree with me) when I see champs that get skins pretty much every season, or already have a ton of skins, get another. Zyra only has two available year round, and the other is limited edition. I've been hoping now that she is more popular, she'll get a new skin, but who knows... She is long overdue for one.
