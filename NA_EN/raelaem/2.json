Being greedy is more beneficial for Full Ap eve for sure. Of course there are some times I get the occasional {{item:3742}} or {{item:3102}} if I need some tankiness but its just depends on the game. Also if you do some innovative clears that I'd rather not share you can pull off some interesting gank paths that really confuse the enemy jungler where you might be. Level 3 ganks and then camping the guys lane you just killed will insta tilt them into raging at their team.
