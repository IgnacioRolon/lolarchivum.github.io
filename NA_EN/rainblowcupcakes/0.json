Let your jungler know you want a gank!\n     Letting your jungler know you want/need a gank will put you high up on their priority list. Don't blame your jungler for not ganking if they've been ganking other lanes.\n2. Let your team know about wards!\n     Saying \"ward in river\" will let your jungler know where it is, when it dies, and whether or not it's safe to gank. Not to mention it allows ganks from alternate routes to be much more effective and surprising to the enemy.\n3. Announce when the enemy uses defensive spells\n     When the enemy uses Flash/Ghost/Heal/Barrier/Cleanse/Exhaust, your jungler will be much more likely to gank the enemy while they have a disadvantage. \n4. If you don't want a gank, tell your jungler!\n     It's a waste of everybody's time if the jungler shows up to gank, and waits 10 seconds for you to tell them to leave. Communication is key.\n5. Use your pings!\n     If you want your jungler to help push the tower after a gank, target ping the tower. If you want them to screw off after a gank, retreat ping them. Communicate your intentions clearly and the jungler will understand.\n6. Announce the enemy junglers position!\n     If the enemy jungler is spotted at top lane, make sure your jungler at bot lane knows. They can turn this knowledge into a safe dragon or counter jungle.\n7. Stay Aware!\n     If your jungler shows up to gank, make sure you notice and follow up their gank with your own cc/damage. Most junglers announce their ganks via pinging and team chat.","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2014-12-30T04:39:15.104+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"8. Do not push the daylights out of your lane!\n    This forces the gank to become a tower dive (which can work, but can backfire way more often). It also pulls the enemy jungler towards your lane as they will be more inclined to show up to either gank you, countergank the dive or cover the lane while their teammate recalls. A 2 v 2 under tower tends to favour the duo with the tower (in early and mid game). Note that pretty much all junglers will never towerdive an enemy who is at full health as it tends to result in a 1 for 1 which doesn't achieve much in the long run.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Borg","date":"2014-12-30T15:19:03.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason this applies to top laners must often. If you push all game and flame me for not ganking I'm probably not going to help much unless it's the most obvious gank  imaginable. Partly because you make me not like you while bot and mid have been typing \"ty :D\" every gank. But more importantly you're showing me that 1) you don't play jungle and 2) you don't know how ganks work, so I'm not going to believe you know how to take advantage of it. And no, just because you were pushed under tower for thirty seconds doesn't mean I'm going to sprint across the map to save you. My world doesn't revolve around you.\n\nOne last thing. If their jungler is setting up a tent top, good. Your job is to not feed and cs as much as you can. Unless I happen to be in the area, I'm not helping much. I'll be bot getting the carries fed and taking every drag.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SeargentAnus","date":"2014-12-30T04:15:08.563+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right before the gank is happening. Walk on the opposite side of where your jungler is sitting. Your lane opponent will naturally walk toward where your jungler is making the gank much smoother. \n\nYou can act extremely aggressive the next few minutes after the gank if they lack vision. Make it seem as if they're being camped by your jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Clomph","date":"2014-12-30T03:44:38.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for posting this..\nYou should also make one for Junglers\n\nLike:\n1) Let whoever has a stun (or any form of CC) engage\n2) Be on the same side of the minions as the enemy, or ready to flash in\n3) etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyTaylorSwift","date":"2014-12-30T02:12:36.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If only this were true, I wouldn't hate to jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"DSRM Mobius","date":"2014-12-30T04:11:43.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"jungle isn't bad \neven if your teammates are not that cooperative \nbeing a good jungler is too know where to gank at the right time\nand having a plan to clearing the jungle","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeemoHunter1337","date":"2014-12-30T06:31:24.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hate it when im a zed. and vi sits in the bush 2 minutes for me to initiate, when the enemy is still pushed up.  and yeeh i was pinging the overpushed enemy with no flash while vi counter pings me and tells me to initiate which is  bad choice.\n\nif i go in i have no CC.this enemy will run back causing the gank to fail.if vi goes in she can use Q to smack them or use ult while i can back her up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NewGrange","date":"2014-12-30T04:49:22.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sticky this thread mods, please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmazingGoat","date":"2014-12-30T03:41:49.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great list.
