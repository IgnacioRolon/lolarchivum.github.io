It&#039;s really encouraging to see one involved in feedback on the player base&#039;s opinion of the game&#039;s state. \r\nEven an occasional acknowledgement from a rioter on the boards that the majority of players&#039; opinion on the game state (which has been very unified on a few issues that feel ignored right now) is at least being heard is welcome. Sadly this type of interaction has been an extremely rare occurrence lately :/ It&#039;s a step towards a feeling that the state of the game isn&#039;t a one way conversation, so thanks Bazerka!","replies":[]}
