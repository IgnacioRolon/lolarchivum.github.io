The one request I have for Riot is to make AR URF available ALWAYS like ARAM is. AR URF is basically the only rotating game mode I look forward to, to be honest. \r\nI think that just like ARAM, it&#039;s really a good way for league players to take a break from the normal game and chill, especially after tilting for a couple of games. AR URF is just so fun and chill, and I think anything that is making the game fun for players right now is important in this many times flaming/tilting/trolling community we have at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"Minarde","date":"2017-12-07T00:12:52.365+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I think that just like ARAM, it's really a good way for league players to take a break from the normal game and chill\n\nThat's a problematic viewpoint, as ARAM *is* the normal game for some players.\n\nRegardless, permanent (AR)URF wouldn't be a good idea. It'd add an extra burden on dev resources while overlapping SR and ARAM's gameplay/audience. Dominion was removed because of a similar drain on resources, but at least Dominion had the potential to reach a different audience compared to League's other mdoes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sëtíer","date":"2017-12-06T20:40:58.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vote here!

Additionally we should have it permanently in custom games so that the \"OP champs ruin the gamemode\" argument is rendered irrelevant.\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
