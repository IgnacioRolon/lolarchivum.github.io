That contributes to damage feeling high for a couple of reasons.** Teams without tanks lack a front line, so tend to get burst more due to the lack of soak/zoning. Metas without tanks also mean it&#039;s more likely that each team has 4, or even 5, damage threats on it as well though, especially if enchanters (the main other non damage group) are also being played less. Even if any individual champion&rsquo;s damage isn&rsquo;t any higher the game&#039;s going to feel much more lethal when there are 1, or even 2, more high damage champs per team.\n\nOk yea less tanks means a feeling of more damage in team fights, but this isn&#039;t what we are referring to when we say damage is too high.\nNow when i&#039;m getting 1 shot by a 6/0 khazix 3 levels up and our team doesn&#039;t have a tank, sure that&#039;s our fault and I&#039;m ok with that. \n\n**What we are referring to are 1v1 situations where a 0/0/0 level 3 champion can 1 shot you from 100% health if they land for example just 1 stun.**\nNo longer can you strategize (which is a big part of what makes league fun) after he lands his combo and say &quot;ok now I should farm under turret and wait for my jungler&quot; or &quot;I should back and give up a wave since I lost that trade pretty badly&quot;. You just die instantly.\n\nIf you think I&#039;m exaggerating, let&#039;s take lvl 3 {{champion:63}}  vs {{champion:51}} \n\n{{champion:51}} lvl 3                              \n615 + 80 (from {{item:1055}} ) health\n30 MR\n33 armor\n\n{{champion:63}}  lvl 3\nAD 63\nAP 35 (15 from {{item:1056}} and 20 from sorcery)\n\nBrand Passive: 174 damage (12% + 13% max health as AP damage)\nBrand E: 70 +12 (from AP) damage\nBrand Q: 80 + 19 (from AP)\nBrand W: 75 + 21 (from AP) + 25% total W damage\nScorch: 30\nArcane Comet: 38 + 7 (from AP)\nignite: 130\n2 autos (assuming you can get 2 autos in with your combo which is reasonable): 126\n\nAdd that up:\n704 Magic damage from everything before ignite\n126 AD from autos\n130 true damage from ignite\n\nMinus resistances:\n{{champion:51}} takes\n539 magic damage (23.5% reduced from magic damage)\n94.5 AD (25% reduced damage from AD)\n130 ignite\n\nLet's assume {{champion:51}}  even has {{summoner:7}}  luckily!\n\n695 health + 78 health from {{summoner:7}} (assuming grevious wounds from ignite)- 763 damage from brand = 10 hp {{champion:51}} in ONE SINGLE COMBO\n\nOk sorry he didn&#039;t one shot her from full health with heal in one combo. \nSo I guess you can strategize against it.\n** You can miss a wave and back every time brand or even a single minon hits you with 1 auto, otherwise the next combo will kill you, you&#039;re feeding and it&#039;s your fault not the balancing team&#039;s.**\n\n\n\n\n\nPS Before I get these types of responses, obviously you can dodge brand&#039;s abilities but i&#039;m saying if he does hit his full combo, which basically comes down to landing his stun which isn&#039;t some ridiculous possibility.\n\nAlso caitlyn would probably have heal which would BARELY save her (again this is already assuming you are FULL HEALTH), but that&#039;s just one example. **The health + resistances are about the same for atleast 50 other champions that would take ignite over heal and then would just die.**\n\n**_IMO from even the most bursty champions, at lvl 3 0/0/0 one combo + ignite should do around 65% health, maximum. Not 99% health after healing which is what this calculation came to without exaggeration._**\n\nEdit: I guess I somehow forgot passive damage, so actually she died without heal lol. I edited the post for that. This is what I had gotten before, just to provide context for some of the replies:\n\n> 695 health - 647 damage from brand = 48 health caitlyn\n\n> \n","replies":[{"poster":"Beatrice falls","date":"2018-07-31T18:47:06.714+0000","up_votes":105,"down_votes":7,"body":"Bruh they have no idea what they're saying.

It's one of the struggles with engaging tbh, since it's difficult to actually have in depth conversations while also doing my day job when I feel like I get 80-90% of the value from reading players thoughts, frustrations etc. That leaves you folks feeling like you're shouting into the void, that we don't care/are oblivious etc. Your clarifying question was super reasonable and I only caught it since I saw my reply get referenced here and had me do a double take with a \"wait I don't think that's what I said\" - I wish it was easier to have proper back and forth conversation that wasn't also a full time job in and of itself:/\n\nbtw - not trying to just dump out excuses, this is more just lamenting one of my personal frustrations.

Let's also assume Cait just takes the Q to the face because reasons even though if there are no minions between them she can also net him thus dodging and outranging the Q while also doing like 1/3 of his health from the net+headshot. But these scenarios don't fit the narrative so we must assume Caitlyn stands still and doesn't use her massive auto attack range to zone Brand off and that only Brand knows how to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JPizzle132","date":"2018-08-01T06:11:54.895+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok let's assume you're against a brand and he never lands a single Q, what are you gonna think about that brand? That he's freaking terrible because he never landed a single stun. It goes both ways, that's not the point of what we're saying.\nThe basis of the two sides to the debate is do you think that you should be able to kill a 100% full health champion by landing one single stun? The rest of brand's damage is actually just completely free if you land the stun. If you think yes landing one skill shot earns you an instant kill with no further real skill, that's where we disagree.\nI'm not hating on brand specifically, in fact he's probably fairly balanced at the moment.

Doesent matter if tanks as a role are played at all or not its that Zed and any other assassin and mage can just oneshot you in 0.4 seconds. Fights are short, games snowbally,towers are way too weak! \n\nPEOPLE ARE LITERALLY TELLING THEM THIS SHIT AND THEY CANT UNDERSTAND!

For example MF Auto + Q will instakill most non-tanks (or in this video just a single auto without a Q kills a Lv18 full health target).  Not even full build!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hva7fEXl1Y\n\nAll damage dealers (including supports) can basically 100->0 in one combo anybody who's not a tank.  It's completely out of line... and adding more front loaded damage like Stormrazor is not helping.\n\nZed can miss all his ability and kill somebody with ult + 1 auto.  It's not OK.\n\nEvery mage damage keystone is single target burst.  Why do we need multiple single target burst keystones?  Where's the sustained DPS or AOE mage keystone like deathfire?\n\n\n\n\nAlso mobility is out of control.  Try playing any immobile ADC's... mobility is so high you cannot position well and be safe.  You are 100% reliant on your team to peel.  Mobility AND pealing power both need to be reduced to put some power back into positioning well.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at itemization.  I think the fundamental issue is that all stats compound.  Offensive stats like attack speed, damage, crit chance all compound together.  Defensive stats like health armor/resist all compound together.  So most people are fully one way (all offensive items) or the other (all defensive items).  There's no incentive to be somewhere in the middle.  You never see an ADC with with 2 offensive items and 3 defensive items... it would put you at a big disadvantage with the current itemization.  \n\nSo what happens when you have most people building full offense, you have a bunch of front loaded damage items (Stormrazor/Luden's), and a bunch of front loaded burst damage keystones (electrocute, dark harvest)?  You end up with everybody instakiling everybody else.\n\nCombine this extreme burst damage with extreme mobility creep and the state of the game is not good right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saianna","date":"2018-08-01T14:28:17.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is anyone surprised?
