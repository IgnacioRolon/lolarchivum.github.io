Your team makes a difficult macro move, using {{item:3363}}  to find their team in one quadrant of jungle, rushing 4 man to other side of jungle to ward everything up while one defends turret. You somehow only lose half a towers health, luckily. Now maybe you can use your vision to strategize your split push waveclear to what side enemy isn&#039;t and atleast attempt to defend effectively right?\nNope.\nShortly after their support uses a 60 sec CD trinket {{item:3364}} at no gold cost or risk to kill all the wards of an ENTIRE QUADRANT of the map you just put, with just their adc (probably a Yasuo) to help btw, denying the turtling team all vision on the map. No need to buy {{item:2055}} . Just one {{item:3364}} on one champion.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of their team waveclears everything on the other side of map, takes your jg camps and bushcamps for insta-assasinations if your team DARES step foot past your walls. Now your turtling team just waits for them to take baron and end, or you walk into jg with no vision and probably get 0.05 second assassinated by a {{champion:16}} . Real fun the stomp or get stomped meta btw.\n\nPeople don&#039;t actually think this hard anymore to startegize in solo queue btw including me. It usually goes more like \n\n18 min. &quot;crap one of our guys got caught out&quot;\n19 min. *enemy team rips through 3 turrets and mid inhib* \n20 min. &quot;can we contest baron?&quot; \n20 min. *enemy team has slain the baron!*\n20 min. &quot;Probably not&quot;\n20 min. &quot;Report jg no ganks&quot;\n20 min. *Your team has agreed to a surrender with 5 votes*","replies":[]}
