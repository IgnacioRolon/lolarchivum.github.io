I just wonder how my build would work with Conqueror. Also another rune I think would be good on Darius is Hail of Blades, it would allow you to stack passive much faster, but I can see why it's not really used on him.","replies":[{"poster":"MrFawknSunshine","date":"2019-08-23T22:51:16.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/9.16/platinum/plus/champion/Darius/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-24T04:14:19.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Death's Dance isn't actually that good on Darius. You're not Illaoi who constantly does AOE damage every 2 seconds. Otherwise you're presenting a typical build and pretending it's something you came up with yourself (Typical except for the Titanic Hydra that is). \n\nAs for the keystone runes, I will say there's a little bit more variety in what Darius can use than MrFawknSunshine is claiming, but that variety is limited to only one usable rune in each tree and, in the domination tree, the only usable rune for Darius is Predator.\n\nAlso why in god's name are you taking CDR runes? Darius takes attack speed runes every time regardless of rune loadout.","replies":[]}]}
