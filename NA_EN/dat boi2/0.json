I just wanna say to anyone that has problems with: \"Failed to launch RADS/system/rads_user_kernel.exe\" here is MY solution. \r\n\r\nSo listen, today i wanted to play some LoL but the error showed up.. i was searching trough the forums and i saw 1 video that said to install kernel.exe.\r\nWhen downloaded man on the video said that we need to copy that in Riot Games folder. But i did NOT have any of files he had.. so i scrolled trough the comments and see one man asking what to do bout that, and the man responded with: \"Reinstall the game.\". I reinstalled it and it works :). So you try to reinstall the game and see, to ME it worked :)  P.S i have windows 7 ;)  (sorry for bad english)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-29T19:00:09.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a really old video and has suggestions I would not recommend.  Downloading something like that from an unofficial source is a really bad idea, as you can never be sure what it may actually contain.  I recommend running a virus scan just to be sure.\n\nThe error you're receiving is usually just a security setting with your PC that's blocking the patcher from loading or reading your game files.  You should go over the steps found in the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to help.
