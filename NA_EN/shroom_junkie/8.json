Is he building like this? Well say goodbye to your tushies unless you can end before he gets this build because then he&#039;s fucking unstoppable. Oh, not to mention any defense he might have, which he still has room for two more items. So, say, against an MR team, Spirit Visage, against an AD team, Randuin&#039;s Omen, and no matter what just grab a Guardian Angel and you&#039;ll be unbeatable. They got a lot of CC? Replace Spirit Visage or Randuin&#039;s with a Mercurial Scimitar, its just that much more damage and you can remove all CC affects currently on you. Heck, if they aren&#039;t building armor you can just build it in place of Last Whisper.\r\n\r\nI really can&#039;t imagine anyone defending this. I mean really, 16% of the target&#039;s current health plus all that extra several hundred damage in both forms of physical and a bit of magic so armor doesn&#039;t affect it, every some 0.5 seconds at only 1 attack speed, and with all this AS it&#039;ll probably be about 2 so one of these about every 0.25 seconds, and every 3rd hit deals 32% and all that extra magic damage x2, plus the extra physical damage x2, and whammo.\r\n\r\n&quot;Oh but you can build Thornmail&quot;\r\nOh but you can do that for almost any AD champ. And I don&#039;t think Thornmail actually affects the BotRK passive since it isn&#039;t actual AD and is just an on-hit effect, so its basically returning some 37 to 53 damage back to him every hit and giving them 100 armor, only 65 with the Last Whisper, even less with other armor pens such as runes and masteries, plus there&#039;s the magic damage from Wit&#039;s End and Devourer that isn&#039;t affected by it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kouga","date":"2015-07-09T10:21:08.151+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Coriandr,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=q1UULw7u,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-09T04:07:25.457+0000)\n>\n> I don&#039;t care what anyone says, this is insane attack speed, **every attack** does....\n\nIf I recall, Sated only doubles the on-hits on every *other* attack, not *every* attack.\n\n> And I don&#039;t think Thornmail actually affects the BotRK passive since it isn&#039;t actual AD and is just an on-hit effect\n\nAll armor reduces BotRK's health shred, because it is dealt as additional *physical* damage.

I never read that. Was it recently added to nerf it before official release?\nEither way though, this is insane attack speed, dealing about 8% on the first hit, 16% on the second(Sated), 16%(Double Strike), 16%(Sated), and then just repeating itself for 16% every hit with insane attack speed without even the ult being on, and probably max(2.5) attack speed with it, plus his Q waveclear and juking, plus his W for healing and damage reduction.\n\n> All armor reduces BotRK's health shred, because it is dealt as additional *physical* damage. Therefore, Thornmail **alone** means you only take 4% current health instead of 8%. And that's not considering any other base or bonus stats.\n\nAnd Last Whisper reduces it to 65 armor. Armor pen. reduces it even further and you'll probably come out with about 50-ish armor from Thornmail, then your base armors. So yes, it will be reduced to maybe 12-14% current health damage, but it'll still be a fuck load.","replies":[{"poster":"R110","date":"2015-07-09T13:22:24.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ah, apparently it is.
