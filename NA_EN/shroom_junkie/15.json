Not only does this relieve pressure off other lanes but it also makes their jungler get behind if they stay too long. To do this you need good vision so make sure your lanes always warded. \n\nWhen your ahead try to roam and get other lanes ahead or if a lanes overextended gank it and try to get a kill/summoner spell. \n\nTry to have a decent champion pool for top lane because usually top lane just fills in holes in the team comp. EX. Your team has a yi jungle, katarina mid, and janna/vayne bot you would probably want to pick someone with hard engage like malphite or wukong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-31T00:24:43.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane is alot of TP, roams and farm denial, learn to freeze lane and deny CS.

I've also learned the hard way to freeze lane and deny CS, especially when laning against a Nasus. Push lane and deny CS, doesn't work when he's farming under tower. Lol.\n\nThough, its weird, I'd assume top lane would be the least ganked as its isolated from dragon and it would be best to gank mid and bot and keep control on it, but every time I top lane I seem to be either ganked several times until I'm simply too weak to win lane any more, or literally just camped. This happens a lot with Nasus where the junglers just sit there so Nasus can farm stacks while you have to sit back, lose your CS advantage, and allow him to stack up so he eventually doesn't even need jungler help.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-31T03:10:23.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Against a Nasus you deny farm and when you can roam to impact map you roam, if you sit in lane and do nothing you will lose.
