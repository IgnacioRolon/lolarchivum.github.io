Not to say more crit chance is bad, because it makes the game less centered around chance, but that&#039;s exactly what crit is. Take for example a few games I had today. First game I was Yasuo, and got Brawler&#039;s Gloves after first back for 20% crit. I hit a crit almost every time I AA&#039;d or Q&#039;d with only a few exceptions. So that was a 1/5 chance to hit a crit every time and I hit it more than 2/3 of the time. Later, I played a game as Tryndamere. I was doing wolves early and had full fury by about the middle, but never hit a crit. Went into lane, didn&#039;t hit a crit until I got early ganked by Evelynn and died. Came back with Brawler&#039;s Gloves so I had 45% crit at full fury. Only hit a crit maybe 1/10 of the time, which would be good... if I didn&#039;t have my passive crit. But I did and even with enough crit to almost fairly hit a crit every two autos, I almost never hit it.\n\nMobas are based on skill and strategy.\nCrit is based on chance.\nCrit does not belong.\nRemove it.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2015-11-12T23:46:31.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Inb4 every adc gets ashe's passive and graves gets a 100% assurance of oneshotting your entire team with one auto, instead of an 80% chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2015-11-12T23:36:47.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because they never said they wanted to remove it","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-11-12T23:40:55.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Avantel,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=ywtvi6IO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-12T23:36:47.845+0000)\n>\n> Because they never said they wanted to remove it\n\nMeanwhile their ENTIRE playerbase besides Yasuo mains and Tryndamere mains(even then) and a very small portion of ADC mains all want crit removed.\nHuh\nI think they're trying to make us happy... or maybe not...","replies":[]}]}]}
