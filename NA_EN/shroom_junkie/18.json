The angle at which Teemo's head is facing as well as its position appear as though Teemo is straining his neck to lean forward...which isn't natural, giving him a sort of \"I'm totally high, dudes!\" look.\n\n- Second is his head is shaped like a football.  There's too much width and not enough height.  While it is true Teemo's head oval shaped and not round, this rendition goes over the mark just by a tiny amount.\n\n- Third is his mouth.  The mouth is much, much too wide.  It needs to be reigned in by a lot. \n\nTo give you an illustration at what the above three corrections look like, I present you with the following image:\n\nhttp://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg132/SenorCrouch/Other%20Game%20Pics/Teemo%20Splash%20Edit_zpspmwczul2.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"TroyTheUnconquer","date":"2016-04-07T16:51:34.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He looks stoned af","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chaos Ascent","date":"2016-04-07T09:34:42.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually love the touch ups to the background, the new background is absolutely gorgeous.
