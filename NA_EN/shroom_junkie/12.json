Especially if they're by Riven Lovejoy.\n\nZed is honestly not a dominant laner unless you are twisted fate or you misplayed the lane.  He has a safer laning phase compared to other assassins and is stronger in the laning phase compared to other assassins, but falls off late game and has a difficult time teamfighting.  A dominant laner would be heimer or cho, who are pretty much unbeatable in a 1 v 1 and are unkillable during laning phase.","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-08-17T15:08:30.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UltraSceptile,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jQx25n4m,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-17T04:14:31.305+0000)\n>\n> You don't main champs because they're broken OP.

The majority of players play a large variety of champs, and thus cannot beat someone who plays one champ solely and knows everything about every match up.  Back in season 4 EVERYONE said urgot was trash, not just like the 2 diamond 1 players who mained him.  \n\nLike let me say this.  You can kill someone by whipping a belt over them until they're bleeding like hell and die from massive bloodloss.  If you were to become a serial killer you could use this method to kill.  But if you were to just shoot them, things would be a lot easier, right?  Same with maining champs in ranked.  You can play anything to get to diamond 1, just as you can use anything to kill a person.  But, just like whipping someone until they die isn't the most efficient method of murdering, playing urgot isn't as viable as playing someone like kha back in season 4.  Urgot definitely needed buffs, whether someone managed to main them to diamond 1 doesn't mean they are viable in soloqueue, don't even mention LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"Shroom Junkie","date":"2015-08-18T03:54:47.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UltraSceptile,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jQx25n4m,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-08-17T17:20:58.764+0000)\n>\n> No, being a one trick pony is what makes climbing so easily, not that many people ARE one trick ponies in soloqueue until very high up.

If you're good enough to be that good at a champion, you shouldn't be thinking \"my champion is so underpowered...\" you should be thinking \"LOL this champ is so good\" even if it isn't, and its just your skill. If you're that clung to the idea that your champion is bad, I don't see why you play him. At least, in Ranked. Maybe if your champion suddenly gets gutted, and you go in and think \"Wow, wtf did they do to this guy?\" then make a post, sure, rant about how they gutted your champ, that's totally fine. But when you're champion hasn't been touched in weeks, and you make a post about it *now*, all I can do is think you're on tilt and raging.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2015-08-17T16:01:31.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiddle in a good place?\n\nLol he got dumpstered by the changes to Runeglaive, He is the only primary jungler champion who doesn't build the full jungle item.
