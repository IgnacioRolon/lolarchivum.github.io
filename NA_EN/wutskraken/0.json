But then some really OP items broke him so Riot piled on the nerfs before nerfing said OP items, and then never reverted the nerfs.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d be happy to get back his 2-second triggered W, even happier to get old W values back.

His kit is rather overloaded. And Thresh has been a consistent pick since release. \n\nI don't think they should be necessarily nerfed, that's not at all what I think. But some parts of the kits should be removed (particularly passives that require no skill) and the power they lost should be placed in the other abilities, not passives, that require skill to use.\nFor instance, I just don't think the passive on his E fits his kit. He's a support, not a damage dealer. No need to give bonus AD on his AAs imo. Take that away, and add strength to his shield (maybe shields two champions so it wouldn't be too oppressive in laning but adds some power to ganks and teamfights early on?).\n\nTake away Zed's 25% bonus AD, and add that ratio to his abilities. Or give him another ability that requires skill, that is equivalent in power. Since he has decreasing energy costs as he levels, why does he have a passive that restores energy? Doesn't that negate his early, high energy costs meant to decrease early power? Rework that whole ability imo, and give him some kind of power there that isn't passive. Although the energy passive does require skill, it can stay, but his energy costs should remain relatively the same.\n\nRemove Yasuo's double crit passive, and move it to his ult where the armor pen is (I don't like it at all due to it's passive, OP, power spike nature but it looks like it isn't going anywhere) and then make his Wind resource meaningful again by increasing power in his shield.\n\nSome champions have good passives, that are needed, but I don't see the point of them on champions with such powerful kits without them. Passives like those above have no counterplay, sometimes don't fit the kit, are hard to balance around, and give the players no chance to make a meaningful decision in regards to play. \n\nEdit:\nNote Annie's passive: her stun actually requires meaningful decision making to use to it's full potential. This is good. Opponents can counterplay by watching for it to proc. You don't have those things on double crit, 25% bonus AD, or % extra bonus damage on AA for a support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sîcarîus","date":"2015-10-23T16:42:37.171+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"They have destroyed Thresh lol. In pro play, when he is picked, his team generally loses. Thresh is honestly one of the more balanced champs atm. How so? Sure he has tons of utility, but he's not nearly as tanky as other supports(Braum, Alistar, Leona) and his damage is nowhere near that of other supports(Annie, Blitzcrank). The reason why Thresh is picked is because he is FUN to play. You can do crazy shit with him if you're good, but you look like a complete scrub if you're bad. This is a VERY appealing champion design to anybody who strives to be 'good' at the game. The last thing I want to see is another Blitzcrank nerfs because 'baddies can't dodge hook'. Blitzcrank and Thresh are the literal definition of 'high risk; high reward'. They could make Thresh have 0 damage on every ability, and people would still pick him because his design is beautiful. It's the same thing with Lee Sin. Even after Riot gutted Lee Sin, people still spammed him. Why?

People who don't know of it will fall for it once, then remember to not be near him upon death.  So far the best use for his passive I have found is emergency destruction.  If I get killed under a turret, I'll just focus the turret rather than waste an attempt to get another kill.  At least then I'll have brought it down a little more if I did not destroy it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ULTRAF0RCE","date":"2015-10-23T20:35:29.117+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion isn't a juggernaut though he is a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Janna Me Fiddle","date":"2015-10-23T20:37:25.116+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ULTRAF0RCE,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=RGn7L3Eo,comment-id=00050005,timestamp=2015-10-23T20:35:29.117+0000)\n>\n> Sion isn't a juggernaut though he is a tank.\n\nWhich makes zero sense both thematically and play style wise.\n\nHis entire backstory screams Juggernaut, his Kit screams Juggernaut.
