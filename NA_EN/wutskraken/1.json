There is a middle ground between ekko and urgot. Gangplank is like ahri, her banrate is tiny, not a common LCS pick and isnt zed tier, but she certainly is strong in most peoples hands. \n\nYour thread made the emplication that winning with GP is supposed to be surprising or that people would look at you funny for picking him or something.

You simply interpreted that way thinking on it way too hard, and perhaps you and I view what counts as meta as different. Personally I do not consider Ahri a meta pick, I consider her and GP to be those off-meta Tier 2 picks that do well against meta champions\n\nThat or you're just here to look for a fight on a M&G thread that was meant to be silly and not serious :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Captain Crow","date":"2016-06-08T04:35:18.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/Ks35oeV.gif?noredirect\n\nTh' way it be supposed to sail, mate.\n\n_An' upvote for ye._\nhttps://img.pandawhale.com/post-34554-dwarven-forged-upvote-gif-dwar-H1Et.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImmortalBloodCY","date":"2016-06-07T06:36:07.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went Karthus Top.\n\nSuffice to say every time they dived me they died but i also died.\n\nAnd these epic ultimate steals xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brimaz The King","date":"2016-06-07T01:00:39.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got my first S with gp on my last game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-06-08T04:45:28.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:41}} is meta though..
