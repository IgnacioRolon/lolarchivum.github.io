Finally, if your shield gets popped by the enemy, you lose your %HP damage which is the only damage that scales well enough to be relevant at that point in the game.\n\nWhat ends up happening in the case you don't have an ally to initiate for *you* to initiate is that you become a peeler. Any ally that stands in your Q might as well be ulted by a {{champion:10}}. It's really odd that someone as bloodthirsty as {{champion:14}}  is best used protecting his teammates instead of murdering the enemy team, but that's about the only option you have vs opponents that are crafty enough to avoid your CC.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AHeroNamedHawke","date":"2015-03-09T14:24:35.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're going to play Sion I'd duo with an ADC main that isn't shit\n\nHe's one of those top laners that can't do shit in a teamfight alone but is great for peeling","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePlasticSpork","date":"2015-03-09T13:46:25.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion is a tank.

However, this is not a tactic you want to use against kiting teams or wombo combo teams.\n\nSince your strategy is to brawl, any team that can disengage and kite you to death will win.  Your strength is to get on top of the enemy and slaughter them.  You can't do that to a hyper mobile team.\n\nWombo combo teams are likewise very deadly, because you want to group up and jump on the enemy.  That's precisely what a wombo combo team wants you to do: group so they can chain five nasty AOE ultimates in your face, ace your team, and take a Nexus turret or Baron.","replies":[]},{"poster":"101100111000","date":"2015-03-09T11:20:38.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build Ravenous Hydra as your one damage item, then be as tanky as you want.

Or, well, he is best used as a tank. As a full tank he is a **bit** less opressive in lane, but much better later on.
