I am not comfortable as an ADC, the role that carries the most weight in the late-game teamfights yet can die in a heartbeat, especially since the enemy could easily pick a dive comp. They did indeed pick a dive comp to annihilate me and our Lux and a pokey/sustain lane bot to zone away me and Blitzcrank to ensure the enemy Jinx got a CS advantage\n\nGuess who received all the blame when Malphite ulted the entire team and Talon dove me straight away? Guess who received the blame when our CC&#039;less top laner couldn&#039;t stop a teleporting Malphite while he himself never teleported to dragon fights, guess who received the blame for being zoned by the enemy because our own jungler was invaded by Shyvana with 0 help from top and mid lane? Guess who received the blame when our Lux just barely missed her critical light binding that would&#039;ve saved both our lives?\n\nGuess who was told to uninstall/commit suicide/never play ranked again/deserved to be bronzeV by their own team\n\nMe\n\nYes, you should have a GENERAL idea of how to play each role in ranked, but everyone has preferences and if you place a jungle main against an occasional jungler, or an ADC main vs a occasional ADC, then you&#039;re gonna run into problems","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-19T05:18:19.051+0000","up_votes":69,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not justifying them blaming you, but we'll always have to deal with our worst role. \n\nThough to anyone who starts mocking someone for playing bad in a role they are bad in: THANK YOU CAPTAIN OBVIOUS!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Zwill","date":"2015-10-19T21:17:12.919+0000","up_votes":74,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hijacking the top comment here:\n\nIt was pointed out earlier in this conversation, but Lyte detailed some of how Ranked Teambuilder will work in an Ask.fm post awhile back. My personal opinion is that this will go a long way towards alleviating some of the pain you, and other players, are currently encountering in ranked pre-game (and the resultant game). \n\n[Here's a link to the reddit thread discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3lznk4/riot_lyte_explains_how_ranked_teambuilder_will/), and I'll also copy-pastarino the relevant parts below:\n\n>Our main design philosophy of the new Champ Select was to retain as much of the player behavior benefits as possible, while drastically reducing queue times. We also wanted to retain the strategic elements of drafting. This philosophy led to us to getting rid of the \"Captain's Mode\" where you can accept or decline potential teammates, getting rid of mirror matches, and no longer asking players to choose a Champ prior to Champ Select.\nThe new Champ Select flow is now:\n1. Players can invite friends into a Lobby.\n2. Each player is required to select at least 2 Positions (such as Top/Mid, or Mid/Jungle). On average, Ranked players only play 2.2 positions, so we wanted to start simple with a Pick-2 design, but have some backups like rank-sorting all 5 positions if there are queue time issues. We also have designs to incentivize mastering all positions in the future.\n3. There's a new position called \"Fill.\"\n4. We're currently asking Duo Queues to cover at least 3 unique positions, to further improve queue times. Duo Queues will still have a higher chance of getting the exact 2 positions they want, but it is not 100% guaranteed.\n5. Once you've chosen your positions, we match you into a full team and you enter Champion Select.\n6. We've made some changes to how drafting works; however, we'll be talking more about this in a future design blog.\n7. During Champ Select, you can still negotiate with your teammates to lane swap or trade champs if you want a more favorable match-up just like Champ Select today.\n8. Once drafting is done, your team enters the game.\n\n\nI hope this answer helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-19T22:14:19.018+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"There is a new position called 'fill'\"\n\nBest.

There's simply no way for me to know if I am up to par in other roles without playing them *in* Ranked, which is more likely to get me back to Silver before I can be good enough with them. It's just not worth taking another role. I practice in Normals, but it's sometimes like beating up little kids and it's not going to go that way in Ranked.","replies":[]}]}
