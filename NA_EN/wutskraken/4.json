THEN think about flat.\n\nA little too excited there buddy. \n1 armor is 1% more of your health pool as effective health vs physical damage. Thus if you have 4000 health and 200 armor you have 12,000 effective health vs physical damage. Lord dominiks, assuming you have base 50 armor and have 2000 more hp than the enemy makes it so that the enemy see you have around 130 armor, so you'd be down from 12,000 effective health to around 9,333 (note I'm not bothering to pull out a calculator for this). And 15% more damage furthermore means that you can divide that by 1.15 which means you drop to around 8,000 hp, meaning lord dominiks in this case effectively drops you to 2/3rds of your effective hp. Just the % pen drops you by 3/4 or so.  Theoretically, if you had such a huge amount of armor that your base armor was insignificant in comparison, then it would approach dropping you by 45%.\n\nAs for flat pen, it's much better vs squishies, true. Because as armor approaches a huge number flat pen becomes insignificant. However as one's armor approaches the amount of flat pen the enemy has, then flat pen becomes much more significant.\n\nIt takes too many items, runes, and masteries to itemize flat pen, hence adcs tend to avoid it as it's not easy to obtain.","replies":[{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2016-04-13T23:13:21.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the evening coffee.\n\nAaaaand everything you just said agrees with what I said... so there.","replies":[{"poster":"Pierce The Veal","date":"2016-04-14T01:21:31.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GetMariahCarried,realm=NA,application-id=Ir7ZrJjF,discussion-id=RkIlLt5t,comment-id=0002000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-13T23:13:21.180+0000)\n>\n> It's the evening coffee.\n> \n> Aaaaand everything you just said agrees with what I said... so there.\n\nIt's the caffeine I had as well.
