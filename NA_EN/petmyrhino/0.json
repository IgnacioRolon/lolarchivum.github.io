I would like to have a chat!","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mby i should be posting this in boards Feedback but i see you the most in here. \r\nMr.Broporo, i was just browsing the boards trying to wake up before enjoying some league and i see you everywhere! just wanted to say you are doing a fantastic job my friend!\r\nOn another note i have a question/feedback. I think there needs to be something done to hextech crafting. What i mean by this is champion shards. See i have every champion in the game and all the blue essence i could ever need. So basically the crazy amount of champion shards i have are just sitting there. I was thinking there should be a way we take say 3-5 champion shards and convert it into a small amount of orange essence or something like that! Or if we have multiple of the same champ (3) and we could convert it into say a Skin shard for that champion. i dunno just some thoughts. It is slightly frustrating when i go to open some chests to test my luck on getting some of the hextech skins and i get champion shards. Still no luck on any hextech skin either. \r\nAlso some things i think about with IP. Like i said i have all the champions in the game so ALL my ip was going to rune pages and runes till i had them all. But with the runes and masteries going away i have nothing to really spend my tuns of ip on. Are you guys ever going to make chromas available for IP purchase again? And maybe some Icons available for a some IP. Or even maybe able to gift a friend a champ with IP say once a month. I understand the whole gifting with IP is a no go because people would just gift everything to their friends or smurfs, hence RP sales going down. Just my thoughts.\r\nIf anyone took their time to read all this thank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-02T20:11:53.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heeeeey thanks for the shoutout PetmyRhino! You didn't know, but you posted this on my birthday nonetheless xD!!!!\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} \n\nThat's awesome that you own all the champions already, but it does make some of those shards and blue essence a little less useful I suppose. On the bright side, you can still use those champ shards to get mastery level 6-7 after getting their mastery tokens! Still your idea is kinda cool, so I'd suggest posting this over in Client Discussion!\n\nAbout those IP ideas, chromas do periodically have some IP sales so make sure to check up on the news page every now and then. Certain icons can be bought with IP sometimes too, for instance the Rift Rivals icons are up for 1 IP right now!","replies":[{"poster":"PetMyRhino","date":"2017-07-02T21:06:16.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh hey happy birthday! hope you have a fantastic day! dont work to hard!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PetMyNashorn","date":"2017-07-02T19:20:15.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some good points have been made here!","replies":[]}]}
