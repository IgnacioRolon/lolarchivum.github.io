Thanks for all the questions!**\n\nHELLO, EVERYONE\nNarrative team & others are here to answer your questions about Azir and his place in Shurima. Like, \"How does he keep his feathers so well-groomed?\" and, \"How does a bird like him survive in the desert?\" (You'll have better questions. I promise.)\n\nWe'll be answering questions until the end of the day.\n\nHere are some other things you ~~might want to~~ **should** check out:\n[Azir Reveal](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/champion-reveal/azir-emperor-of-the-sands)\n[Shurima: What Lies Beneath the Sands?](http://promo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/index.html)\n\n[Azir Art & Sound Q&A](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/9f9inmau-azir-qa-art-sound)\n[Azir Gameplay Q&A](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/sixv1VVL-azir-qa-gameplay)","replies":[{"poster":"Renekton Bot","date":"2014-09-10T21:56:24.721+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look I know most of this stuff already, but I missed out on everything after \"I get locked in a tomb with a living night light.\" \n\n1) They said Azir was dusted after the ritual went wrong. How is it that we have to suffer his obnoxious, overbearing presence again? I mean, I knew a guy who had the same thing happen to him (minus the betrayal). Only thing he ascended into was a cloud of atomic particles.\n\n2) Why's everyone making such a big deal about this, anyway? I'm already part of the league. Coolness factor as maximum capacity. Tell him to leave.\n\n3) Apparently Shurima fell while I was gone. What the fuck, Nasus? \n\n4) Did anyone feed my goldfish? Or did he ascend as well, since everyone's fucking ascending now?\n\n5) How long did Nasus feign sorrow over what he had to do? Did he immediately go into my room and touch my stuff? What did he take? Tell him I want it back and I'm going to kill him.\n\nThanks for your time, but thank me for mine most of all.","replies":[{"poster":"Ronoh","date":"2014-09-10T22:59:28.657+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ren bot with the hard hitting questions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vakabiel","date":"2014-09-10T18:22:16.322+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":3,"body":"Would you say Azir was the kind of ruler that people** flocked** to?","replies":[{"poster":"Opeli","date":"2014-09-10T18:38:44.111+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":4,"body":"HEH","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Beryll","date":"2014-09-10T19:49:57.360+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So this may clash with gameplay but:\nHow does it work out that a great emperor, who doesn't even bother attacking himself, dashes to one of his lowly soldiers?
