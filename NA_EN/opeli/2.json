Digging Xerath’s betrayal of Azir? The rivalry between Garen and Darius? Graves and Twisted Fate’s ongoing tension? Talk about it here! \n\n* Fanfiction, fanart, champion concepts, and other lovely things like that should NOT be posted here. This board is for discussion on League of Legends’ canon story.\n\n* Upvote/downvote on content! Votes are your friends! Downvotes should be used for comments and discussions that aren't relevant or don’t add to the discussion - they shouldn't be used to express disagreement with another player.\n\n* Use those filters!

She's still a seductress and a little less liked than Kat.

For example, Nasus used to be a space librarian.

I'm glad to see lore getting polished up. (I do get a little concerned when I see some of those gems being ground up with all the junk.

I think the old lore is pretty damn charming. There's something so... familiar and cozy about it.\n\nThis comment made me so happy. Like I said, a lot of clean-up needs to be done, but I think LoL works in part because it's a little cartoony, a little insane, a little strange, a little fourth-wall-breaky. (To be honest, this is part of why I like the Summoners concept: I enjoy the self-acknowledged silliness of, e.g., translating connection problems into \"chrono-distortion on the Fields of Justice\".) It would make me sad to see Riot steamroll its distinctive, quirky, \"garage startup\" lore entirely into glossy cardboard. There are *so many* dark-and-gritty serious-business fantasy settings out there, and I think LoL stands out in part due to the splash of satire. It's almost like it's The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny in video game form, a sort of \"Mega Man versus Legolas\" daydream brought to life. You could say it's a post-modern reflection upon fantasy as a whole.\n\nThere's some profundity in there, too. Although the proportions are markedly different, I'm somehow reminded of Terry Pratchett's Discworld, where some pretty heavy meaning and character depth sometimes bursts out of a very silly context to sock you a dose of unexpected enlightenment.\n\nIf I were to abstractly describe the sort of lore team I want to see working on this, it would go something like this: \"Serious enough to feel compelled to replace weak stories with strong stories, but playful enough to appreciate LoL's charm and not make it just another fantasy setting.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stars Shaper","date":"2014-09-25T17:10:44.860+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is driving ppl mad is that the \"new lore\" has been presented as a flat and shallow preview of the champions and their backgrounds.

Perhaps a lore-based explanation can be put in? Perhaps it could be something akin to, say, this: [http://soraka.blogspot.ca/2014/09/tales-of-valoran-44.html](http://soraka.blogspot.ca/2014/09/tales-of-valoran-44.html)\n\nTo clarify, perhaps something happened AT the Institute of War, perhaps something catastrophic, to make all these summoners realize that they never actually had any power/control over what happened in SR or Howling Abyss or whatever. They were glorified spectators, making things up for themselves to fuel their own egos and delusions. Perhaps some strange magical artifact they brought in made them insane over time, planting the falsehood of their powers in their heads? And that, very recently somebody (*cough* NEW THIEF CHAMP *cough*) stole said artifact and broke that whole illusion? This would leave us with a big dilapidated building (because summoners were too busy hallucinating that it wasn't already a dump) full of psycho mages-to-be that had just been staring into crystal balls to watch champions kill each other over and over, with no relation whatsoever to what actually is happening. After the realization of this shocking truth finally sets in, the Institute of War decides to become an entertainment organization, hocking \"What if?\" matchups of the world's real heroes and villains against each other in relatively even matchups.\n\nAnd, renaming themselves after the riot that initially broke out when they all realized they were deceived by that strange artifact, they rename themselves Riot Games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"World Eaters","date":"2014-09-24T07:15:50.764+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So now that the shurima event is over is there just a short delay on the lore being update in game? cause now I have an idea about{{champion:268}} {{champion:101}}  {{champion:58}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:69}} but they arn't the only characters involved and all of their lore is still only 2-3 sentences and honestly I look to lore to get about 30% of my how to play the champ feel cause that is something I love about league is I always feel like I am playing better when I am playing the character right thematically.\n\nFor example when I play WW I think of a man who has lost his mind to the beast and hunts down his pray and seeing them weak only makes him hungrier and then I just run around and nomnomnom and he hunts on the fields of justice because thats where he can hunt without repercussions\n\nnow I keep hearing that the lore is getting a complete overhaul and I am kinda sitting on the fence going OOOOooo where is this leading but at the same time I love the idea that the IOT was made to stop wars that wiped the land clean and it makes sense as to why all these amazing characters are running around fighting.\n\nI am just scared that all the characters are just going to suddenly not have a reason to fight and the only reason they are fighting is because I am a summoner and they just have to obey me.
