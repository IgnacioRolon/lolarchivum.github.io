You can very easily be kicked out of a restaurant, bar, or any other business for insulting and verbally harassing others, be it employees or other customers, In fact, you can even be fired doing this, all just for \"speaking your mind.\" Also, continually doing this even after numerous warnings can result in you not being allowed in that place of business again. That's pretty much what's happening here. You were given multiple warnings that your behavior was not acceptable, yet you continued with it anyway. The reason for your permanent ban wasn't because you were calling others terrible, pathetic, bad, useless, etc., it was because you continually did so even after multiple warnings saying that unacceptable to do this. You essentially showed Riot that you had no intention of changing your behavior, so Riot permanently banned the account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2017-01-29T22:53:07.702+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"vampirekid13","date":"2017-02-01T12:22:16.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sammy Veigar,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yFjZlGkf,comment-id=000d0001,timestamp=2017-01-29T22:27:39.704+0000)\n>\n> Luckily in the real world the Police don&#x27;t go around killing people who break the laws that they don&#x27;t even know about.\n\nyes they do. thats actually  a pretty big issue in the US.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirPacifista","date":"2017-02-01T12:17:52.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After\n>2x 10-game chat restrictions\n2x 25-game chat restrictions\n2x 14-day bans\n1x manual time ban based upon manual account review\n\nI it is not really debatable if this course of action was right or not, it was.\nI never received a restriction since Season 2 (because i started there).\nSo i would say you could have taken the warning, like an adult or get banned, easily.\n\nAlso, you realise i now could ALSO, call you many things, insulting things which insults you as a person and your intellect as a whole, since you made such a ... good comment, because you thought that 2 games got you banned, even through you got FAR FAR more chances than you deserved.\nBut im not insulting you directly, because there is a summoners code aka rules for not beeing a dick.\n\nNext time (This game or another) try to read beforehand what is allowed and what not.\nOf course you can Scream whatever you like, but if they forbid it you will get punished accordingly, if you can't understand that... well then thats just sad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Caso ÃŸandito","date":"2017-01-28T23:58:18.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi riot tantram can you please go to my post about being banned I am so confused and I would really appreciate you looking at it because it is not fair what is being done to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"vampirekid13","date":"2017-02-01T12:20:59.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=yFjZlGkf,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2017-01-28T01:32:45.876+0000)\n>\n> If anything, I&#x27;d say the system didn&#x27;t catch you fast enough.\n\ngod damn thats the most subtle kick in the balls ive ever read on these forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"stronger","date":"2017-01-30T02:02:33.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello riot tantrum, \n I've recently been wrongfully banned from the league community for false accusations of scripting.
