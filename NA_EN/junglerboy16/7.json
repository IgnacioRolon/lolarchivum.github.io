There aren't any numbers up on that was of yet, but I am still eagerly anticipating these changes.\n\nWhat are your opinions on this? Will this bring tanks in line? will it be too little to really change anything? Are there bigger fundamental issues that need to be addressed?\n\n**EDIT:** something I didn't notice that is actually a big deal, Cinderhulk's AoE burn only activates *in combat*, so you won't randomly aggro baron or dragon when warding, or other annoying situations where you don't want to proc the damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Yandere Carry","date":"2015-02-28T00:56:30.549+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":23,"body":"if this does NOT stack with sunfire cape it will be fucking useless.","replies":[{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2015-02-28T00:59:28.214+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'll deal more damage than Sunfire Cape when you've been in combat a bit.\n\nDepending on how long that lasts, it'll make clearing much better than Sunfire.

The thing I like about it is that you no longer have to go for Sunfire, you can just opt straight into Randuins after finishing your jungle item (the immolate effect is weaker at first but ramps up sort of aggressively to be stronger in the middle of a fight), not to mention the return of the 25% bonus health (hello Sion). Not going for Sunfire also frees up a slot for stuff like Righteous Glory (one of my favorite items that I never get to buy). I also like how you can go for Bami's Cinder without finishing Sunfire (if you're playing a non-jungler tank or an off-tank jungler), so you can get some of the Sunfire effect without having to invest in the full item.\n\nRegarding the other changes:\n\n* I agree Cho's retexture looks great.\n* I'm glad they're actually buffing specific junglers too since the Cinderhulk effects don't really help with the first clear\n * I thought Xin was actually okay already, but I guess buffs are okay?\n * I'm glad about the Nidalee changes; nerfs her jungle clear (traps and pounce resets were a huge portion of her clear) which was still pretty fast, without really affecting lane Nidalee (which is where I primarily play Nidalee)\n * Gragas buffs are nice, I think he has larger problems but they're nice\n * Unsure about Skarner buffs; I agree it's good for him but I've seen some people comment that it's not really what he needs either\n * Also unsure about Zac buffs; I guess it's good his ganks will be better? I don't play him either, lol\n * Vi nerfs are kind of sad since I just picked her up, but I understand that they're sort of necessary\n * Volibear buffs are kind of cool, I think he's kind of a strange champion but he does a surprising amount of damage already with his W, nice that he can use that more to clear\n* Azir buffs are good I suppose; I still think his kit has absurd potential but no one can play him maximally so it doesn't really matter I guess?\n* Lissandra nerfs are good\n* Tristana buffs are pretty cool, nice that they're emphasizing the windowed aspect of her power instead of just giving her straight buffs\n* Urgot changes are nice I guess, don't play him much either","replies":[{"poster":"Messaiga","date":"2015-02-28T04:15:22.315+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"About Vi, she totally needed nerfs.

The buffs aren't exactly what he needs (the Q change is kind of a simplification of his damage since 58 is an awkward number).  I'd gladly exchange that damage increase on his E for something else like:\nFracture applies 2 stacks of Crystal Venom (instead of one).  \n\nThis basically means if he lands his E and uses his Q he can proc his passive immediately (making it easy to get the bonus damage on Ulti or the stun in early ganks).","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2015-02-28T04:45:18.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> re: Vi -snip-\n\nOh, I understand she's one of the overbearing picks right now, just selfishly she's one of my favorite champions so it's sad to see her nerfed (especially since I really liked that she had such high base MS) :3.

My guess is that if nothing changed we'd see all this stuff go to live in around 2 weeks.\n\nAnd also I share that opinion on Vi somewhat, I remember a little over a year ago (when I was a mere newbie) that she was one of my favorite champs.
