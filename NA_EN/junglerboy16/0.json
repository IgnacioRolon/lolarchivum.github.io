As the second nexus tower fell my ping spiked and with one hit on the nexus I got the dreaded \"attempting to reconnect\" message, before the game crashed and sent me back to the log in screen. I am now stuck there and can't log back in. My internet connection is just fine, but it says there is an unknown error when authenticating my account. Anyone else have similar issues lately?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-29T22:48:45.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like a change or interruption with your network is failing to specifically reach the game server or even the client.
