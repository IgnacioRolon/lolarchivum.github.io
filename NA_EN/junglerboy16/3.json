Right now, he is *totally* immobile, which makes absolutely no sense because a winged gargoyle of all creatures should have at least a little mobility. Gailo&#039;s only hope for initiating a team fight right now is to flash into the enemy team, which is a risky and usually sub-optimal.\n\nMy suggestion is simple: his E is now a dash (hooray for no more flash engage) that functionally works exactly the same as the current skillshot, just with a reduced range of 900 from 1180 to make up for the improved mobility. Additionally, increasing the cooldown to 14/13/12/11/10 from 12/11/10/9/8 (or possibly higher) would help keep him from becoming *too* mobile. This ability then becomes an excellent engage tool that allows Galio to both dive in for clutch ults, and also speed up allies that are following him into the fray. This would be a slight nerf to full AP Galio since E *is* one of his two major wave clear options, but on Bruiser Galio (his intended role), it gives him options to make plays, and a tanky Galio would not risk as much from using a dash for a bit of wave clear.\n\nWhat do you say Riot? Can we give Galio this one last change to bring him up to snuff?\n\n**EDIT:** So a lot of people are commenting that this change would make Galio really OP, and I have to agree. *But*—and this is a big but—that is only because right now his kit is overloaded with false power that he can't really use effectively. He suffers from the exact same issues Maokai had before his rework last season; he has excessive damage and surprising power in a successful situation, but he like Maokai is far too unreliable in *any* meta to actually utilize that excessive power. When they reworked Maokai (who had been my main for almost 8 months), they nerfed his damage across the board *but he was still far stronger than before the changes*. Galio needs the same type of changes to bring him up to date, and if part of that means axing some extra false power, then so be it.","replies":[{"poster":"Apollocliptic","date":"2015-06-17T13:53:50.868+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"It'd be easier to just remove the cast time on E.

Gallios Problem really isn't a lack of impact on a good ult, but rather the lack of impact without ult.\nAditionally, his earlygame is to mana dependend and his melee AAs seem disconected from his kit. The only reason for him to get in melee range and use AAs is 'because i can', unlike every other melee in the game he doesn't have a single part of his kit linked to AAs, which feels a bit od. You can land Q for slow, E for speedbuff and catch up to melee distance, just to discover that you don't get rewarded at all for doing so, unless you want to ult(which could also be done from ~400-500 units away vs a single target).\n\nRight now, his tank part is slightly underwhelming while his mage part drops a bit to hard later on due bad ap-ratios.\nI think changeing the passive into a magic on-hit that scales with MR and increasing his ap ratios in return would help tanky gallio to make use of his stickiness, while higher ap ratios would allow mage Gallio to scale better into the late, which then leaves it to the player on how to blend those two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killadillo","date":"2015-07-19T00:33:37.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you miss out on the opportunity to make a flying champion more reliant on his wings, considering he is made of stone i think mobility should stay the same, but maybe give him his mobility through spells.

Don't change Galio, just give his Kit some nicer synergy. As a defensive/counter engage type he is awesome, and I don't want to lose what he is for something else. Removing the cast time (or allow movement while casting) on E, and he can then throw it into his combo, right now it's so clunky. It's not giving him a dash, just making his small mobility skill more reliable. I also suggested increasing the missle speed of Q if travelling along the E path. This would be a flat buff though to a champ almost perfectly balanced. I'd suggest a trade off, but not a big one, Trading a little off the base damage of Q and E, so that he lands them a little more consistently with much greater fluency, but with a little less damage, as this buff would mostly promote spell spamming and with his mana if he doesn't succeed in the combo he is in a weaker spot. It also telegraphs his kit a bit because people would constantly be trying to E Q or E R.","replies":[]},{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-06-18T14:41:21.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well you had no problem doing that to AP maokai, which was a legitimate build until the balance team cut about ~300 damage from his kit.

I understand that doing this would require nerfing some of Galio's more magey aspects, but at the moment, he feels so unreliable (and rather clunky) that that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The whole point of his passive is that he can build as a tank and still deal damage, or that he can build magey and get a little tanky without hurting his damage.

It's also on the worst possible place to buff Galio— his ultimate is arguably the most powerful part of his kit, and it's already extremely rewarding to land it properly.\n\nIt's a somewhat good thing for Galio that AP mages are currently somewhat mediocre compared to other roles (primarily assassins, AD especially) as things currently stand (due to the mana regen changes), or this buff might have made him too strong. He's fine, just underplayed (he's one of my most-played champions at this point; he's my go-to champion for countering Fizz, LeBlanc, Singed, Teemo, Malzahar, etc.).\n\nIf there's one place in Galio's kit that might be appropriate for buffing, it's his W. It could be changed to allow shielding of minions (possibly without the healing portion of the skill; Galio could abuse that for ridiculous laning sustain), shielding himself+the target (this would allow Galio more freedom in choosing who to shield; currently, he has to choose between buffing his damage *and* defensive stats by shielding himself or just giving an ally some resistances), and/or healing the target in addition to Galio.\n\nA dash on Galio's E is really risky in terms of balance; he's already really good with just speed boosting/slowing on his Q and E. They're enough to set up a good ultimate if you use them properly. Even if you only get to ult the enemy's frontline, you're opening up the rest of the enemy team to your allies while the enemy frontliners are taunted, and though it's bad to force a champion to rely on Flash, Galio is currently balanced around burning Flash to perform the best possible ults. Imagine putting a dash on Annie— does she really need more mobility for deploying her ult+stun?","replies":[]},{"poster":"thinking man","date":"2015-06-17T16:08:33.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"make it similar to an Aatrox Q where you can interrupt it mid-air easily and it'll be okay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zedex","date":"2015-06-18T16:21:22.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a suggestion for Galio's ultimate. \n\n\nThink of Aatrox's Q, and how he leaps up to crash down at a location to disrupt the enemy. Galio should do something similar to this, as in, when he activates his ultimate he should leap up and crash down in a targeted area, taunting all nearby enemies when he does so. \n\nWould that break Galio? Maybe lower the area of effect on the ultimate to balance it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowvyr","date":"2015-06-18T07:39:14.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see him jump up in the air with his ult, land stunning enemies for maybe .25 seconds, then taunt them like normal. Give it a little bit of range so the he flies up to a target location and slams down.

His lore says he's more of a guardian or protector, which would translate into more of a defensive tank, like being based more on peeling or disengage rather than initiation.\n\nNot to mention any sort of gapcloser on Galio would make him gamebreakingly overpowered. Flash-Idol of Durand is already one of the best initiation tools in the entire game, and the ability to do that without Flash would make him completely broken if he didn't get any hard nerfs to the rest of his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"AutoreactiveCD4","date":"2015-06-17T17:01:06.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe Galio's prime was when double ap comps were popular and he was used as an anti-dive champ.
