Also, just wondering, but how often do you play Swain? Right now, if they simply removed the ramping mana cost and made the cool down shorter (it is already really small with CDR), then he would be able to leave it on almost indefinitely, and considering the amount of damage and sustain it gives, I don't think that would be good for him. Right now, having the ramping cost and a cool down on the toggle gives Swain meaningful times of weakness, like \"Oh, he just turned off his ult, I have 6 seconds to retaliate before he sustains it all up\" and \"swain wasn't watching his mana, so I can take advantage of him being OOM\".","replies":[{"poster":"HandheldBrandon","date":"2015-02-02T15:05:05.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":13,"body":"I played Swain non stop for almost 2 years since his release.\n\nHonestly what you are asking isn't really a QOL its just an indicator to let you know how much the ult is costing. Riot does stuff like this alot.\n\nA QOL would be more like bringing his mana costs in line with other champions that are similar or making it so his ult doesn't have that 0.3 second delay when first hitting the button (Which it does i tested it numerous times at 20-30 latency).\n\nIf they honestly wanted to do anything with Swain they would need to fix his problems. \n\nHe is a dot mage like Malzahar and Cassiopiea but falls short in DPS compared to both of them in exchange for tankiness and sustainability however his sutainability costs are so high that it ends up hurting him in the long requiring him to completely Itemize around his ultimate for him to be successful.

We were also unhappy with how Yasuo was using Last Breath to engage in fights by teleporting from thousands (and thousands) of miles away.\"\n\nAfter the changes were made that made Yasuo feel smoother and play more correctly tuned they went and nerfed him because fixing him and making him overall smoother to play and function he was still considered too good so they then nerfed him.\n\nBy directly fixing his flaws and strange gameplay behavior they indirectly buffed him which then they went and nerfed him.\n\nIt was a buff albeit in a different manner than simple numbers changes.\n\nAlso in \n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-417-notes\n\nThey deliberatly called a rammus change a Qualit of life buff which changed how his Powerball and Defensive ball overlapped.

It makes Swain interesting because you have to think about when to transform back and forth carefully. Having that ramping cost increases his threat, skillcap, and counterplay. To me, he is an example of a remarkably well balanced champion. He has weaknesses and strengths that are VERY well defined, and his win rate is reasonable.

A good Swain player is terrifying; a bad one is hilarious.\n\nCould they lower the mana cost on ult a little overall to bring his costs in line with other champs?  Absolutely yes.
