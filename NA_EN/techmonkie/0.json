There's so much distortion and reverb that it's incredibly hard to hear what she's saying at all.  I like the idea of adding an 'electronic' edge to her voice for this skin, but you guys have to seriously tone back on the distortion/reverb, or it's just gonna sound like a really big echo'y mess.  I've included a YouTube link to the new voiceover so you can listen to it and draw your own conclusions.\r\n\r\nYou guys have a *really* good product here, and my wife and I will be insta-buying it as soon as it drops, but please, consider doing something with the voiceover.\r\n\r\nThe only other minor pet peeve I have is not being able to select which song I want to listen to when she's on my team, but that's relatively minor considering how overbearing the VO issue is.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTech","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Galetta","date":"2015-02-03T21:29:22.156+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":13,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nI just wanted to jump in and comment on this.

The fact that you can hear the heavily chopped up VO without the music does seem kind of wonky and I question the judgment in that.

I love the particles, the icons, and the music, but the way the VO is being handled leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Riot, you've set [your own rules](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752874-Guide-to-Skin-Price-Tiers) as to what you have to deliver to justify a skin costing around $25 when not on sale: so, deliver.\n\nRiot has clearly listed the criteria for an ultimate skin, including \"new voice over and sounds.\" Okay, we've got the new sounds. Plenty of them. Over 3 hours. Now where's the new voice over? If the idea is that overcompensating in one area is supposed to cover for a lack of development in the other then I don't agree.\n\nAnd I don't agree that the remixing and filtering of an old voice over into electronic gibberish to disguise the fact that it's recycled constitutes a new voice over. In my opinion, it seems lazy and cheap, like they didn't want to hire a voice actor or singer. It feels to me like it wasn't a stylistic decision but a sneaky one to disguise a shortcut taken.\n\nAnd I don't understand why you're okay with it, or why you're saying it's because the skin is all about the music. The human voice is music. It's the original instrument. It doesn't need to be rendered unintelligible to be musical. A similar effect can be achieved with real, honest to goodness, understandable words from a brand spanking new VO put through the same process. And everyone can be happy and everything can be square. But I don't see that happening. And that makes me a little sad.\n\nEDIT: Apparently some [new lines were recorded.](https://twitter.com/ErinFitzgerald/status/562689192153853954) This only bothers me more. They had the voice actress in the studio and recorded new lines, but you can hardly tell because of the processing and remixing with the old lines. They had the opportunity to do a proper, full, new VO but went this route instead. Disappointing.

We intended for her VO to not be understandable. This VO change was made in order for the VO to not distract or interfere with her music. She has an obvious Daft punk/EDM feel and we wanted the VO to harmonize with that.  \n> \n> The VO is also supposed to be heard with her music. I would hold off on final judgement until you get the whole experience. :D\n\nTo be honest, I'm not really sure how I feel about this.  I can understand focusing on the music, but I feel like it would still be nice to have a slightly more understandable VO.\n\nThat being said, I'll wait for more previews before making a final decision.  I like pretty much everything but the VO at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HowPlayGAEM","date":"2015-02-04T00:34:57.304+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"So, basically, its a skin that can't be enjoyed if you have the music turned off :/\n\nConversely, its a skin that can only be enjoyed by drowning out the rest of the sounds in the game :/\n\nSince this is an ultimate skin, that means Sona won't be getting another skin for 2+ years...\n\nCan you guys update Arcade Sona please?  She doesn't have a recall animation and you muted her sounds.\n\n\nEDIT:  You know, most of the complement comes from the synthesizer; was it really necessary to make her speak gibberish?

This is an ultimate skin and seems pointless that you cannot even understand her VO lines. We get all these new champions that have VO lines for items or VO lines with different champions in the game and yet we have to shell out $20 for a skin and cannot even understand her VO lines. Riot Galatta said it sounds better with the music but I disagree, I enjoy listening to my champions voice and hearing what they have to say, I do not want to spend $20 on a skin just to turn off one complete feature of the skin because it sounds terrible (even when paired with the music).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Celeste Benal","date":"2015-02-03T21:29:54.010+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.
