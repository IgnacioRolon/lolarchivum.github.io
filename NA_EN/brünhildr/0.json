I don't see any option to edit item sets anywhere and that's fucking ridiculous. What happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-28T18:16:16.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The updated client is still in testing, so some features aren't available just yet.  Item Sets aren't available, but you can still make adjustments through the legacy version.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nAny updates made there will still show up in-game!  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Brünhildr","date":"2017-03-28T18:18:02.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That works, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
