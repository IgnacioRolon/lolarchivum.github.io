I stopped playing while my account was suspended. Didn&#039;t realise the chat filter would punish you that hard for it, and I figured I wouldn&#039;t use the word anymore and it&#039;d be fine (never use that word in the first place, just randomly used it that time).\r\n\r\nThat was the first time something had actually happened to my account for ages excluding a 10-match chat ban once in a while when I was having a bad lengthy series of games.\r\n\r\nWhich is why I&#039;m surprised I suddenly got permanently suspended in last game, I assume because I had said &#039;%%%%%%%%%%% ding dong&#039; in my second flagged game as a joke, and possibly my account had been flagged as being &#039;racist&#039; or something.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m asian myself, so I didn&#039;t think it would be considered that big of a deal.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the other messages I said were relatively rude, but I&#039;d have expected a 10-20 match chat ban instead. Hence, I&#039;m surprised I&#039;m suddenly permabanned.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s probably better for me since I put way too much of my time in this game, but I figured I&#039;d try and see if something can be done since a perma-ban I feel is excessive and came out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nAs in, honestly, I&#039;ve said much worse way way in the past than the games that were shown in the log and for them, I got at most a 10-20 match chat ban.","replies":[{"poster":"oSEXYPLATYPUSo","date":"2017-07-10T03:26:46.606+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO NOT ONCE BUT TWICE YOU USE RACIAL REMARKS AND THINK THE SYSTEM IS THE REASON WHY YOU GOT PERMABANNED ? \n\n\nREALLY?","replies":[{"poster":"QsZgojdN3i","date":"2017-07-10T03:41:26.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first time I was asking for it, the second time though was a joke entirely.
