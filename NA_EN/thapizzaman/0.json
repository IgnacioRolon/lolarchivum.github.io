He literally soloed the game. What&#039;s the point in learning: laning phase, team fight phase focusing on objectives ect. ect. if one person can just come out of the jungle and shit on your whole team and destroy 3 turrets in a matter of 10 seconds. http://i.imgur.com/mTqphtR.png?1","replies":[{"poster":"Droogzy","date":"2016-03-22T23:26:49.509+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndmere finished with 7k more gold than anyone on your team. \n\nI hate that shit stain, but its pretty clear you weren't winning all game, someone was giving a lot of kills over to Tryndmere. 7k gold lead on one character doesn't magically appear out of nowhere. \n\nAdditionally, he hardcore farmed like crazy, he has the highest CS in addition to most kills.

He has 245 CS. That's nearly DOUBLE the numbers from anyone on your team. As jungle too.\n\nBasically, you guys left a hypercarry to free farm. I guess you dominated the rest of the map 4 v 5 and when he finally farmed up and hit his powerspike he joined his team and destroyed you.","replies":[{"poster":"ThaPizzaMan","date":"2016-03-23T05:11:12.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly what happened","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EndlessSorcerer","date":"2016-03-22T23:45:53.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, few things to note looking at [the match in question](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2133270492/33545118?tab=overview)\n\n[1] Garen is not a heavy autoattacker, so Fervor of Battle isn't really a useful mastery on him.  You'd have probably been better off with Grasp of the Undying or Thunderlord's Decree (or arguably Stormraider's Surge).\n\n[2] You were not ahead the whole game.  Until ~29 minutes into the game, neither team was more than 2k gold ahead of one another (with the leading team going back and forth).  While your team had more Dragons, the enemy team had more towers killed.\n\n[3] Their jungle Tryndamere had ~100 CS above anyone on your team except Tristana.  Considering their Lucian was also decently ahead and that most of your team didn't break 150 farm in a 35 minute game, your gold was no where near as high as it should have been.\n\n[4] Your team had very little lockdown.  All you had for CC was basically Maokai's QWE, Tristana's R and Bard's QR, so you didn't really have a way to lockdown or kite Tryndamere for a noticeable amount of time.  \n\n[5] Tryndamere had a massive gold-lead on everybody and no-one on your team was actually capable of dueling against him.  He could easily just split-push you to dead while giving his team a numeric advantage else-where.","replies":[]},{"poster":"magee101","date":"2016-03-22T23:31:51.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THe problem was your team comp, not trynd. Trynd fails in a cc heavy team comp, but even then he can still backdoor a game into a solid win for his team. This Trynd went the way of the Yi and farmed his ass off so that when he did come out you underestimated the damage he could do and he quickly snow balled off that (I've done that tons of times with Yi, it's kinda hilarious). Undying rage is really easy to deal with, CC that mofo. Your team didn't have that cc you needed. \n\n(There are other notes to be made about your teammate's builds and item choices which also did not do well against a Trynd but that's for another time.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"StygianDusk","date":"2016-03-22T23:31:12.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you.
