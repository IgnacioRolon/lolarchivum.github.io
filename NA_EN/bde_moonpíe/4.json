But if you get counterpicked you will cry. (I can't see how you would win vs a zed post 6, or a talon).\nVs AP mage you should be fine as long as you buy edge of the night and malmortius.\nAlso you are easy to dive for any tanky jungler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"serenity7","date":"2017-02-21T18:39:42.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can most likely do better bot lane even with a bad support than you will mid. If your support is bad, focus on using your q to last hit minions while also hitting the enemy. The amount of early poke you can get with a max damage q is enough to control the lane yourself. \"Bad\" is such a general term. It depends what the support is doing wrong, you have options to deal with them. Are they too passive, just sitting around under tower? Or being too aggressive, positioning badly or starting bad fights? If you have the passive type, time those q's well and position so that you are behind the minions to avoid harass from the support but be on the same side as the adc so you can auto them. Also put traps in the bushes. If you have the over aggressive support, make sure you stay back and don't go in if they go in at a bad time.  You can possibly save the support with your w snare while staying at a safe distance. If your support is unreliable make sure you don't walk up so close that you can't get out alone. Also if they are caught out, if you ult even if the enemy isn't low enough to kill, they will often run away anyway or at least disengage the fight.\n \nIf you go mid you'll probably just get cucked by a zed or leblanc. And if not that you'll just be an easy target for ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-02-22T16:46:51.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for the help, but I have another question, do I need to make any changes to the Jhin build I usually run in bot lane or not?","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeresyHorus","date":"2017-02-21T20:30:24.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"against ap mages, yes go jhin mid ( against syndra u need to be aggressive from level 1 with aa ).\n\nagainst tanks, yes go jhin mid ( take warlord and its peace of cake ).\n\nagainst assassins, no dont go jhin mid.\n\nagainst marksmen, depends ( dont go against MF, varus, cait, cassio, vayne, luc and quinn ).\n\nagainst fighters, depends ( dont go against riven, xin, wu, skarner and gnar ).\n\nagainst Yasou and Jayce ( they have their own special catagory ), no dont go jhin mid.","replies":[]}]}
