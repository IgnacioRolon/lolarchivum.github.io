She has become to dependent on her stacking in the jungle, and because the enemy team can see her marks in the jungle and anyone can steal them from her she falls off early game and the only decent damage you can do with her is at 50 minutes because everyone can steal the stacks, so I never see her in any sort of play, so please so this champ some love and Buff Kindred.","replies":[{"poster":"Yago","date":"2017-03-12T03:01:40.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just did.

If you manage your ganks correctly you should be forcing out pressure easier than half the champions in the game. The marks are not \"everything.\" If you do make them everything, you've not only made yourself vulnerable to the enemy for being in predictable areas, but you're dictating that the champion is weak based on this playstyle interaction when it's not everything that makes Kindred a jungler even if it holds some value to her identity.\n\nTo give an example, let's say the bottom lane Scuttle is marked by Wolf. You're about to head to your red buff.\n\nDo you:\n1. Finish red, mark someone and go for a gank.\nor\n2. Go for the Scuttle immediately.\n\nThe answer is both. No option is worse than the other as long as you already expect to know where the enemy jungler is based on what camp they started, and there will be rare cases where you will be able to do both. But if you blindly choose one of these options while expecting nothing, you've set yourself up for failure.\n\nI already went Kha'Zix vs. a Kindred recently and she went for every single mark that wasn't in my territory. She died for every single one of them save for one where I didn't get there in time, but I knew exactly where she was most of the entire game. It's unfortunate too because she was scaling really well from my team's screw ups and could 1v1 me if she used her ultimate correctly (which she didn't). She's a high-knowledge champion and does not need buffs. The problem has more to do with player learning curve and if they made her marks SEEM less mandatory then players wouldn't be having such a bad time with her. Early game one mark is literally just ~8 HP damage on autos and 5 damage extra on Q. But gigantic blue mark on the map says it matters.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-03-12T23:24:34.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She was insanely toxic to the game.\n\nI am glad she is out of the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-03-13T00:07:47.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dominick Destine,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=3RrGQtAL,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-03-12T23:24:34.112+0000)\n>\n> She was insanely toxic to the game.\n> \n> I am glad she is out of the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-03-13T00:08:13.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Says the guy that plays Vi jungle","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-03-13T00:06:19.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yo, I'm here to give personal pinion about a champion that I personally enjoy, and yes she was toxic but I don't want her to be that way, just good enough to be a solid jungler that in the right hands, can be very valuable to the team she is on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NGNL Asian","date":"2017-03-12T23:23:20.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That champion is going to be like aatrox for the next few years XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spartan Sol","date":"2017-03-12T03:26:54.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kindred could use a few minor buffs but otherwise shes fine.
