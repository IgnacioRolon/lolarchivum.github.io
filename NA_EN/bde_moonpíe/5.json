But I feel like this would be a really fun concept to think about. First of all we all know what Shen is, a energy based tank, that can be played in the top lane (or support for a little fun), and I like the rework that Shen received in the beginning of 2015, but really i don&#039;t feel that he is in the right place right now. I don&#039;t feel that he should be a tank, but more of a hard-carry fighter kind of a champion. I mean, he has a percentage of maximum health damage build into his kit with a +1.5% per 100 AP, but really with all of the items in the recommended item&#039;s for Shen&#039;s build, I never see AP. So I think with these new abilities, Shen could become more reliable as an Mixed Damage fighter. He no longer has a spirit blade that follows him around.\r\nAlso keep in mind that some of the names and of the abilities have remained unchanged, and are original works from Riot Games. (Please, don&#039;t hate on it too bad). And if Riot reads this, thank you for putting time into reading this\r\n\r\nPassive, Equilibrium: When the A key is pressed Shen switches between 2 kits, each with its own respective passive and other abilities, and each kit has its own set of cooldowns that you can see above the hotbar, even if it is not the kit that Shen has selected\r\n\r\nKit #1\r\nPassive: Absolute Offence: when below 30% health, gains 25% bonus AD\r\n\r\nQ: Twilight Assault: Shen&#039;s next three basic attacks become empowered dealing (30% AD) +3.5% of the targets maximum health in Physical damage (15% is converted to True Damage) (+2% of targets max health per 150 bonus AD)\r\nEnergy cost: 40 energy\r\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4 seconds\r\n\r\nW: Vorpal Blade: Shen gains 15% bonus attack speed and his basic attacks heal Shen for (30% AD)\r\nenergy cost: 80 energy\r\nCooldown: 12/10/8/6/4 seconds\r\n\r\nE: Shadow Dash: completely unchanged (Cuz i&#039;m lazy)\r\n\r\nR: Last Stand: Shen&#039;s abilities become empowered for 10/15/20 seconds, cooldowns are increased by 10%\r\nQ: deals (60% AD) and 5% of the targets maximum health\r\nW: Gains +30% attack speed\r\nE: the taunt duration increases to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\r\nEnergy Cost: None\r\ncooldown: 120/90/60\r\n\r\nKit #2\r\n\r\nPassive: Absolute Defense: The same as Ki barrier, but the base cooldown is decreased to 4 and casting abilities no longer lowers the cooldown.\r\n\r\nQ: Spirit wave: A point click ability that sends out a wave of spirit energy, dealing (75% AP) to the target clicked on.\r\nEnergy Cost: 40 energy\r\nCooldown: 8/7/6/5/4\r\nW: Spirits Refuge: The same as before however, you click on an ally champion or yourself to activate the blocking zone\r\n\r\nE: From the Shadows: First Cast: Shen becomes invisible for 2/3/4/5/6 seconds.\r\nSecond cast: Shen comes out of invisibility with an empowered basic attack dealing (60% AP) and blinds the target for 2/2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds\r\nEnergy Cost: 100\r\nCooldown: 14/12/10/8/6\r\n\r\nR: Stand United: the same as it was before\r\n\r\neach kit has its own set of cooldowns, and the passive effect for both kits cannot stack with each other. Also if you have any effects on you or an ally and you switch to another kit while they are active, you lose those effects with the kit change\r\n\r\nForgive any spelling errors or anything else that you find wrong with this, and let me know what you guys think, down in the comments, Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mecha MaIphite","date":"2017-05-07T13:08:44.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> taunt duration increases to 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds\n\nmy sides","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melledoneus","date":"2017-05-07T18:51:05.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen was never meant to be a lane bully or a real fighter, but this rework does exactly that.\n\nThis would make him extremely broken with fervor-bruiser builds.\n\nI like the taunt duration increase idea, but it eats up too much of his power budget.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-05-07T15:33:51.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and the 15% conversion of the Q in True damage Only applies to the base AD damage and not the Max health damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-05-07T15:32:38.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the Q scales with (30% AD) so there is scaling on the Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-05-07T15:30:00.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, Broken Q on the Absolute Offence kit, but hey I came up with this in 2 seconds, so there will be some changes, thank you for catching that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asayake 5150glow","date":"2017-05-07T14:26:24.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One problem, taking a look at this, is just comparing it to other shapeshifting/multikit champions. They all give up their ults, and they have cooldowns on swapping.\n\nThat being said, this kit doesn't seem to have many problems with that, as there's no ranged -> melee change, although a few abilities seem overtuned.\n\nOffensive kit:\nPassive: I don't believe Shen has the stick potential to use this passive reliably. 30% health isn't very much, and then Shen basically has no passive until he gets that low. Might need some changes, not sure what to, tho.\n\nQ: Very strong ability in terms of damage, I'm assuming it's also an auto attack reset, once we get rid of the Spirit blade there'd be no clunkiness implementing that. It's quite powerful, although I only see one major problem, that being his E, actually. If it's unchanged, is he still getting ~35 energy back per Q hit? Because that Q only costs 40 energy... Yeah, some form of energy regen you definitely forgot.\nAlso, is there no scaling on this ability? Does the only thing that gets better from ranking it up the cooldown?\n\nW: Not much of an AS boost, very strong heal assuming a 300 AD build. But how does it last? It's cooldown gets very low in later ranks, which should be fine... but there is no scaling on this ability either. Seeing what Olaf has on his W, I don't think it'd be too much of a stretch to rank the attack speed up to 40% at rank 5. Expensive in terms of energy though, how is Shen going to regen energy? That takes a big role in the balance of these abilities. Should he have them up permanently once he gets to late game? Or should they be stronger boosts, but only temporary?\n\nE: Shen's gonna need more reliably mobility, and some stick, to work as a fighter. Right now Frozen Mallet does the job, but I don't see that fitting into this build.\n\nR: Overpowered as fuck.\nAlright, so Q is gonna do a shit ton more damage, with a 300 AD build getting 500 damage + 7 2/3% maxhealth on each auto, oh and 75+~1.15%maxhealth is converted to true damage? That's Irelia style true damage, and that's not even counting the other 225 + 6.5% maxhealth bonus physical damage. Seriously, that's broken.\n\nW: Underwhelming, not too strong, though. Like I said, the ability itself could stand to rank up to 40% attack speed... I think.\n\nE: Holy fucking shit, 5 second taunt? You gonna make him the Malhazar of duelists, man, QSS or you're dead. Or a super lucky Riposte, if you're Fiora.\nAnd imagine it in teamfights. CC'ing 2-3 champions for 5 seconds effectively makes it into a 5v3/2. Right now it's only 1.5 seconds, and Shen is still picked as a tank who provides CC for his team.\n\nAlso, this thing lasts 20 seconds? What type of fight lasts 20 seconds? Useless power, except that his ult will be on a ~20 second cooldown after it runs out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saevum","date":"2017-05-07T13:05:46.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rework ideas or suggestions usually go on \"Concepts and Creations\" section.\n\nGameplay section involves** tweaks with the champ current kit**","replies":[{"poster":"BDE Moonpíe","date":"2017-05-07T13:10:12.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to put this into concepts and Creations, but then i got removed by Riot\nSo I figures I would put it here. lul","replies":[]}]}]}
