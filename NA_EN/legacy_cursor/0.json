I spent close to 400$ on my banned account. its very harsh. They should only go as far as permanently chat banning you unless you cross the line with threats and racism, hacks etc. You can beg for it back all you want but they literally don't care about you. You're just a number to them. I'm sorry man, absolutely sucks.
