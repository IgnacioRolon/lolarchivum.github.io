HERE'S AN EASY FIX.","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"The current Mordekaiser kit destroys Tanks, can't do much against anything else and **IS VERY STATCHECKY**. Here's my fix : \r\n\r\n-  **Passive :  Mordekaiser deals  5 − 15.2 (based on level) (+ 60% AP) magic damage per second to all nearby enemies, marks enemy units with Siphon* and gains 3% − 9% (based on level) bonus movement speed.**\r\n\r\n*Siphon : Enemies take  2% − 10% (based on level) of target's maximum health when hit with a Mordekaiser ability or auto attack.\r\n\r\n- **Same Q.**\r\n\r\n- **Same W.**\r\n\r\n- **E : Same passive, but narrower with a lower cooldown*.**\r\n\r\n*Instead of the cooldown being 24/21/18/15/12, make it 18/15/12/9/8.\r\n\r\n- **Ult : Same ult, ALLOW ALL OBJECTIVES IN (BARON AND DRAGON INCLUDED), and if possible, make the area 2x larger so enemies have better escape paths and aren't just trapped.**\r\n \r\nPLEASE give this champion more skill expression, otherwise he just stomps a game or can't do anything because of bad design. Numbers might be bad, but the idea is what matters.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackKnightJack","date":"2019-08-15T19:21:56.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know Mord works like this because he needs room for tank items as he has no range or mobility, right?","replies":[{"poster":"Zbskiller","date":"2019-08-15T19:40:48.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?

The truth is, they don't. Some champions take more skill than others, and have more binary play styles, that's just a fact of the game. Also, the reason I brought up good game design and bias is because 99% of the time people confuse their knowledge of the two. This is most certainly the majority of the cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Zbskiller","date":"2019-08-15T19:36:09.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not right at all. Yes, some champions need to be simpler for newer players to slowly get accustomed to the game. But it's undeniable that when champions have very simple kits, they tend to either dominate because of their superior numbers compared to the rest of the roster, or they get shafted and never seen again. And players complain about those champions, tanks included.\n\nWukong is one of those champs. Riot completely gutted because his kit has NO SKILL INPUT AT ALL, which makes his viability rely STRICTLY on his dmg, since he has no terrain scaling or any skill shots which can impact player differences. I hope you realise that this is why some champs are better than others and you'll rarely find any basic champs in high elo or in competitive games.","replies":[{"poster":"Kai Guy","date":"2019-08-15T21:11:33.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im 100% ok with basic champions only being viable in high Elo because of a counter matchup or high synergy with teams comp. I don't think all champs should enjoy universal viability, and the reward for skill expression should be increased viability.  Higher ceilings should be higher power budget.\n\nIf there is a higher ceeling champion for every basic champion which removes their viability completely from top end MMR?  That's ok. Not everything needs to exist at the level some 0.001% of players function at.  For Bronze To Gold basically everything can be viable to climb assuming your skill is there.","replies":[{"poster":"Zbskiller","date":"2019-08-15T21:30:13.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree, I think all champions should be universally pickable, of course with major drawbacks for some in some matchups (i.e. Kassadin vs any AD matchup midlane should be incredibly hard for Kassadin, but he should still be **playable** in those matchups, and not an auto lose). \n\nLetting all characters be viable in all elos makes it so that people can enjoy they're favorite champion no matter the matchup, and really live their fantasy in the game which makes the game more fun to them in return.\n\nMy ideal situation is that all champions should be playable in all elos, some harder than others for sure, it's inevitable, but still playable. And I think this change will help Mordekaiser in that aspect. \n\nI love the idea and aesthetic of Mordekaiser in the rework they did for him, but his kit is just so 1 dimensional.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MalignMetal","date":"2019-08-16T01:53:05.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean there are worse stat checks,","replies":[]}]}
