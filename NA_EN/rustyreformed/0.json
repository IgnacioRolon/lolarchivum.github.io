I understand different things are stronger and better picks in different elo&#039;s. But i mean really when you have a braum, soraka botlane going healer/tank. they are obviously going to lose lane vs an actual adc/sup lane. My point is i dont want to suffer que time dodges because of troll picks but i also dont want to sit through a 20 mins game of troll either. Someone help im lost on what i should do","replies":[{"poster":"AlienPrimate","date":"2017-07-26T19:52:43.172+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are going to be dodging a lot if you think Teemo mid is troll.","replies":[{"poster":"RustyReformed","date":"2017-07-26T19:58:23.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was just my first example.

This is even just in low silver I experience comp matters. Everything does not work.

I use the policy \"Don't negotiate with terrorists\" and replace \"terrorists\" with \"trolls.\" For one thing, the only way they're going to get punished is if I play the match out with them and report them at the end, and for another thing, if I dodge, then I'm showing the trolls that they have power. If trolls start meeting lobbies of four people who refuse to dodge and say that they're reporting the troll at the end unless he or she plays legitimately, then I think instances of trolling would go down, because their \"victims\" are taking an active stance. If people just dodge at the sight of trolls, then the trolls just get a free dodge, and more importantly, they see that their trolling has an effect, which just encourages them to troll further.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuicideAll","date":"2017-07-27T02:09:31.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodge penalty is too much.
