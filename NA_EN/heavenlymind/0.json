The problem with this news feed of \"alt tab\" being the issue is that many people believe that if their game does not load and they did not hit \"alt tab\", then it's another issue and simply will not attempt to reconnect. I will point out that since the patch I have had to task manager force quit LoL EVERY single game since the patch, and sometimes multiple times just to reconnect. I will add that I NEVER hit alt tab. I understand some people alt tab to turn on music or whatever but I'm just looking to play the game. My computer/net are beyond handling LoL so not the issue. First, I would suggest that the wording on the news feed be updated to something more general with quick bug solution fixes as I have already mentioned. This will help keep thousands of people from losing/leaver games for no reason other than a faulty patch. Second, Fiddlesticks needs a new skin.\n\n******************UPDATE********************\nSeveral hours after posting this I suddenly no longer have the problem and neither do my teammates or enemy team. I am guessing that it is fixed now. If there are some that still have errors please post.","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2014-11-07T01:21:02.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You dont have to exit the game every time, just wait 2-3 minutes.\n\nThe game has always loaded up for me, even if the loading screen has crashed.\n\nThe game will just randomly start","replies":[{"poster":"HeavenlyMind","date":"2014-11-07T02:43:45.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have waited it out 3 times for up to 10 minutes, and it did not load.
