The resulting range is pretty much global and can be cast from base to enemy nexus.\r\n\r\nKind of new to League of legends forums but still thought I should attempt to report this bug. Sorry if i have violated any rules for this posting.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2017-05-18T16:21:37.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nThanks for the report! Maokai had been disabled to resolve this issue.
