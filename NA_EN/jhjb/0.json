What exactly are these contributing toward a win? I realize you think you're giving advice to Annie at one point, and you do have a suggestion in there, though presented in a rather negative tone. It *is* possible to give constructive feedback without linking it to an insult.\n\nBut there's something to understand about your ban: It's not just this one game that, by itself, brought about this ban. Permabans are handed out when there's a consistent pattern of negative behavior across many games, and also generally after several warnings are given (by means of chat restrictions and temp-bans). You failed to heed those warnings. \n\nAs for the email, have you checked your spam folders? Or do you have your inbox set to automatically delete anything it regards as spam? Since you didn't get the ban notification, or any emails about the creation of your ticket, it sounds like your email is filtering stuff out from riotgames. If you did submit a support ticket, you should be able to log back into the support site and view the status of your current and past tickets there, though.","replies":[{"poster":"jhjb","date":"2015-11-17T17:16:02.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Well, of course i used to be maybe a bit harassing or talked that way... \nBut, what i dont get is, it was my first game for a while.... \nAnd just because someone reported me, i get the perma ban ?? that's what im worried about...  so this would  mean whenever trigger the report.. if in your chat logs, something sounds suspicious.. you get the perma ?? i dont think that's fair...","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-11-17T17:23:16.315+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were permabanned because you were continually harassing players after multiple warnings about your behavior. *It wasn't just that one game*. Please, understand that. That game was the last nail in the coffin, but there were many other games involved leading up to your permanent ban.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter that you hadn't played for a couple weeks. 2 weeks not playing the game doesn't magically clear your account of any past wrongdoings. You were probably harassing players before you took a break, and you still were when you came back from the break.","replies":[{"poster":"jhjb","date":"2015-11-17T17:27:49.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Oh but i understand that  ! \nWhat i dont get it, the perma ban right away after one game , and whiteout any analyze or the chat and context, beside the words i said to Annie ... i dont think this worths a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Zielmann","date":"2015-11-17T17:45:15.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you don't seem to understand it. \nYou're trying to look at it as \"I was perma-banned for saying x to Annie in this game\", but that's largely a false statement. At the very least, it's completely misleading. Again, your harassment towards that Annie was the last straw, after a very long pattern of the same behavior. That pattern shows that you aren't willing to correct your behavior at all, and that unwillingness is what had lead you to a permanent ban.\n\nI've seen an analogy to the points system they use for traffic violations, and it's a rather fitting one for this situation. Certain violations may result in having your license revoked after just one or two instances. But somebody else might just be caught speeding enough times in a year, and wind up having their license revoked as well. Typically, speeding by itself doesn't result in losing your license. But do it enough, and it'll happen.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MegaManYYZ","date":"2015-11-17T17:47:42.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this was your first game back from a SUSPENSION, it means you're already blacklisted, any small report will get you a larger suspension.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-11-17T15:30:34.593+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"You flamed... literally all game.

Sometimes its best to just not say anything even if you honestly think a teammate is terrible.  Telling them that doesnt help them get better and creates a negative feeling between the team thats supposed to focus aggression on the other 5 players in the game not on your team.
