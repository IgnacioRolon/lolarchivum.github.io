Similar to how you can stop Ryze ultimate. As stuns are the only counter to hypercarries in general, they should be more helpful against an Akali. If this results in her being too weak you can always use this now actual counterplay as justification for a buff elsewhere. At least then she'll have counterplay. \n\nI'd like to get some perspective as I truly feel Akali is only really broken because of the shroud. Unfortunately, it is also her signature move that everyone thinks when thinking Akali, so nerfing it too much may hurt her identity.","replies":[{"poster":"JoshTGW","date":"2019-11-17T07:02:08.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's not the worst idea I've heard for a balance change, but where would she be buffed to compensate for the nerf?\n\nAkali, despite the nerfs she's gotten and the player-base saying she's horrible, isn't weak or horrible at all. A good Akali player can play her at a fairly strong level too which, there's very little you can do against her. The current way to counter her, I believe anyway, is with ranged characters, AoE abilities for dealing with her when she's in her shroud, or control wards (pink wards).\n\nI find it interesting that you mention her shroud because I've honestly thought of how best to change it to make it reasonable while also finding a way to buff her elsewhere. I thought of how shroud should have a limit to how much visibility of Akali it hinders and I've thought if you're right next to her, you should be able to see the champion without an issue, forcing the Akali player to constantly move around in the shroud and avoid the opposing team while dealing damage. The way they should buff her is surely NOT by damage at all, maybe by health if the shroud got some changes, either your idea or mine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-11-17T07:19:19.437+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being visible in a smoke cloud because of, rather than in spite of, being unable to move or act just doesn't make sense.
