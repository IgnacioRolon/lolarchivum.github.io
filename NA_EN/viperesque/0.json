Headshot&quot; is hugely obnoxious. More so than stuff like people spamming Lux laugh, IMO. I&#039;d appreciate it being substantially toned down, or preferably removed altogether.\r\n* Pool Party Graves Q is pretty much invisible on Howling Abyss due to the low contrast with the bridge itself. Can&#039;t attach a pic because I don&#039;t own the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-11-13T21:48:39.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey viperesque, \n\nI can bring up the Caitlyn VO issue - I'm not sure if we'll be making changes there. However, you're right with Pool Party Graves  - it's pretty hard to see on Howling Abyss. We'll see what we can do to improve the visibility. :]","replies":[{"poster":"iHerring","date":"2015-11-14T00:03:46.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the Caitlyn VO is a nice touch but see a few people complaining about the frequency. I haven't seen her in game much yet, does she say it literally every headshot? Maybe she could only say it on a net/trap headshot and say every 3rd/4th AA headshot or something.\n\nThat could reduce the VO spam in laning and to be honest in teamfights with so much going on I probably don't notice half the VO with so many splosions and such.\n\nAlso while I'm here, kudos on the new Q animation for whoever did that. It's like you've taken the old '1 handed rifle' flair and turned it up to 11. Can't decide my favourite between that and MF's Q now! :3","replies":[]}]}]}
