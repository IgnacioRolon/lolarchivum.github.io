Cross guard doesn't help shit, if your hand is hit at 90 degree angle.\n\nSecondly, due to the nature of lightsabers it was impossible for the blade to \"slide\" down for a hilt to make sense. Why? Because magnetic fields stop lightsaber on the spot and lightsabers themselves use magnetic fields to maintain the blade, so when two collide, you can only pull them away, not slide them aganist each other like normal swords.\n\nThirdly, early versions of lightsabers were ceremonial blades, that require a huge battery \nstrapped behind Jedi's back to work merely as a flash light for a moment, due to energy loses and overheating.\nLater iterations were closed circuits with build-in energy cells that only lost energy when actively cutting something, hence why those \"_modern_\" models lasted for years.\n\nKylo's basically has two blades. One \"_proper_\" and second \"_prototype_\", that's entirely lost energy.\n\nThe fact his lightsaber didn't run out of power while merely fighting Rei, makes it one of the biggest jokes in Star Wars.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-05-27T15:01:26.811+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"create solo queue as we were promised*\n\nold queue was solo/duo, still not the solo queue that we want.","replies":[{"poster":"Kedren Aderac","date":"2016-06-11T12:12:49.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jet Alone","date":"2016-05-28T04:05:22.979+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"solo Q is never coming back dude\nriot doesn't give a shit about us\ni don't even play league anymore, i only browse the boards once a month to see if anyone still cares\nleague is dead","replies":[{"poster":"Arsenic Sulfur","date":"2016-05-28T22:45:25.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still one of the most populated games, not dead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Herny knock down","date":"2016-05-28T01:05:52.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice to have solo queue and dynamic queue so you can pick .
