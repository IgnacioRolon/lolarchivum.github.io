He didn't know what he was doing, he just realized he fucked up by trying to trade and  the Yorick, who probably didn't what he was doing as well, stayed in tower range without going for the kill. That's all there is to it. It's not like Darius did good. Yorick fucked up. He just was confused, stayed in tower range, died. You give them way too much credit when it's obvious they're bad. Both of them.\nI mean, look at it. Why did Yorick stop? He could have gotten a tradekill easily if he didn't suddenly stop and hesitate. Are you that blind to what is happening?\nAlso, ONE SINGLE OUTPLAY DOES NOT DEFINE HOW GOOD SOMEONE IS (this wasn't even one but w/e) Sometimes, you can do a great thing and suck in general. You seem to think that one example proves a theory, which can not be more wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandemic Punch","date":"2016-06-06T16:49:03.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop giving in.

He was thinking that he can all in vs Darius but Darius was in tower range and he planned whole action to bait Yorick to dive him.  Yorick realized that he is losing trade right after Darius baited him in tower range and then it was too late so Darius was counting that Yorick won't go for trade because he would think that he can just escape but Darius was counting on his passive to finish him off and it did. Darius planned whole action, nothing is luck here man.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Herny knock down","date":"2016-06-06T16:55:15.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If isn't about winning a lane it's about outplaying someone why you even mention and I quote * Why is this Darius bronze 5 ?
