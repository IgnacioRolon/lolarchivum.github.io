But hey that&#039;s old school, every new champ was always OP except Syndra and Bard on their releases.\r\nSoooooo... We have to fix that, right?\r\nTo balance her we need to totally remove the duration of that stone thing that she gets, animation can stay but that knockup/slow must go away.","replies":[{"poster":"iConcy","date":"2016-06-10T20:09:56.944+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"what... she was like one of the most underwhelming releases in a long time. She literally has 3 abilities since her ult isn't the most useful thing and doesnt help much in a fight (its a good ability dont get me wrong but that besides the point) and any type of damage knocks her off her wall - seriously a one damage dot knocks her off.. Her passive is literally just movement speed by a wall when not in combat so it has no use besides getting places which makes her roam okay i guess. And then her she nerfs her own Q by using it but hey she gets movement speed form the worked ground so theres that at least.\n\nI mean ive done well with her but lol at saying shes broken. Try and play her a few times and then come back to us.","replies":[{"poster":"iConcy","date":"2016-06-10T20:39:15.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had a kid play taliyah jungle on my team, and yeah man shes _really_ op__","replies":[{"poster":"spombjop","date":"2016-06-10T20:43:06.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LJTakeshi,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=6KELmPlJ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-06-10T20:39:15.358+0000)\n>\n> Just had a kid play taliyah jungle on my team, and yeah man shes _really_ op__\n\npeople were saying the same thing about yasuo when he was released, 1 month later - penta every game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-06-10T20:51:42.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't even tell what change you're suggesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voidner","date":"2016-06-10T20:03:10.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/Kxiin.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"FourVsFive","date":"2016-06-10T20:54:48.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Talking about balance in LoL is a joke, don't wast your breath.
