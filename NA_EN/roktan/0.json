Not only does his Darkin form feel more satisfying and fun to play by turning his W into a knock up, but you are able to switch into it much sooner. I don&#039;t get it.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-08-09T00:18:07.051+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which form Kayn gets the option to transform into first is based off who he's been fighting during the game. If he's been fighting more ranged people he'll get offered Shadow, with a wait for Darkin. If he's been fighting more melee he'll get offered Darkin, with a wait for Shadow.","replies":[{"poster":"Karn Bishop","date":"2017-08-12T07:30:38.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems counter intuitive though for an assassin, even waiting until mid game to become an assassin and you lose the strongest window most assassins thrive in early game.\n\nthere should be a way to stack blue kayn easier given how easy it is to unintentionally unlock red every single time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Celebrimborr","date":"2017-08-09T00:14:36.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the same time its just much harder to gank ranged people. Top is the easiest to gank and usually melees are there. Mid is a mix but is much harder to gank. Same thing  with bot lane having the most ranged but harder to gank as the support will always have it warded and most likely has Crowd Control to keep you off the ranged","replies":[]},{"poster":"CamilleRule34","date":"2017-08-08T23:28:12.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on who you fight, chances are youre fighting a bunch of melee people. Statistically, more people are melee than ranged, so really its just one of those odd happenstances","replies":[]}]}
