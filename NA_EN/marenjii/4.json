Preferably in MLA format.\n\nPixel, HD. *Talon Ain't What He Used To Be*. Riot Boards. 20 October 2014, Web.\n\nThere we go. But, yes, really. Talon's silence allowed him to be a counter-assassin. His job was to shut down champs with damage so high that the rest of his team can't confront them without dying.\n\n{{champion:119}}  {{champion:103}}  {{champion:45}}  {{champion:1}}  {{champion:105}} \n{{champion:238}}  {{champion:38}}  {{champion:55}}  {{champion:92}}  {{champion:9}} \n{{champion:18}} {{champion:157}}  {{champion:115}}  Eh, maybe Ziggs\n\nWhen these champs reach their power spike, you need high damage initiation to take them out. Without his silence, literally ALL of these champs can now counterattack him and probably kill him, if not just get away.\nViegar, Ahri, Annie, Ziggs, Fiddle, Tristana, and Draven can disrupt you and fight back. (Stun, Attract, Fear)\nFizz, Zed, and Kassadin can either leave quickly or become invulnerable from your assault and then fight back very easily\nRiven, Yasuo, and Tristana will simply stun AND out damage you before your blink goes off cooldown again\n\nSo, yeah, he needs a silence. Many people I see who call for nerfs against talon have only played against him and not as him. I hate fighting Aatrox, but I'm not gonna say he's OP. Talon's silence wasn't even like, 3 seconds like Garen's or Fiddle's.\n\nAnd if Riot is concerned with Assassin counterplay, nerf Ahri. She is an AP assassin, and her attract is a silence and a fear that brings you closer. No counterplay in that. Yasuo is an assassin, and he's allowed to be twice as OP as talon ever was.\n\nI WOULD consider Talon OP if he was capable of easily downing tanks, but I don't see Talon offing a Volibear or Garen all that often. Talon's silence may looks like such a small thing. \"It lasted like, what? A second?\", but it was a major part of his kit, it made him the essential anti-hypercarry. \n\nIf they will not give back the silence, give something of greater or equal value. I'm thinking somewhere in the range of a point blink like Kass's ult, or an Invis. Something that keeps him more viable than a .25 second slow. That's not even a slow: .25 second stumble.  I love their justification. \"Just about enough time to get a hit in with your passive\".","replies":[{"poster":"Marenjii","date":"2014-10-21T02:41:35.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, done.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Salidfingers","date":"2014-10-21T00:21:41.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon is an AD caster and i had champions that counter him if someone would had picked him. \n\nSo to me what difference does it make compared to a burst mage that has real CC.

That's more than I can say for talon's nerf where in every scenario his E is now basically worthless. Might as well build him as a max CDR tank now so he can slow people for his team to catch up, his damage was never good enough to compete with other champions that didn't have silence as it is. \n\nI don't know what random statistics you pull that place Talon as very strong pre nerf when Ryze, Rumble, Every ADC with a blink/dash,etc. completely outclass him in picks/bans win rate etc.\n\nEven worse is that NA WASN'T EVEN tring to counter him with Janna and stuff like that until they went to worlds. \n\nI just hate how every time any assassin sees even miniscule play it's 'very strong' but that fucking lee sin or ranged ADCS that have been seeing play for ages are just supposed to be 'oh yeah ofc they are picked we need them'. Like ppl are going on about Fizz and Zed who were  TOTAL SHIT in the Worlds. Not even SSW could pull off Fizz against a team whose number they had completely.

I think she needs a nerf on the width of her sphere-stun, but she has a chance to miss her cc. I do agree that Talon needs something to allow him to kill his targets without them destroying him, but honestly a silence against ability reliant champs is quite a difficult thing to overcome. If he has the silence, he is overpowered, but without it he is garbage. I think a snare + channel cancel would be a good fit for him, as it would allow him to hold his prey in place by disabling the use of movement spells (Flash{{summoner:4}}, Shunpo{{champion:55}}, Deathmark/Living Shadow{{champion:238}}, etc.) while also allowing him to counterplay specific matchups that he used to counter by canceling their channels (Death Lotus{{champion:55}}, Crowstorm{{champion:9}}, etc.). He would still be able to dodge skillshot abilities with his ultimate and allow enemies to still have counterplay on him with the use of their abilities, this way he doesn't automatically win the laning phase in specific matchups.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-10-20T21:59:13.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not sure you know what the word 'ironic' means.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunderflump","date":"2014-10-21T00:36:33.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I'm not sure you know what the word 'ironic' means.\n\nhttp://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/irony","replies":[{"poster":"AtheosisX","date":"2014-10-21T00:54:16.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > I'm not sure you know what the word 'ironic' means.\n> \n> http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/irony\n\nSo you read the definition and still thought it applied to the topic?
