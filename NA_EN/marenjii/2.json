But basically killing your lane opponent 2 or 3 times but they don&#039;t die because Soraka presses W is bullshit. But if you decide to just focus her, then her full HP carry will just get free auto attacks off on you. So you get punished for focusing her carry, and still get punished for focusing her.\n\nNo one has the burst neccesary in the early game to overcome Soraka&#039;s healing, but even when mid-late game happen if that person has one defensive item to stop them from being insta gibbed, then Soraka heals them to full and you just blew your CDs for nothing. Even worse if they bought a Spirit Visage to increase the healing they get from Soraka by 10%.\n\nNow clealy you can kill people on Soraka&#039;s team, she isn&#039;t broken to the point where she makes her team invincible, but the amount of damage you have to pump out to kill her carries is unthinkable. Grievious Wounds as it exist is not good enough of a counter because her ult removes it before applying the heal, and her heal CD is less than 2 seconds when maxed if she has at least one CDR item, so if my ap carry has Morello&#039;s she&#039;ll just bring them back over 40% then heal them less than 2 seconds afterwards anyway. (For reference her heal at 40% CDR is on a 1.2 second cooldown).\n\nAt this point I don&#039;t think any rework will allow Soraka to stay as a dedicated healer in this game. She just provides bad gameplay imo. Sitting back and hitting W on her carry is still almost all she does. Just that now she has to land a skillshot to heal herself so that she can continue healing her team.","replies":[]}
