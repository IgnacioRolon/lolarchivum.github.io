Balanced","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":9,"down_votes":11,"body":"Like seriously, at least mages, and assassins need to kill someone with their burst, or they die due to everything being on cooldown. An ADC just crits you 3 times in less than 2 seconds, and you're almost done! By time you get to them they are already one shot away from killing you, unless you can CC lock them, and their team provides absolutely no peel. Then they lifesteal back all the damage you managed to deal. Even worse when they have red buff. You won't even touch them, much less look them in the eye. But Randuin's loses it MS slow on hit, even though Furor, and Phage/TriForce exist. Furor less than a sixth of the cost of Randuin's, did not take up an item slot, AND still gave the person a net gain of 2%MS, yet RIP MS slow, cause toxic.","replies":[]}
