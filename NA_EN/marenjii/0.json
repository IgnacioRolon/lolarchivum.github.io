We also made it so that she gets to drain tank and win all of her fights if you bought WotA cause now you can drain tank almost like an ADC!

He's been nerfed a shit ton, and is now at the point where if you're good at him, farm up, and you have a good Yasuo team comp, you can carry games with him.  If you're not a good Yasuo player, you're gonna have a damn hard time trying to win games with him.  He really needs 3 big items to reach his damage thresh hold (unless you skip BotRK for Serker Greaves, which I like to do), and if you don't build tanky you will get focused shit on in teamfights.  He scales amazingly well at 6 items, but he takes a long ass time to ramp up, and a good team comp that's executed well to be relevant in any way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brenticus12","date":"2014-12-31T18:42:45.940+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"His double crit is not thematic in any way so he doesn't need it..\nThey nerfed everything that was thematic to him. \nHis restless playstyle with passive shield, wind shield strength, movement speed, ult range and yet they didn't nerf the one non-thematic element, his double crit.\nI love Yasuo but any champ with double crit is going to be hard to balance unless you nerf the crit itself.\n\nThe only thematic explanation I can think of is this - \"When the world's out to get you, every strike counts\" but that's still pretty fucking arbitrary.","replies":[{"poster":"YOU BEEN WARNED","date":"2014-12-31T19:18:52.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree, it's what makes his kit work.
