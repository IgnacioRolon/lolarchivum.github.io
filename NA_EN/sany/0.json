I was in a game playing caitlyn with a yuumi support and a lee sin jungle who was baiting me (not the yuumi but the lee ) and rengar got fed so I was a little bit tilted but I didn't really said bad things to deserve a ban or do you think I still deserve it?\r\n\r\nAlso, interesting fact about honor system : After many reports on you, Riot look at what you typed in chat and compare it to other games so if you haven't typed good things, and you type negative things in one game, you automatically get a warning. so here's my chat log of 1 game I typed after a long time to get a permanent ban :( \r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nSany: no I'm just walking with my cat\r\nSany: what is this range\r\nSany: yeah mb\r\nSany: but dude\r\nSany: fucking ward river\r\nSany: ward\r\nSany: he just walk river for free\r\nSany: see\r\nSany: how do you know they're here\r\nSany: ward RIVER\r\nSany: I moved forward cuz I was zoned by feathers\r\nSany: but she flashed\r\nSany: come here kitty\r\nSany: lee\r\nSany: I don't understand lee sin\r\nSany: he's pinging that he's coming\r\nSany: but he doesn't\r\nSany: dude\r\nSany: you turned\r\nSany: I saw\r\nSany: you didn't come\r\nSany: idk\r\nSany: idk about that lee\r\nSany: you still got R\r\nSany: you know?\r\nSany: jg diff\r\nSany: you know\r\nSany: just don't come near me\r\nSany: during the game\r\nSany: and I shall carry without you baiting me\r\nSany: you baited me 2 times\r\nSany: I'm done with you\r\nSany: you pinged you're coming\r\nSany: I saw you coming\r\nSany: so I fight\r\nSany: then you didn't come\r\nSany: lvl 8 lee sin\r\nSany: look how useless\r\nSany: stop fighting lee\r\nSany: yeah ping me\r\nSany: it's me and you kitty\r\nSany: we win this\r\nSany: wow\r\nSany: lee landed something\r\nSany: proud of you blind monk\r\nSany: you got this mario\r\nSany: look where is lee\r\nSany: and baron up\r\nSany: see\r\nSany: what I mean\r\nSany: poor monk\r\nSany: we turtle this\r\nSany: not your fault\r\nSany: he can walk freely\r\nSany: we got no pressure\r\nSany: no one can peel this\r\nSany: not even lee with his kick\r\nSany: maybe syndra\r\nSany: gj cat\r\nSany: no\r\nSany: 4v4\r\nSany: holy shit\r\nSany: can we trade jungle?\r\nSany: I want the double cat in my team\r\nSany: is he gonna jump me?\r\nSany: I wonder how\r\nSany: LOL\r\nSany: report me for what?\r\nSany: being lvl 12?\r\nSany: gg ez\r\nPost-Game\r\nSany: yeah blame me\r\nSany: it's okay\r\nSany: I forgive you\r\nSany: lol\r\nSany: I made the game harder just by typing\r\nSany: I like that quote\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like your opinion too, comments and vote to make a debate.
