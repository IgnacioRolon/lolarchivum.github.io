I have very good internet connection. During champion Select, I get a trying to reconnect message and then I get kicked out of the select and banned for dodging. I also lose LP. I am not sure what is causing this. But right now, I am sitting on a 30 min ban because of it. It only happens during champion select. I never get DC'd while in game, ever! If there is anyone else experiencing this please add to the post so it can get some attention from Riot and fix it.\r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"FC Secrets","date":"2017-09-22T22:26:33.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be nice if I didn't get punished for it and have a 30 minute ban and LP loss because of it. How is this fair? And I know I will get a response of saying, sorry can't help you there. But man, I tell ya what, we should not get banned for being DC from Champ select when it is at no fault of our own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T22:19:54.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your internet connection could very well be good, but you can still have instability or blocks causing you to desync from champion select and even in-game.  I don't recommend queueing up for anymore games for now, and instead stick to custom games while troubleshooting.  Run through the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help clear up any blocks and snags, and you should be good to go!","replies":[]}]}
