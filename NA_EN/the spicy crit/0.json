As soon as LeagueClient.exe process starts, my HDD usage rapidly jumps to 100% and my pc is next to useless while League or client are patching. I&#039;ve seen that im not the only one.\nWhy does client alone have 3-4 processes while the game itself has only 1 ?\nRight now i'm unpacking a big .rar file and client won't even start. Something stinks here and it's not me, i have showered about 30 minutes ago.\nBTW. My gf left me for another guy an hour ago, what should i do?\nEDIT: I know that mining is usually done with CPU/GPU, but it is possible mining with HDDs too, i've read a few articles, that's why i asked did they use our HDDs to mine because every time i run this client, my HDD usage jumps to 100%. Even on my friend's $300 SSD it jumps higher than it should.","replies":[]}
