While I have seen that being used as an argument against functionality about information you normally shouldn't see (I've once seen a program that lets you see what champions are being picked by your opponents in blind pick normals and in ARAMs during champion select), I'm not 100% sure about information that can be retrieved using legal thrid party sites such as lolnexus.com and lolking.net; I would really like a detailed explanation about what EXACTLY is and isn't allowed to be used in third party applications.","replies":[{"poster":"Volt Cruelerz","date":"2014-11-28T17:58:15.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I've never really been satisfied with their definition of \"interference with the gameplay experience,\" or lack thereof, really.  Obviously any bot that plays the game for you or program that gives you vision of things you shouldn't be able to see is bad, but fundamentally, this program does change the gameplay experience... that is to say, it makes it better (provided that their code doesn't crash).\n\nThings like that don't give you inappropriate knowledge of the game (you could look up all the champion/summoner statistics if you really wanted to, it's just inconvenient) and IMO ought to be fine.  That said, Riot's vague policy catches things like this in the crossfire.  They're probably intentionally vague because it's hard to nail down what is and isn't reasonable except on a case-by-case basis.  I certainly can't think of a better way to word their policy that doesn't catch reasonable programs in the crossfire.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-11-28T19:49:43.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems really unfair, but everybody uses lolnexus nowdays anyways so idk.","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2014-11-29T09:05:22.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just curious how you think this knowledge is unfair?

Fairly sure if it did that they would talk about it as a great feature to draw more people to it. Show me specifically where it shows or says it tracks any of those?

It really only puts something not offered in the game client onto the game client (think curse voice) it really does nothing that's game breaking or even game changing. If you want to have the information at your feet you can if not oh well. It may help newer players learn how various runes impact champions but as a whole it shouldn't be massively impactful unless someone is running odd rune pages/masteries it gives you a more convenient \"hey look out dumb%%%\".
