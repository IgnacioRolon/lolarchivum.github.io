IF you are a capable player, the system will _help_ you climb into your Rank. Especially the NEW System where you earn Free PROMO Wins until Gold 1. Just follow these easy Steps:\r\n\r\n* Change your Attitude, this is not the end of the world. You have so much time to climb.\r\n* Take this placement as an opportunity to **Shape raw skill** into a Capable LoL Player.\r\n* Don&#039;t forget, you are not alone, everyone is going through it.** Never Giveup**\r\n* IF the system made a mistake placing you too low, it will reward you with 22-35 IP per win. \r\n* IF you deserve your position, you will earn 18(or lower), and lose as much.\r\n\r\nThe First Step to climbing is your Attitude. We don&#039;t sit in Diamond because of our skill alone. 70% of it is our Positive energy in every match. Stressing out will only stress your team. We are People after all.\r\nYou don&#039;t have to communicate with any of your players but to use your Pings (don&#039;t overspam). If you lose 3 in a row, take a break and play at your best. Try not to play after midnight, everyone&#039;s eye and hand coordination falls off and you are increasing your chances for a Loss.\r\n\r\nI wish you all the best in your Climb. Don&#039;t ruin your Mood over a game.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"daemanic","date":"2016-01-21T23:36:49.687+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2016-01-21T23:37:58.229+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[{"poster":"Rinky Dinky","date":"2016-01-21T23:38:19.164+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[{"poster":"xShiNjiNx","date":"2016-01-21T23:38:34.928+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[{"poster":"isolate plz","date":"2016-01-21T23:39:21.605+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[{"poster":"xXExpandedDongXx","date":"2016-01-21T23:40:28.281+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":":)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miss Luxanna","date":"2016-01-22T00:11:05.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lightmage?

I was under the impression that for every two games you lose, you go down one division, but that does not seem to be true.\n\nIt's the inconsistencies with placements that makes everyone mad, not necessarily where they were placed. Someone who was Gold III the previous season can win nine games and end up in Silver IV while another person can win four and be in Silver I.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pulsefire Seph","date":"2016-01-22T00:07:53.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, I went 9-1.\n\nNINE AND ONE!!\n\nI felt unstoppable, amazing, ecstatic. I was playing against people much higher rank than I was (Gold 2 vs Plat 3/4/5) and I wasn't just \"not losing\" I was absolutely DOMINATING them. Like, 11-1, 14-2, 8-0, insanely good scores. \n\nAfter the 10th game, which I won, it was my moment of truth. And then\n\n\"Congratulations! Based on your performance, you have been demoted an ENTIRE DIVISION down to Silver 1. Get rekt m8.\"\n\nI haven't felt this heartbroken in a long time. It took me so long to get to Gold 2 (was placed silver 4 last season, did terrible in placements, 3/7) and I was climbing so fast the last couple of weeks, from Gold 3 to Gold 2 in one night. It was great.\n\nSeeing that Silver 1 message made me so upset and sad. I just wanted to uninstall right then and there. I can't just \"climb\" back to where I was in one night. I work 40+ hours a week, I don't have time to grind the ladder all day everyday. I work, I have a home, I have things I need to do. \n\nI dunno man, this seems fishy. Doesn't seem right. {{item:3073}}\n\nEveryone keeps saying \"Well if you are good you will climb\" and I understand and agree, but if I keep getting put so far back every season I will never make it to where I really belong, as I simply cannot play enough to get there.
