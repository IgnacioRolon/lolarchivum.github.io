Champs with no armor and small health pools diving turrets and surviving. It just seems like turrets aren't so much weak as they are slow as balls. Like painfully slow to do anything in a game that feels like it is only getting faster in tempo. So many mobility moves are .5 second dashes and blinks. Have you guys experimented with speeding up shots and targeting instead of increasing health and damage? Also shattering defense after 5 shots or something would make it so the 4k health tank can't just tank 20 shots.

Most of the time it's just based on whoever happens to have a mid/top/jung that has a mind to go bot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2017-01-02T18:23:34.027+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fizz Enthusiast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Thjt738p,comment-id=001a000100000000000000050000,timestamp=2017-01-02T10:56:57.749+0000)\n>\n> Nah, I&#x27;m saying mid can follow and if all lanes are losing (ie. enemy bot has priority to push you in + mid can roam without being followed + your jungle doesn&#x27;t have priority) then yeah, you probably have to give up the turret). Bot usually can&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t roam, just has to play a bit more cautiously if they&#x27;re receiving a lot of attention.  \n> \n> I&#x27;ve been Diamond for ~3.5 seasons and an AD main for at least half of it and I can say with great confidence that 4v2 dives get botched a lot more than you&#x27;d think. Sometimes they go for it, then jungle counterganks from a good angle (eg. unseen from lane or gets a good rotation), or top TP&#x27;s behind, or mid just follows - maybe a clutch exhaust from supp, or flash outplay from AD. \n> \n> I agree the situation is not optimal, especially for bot lane agency and perception is definitely that bot is a shit show clown fiesta party, but at the same time, I think there&#x27;s a lot of sensationalism of how dire the situation is. \n> \n> People claiming that you can 4v2 dive full health bot laners at level 2/3 is pretty absurd. As the bot lane players, if you manage to thin out the wave as it&#x27;s pushing into turret, you can stall the dive or make it a lot more risky for them to go for it.  \n> \n> The TLDR is that most of the time, your team has to be pretty far behind for you to be getting 4v2 dived with no recourse or strategical counterplay.\n\nLet me fix this for you.....\n\nIf you play one of our \"Better\" supports.  You can CC them or help your adc not die in a 4v2 because we gave these supports overloaded kits.... (looking at Thresh)\n\nBut if you like other champs rather than the 3 or 4 good supports, then yes you should die on the turret because of you fail in Champ select. \n\nThis is playing into the MAJOR problem of the direction of this game.  A few champs are \"balanced\" at the LCS level.  If you don't like or play those champs then why play the game at all.  It so funny watching people that have no clue about marketing or why people like there game make decisions on it.\n\nIf you make your bronze to plat people happy and balance they will become more involved with the game.  Then will then want to watch the LCS.  Then once more people watch it you can make more $$$ with advertising.  Now when you \"balance\" for the LCS and it screws your base.  Then will become angry and not watch the LCS.  Right now everyone I talk to is almost to the point of not playing or just playing until a new game comes around.  Everyone of Rito post are down voted instantly.  Its almost like they have no clue or don't care what the player base says.\n\nIf you don't want to bring champs to an equal level then just delete the ones instead of giving false hope.  Because right now you are destroying this game.  Its all most funny because this is what happened to WoW.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lucifer","date":"2017-01-01T22:12:01.739+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then you leave and lose the turret FB, Dragon and the game completely snowballs out of control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AMYS GRAVE","date":"2017-01-01T20:33:45.003+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch some streams man, that's not at all close to what is happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oglaf","date":"2017-01-01T20:54:41.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fizz Enthusiast,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Thjt738p,comment-id=001a,timestamp=2017-01-01T19:42:03.980+0000)\n>\n> I think we want to both preserve the sanctity of laning phase as well as allowing for progression in game state. \n> \n> If bot lane is both low, I think it&#x27;s completely appropriate to be able to have a 3v2 dive with the minion wave, kill both and escape. Without the minion wave, should be very difficult. \n> \n> I think if bot is both full health, neither outcome should be guaranteed in a 3v2 (or 4v3) dive (there should be outplay potential on both sides), but in a 4v2 dive, I would expect both players to die. \n> \n> Personally, I think 4v2 dives are very telegraphed and you have ample time to leave if jungle isn&#x27;t there to countergank (or at least ward to prepare and call mid lane to prepare for rotation and get cleanup). \n> \n> I think it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect a turret to defend you from a 4v2 dive with a minion wave (turret would pretty much have to 3 hit KO you), but if defense in a full health 2v3 or 3v4 is failing, that&#x27;s something we can look at.\n\nNobody is really worrying about the lane towers.\n\nIt is the inhibitor, and especially nexus, towers that are utterly pathetic. \n\nThey are not balanced in such a way that they scale up adequately to the items players have at the point in the game where they are likely to get attacked. They can just be face-tanked and melted in seconds. Especially the nexus ones; you don't really need minions to tank them for you, you just need the enemy players to be dead. Then it is game over regardless. They are trivial at best.\n\nEDIT: Downvote why exactly?
