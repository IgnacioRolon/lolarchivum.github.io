Many splash elements, such as the minimap, kill callouts, and scoreboard- **need **to remain as the base splash for gameplay clarity, quicker reads, and so on. \n\n_However_, the big circle next to your abilities doesn&rsquo;t serve any significant gameplay purpose. Sooooo- it&rsquo;s time for another wide-sweeping change!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/v9M6yC3.png\n\nVoila! You&rsquo;ll notice that Arcade Ahri now has her respective skin splash as her portrait, as opposed to Base Ahri, as it is on Live. \n\n**On PBE tomorrow(ish), every single skin will now show its respective splash in this slot (and only this slot). **\n\nAnd that&rsquo;s it- short and sweet. Hit me with any questions and/or feedback you have! You&#039;re all great, and I hope you have a nice day.\n\n-----\n\n**FAQ**!\n**Shouldn't this have been in five years ago or so?**\n\n>Yeah, probably! :D \n\n**Isn't this a feature on ultimate skins? **\n\n>Yeah. We&rsquo;re sensitive to removing that as a unique feature on ultimate skins, but ~800 skins stand to benefit from this. \n\n**Does this impact the minimap, or other gameplay spaces?**\n\n>Nope!\n\n**What if I think the current minimap icons suck though? **\n\n>Well, you&rsquo;re kinda right. They aren&rsquo;t made for that particular space, instead they&rsquo;re teeny crops of huge assets, that are further downscaled. While skins will never have a place on the minimap (see the above reasons), there are changes we&rsquo;re looking at to improve the standard iconography.","replies":[{"poster":"Solari Fortune","date":"2017-07-25T00:45:22.178+0000","up_votes":183,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can Loliipoppy's portrait be the OG Lollipoppy?\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/107a586139c6691a881ce65c8e592d36.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2017-07-25T05:49:53.619+0000","up_votes":99,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look, man.
