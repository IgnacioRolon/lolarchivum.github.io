As we all at Riot Games know, weeding out fun to such a caliber would have widespread catastrophic meltdowns. \n\nAdditionally, during the phases of night when we reset Zilean's clock for DST, a strange phenomenon occurs. It has been seen that many employees start experiencing weird symptoms, such as the strong urge to put on hats, and hide mushrooms. Even those associated with this event have noticed themselves falling into guttural vocal patterns, decrying such things as codes and duty. \n\nFor the sake of everyone at Riot Games, I beg of you: Please do not ask us to stop time.

Maybe I can explain some of the rational behind the changes?\n\nIts hard to describe.. but they just feel really \"dull\" in a sense. I can't quite put my finger on it, but some of the textures just really seem washed out and as if they don't fit at all. Like compare the last caitlyn skin (is that officer caitlyn? ) with the frosted ezreal skin. Caitlyn is incredibly defined where as ezreal looks like he lost a ton of detail with the color choices. Or even the two Morderkaiser skins look washed out.","replies":[{"poster":"Bacon","date":"2014-11-04T10:05:59.966+0000","up_votes":47,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"dullness\" you guys are seeing is them desaturating all of the textures. They're doing it with pretty much every single re-texture so that they better fit the palette of the new SR.\n\nYou may not have noticed it because the new map is beautiful in a lot of ways (being more lifelike and realistic), but it's a LOT less colorful than the current SR. The reason for this is all centered around one of their core design principles - 'clarity'. They want everything (or at least when able) to be easily understandable/readable at first sight and intuitive to anyone watching or playing. This especially applies to those doing so for the first time. \n\nDifferent elements in the game (champions, buildings, terrain, creeps, champs, particles, buffs, objectives, etc..) have varying degrees of visual importance. I think a RIoter has listed it somewhere in full before, but the most important ones to know are that they prioritize particles/abilities over champions and champions take priority over the terrain/map (In terms of saturation). They want abilities to 'pop' in comparison to the map, so that it's very clear what's a skillshot, or aura, or field, etc. so that it's very clear what is affecting what. The idea is that this will make things much easier to understand for LCS viewers and new players, but obviously current players as well. A good comparison would be the reason why we like to shoot fireworks in the night sky, rather than a... sunset over a vibrant mountain range, for example... I don't know. But you get the idea. \n\nAs well as desaturating the new textures, they're also removing lots of the clutter (shadowing, detailing, etc..). Again, this is just for readability. Having really cool detailed textures is cool and all; they're really pretty. But it's kind of just unnecessary 'visual noise' for the average player/viewer. You really only appreciate that stuff when you are zoomed in and/or out of combat. \n\nHere are some quick examples I went and found so you can see what I'm talking about (old ones on the left):\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SXpCP0_e3X8/VCYV6YG58sI/AAAAAAAAZ3E/miKftbHHhHA/s1600/blitz.jpg\n\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pg_9gTr_cR4/U_0ckFNGjbI/AAAAAAAAWKA/pKT4pyBiWDM/s1600/ib2.jpg\n\nIn theory, what they're doing should work. We'll get used to it over time and all of a sudden things will be easier read. There won't be as many of those hectic teamfights where you die and throw your hands up out of confusion and have to check the death recap to find out what killed you (only to have it bug and say that flash did 728 damage to you or something XD). But yeah. And hopefully it will make it easier to use flash to dodge things more effectively, or realize that there's a cupcake trap in that bush before you accidentally ult on it as Kassadin, or to notice a half second earlier that your Riven ult isn't active because you accidentally tried to activate it while in a Soraka pool. - Things like that. Hopefully. \n\nBut yes, I do agree with you guys some of these \"retextures\" do look pretty bad. But it's only because they look more dull. It's only human for us to feel that way. As we get older the cones in our eyes pick up less color (one of the reasons people say the world just seems less vibrant as you age - your senses dull - smell, taste, hearing. But that's a whole different subject). But I can prove it to you. \n\nHere's a picture of some cool snakes: [Snakes](http://i.icap.me/8714150950895832.png)\n\nNow do you want to see what they really look like? [Here](http://i.icap.me/8714150951084449.png)\n\nStill cool, obviously. But kind of depressing when you realize that the real one is more dull in comparison. If you want you can test it out for yourself really easily. Go into your monitor settings and turn the saturation up by 30% or so. Then go about your day for a few hours; play a game of league, watch some anime, etc.. Then revert the saturation. Makes you sad, doesn't it?\n\nSo yeah. That's essentially what Riot's doing. It's visually depressing in comparison. But it's for the better good. We'll get used to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rhyto","date":"2014-11-04T12:49:32.222+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best reply and support for a Rioter. *Fist Bump +1*","replies":[{"poster":"ChimeiTekinaNasu","date":"2014-11-04T16:26:06.163+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"His username is \"Bacon\".

Aside from Ghost Bride, I think all of her skins are in dire need of some love.","replies":[{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2014-11-04T12:51:17.458+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, but I don't think textures are the problem. Models and Animations are really what's killing her.

She looks really clunky, specially If we put her close to the other Piltovers champs like Jayce, Vi and Jinx, they are all good looking, with nice models, animations and high techs, while Caitlyn looks just old and boring. I really think she needs a VU not just to update her but to make her fit more into her character (A respected Sheriff using a miniskirt?) and look more like a Piltover champion too.","replies":[{"poster":"Tapu Fini","date":"2014-11-05T01:19:02.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caitlyn is definitely in line of sight, I saw somewhere, I think it was ironstylus, talking about caitlyn's future appearance.

Most of them give more clarity to the model and make it stand out with the skin's color scheme.\n\nFor example, Amumu's are really nice. His classic green is more toned down and easier on the eyes, and the rest of his skins feel that way as well.\n\nKeep in mind I don't have access to PBE at the moment so all opinions I have on this batch are purely based off of images and not the actual in-game experience.\n\nHere are my thoughts/concerns:\n\n1) {{champion:51}} **Sheriff Caitlyn's hair**. I'm biased because I like her live splash art a lot, but I remember a while back that the model's hair was altered from blue to black, and yet it's blue here in the images. Could we change that to match the splash art? One of the biggest complaints with skins is the disparity between models and splashes, and here it feels significant enough to warrant an edit.\n\n2) {{champion:26}} **Zilean's overall color scheme**. I feel that, across all the skins, there might be a darker tone of brown than is necessary. I could be wrong and maybe the lighter tones don't fit as well on the new SR, but it personally looks like a bit difficult to pick out on the map. Especially when you consider that the live Zilean textures are extremely bright, this will throw people off significantly and I'm not sure if the darker tones are thus the way to go. To point out a couple culprits, Shurima and Time Machine both have tones that I feel could be brightened up. Maybe it's the gloves? I'm not sure.\n\n3) {{champion:79}} **Gragas' skin tone.** This is more due to perspective because of the close-ups, but I feel it's a bit jarring that his skin tone is significantly more subdued. Since all the textures were intended to have less visually cluttering schemes, I can understand why it's more tan (or peach, or beige? I don't know haha). I would like to point out though, that Caitlyn's and Ezreal's skin tones look brighter than Gragas, and that may be why it looks odd to me. Argument against this is that Gragas is substantially more naked than the other two (from the waist up, lest anyone dare imply that's not what I was referring to with the word choice).\n\nOther than, I'm looking forward to the texture changes!

Sheriff, Safari and Resistance Caitlyn splash arts all have brown hair, and even the old main splash had it too. And honestly I like the brown/black hair a lot more than blue, I think it fits a lot better. Specially Sheriff Caitlyn because that blue is too light.","replies":[]}]}]}
