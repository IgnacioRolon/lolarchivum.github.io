{"poster":"Ququroon","date":"2017-04-18T20:14:07.180+0000","title":"Midseason Update - Utility Contribution","subforum":"Dev Corner","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all!\n\nIn the [Intro to Midseason](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/intro-midseason-2017) we talked about highlighting the contribution of non-carry roles in League. This is the first step of many towards this goal, and it&rsquo;s aimed at making supports and tankier champions feel more rewarded and recognized for their actions. It also comes with the added benefit of improving tactical clarity for both players and viewers.\n\nThese features are currently on PBE, but we&#039;d love to hear your feedback all the same!\n\n**Crowd Control Name Display:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WuIErsl.png\n\nBy giving CC states a more in-your-face treatment, we hope that players and viewers will be better able to track the flow of a fight and help teammates figure out when to follow up or turn tail. While CC is already appreciated when noticed, this new display works to improve that feedback loop so everyone can bask in the light of a 5 man Leona ult.\n\nThe system follows a strict prioritization to deal with situations where multiple CC types are applied to a champion - after all, if you&rsquo;re airborne or suppressed, being blinded as well is the least of your problems.\n\n**End of Game Stats:**\n\nWe&rsquo;re getting more relevant stats onto the End of Game screen! Again, this is only our first offering - expect more in the future.\n\n* **Crowd Control Score**, a sum of all the CC effects applied to champions during the game - hard cc is weighted higher than soft cc.\n* **Vision Score**, a calculation of contributed vision over the course of the game - further details to come.\n* **Damage Dealt to Structures**, the amount of damage dealt to towers/inhibitors/nexus.\n* **Damage Mitigated on Self**, the amount of damage a champion reduced or blocked, through abilities or shields\n\nPlease note that these stats are still in process of being implemented, as will have more updates as the PBE cycle continues. \n\n**Better Item Feedback:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D98mz8R.png\n\nHave you ever found yourself wishing how much damage you&rsquo;ve blocked with your Locket? This change will add more of these stats onto active items, so you can better evaluate how well you&rsquo;re using them.\n\nPlease note this feature will not be showing on PBE for a couple of days, as we put in the remaining work to get it ready.\n\n**Spell Attribution:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HNBVkHg.png\n\nHave you ever been drive-by ignited, or you think you heard your lane opponent pop heal, but you&rsquo;re not sure? We&rsquo;re adding a new VFX trail from caster to target on most summoner spells and active items to make those moments clearer. There&rsquo;s a visual for both enemies and allies, so it should be easier to discern who cast what in a skirmish.\n\n**Death VFX:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qlcgIwm.png\n\nOur old death VFX (for those who noticed it), was slow and subtle. We are updating the effect for both enemies and allies to be snappy and more noticeable so the flow of a fight is more clearly communicated.\n\n**Active Item HUD:**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/B9EGZha.png\n\nActive items often contain a lot of power and gold-efficiency of an item, which is great when you remember to cast it, and awful when you don&rsquo;t. This change adds a thicker and more prominent border to our major activatables, separate from consumables and trinkets.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-04-18T20:18:01.802+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"I want the game to yell **PENTASSIST** when I give my Vayne that gets a Pentakill a Relic Shield heal.

Will people actually get more exposure to those cc names now?\n\nWe are going pretty coarse with this pass. For the short term these are represented as: Entangled -> Rooted bc you can cast abilities, Polymorph -> Silenced, Grounded is not represented, Nearsight is not represented. We will almost certainly be adding these post-launch in addition to new states such as the different flavors of channeling (Interruptible from damage, CC, etc.) and defense shreds.\n\nWhy? To be frank this stuff can be messy under the hood and with limited time it was more valuable for us to focus on the broadly encountered CC types than the special snowflakes - especially knowing that we are planning on swooping back around and adding more.\n\n\n> Will we be provided with that cc priority list? While it&#x27;s pretty clear supression trumps almost everything (maybe not stasis), it&#x27;s less clear if say, teemo blind is a bigger deal than a quinn nearsight.\n\nWe can share it, but I'm more interested in how the prioritization feels in real game scenarios - if it feels off, we will re-evaluate and make changes.\n\n\n> Are the various new end of game stats going to impact our mastery grading? Might they be things that already were considered but we just weren&#x27;t shown, or were they simply not tracked at all, but might be added to grading now that it is available?\n\nCan't commit to that, but I will say that I like the idea and I'll make sure to ping the right people.\n\n\n> Will we know how the calculations for vision/cc are actually done, or will it remain a behind the scenes calculation left for players to try to figure out?\n\nYes, Riot GMang will have a break down for you guys soon.\n\n\n> Who is the damage mitigated on self stat really aimed at? It seems to me it&#x27;s basically just braum, with almost every other shielding support focused on shielding *others*, rather than shielding themselves and body blocking.\n\nIt's abilities and items so it'll be a fun bragging stat for Tanky fuckers like Alistar or unkillable monsters like Malphite and Sion.\n\n\n> Will the damage mitigated to self stat interact with yasuo wind wall? it&#x27;s an ability that blocks a lot of potential damage, but theres also no garauntee that any skillshot projectiles it stops would have actually hit yasuo.\n\nI don't think so.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-04-18T23:34:38.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The initial description for the damage mitigated stat says abilities and shields, and you just said abilities and items.
