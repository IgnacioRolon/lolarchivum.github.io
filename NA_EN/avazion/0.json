Defeats the purpose imo\nYeah, you see, unlike morgana, rito wanted spell shields to be weak against the ADC overlords. so they made it so that, unlike morgana, spell shields only nullified the damage check. \n\nMost CC projectile skills go;\nProjectile: Hit/miss\nIf hit apply CC\nIf miss do not apply CC\n\nthats why morgs shield blocks 90% of all CCs.","replies":[]}]}
