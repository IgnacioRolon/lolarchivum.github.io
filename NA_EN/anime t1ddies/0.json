The situation in bot jungle is now 3v5, with them having the 5. I, the jungler, and our adc huddle under tower while our support walks merrily into their entire team and gets insta-rekt. From this point on it becomes increasingly evident that our support was either trolling or just extremely new to the game: i.e. taking cs from the adc, charging headfirst into 1v3&#039;s, trying to tank minion aggro, and just being an all around anchor. On top of this the other team was mopping the floor with us, so we tried to surrender, but the alleged troll and their duo-queue partner wouldn&#039;t let that happen. \r\n\r\nThe game continued with them slowly demolishing us because we had let them get a considerable lead, and while we were able to secure a few small victories here and there they didn&#039;t add up to much, and before long we had pretty much given up the game and joined our trolling support in their endeavors. Granted, we probably could&#039;ve turned the game around and won if we had tried, but none of us cared enough to do so; it was just a normal match, we were extremely behind, and to me (and the rest of my team, apparently) just screwing around and losing the game would&#039;ve been more fun than going through hell just for one victory that wouldn&#039;t even matter if we didn&#039;t have fun in the process.\r\n\r\nWith 5 people just screwing around it didn&#039;t take long for the match to end, not that it bothered me, but what did bother me about the whole ordeal was that a couple of players on the other team straight up reported us and insisted that by trolling and throwing the game we were being toxic, so I wanted to discuss it. Were we really in the wrong here? We weren&#039;t enjoying the game playing it the normal way so we started playing it in a way we did enjoy that also didn&#039;t affect too heavily the experience of anyone else (at least not on our team); is adherence to an arbitrary code of honor more important than having fun? Just looking for different peoples&#039; opinions here.\r\n\r\nP.S. If you&#039;re wondering how a feeding support can ruin a game I have one word for you: Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2016-09-04T02:24:10.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing ahri ADC earlier in a blindpick (why not?) and carrying the hell out of a supertilted katarina (something like 6/12, was 0/4 by 6 minutes).\n\nEvery 80 seconds or so, kat would /all some salt about how i was throwing the game, find someone to shunpo onto, and die.\n\nWe lost, i got an S, kat got reported for intentionally feeding, i got reported for intentionally feeding, trolling, being extremely toxic, and at that point the limit of three report categories probably kicked in.\n\nTL;DR Most trolling in norms is done by some teenybaby that thinks someone else is trolling, usually because they are three times their rank and not following orders.","replies":[{"poster":"Anime T1ddies","date":"2016-09-04T03:07:28.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand where you're coming from, but what about those other semi-rare instances where the 'troll' in question is 0/6 by 10 minutes and not communicating at all, and the rest of the team is too apathetic and/or not gud enough to carry them? \n\nAdmittedly I'm Bronze 20 garbage, and the point of this has nothing to do with anyone's skills. I could care less if we lost that game even if we were actually trying to win, and that would still be true if we lost in spite of that, or if I had more deaths than I had ranked wins (which I did), but what bothered me was the fact that somebody thought what we were doing was so wrong they had to let us know about it every minute or so in game and even report us for it. \n\nStrange as it may sound I actually did enjoy trying to sneak my way into their base on a top secret mission to infiltrate their fountain, or dancing in front of a wave of freshly spawned super minions (also in their base), or any other silliness I could come up with, instead of actually playing the game. Call me immature, a sore loser, etc., but am I really in the wrong here for prioritizing fun over winning?\n\nOn a side note, ADC Soraka can be pretty fun if that's what you're into; nobody expects the 800 damage crit banana...","replies":[{"poster":"StarTorched","date":"2016-09-04T05:01:01.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soraka can work pretty damn well as ADC.
