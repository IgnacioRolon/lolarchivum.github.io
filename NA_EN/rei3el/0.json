I tried the windows time syncing and it didn't work. and to get all of these because some trolls are premade and decide to report you, I don't know but I think riot should put a little work on the report system instead of just releasing skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-01-22T21:23:53.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, troll reports don't affect anything, since a report flags an account or match for review, rather than forcing action blindly. The Leaverbuster system works on its own and will detect inactivity or disconnections by itself. The endless queue issue you're experiencing is most likely caused by a poor connection to the PvP.net service, which is in charge of notifying you of queue pops and keeping your client communicating with our matchmaking services. These poor connection are typically a result of specific network settings that don't play well with League, so I recommend working through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).\n\nLet me know if this resolved your issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
