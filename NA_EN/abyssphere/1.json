You took a champion with very light particles and gave her a skin tier that suits her, only giving her a particle on her R because obviously it features her weapon, which is a changed model. If this was a 975 RP skin it would almost certainly suck because it&#039;s really hard to give a champion like Irelia noticeable particles so that the skin feels worth it. But 750 RP fits perfectly.\r\n\r\nCan we get more 750 skins for champs who actually naturally fit the tier? After the Syndra fiasco it feels like skins like this (another example, the Sivir, Nautilus and Warwick skins recently) should be complimented for making sense. Certain champs just better fit into certain price tiers and I&#039;m glad Irelia got a great skin that is just right for her.","replies":[{"poster":"Inphernal","date":"2015-05-21T02:21:45.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"being stuck in a low skin-tier is a bad thing because it signifies bad and inflexible design and cheaper skins are intentionally lower in quality due to time  spent designing/creating the skins as well as subtle techniques used to devalue the skin such as lots of browns/low contrast between colors.\n A good design is flexible and has many available places to add significantly more thematically diverse designs while maintaining the silhouette and identity of the character.

A good example of this would be the champion Nautilus\n\nI think unflexible design doesn't necessarily signify bad design on a champion. It's just a thing that happens with champs whose skills are almost entirely melee-based or generally lacking in particles. Naut is a good example of a champ who can get lots of different skills because his E and R are both ranged, particle-heavy abilities, and his shield obviously has some too. But Irelia has a steroid, a dash, a melee-range ability and one ranged ability with particles. It's just kind of natural that it's hard to make skins of 975+ tier for her, no?\n\nIt's not great for a champ to be stuck in a low (or high) tier because obviously it limits options but I'd rather a variety of well-made 750 skins for champs like Irelia than a really poor attempt at giving her a 975+ skin that will just end up disappointing everyone because she is at the end of the day poorly suited to a skin with particles.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-05-21T16:40:51.117+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hiya! \n\nGlad to hear you're happy with upcoming skin content!

Urf the Nami-tee is a good example, since her base particles fit in really nicely with the new skin's thematic.\n\nYou're right with the last point, I should have clarified! I think particle-heavy champs absolutely can get lower tier skins, you just need to be a lot more careful with the skin concepts you choose. Nami's April Fool's Day skin is a really good example because it's the same Nami, just dressed in a funny costume - there isn't much of any reason to expect new particles and honestly it'd be difficult to think of Urf-themed particles for most of her abilities. 750 RP is a perfect match. But when it comes to \"fantasy-changing\" skins, particle-heavy champs do tend to need the higher tiered skins because their base particles can clash with the new model if unchanged.\n\nA good example of that is looking at the two Marauder skins - Warwick's model changed hugely to make him really sinister but because he has so few particles and what he does have are really ambiguous particles, there was no clashing. Ashe on the other hand got a lot of negative reception because she was still shooting standard frosted Freljord arrows despite now being an evil crusader. Then you can look at the Order of the Lotus skins - Irelia is perfect for 750 for the same reasons Warwick was good with Marauder, but Karma suited 975 for the same reason people thought Ashe deserved to be a higher skin tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2015-05-21T20:32:47.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG THAT SPLASH ART FOR IRELIA.\n\nNow I have to buy it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linna Excel","date":"2015-05-21T19:39:03.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri's particles probably don't have to be changed for a 750 skin as midnight shows.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reaper Review","date":"2015-05-21T22:36:15.387+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, wait, we're saying Syndra having one 750 skin is a fiasco when Ezreal exists?
