This is... actually a somewhat commonly held belief amongst the player base. Personally I think it's fine - Sona is *the* poke/sustain support and I don't see why that can't be her identity, but admittedly it's a hard style to lane against. So I won't argue with Riot nerfing her poke/sustain.\r\n\r\n**However**, my problem is the way in which Riot is going about balancing her. If her poke and infinite sustain is too annoying then why, instead of making it weak to the point where her and her ADC will be out-damaged/out-healed, don't Riot just use her other gate besides health to stop her staying in lane indefinitely? That gate is *mana*. Sona has already taken a hit to her mana with her W's mana cost raised but Q has a somewhat low mana cost, that could scale upwards better. How about 45/50/55/60/65 being changed to 50/60/70/80/90? She runs out of mana quicker than before, but still does what she did. You're not removing her strength (poke/sustain) but removing her ability to do it indefinitely through greater mana gating. Sounds fair to me. Problem is, her mana costs might be *too* high then. So why not reduce the costs on her non-sustain abilities? Song of Celerity costs a lot of mana for a rather blah abiliity, why not reduce its cost? Crescendo too has an odd mana cost - most ultimate abilities that scaled up in mana cost have been changed to flat (most notably, Nami's Tidal Wave). Reduce Crescendo's mana cost to the standard 100 at all ranks and with a cheaper Song of Celerity she's less punished for using her less \"oppressive\" abilities, while still encouraged not to spam her Q/W.\r\n\r\n**My other problem is that Sona gets nothing in return for her nerfs.** Thinking her poke and sustain are unhealthy is fair enough but instead of just weakening that (i.e directly nerfing a support most pros think is horrendously outclassed as is), why don't you just transfer the power to more healthy parts of her kit? Song of Celerity is almost universally thought of as underpowered, her auras are honestly pretty weak and her E Power Chord is somewhat poor.\r\n\r\ntl;dr - the only reason Sona ever gets picked right now is because of her poke and sustain. If you want to nerf that then there are better ways to do it (greater mana gating) AND she needs to be given something back to have any reason to be picked. Buff her auras, buff her Power Chord, reduce mana costs/CDs on her E/R, whatever. But right now Sona's being stripped of the only thing she has going for her and she's being given nothing she needs to compete in return. This is a horrible balancing method that leads to people like Zilean diving to 43% winrate and then being ignored after. Don't let it happen to Sona.","replies":[{"poster":"Urdnot Entar","date":"2014-12-20T20:46:34.576+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot needs to rethink a **lot** of things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyrokineticmage","date":"2014-12-20T21:20:49.422+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sure Sona pokes are strong and her sustain is decent but she is also the squishiest champion designed.

I just think that if Riot does insist on nerfing her poke/sustain then they could at least be smarter about it. She really needs at least some compensation because her numbers just keep getting worse.\n\nThe funny thing is I agree about how you're meant to play against her (and why she's fun).

It's true some people really don't like it, but I think that's exacerbated by a general distaste for the rework, how ive been poorly engaged with the community, and Cassiopeia's overall weak state. So im trying to solve all those problems first and isolate the passive as the only variable, while simultaneously trying to improve it.\n\n> But yes, while we have high hopes yet, we won't keep something in the game thats universally hated.\n\nThis is a comment from Stashu from his \"Latest on Cassiopeia\" thread. This is the comment that I think really needs to be held to with regard to Sona.\n\nFrom the Sona rework summary:\n\n>    Essentially, we took Sona to the update board because we saw a unique opportunity to make her more rewarding and more fun. She wasn’t terribly strong or weak, but her kit clearly lacked high moments and overall satisfaction. We wanted to keep her theme as it was and retain her awesome Crescendo while giving her basic abilities a more visible and tangible impact. Oh, and if we could sneak in some fancy texture updates in the process (and we could!), then all the better.\n> \n> So what’s changed? Well, Sona’s gameplay now revolves more around moments of power. Instead of hanging back and winning a war of attrition during laning, Sona’s now got the kit to power up her allies and save their lives when a fight turns against them. Auras are smaller and more visible now, so getting the most of them requires great positional awareness for Sona and coordination with her allies. This allows us to reward great play with much more impact for each of her songs. You’ll be able to make plays as Sona, earn your team kills and save lives with clutch ability casts and smart positioning. At the same time, the enemy team has larger windows to fight back in thanks to her longer cooldowns, adding in clarity and counterplay to Sona’s kit. We can't wait to see what players can do with her update. \n\nTo start I'll ignore the more fun business because that's subjective. Personally I thought she was a lot of fun before. More rewarding is easy to touch on though. If she's more rewarding, similar actions should have more effect. To counter that, the actions were made more difficult to accomplish. (350 range aura instead of 1000 and shorter effect durations) So, are Sona's abilities more rewarding?\n\nPower cord scaling is identical. Both per level and the AP ratio is the same.\n\nQ: \nThe base ability damage took a nerf, staccato damage took a massive nerf (It's even getting nerfed again in the current PBE cycle), and the break even point for the on-hit damage assuming max rank Q and R is 5 auto attacks, but that ignores the fact that it no longer boosts ability use at all. So AP and AD casters don't get benefit to their abilities anymore. Only AAs. It also ignores the difficulty of use. It's nothing to fit your whole team in 1000 range, I don't even think it's possible to fit a whole team in the 350 range aura, in practical play. Additionally, R2 Q used to be worth a full set of AD marks, which would help ADC last hitting a great deal. Current Sona doesn't have that potential.\n\nSummary: All effects are lesser, while additionally being more difficult to actually utilize to their fullest potential. There is no possible way this could be considered more rewarding.\n\nW:\nHeal is stronger at ranks 4 and 5, and more effective on damaged allies. Shield can provide similar effective health points, with high AP, but has half duration. At max rank W with max R and assuming 320AP (Generous I think) Shield will give 209 x (1 + (Target armor/100)) EHP for 1.5s Activating old W would give Target Health x .2 EHP for 3s and Target Health x .1 EHP for as long as Sona stayed in that stance. Meaning old W's mitigation scaled more with champion levels and ally items then Sona's items which was great for a gold starved support. \n\nSummary: The healing could be either way, old or new. Yes you can currently \"Make plays\" with a boosted heal, but the mitigation trade is definitely not in Sona's Favor. Similar mitigation values at high AP, requires strong itemization from Sona to be as effective, and drastically lesser duration on the full effect make this another ability that cannot be considered more rewarding. Looks flashy, but provides dramatically lesser effect.\n\nE: \nBuff to Sona, nerf to allies and minions. Tempo is identical. Necessary change to allow Sona to tag allies with other auras. Basically just lets her become a race car and escape trouble or lengthen aura durations by tagging. Is what it is. Though fast minions was cool. \n\nR:\nSame, but scales other abilities as well. More rewarding for that fact, but then there's Nami, who's ult also hard CC's (Unaffected by tenacity), also soft CC's, Same base damage but better AP scaling, and 100mana at all ranks vs 100 +50/rank for Crecendo shorter cooldown at earlier ranks, and it's got about 6x the area. Tidal wave may be slower, but if I can land a Morgana Q or Blitz grab, Imma hit a Tidal Wave with 10x bigger hurtbox. Too much of her power budget is tied in this ability without respect for the relative power of similar abilities.\n\nBasicallly her Q and W have less impact than the old versions which is contrary to the stated goal. Her E has a larger impact to herself, but less to her allies which allows her to attempt to tag allies with other auras, which is needed due to their tragically short range. Her gameplay is flashier, but mostly due to GFX buffs. She doesn't feels stronger than she used to due to the fact that even her activated abilities are weaker or nearly the same, not just the auras.\n\nIt's interesting to see a much weaker kit get nerfed as often as Sona has been lately, considering the original kit \"...wasn’t terribly strong or weak\". To me that statement reads balanced. Amazingly she went from a balanced kit that was seen as too boring, to a weaker kit that's flashier, but incapable of being strong  in a healthy way, and drawing repeated nerfs.\n\nThe current kit isn't as strong as the old kit, but from my observation, it can be more oppressive. Which is strange. The old kit \"wasn’t terribly strong or weak\". It had a base power floor in the non-scaling auras, that was perfect for a gold-starved support. The power ceiling was high though, due her kit having a strange scaling mechanism through her power chord/lich bane path. Her support build and lane build were sufficientally different enough that lane Sona didn't dominate as a support. It's exactly what they're trying to figure out how to do with Morgana. Right now, Lane and support Sona are too similar as both her Floor and ceiling scale with items. \n\nIMO the best thing to do would be to combine the efforts. Take the new GFX and mix them into the old kit. Flashy presentation with a stronger and healthier kit while showing that Riot learns from and fixes their mistakes. This rework was a mistake. It rewards Sona less than the old kit for the same actions while being more obnoxious to use. Some people liked the more passive playstyle, let them have it, especially when it's an overall healthier kit, and similar kits exist that are less passive (Nami).\n\nSona was the first champ I got, and I'd hate to see her kit weakened over and over, and all because of a kit rework she didn't need, ends up making less healthy, and wasn't even well received.","replies":[{"poster":"Pika310","date":"2014-12-24T03:08:43.060+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"A perfect analysis, I have nothing more of significance to add.

They're exempt.  The reason behind it?  Dashes.  And dashes look better for muh esupurts.  Honestly it's making me sick.  Riot either is extremely ignorant or is flat out lying to us because Nami does the same thing, except better.  I don't even play Sona,  I occasionaly took her mid with Lich Bane, but this is just stupid.  I have long since lost faith in Riot's balance department, and to be honest, they need to burn it down and start it over again, because they have proven time and time again that they do not know how to balance their game.","replies":[{"poster":"Junkο","date":"2014-12-20T23:49:46.306+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":3,"body":"She is not Olaf tier, she is still fairly decent.\n\nShe will be soon if RIot keeps going in the direction they are going with her though..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Wild AP Sona","date":"2014-12-25T00:50:03.734+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Takhuan","date":"2014-12-21T06:12:30.275+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel bad.

I think in Season 3, Riot nerfed Garen's Courage Passive changing it to 20% of bonus armor/magic resist rather than 20% of total armor/magic resist. The main thing Garen had going for him was the ability to rush damage items early while still being pretty tanky, and I think they said they liked that attribute about him, but later on they just dumbed it down even though he wasn't really too difficult to beat while he had it.\n\nI think it took something like 14 Armor and 10 Magic Resist off of his Lv.18 stats, which you kind of just wonder *why* that was even necessary. It ended up happening because players didn't want to learn how to deal with him and would rather have him nerfed so he wasn't used much at all anymore. (Although he wasn't used a ton before anyway) The problem lied in the current itemization available and wasn't really related to his current kit itself. Sona's item that's causing a nerf like this is likely Lich Bane.\n\nI think the same thing might be going around here, but who knows.
