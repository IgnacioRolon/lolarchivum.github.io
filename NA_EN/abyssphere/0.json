What he did to Cassiopeia's playerbase was wrong and until he at least apologises for that he can't complain about how he gets treated. He should not be posting on these boards right now if he's not going to address the people who have been begging him to talk to them for over half a year now.\n\nI hate saying stuff like this but seeing Stashu posting on here is genuinely infuriating. To waltz onto the boards after such a long absence after leaving in such an extraordinarily unacceptable way (his last posts were GIANT promises to Cass players that he would make her a poison mage once more and would get back to us soon on his work) is absolutely ridiculous. The man has no sympathy for the players he mistreated, and he deserves to be reminded of what he did.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cerbearus","date":"2015-07-21T23:10:57.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"MB for wanting a duelist to require reflexes","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-07-21T23:20:38.676+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your bad for assuming everyone has 0 ping when playing this game with only west coast servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Scolipede","date":"2015-07-22T00:12:23.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or that everyone and their moms can afford an Alienware mega-tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-07-22T00:15:38.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"come again?\n\nLoL can be run on a toaster practically.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Scolipede","date":"2015-07-22T00:19:05.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't the struggles of 20fps...","replies":[{"poster":"Durzaka","date":"2015-07-22T00:32:56.415+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually barely maintained 30fps when i first started LoL.\n\nI was also using an intergrated graphics card and terrible set up.\n\nThe only more PC friendly game I can think of besides LoL is WoW.

Play it and see if it feels right to you too.\n\nOh, no, trust me, I understand the mechanical reasoning behind it perfectly well. From a pure gameplay and mechanics standpoint, you guys approached each of these problems fairly reasonably (team-wide benefits keep her from being too \"selfish\" a champ, having a heal rather than something that directly kills people makes her less snowball-y and gives her some fallback, squishy melee characters usually like heals unless they're Yasuo and can kill everyone before they need any, etc.). It's just that there's more to the puzzle than that--it's like finishing one side of a Rubic's cube just to turn it over and find that all the other sides are still scrambled.  \n\nIn a lot of the work I do, whether it's redesigns or any of my [more original work](http://rfmelley.wix.com/portfolio#!original/cghg), I am constantly tasked with filling in holes and guiding gameplay in ways that are both healthy and natural--natural being one of the key words, here. When any kit is under the microscope, I always find it best to establish a clear, niche goal for that character (which is mostly informed by theme and appearance) and build everything around that. With Fiora, here, we have a duelist--someone who specializes in one-on-one fights, to the point where her father assisting in one of her duels is a great point of personal shame for her--and yet her defining contribution to her team greatly favors huge, crowded teamfights.\n\nAnd in general, I think one of the greatest downfalls behind this kit was the mindset behind approaching her as a champion that will be playable in League matches--**it's working under the assumption that all games can and should be defined by big clustered-up teamfights**, that every champion should have a big tool that throws something new into one of those crazy messes, that exploring other strategies through champion kit design might rock the boat or result in a dud. \n\nHowever, if there's anything I've learned from playing a good few hundred games of Heroes of the Storm, it's that even in a much faster-paced and more co-operation driven game, not everything boils down to throwing two teams at each other. You've got heroes like Abathur who prefer breaking the enemy team up (since he adds 0.5 to individual ally heroes rather than being a present 1 himself, and constant 1.5 vs 1s are better than 4.5 vs 5s), or those like Zagara and Gazlowe who are generally lackluster in teamfights but can apply amazing map pressure and contribute to their team through objectives. In Fiora's case, this could be equated to being that one hero you pick because someone on the enemy team is going to constantly solo objectives while their team stalls and you need someone to poke a few holes in them, or when you need someone who can break the enemy team up because she can pressure their toplane while everyone else is fighting over jungle objectives, and the enemy team knows they'll have to send two because duels are what Fiora's made for. **In other words, players should want to pick Fiora because they want a Grand Duelist, not a walking health pack. **\n\nOn many other characters and archetypes, this would've made perfect sense and exist as a great and flavorful addition to their kit. Aatrox just took that guy down? \"Let's all get back in the fight! I think we can turn this battle around!\" Warwick just went to town on some juicy carry? \"Alpha wolf just secured our prey, let us feast!\" Having Fiora be this big teamfighting powerhouse is like being in a fencing/boxing/MMA match and having all your mates flood the stage because you got in a really nice blow and then helping you take down your next four opponents. Not the coolest thing you could have on a duelist! It helps a lot if you think of it cinematically--think about any cool fencing duel you've seen in a show or movie (Princess Bride almost immediately comes to mind), and then try to imagine how those effects would be represented, and if they'd make that scene better or worse. Would Inigo's final fight be cooler if Fezzik came in and bashed the other guy on the head? Probably not!\n\nAlso, out of curiosity, do you know exactly the thought process behind the E? It's not too out-of-the blue, but it does seem a little bland, and during testing, I didn't really see much use for it beyond \"it does damage\" (which a lot of things do) and having the small slow sort of help position for weak point poking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CyberDarius","date":"2015-07-22T16:34:41.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotScruffy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=jz2oAKqv,comment-id=000a000300050000,timestamp=2015-07-22T05:09:10.275+0000)\n>\n> It actually fits quite well with the rest of the ult, I'll explain.

If you use R only for the heal you are missing out on a ton of damage from the 4 free procs. Burning an ult cooldown for an easier heal and no damage seems like it won't become the primary use case.\n\nIf the AOE heal zone is as fight changing as you claim it is (and it seems like it is, with 100 heal per second to multiple targets), then taking someone out early and setting up that zone around dragon or baron can basically guarantee you that objective. Depends on the duration and the CD, but I can see Fiora jungle basically forcing objectives just so she can assassinate one person and set up her unkillable zone of baron taking.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Frosted Otter","date":"2015-07-21T20:45:38.540+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd think of it more as: Fiora wins a duel boosting the morale of her team thereby healing them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DynamiteGazelle","date":"2015-07-21T23:35:00.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isn't the whole point of a duelist is that they dominate 1v1s (aka \"duels\") at the cost of team utility? \n\nNow you're giving her strong 1v1 potential AND an ult that can potentially heal your team for OVER 1000 HP in a large area?
