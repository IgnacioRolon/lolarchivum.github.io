I just thought people would like to see the statistics. At the end of the day most of what is discussed on this board is just opinion, so giving people some actual info to dig into is a nice change.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-05-01T14:50:39.443+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually, win rates tend to drop significantly for the first few days after a rework or new champion release, even if the champion itself is still really powerful (such as with the {{champion:38}} rework a while back, for example, or even the {{champion:14}} overhaul). From my limited experience playing {{champion:13}} , I think he may actually receive pretty significant nerfs to some of his abilities, namely his E (it can take out half a melee top laner's health in one hit). Overall, I think he's in a good state, and while I'd like his Q damage to be buffed a little, he seems to be fairly strong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GundayMonday","date":"2015-05-01T14:31:07.928+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The one guy I saw playing Ryze yesterday didn't even know the rework was happening.

I would suggest something like making subsequent hits with his Q increase the damage it deals for X seconds, stacking a few times.
