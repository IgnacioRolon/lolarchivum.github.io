Ever since then everything but league works perfectly. The second the game actually starts, like I'm at the fountain, it crashes my entire laptop and I have to take my battery out just to get it to turn off. Nothing else is broken on my laptop at all. I tried re downloading league. I uninstalled the update. What else is there to do especially since everything else works perfectly and now I have a 20 minute wait ban because your game thinks I'm quitting when it's actually destroying my laptop.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-09-06T18:22:03.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same problem with the new Windows 10 update!\n\nif you right click the League application and select \"Test Compatibility\" it will run a diagnostic and fix the problem for you!\n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-06T16:18:18.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A recent Windows 10 update has been causing a crashing issue for some players.
