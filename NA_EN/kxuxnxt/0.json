However, as soon as I get in the game, all of these types of shortcuts stop working. This is also the same with Ctrl+Alt+PgDn which is used to change song on winamp. Is there any way of getting this sorted out so anytime I want to change song or the volume I don't have to alt+tab out of the game? Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-03T23:58:25.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really interesting to hear, as I'm able to use function keys to perform those tasks.  You may need to run both League as well as the program that enables those functions as Admin.  Having those permissions set should get it through.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
