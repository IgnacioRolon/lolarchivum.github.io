Same mistakes happen, people are still indifferent to knowing good build paths or skill maxing order or runes etc, which means that they are not doing the maximum of what their character can do.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, what do you people recognise as Intentional feeding or bad plays in general? For me, it&#039;s a lot of things. For one, it&#039;s the obvious &quot;running down mid&quot;. But moving away from trolls, let&#039;s talk about real things.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I can&#039;t stand when people play a champion with bad runes, bad items etc. I just can&#039;t. For example, with the new runes update, I had some friends who were &quot;bored&quot; to read through the changes so they just picked whatever seemed close to the old ways and went with that. To me, that should be punishable. You are intentionally taking on a non-optimal rune, thus putting behind yourself and therefore the team. Same goes for itemization. People are &quot;bored&quot; to read what this new item does or if it fits the playstle of their champion or the team. For example, a Locket is a VERY USEFUL item when it comes to teamfighting, to the point that if one team has it and the other doesn&#039;t, then the team what does not will probably lose the fight. Therefore, building a Locket somewhere down the line is almost mandatory, especially if you have an appropriate champion to do so (tanks / supports). So, not building one as a Taric support should be punishable. It&#039;s such a good item what can win you a game. I can compare it to something like not using your Orianna R to set up a good fight. \r\n\r\nSame can be said about Summoner Spells (lack of an Exhaust vs an assassin), skill order etc. There is almost no reason to max E on Sivir for example, and doing so is probably gonna lose you the lane and probably even the game.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing about all these is that it&#039;s not mechanical skill. It doesn&#039;t require you to have fast fingers, precise clicking or fast reactions. It doesn&#039;t need you to be able to have the game sense to predict or whatever else. It&#039;s just basic game knowledge that EVERYONE can and should have. And I&#039;m not talking about spending hours on end on wiki and probuilds and pro streamers to see what&#039;s best (even though it&#039;s a really good way), no, I&#039;m talking about getting to know basic stuff. Just like how important Locket is for example. Things that do not take a lot of time or effort or skill to implement in your game, but they make a huge difference. Instead of practicing for perfect CSing 5 hours a day, it would probably be better to know what is the best itemization you can have, best rune setup etc.\r\n\r\nI guess what I&#039;m trying to say is that knowledge is power, and in 2018, not having knowledge is not acceptable. There are way too much sources where you can get knowledge for the game, even just basic stuff if you don&#039;t really wanna dive into it. I don&#039;t know if lack of knowledge should be punishable or not, but what I DO know is that you can&#039;t really complain about the guy who didn&#039;t use his ultimate in a fight or didn&#039;t use his flash or didn&#039;t land a skillshot, when you yourself didn&#039;t do your own part to help your team the best way possible.\r\n\r\nThere is the &quot;active&quot; part of helping your team (mechanics, game sense etc) and then there is the passive (game knowledge). You can&#039;t be an &quot;active god&quot;, but you can gain knowledge. Get your &quot;passive&quot; skills high because you can, and worry about &quot;active&quot; skills later on, because you might not be able to get better on them. Get your baseline to where it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Espy Psyche","date":"2018-01-21T19:26:49.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Just no. What you want to do is ban everyone from playing League who isn't already good enough (but not just \"anyone who isn't already good enough\", more like \"anyone who doesn't follow your exceptionally narrow definiton of how to correctly play the game\").\n\nNote that this requires use of resources from outside the game and outside Riot's control. This is also not permissible -- it allows for players to be deceived by bad advice from outside the game where Riot cannot regulate it so that said players can get banned. Realize that Riot has actual enemies that would love for players to be banned unjustly from League of Legends.\n\nThe most obvious beneficiary of unjust bans from LoL are companies that also have MOBAs: Blizzard (Heroes of the Storm), Hi-Rez Studios (Smite) and Valve (DOTA 2). However, other companies would also benefit because most players don't play one genre of game. I play League, but I also play Hearthstone, DC Universe Online, World of Warplanes, and Overwatch. Blizzard, Daybreak Entertainment, and Wargaming would love for me to be unjustly banned from League because I would spend more time (and probably more money) playing their games instead.\n\nIt would be easy for such companies to put together sites that peddle false information on what the \"best\" builds and runes are. They also have the cash to make them look polished and easy to navigate, and to drive the traffic up. They would even sponsor streamers to peddle their wares for them. They would make all that money back in the waves of players who are banned from League for following their guides, because those players will come play their games.\n\nAdditionally, the sites we all know already (LoLKing, OP.GG, etc.) would realize very quickly that their sites were actually required for people to be allowed to play League. What would they do? Go to pay-to-read. They would nickel and dime people at every page because they know that their information is crucial to being permitted to play the game at all. Do you want to have to pay $0.99 for every OP.GG page independent of each other, with a $99.99/mo option for \"unlimited\" page views?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat all being said, I don't want people to intentionally be useless.\n\nI use the \"AP Garen Rule\" for how to know if someone is trolling with their builds or rune pages. Ultimately, it boils down to \"AP champions do AP things, AD champions do AD things, and tanks do tank things\".\n\nThe namesake of the rule is that Garen has absolutely zero benefit to building AP. Thus, if he's building AP, he's inting. The same goes for if he builds mana since he's a manaless champion (disregarding Sheen build path because Sheen is a special exception that I'll get into later). That includes \"mana runes\" or \"AP runes\" such as Summon Aery, Manaflow Band, or Presence of Mind.\n\nSimilarly, Lux has nothing in her kit that improves her auto attack damage or attack speed and has nothing that scales off AD. Thus, if she builds AD (or crit chance, because crit chance is an auto attack stat), she's inting. Again, just like with Garen and Manaflow Band, this includes auto attack enhancing runes such as Lethal Tempo, Legend: Alacrity, and Legend: Bloodline.\n\nThere are other combinations of runes and champions that do absolutely nothing. These can be determined just by reading over the champion's abilities once and the rune once and can all be done from within the game (no outside resources required -- something very important). These are also inting.\n\nWhat makes my definition better than yours is that mine doesn't include information from outside the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-01-21T19:05:14.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If playing bad counted as inting, then 99.99% of players would be banned since we're pretty much all objectively bad and basically inting relative to the pros.\n\nBut instead inting is *intentionally* feeding, which usually takes the form of running down the lane and not fighting back, but sometimes can be more subtle. Still, lack of game knowledge is not inting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Around999People","date":"2018-01-21T18:59:46.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll mention an example from a few games ago.

In her minion wave, under her tower, anywhere except under his own tower. It got to where Riven was 6/1 and started roaming and he kept trying to 1v1 her.
