Meta is basically the strongest picks you can have in order to win games and like it or not, a meta will ALWAYS exist. It's almost impossible to achieve perfect balance, therefore there will always be strong picks and weak picks, therefore, climbing elo will be more successful when following the strong, meta picks. This was always the case, and this will always be the case.\r\n\r\nThis time around, though, it seems like we have moved away from the typical meta thing, where you had slightly more chances to win, to a point where there are certain picks that are almost guaranteed free elo, and that's because they have little to no counterplay. \r\n\r\nLet's see Talon, for example. Smite mid Talon is one of the most broken things ever. Not because of his damage, he never got buffed recently or anything. It's just how he works right now. He can have insane XP gains, with no counterplay. As a melee champion, he has superior waveclear both in lane and in the jungle to almost in other pick. He can start raptors level 1 and pop into lane level 2 during the first wave, spam his waveclear, then proceed to jungle again for fast levels and gold. This has close to ZERO counterplay. You can even ward his raptors, and it will won't do much, since he can start wolves. The fact that he only pops into lane to push out the wave, and then leaves again makes it so that there is almost zero chance for the enemy laner to try and stop him, especially seeing how his waveclear tools are far superior to almost any other laner.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Talon are other picks that can utilize Smite in the mid lane, like Ekko, Taliyah, Aatrox etc. You can make cases like \"but these champions are bad later in the game, they get outscaled\", but it DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER. I played normal draft games picking Talon for the first time in platinum elo, and I stomped the early game. My team got so many huge advantages that late game was only just a myth.\r\n\r\nThis makes it so that this tactic is almost free elo. As long as the smite player doesn't fuck up their execution on correctly killing raptors and then pushing lanes and having good back times, it doesn't matter what the enemy does. The smite champion will just hit level 6 before anyone else, then proceed to heavily zone you out of cs in lane and roam the entire map. Almost zero counterplay. Even when warding off ganks, they still apply insane pressure, forcing one champion to be glued into mid lane, while they roam around.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere never was such a thing. Apart from certain cases where champions were indeed broken (Runeglaive Ezreal, 5.18 Darius), we have never seen anything like this. All the other cases were temporary number mistakes, and were hot-fixed pretty soon. The smite thing won't be looked at for a long time, and only after someone hits #1 in China and makes a Reddit post about how he boosted their platinum friend into Masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not really complaining about it, I will probably just abuse this to gain free elo. As it stands right now, with all the coinflip matchmaking and stuff, I can only resort into such tactics to gain elo, where I know that my good effort will pay off. The thing is that most people don't enjoy that, and I would also certainly want to get my elo through actual interaction with the enemy as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Duskz101","date":"2018-07-17T00:20:42.508+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"THESE ARE STATS: Champion.gg\n\nTalon - Plat winrate 52% - Silver 49% win rate.\n\nEkko - Plat 50% - Silver 50%.\n\nTaliyah - Plat 51% - Silver 49%.\n\nAatrox - Plat 46% - Silver 49%\n\nNothing about these numbers show a \"free-lo\" champ.

If there was a significant shift with them taking smite and getting \"freelo\" (As you put it), it would show in their win rates under \"Jungler\" on Champion.gg. I quickly looked this up, and both Talon and Ekko are sitting around 51-52% win-rate with smite. It's above 50% but HARDLY something to consider \"freelo\" (a super dramatic term).\n\nAlso, if you're mid-laner is taking smite and you don't believe there is any counter play or punishment to that then I got some news for ya'! There definitely is....\n\nThis just requires a bit more coordination. It's obvious what their plan is if they have smite, so talk to your jungler about how easy a kill catching them could be. Then what? They're stuck with smite, knowing they'll be hunted if they go to use it. Now, I understand that they can take their own raptors, but this is also punishable if you catch them in the act. Raptors DO damage. You 'pincering' them against raptors can very easily turn into a kill for you. This comes with risks, I know. \n\nOver-all, there is lack of evidence suggesting anything beyond your own experience to state that these picks are \"Freelo\" picks....","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-07-17T12:09:43.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, all the korean challenger ladder spamming this shit to get to rank 1 are just lucky?

The enemy jungler will have to start their own camp and not try to stop you, and the enemy mid laner can only ward raptors to see if you're doing it and try to stop you, to which point you just skip raptors and do wolves instead. \n\nThere isn't any counterplay to this.

Before getting to lane and start csing your own minions, you take your raptor camp (or the enemy's, if it's safe to do so), starting with W, smiting the big raptor. It takes one autoattack on each small raptor, 2 Ws, and I believe a couple more AAs and Smite to finish off the camp, granting you level 2. You then pop into lane with exactly one level advantage over the enemy, and you lose, at best, 1 minion. You then have complete lane dominance and control with your level advantage, and all you do from there on is push lane with W, and then leave lane to try and take from camps, preferably from the enemy. If that's not possible (usually is, though), you can take Scuttle Crabs.\n\nBecause of Talon's W, pushing the lane is pretty easy and fast and safe. The enemy mid laner can't contest you because you are stronger, and their waveclear is worse, so they can't stop you from roaming and pick up more jungle cs. This will get you to level 6 very quickly, and this means that you can then proceed to roam and snowball your lanes, while destroying your mid laner and the enemy jungler.\n\nItemization usually involves getting Tiamat first for insanely strong clears, and Mobility Boots for the roaming.
