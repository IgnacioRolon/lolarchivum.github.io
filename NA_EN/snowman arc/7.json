Simple put his attack speed buff on his Q and his armor reduction on the primary target of his E. There. Problem solved.\r\n\r\nMost of Wukong&#039;s laning patterns (99% of them) go E into AA into Q, then seeing how the trade goes and how the lane state is etc, you can continue on trading with an attack speed buff and an armor reduction, or back off using W mostly. In this trade, Wukong doesn&#039;t take advantage of the armor reduction until AFTER he has used all of his combo damage, which is basically useless. The only way he can actually use the armour reduction afterwards is if he keeps on fighting, which puts him in a disadvantage because the enemy will retaliate with their own combos, or if he has ultimate, which he won&#039;t for the first parts of the laning phase.\r\n\r\nInstead, getting the armor shred as soon as he E&#039;s in means that both his AA and his Q will benefit from it, making his damage output a lot higher.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a simple change that will make Wukong feel so much better to play. Other side notes is that since the Q is an AA reset, the extra attack speed doesn&#039;t really do anything, so right now you probably lose a small amount of the augment, while having it AFTER you are done with your main combo makes it more rewarding to use.","replies":[{"poster":"AmetDeCrypt","date":"2018-03-21T15:02:31.316+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":1,"body":"sounds reasonable to me. and I hate the monkey almost as much as akali.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iPooUnicorns","date":"2018-03-21T20:52:56.054+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea, I'd also really like to see his ulti tickrate to be lowered to .5 sec","replies":[{"poster":"Rezlac","date":"2018-03-21T21:10:28.198+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"This literally tilts me.
