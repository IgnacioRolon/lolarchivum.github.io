I need to point out that it definitely feels like it's way more than 150ms, sometimes it even feels like 300+. It just happened again in a RANKED game this time and some people lost elo because of this. I want to know, is this a problem from my perspective or is it the game's problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-30T21:16:45.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that happen almost every night after 10pm or is it a random kinda thing? Sometimes the internet traffic around your house can impact others, like if everyone gets home around that time and starts streaming it can have a mild effect on others in the area. It could also be related to how your connection is being routed to the game servers too, which can be impacted by improperly working nodes that your ISP uses. \n\nIt'd be good to run a traceroute to check up on the health of your connection after it leaves your network. Grab [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a trace to the EUNE servers at 31.186.224.42 and post those results here for me. Those results should give me an idea of how we can get this fixed up for ya!","replies":[{"poster":"Snowman Arc","date":"2018-01-31T01:50:20.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, just to clear this out, I know that if other people connect to their devices and start downloading / uploading etc, it's gonna affect me hard and this was happening lately until my sister actually said \"I do not have anything open\". So yeah, it has nothing to do with other devices connecting to the network.

I wasn't speaking about just those inside your own home, but more so those who live close to you since their bandwidth can affect the neighborhood as well. That traceroute helps to point me to the main issue as well.\n\nOn that note, this trace seems pretty clean so I wouldn't think packet loss is the problem here either. Packet loss doesn't usually happen all the time though, so I'm curious as to what your connection looked like *during the game that lagged*. If you could find the network logs from one of those games that had the lag spikes and have this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them, I'd like to take a look at that as well. Try to grab a screenshot of it and send it my way.\n\n\nWhile you're getting that done, you can try adjusting a couple things to see if they help at all. Change your DNS server settings to 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 and test that in a custom/practice match really quickly.
