Also, I noticed only one of my ARAM games is showing up in my match history, not sure if this is connected. All of those were matchmade, solo ARAMs. Not especially looking forward too see how long it will take to register 50 assists now, since act 1 should be done at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"Lawl Toast","date":"2015-07-23T15:46:30.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And of course just after I post this, everything catches up and suddenly I go from just finishing the first objective, to suddenly having an icon.

Even after doing so and playing a match-made ARAM game (and winning), I still have not seen any progress when using the \"Click here to earn Bilgewater rewards\" link in the LoL client.
