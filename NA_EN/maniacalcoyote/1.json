Once I selected Nasus and locked, I started iTunes. It started just before the screen turned black, and I Alt+Tabbed over to iTunes to start up my mood music. Once I got it started, I tried Alt+Tabbing back over to look at the game loading screen and try to figure out the enemy composition.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I instead got the \"Bugsplat\", and all LoL-related programs terminated. I launched LoL again, logged in, and pressed \"Reconnect\" when it was available. I started loading in finally, but then a window popped up saying that the game was no longer going on. I pressed \"OK\". Beneath that was a \"Because of your leaving early, you have been placed in a lower-priority queue.\"\r\n\r\nA little help please? I barely have enough time for a full game as it is, and now my time needed for a game has been increased by half, to 90 minutes? Are you trying to force me to leave even more?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-30T21:38:07.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Alt+Tabbing* out of the loading screen has a chance of causing bugsplats if you do so before the champion portraits come up. This is especially true if you're running League in Full Screen mode. If you prone to *Alt+Tab* out a lot, I recommend running Borderless mode, as it is less likely that you'll bugsplat after *Alt+Tabbing*. You can select your Windowed Mode inside your game settings in the **VIDEO** section.\n\nLow priority queues are the result of a trend of disconnecting from games. If you're experiencing crashing or any other technical issue not related to *Alt+Tabbing*, please let me know so we can work together on a solution.\n\nLet me know if Borderless helps.","replies":[]}]}
