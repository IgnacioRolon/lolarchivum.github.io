After a bunch of work, I finally was able to reconnect. To add insult to injury, I got hit with a LeaverBuster. I left due to network problems, then returned ASAP, and stayed for the entire loss. For my perseverance, I was rewarded with a 5x20 LPQ.\r\n\r\nStep-by-step instructions:\r\n1. Load into a game of League\r\n2. Have your network connection status go to \"connected\", \"Secured, no internet\"\r\n3. Close client, attempt to restart for 5 or 6 times.\r\n4. Turn WiFi off and on several times\r\n5. Reconnect\r\n6. Finish the game.\r\n7. Get rewarded for your effort with LeaverBuster\r\n\r\nBefore some wiseass comments about my getting a 20-minute LPQ, I've had network trouble very often.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-12T20:33:58.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) is intended to give players time to troubleshoot whatever is causing them to leave, or allow time in case an interruption would happen were there not a lower priority queue.  Even if it's something out of your control, they still cause a negative experience for other players so it's important to get that fixed up.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to troubleshoot whatever is causing your network a failure to connect to the game server.
