It was my mistake for not reading intently what it was all about, but seeing the conversion rate of IP to BE made me realize the fact that I made a mistake in buying Camille too early. Any way for it to be refunded so I can still enjoy that sweet, sweet Blue Essence?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n---\r\n_And remember, it's all for the sake of **Ultimate Hope**!_\r\n- N.

Your old BE was multiplied and added to your IP to create your current BE balance. The IP you had before was not multiplied in any way, just added to the multiplied blue stuff.\n\nSo if you plan on refunding her and buying her back with blue essence you'll wind up with the exact same balance at the end of the day!","replies":[{"poster":"N Komaeda","date":"2017-11-09T14:05:35.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am bamboozled.\nThough you may be correct, there is yet another reason I'd like it refunded.

They should be able to look over whether she was used and how long it's been and see about getting her refunded.","replies":[{"poster":"N Komaeda","date":"2017-11-09T14:02:27.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o/\nThank you, poro friend!
