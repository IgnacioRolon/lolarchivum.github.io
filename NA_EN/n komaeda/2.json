Restarting it uncovers that the download is corrupt. This can happen, and I'm most certainly not blaming Riot.\r\n\r\nWhat I am kind of... Agitated about is that the second time this has happened, I have received a 5 game Low Priority Queue. This is, in my opinion, not correct. I have messed up though, by not saving the proof.\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain why this even happens, and why you should even receive a LeaverBuster for a corrupted download?\r\n\r\nSincerely:\r\n-Killing Targets{{champion:412}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T21:54:31.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Disconnections from matches negatively impact everyone in the match, even if the disconnection was not intentional.
