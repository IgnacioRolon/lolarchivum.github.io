You have 140 champion and only about 25% of them are relevant, look good, and are fun to play. Let&#039;s be completely honest here, Riot Games, and say that about 75% of your champion pool is outdated in terms of gameplay, art, thematics, and uniqueness. Almost a third of your 140 plus champions aren&#039;t even amazing in this game.\n\nI also want to bring up the fact that every single year the same popular champions get a rework that makes them relevant, receives some sort of art update that really brings it all together and is polished, and you acknowledged and talk in depth about the same champions and now new ones. Every post there is something about Zoe, or some other new champion that is now being prioritized for a rework. The double standard you guys have towards new and popular champions versus the many champions that get sh*t work done on them all the time. Let&#039;s also add in the fact that there is always an excuse. You are the company of many excuses but not much product. This company&#039;s idea of a work ethic is constantly creating new content that becomes overbearing and prioritizing work on the same champions every year, while not even listening to a single plea for work to be done on a problem champion or one that is getting ignored for years.\n\nWukong is a champion players want worked on. Players want actual work to be done on this champion but because he is now going to be sitting at a decent play and winrate, Meddler will come up with an excuse as to why Ryze or some new champion needs a prioritized rework over one that players have been asking for actual work to be done on. At some point Wukong will go back down in play and winrate and players will wonder why nothing is still getting done. It literally took these Developers 2 years to finally give Lissandra a proper passive and make her better, but in the meantime Ryze is considered for a rework every single year and champion like Ahri and Lux always get months worth of rework time.\n\nLet&#039;s also talk about how Meddler said Karma needed a VGU 2 years ago to address issues with the entire champion. The rework was finally implemented and only 2 months worth of time was allocated to Karma and one month of that rework was spent on scrapped abilities that didn&#039;t make it into the kit. The Developer in charge asked for feedback and there was MANY threads and posts about the rework in the feedback board and for the past 5 years about Karma&#039;s problems? Guess what Meddler and the Developer in charge of the rework decided to do? Give Karma another numbers buff, ignore any feedback or suggestion from players, and completely make the rework one sided towards one role. 2 years worth of waiting and even asking for feedback, we get a rework that no one really asked for and is disliked by mostly everyone.\n\nI mean we have a champion like Morde constantly being ignored for crappy work but Ezreal and Ryze can get a prioritized VGU and Lux and Ahri can get months worth of work done on them every single year. God forbid we work on rectifying any mistakes but always have an excuse to never actually do work.\n\n==============\n\nSo yeah . . . advertise you have over 140 champions for players to play as. Let&#039;s be real here though, unless the champion is a new one or popular one, you are never going to do work on them and you are never going to go out of your way to do the right type of work on them. Horrible company that continues to believe they are doing solid work for the game, but in reality you just keep throwing new content at a wall and hope it sticks. You don&#039;t care about the things and champions that made LoL amazing. You care about the next flashy thing that is basically a 2.0 of another champion.","replies":[]}
