It also shouldn&#039;t have taken them this long to finally work on Karma and use time as an excuse to actually do nothing on her. These Developers have single handily buffed Karma&#039;s Mantra more than 10 times and reworked her Mantra abilities more than 10 times. The Mantra abilities are not working because of no skill expression on them or a gameplay identity that it can take from.\r\n\r\nInstead of working on every single Mantra ability and giving Karma more skill expression on them, Riot Game Developers decided to yet again buff the numbers of her Mantra Q and Mantra E and only give her a new Mantra W mechanic. The Mantra W mechanic is taking up so much of her power budget now they are only doing that on her and calling her a pure Support. I mean buffing the numbers on horribly functioning and no skill expression Mantra abilities has worked so well in the past, especially when those abilities have almost all been nerfed right after or a year after.\r\n\r\nYou want your proof? Buffed, nerfed, and reworked Mantra and basic abilities. It shouldn&#039;t take this much effort to make a kit work if it isn&#039;t working. Please for the love of God, work on every single Mantra ability so that it fits an actual gameplay identity that makes a compromise between Mage/Old Karma mains and New/Support Karma mains. It shouldn&#039;t be this much work to actually get work done.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cvpsI7H0gmApJn2LOTda1ukCM63E2wf-XRc99J9HbF8/edit#gid=1676494046","replies":[{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-11-21T16:41:39.762+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I've been saying the same thing about Morde since 2012 but all I got was a crap rework that sucks","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2018-11-21T16:45:11.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. I've made many posts about him as well. The same with Skarner, Malz and Lissandra. I am happy Liss got her rework, but it took two years. I'm afraid they are going to probably ruin Morde again and not addressing any of his problems. They are probably going to keep him botlane and force an identity on him that he doesn't deserve.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frosted Tips","date":"2018-11-21T17:11:10.946+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you decide to ignore the community and go with your terrible ideas you have to extend the time so that the people fighting you finally get tired and are exhausted of all motivation so you can push out your garbage update with minimal resistance.","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2018-11-21T17:13:52.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what they want.
