You can always give it to another champion, right?\n\nNewer champions, Aatrox, LaBlanc, Lux, Ryze and everyone else can receive several art changes, additions, and creative ideas, but Karma cannot have anything done to her but amazingly done splash arts that do not match her models in game. Karma doesn&#039;t even have completed art assets and a bland conception after her relaunch, but Aatrox and LaBlanc can have their art assets worked on, not once, but twice. Xin Zhao can have his art assets worked on, but you have the nerve to say that a champion with completed art assets and a better kit, will receive art assets before a champion with a poorly executed theme, updated splash art that didn&#039;t even match in-game models, to begin with, the removal of core parts of what the community loved about Karma, and much more  . . . for a second go at LaBlanc and Aatrox&#039;s art.\n\nExplain the reasoning behind always have an excuse to not address any of Karma&#039;s issues since her ridiculous relaunch four years ago, but always having a reason to not nerf a toxic Yasuo windshield that blocks every attack and continuing to expand on a popular champions&#039; art assets over the 129 other champions that need it more?\n\nThe answer is simple. You don&#039;t care and you said many years ago that you didn&#039;t have the budget or time to work on her, but you apparently have all the time in the world to work on a popular champion that receives almost the same level of treatment you gave Karma four years ago. You have yet to do a single amount of work to correct mistakes you made four years ago and you continue to tell us you are going to work on this champion, but half of us already expect nothing more than a Ricklessabandon level rework that increases the amount her unoriginal mass shielding does.\n\nI don&#039;t expect a response. I expect new players to come in and flame me. I expect people to tell me I am a whiny little LoL player. I am all of the above. I am also a dedicated Karma main since season two that has been fighting for years, like many of us, to have a champion I really enjoyed playing . . . receive any amount of love that isn&#039;t a stat check or buff to her R+E. We have been patient. We have been asking for communication for years. We have been waiting. We have put up with stubborn Developers named Scarizard (RIP thank God) and Ricklessabandon that didn&#039;t care about Karma mains . . . opinions when they did anything and didn&#039;t have the nerve to rectify any mistakes. Now we are with this new generation of players that just sit here and flame all of us old timers that want to have some sort of our favorite champion restored . . . or make better if anything.\n\nDo a better job, Riot. Your reassurance every year that you will work on Karma and do something on her, seems to be a lie every year because all of us Karma mains know exactly what to expect: a half arse relaunch with nothing more than a Ricklessabandon and Scarizard level commitment.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWintertechnics.","replies":[{"poster":"Tenth Leper","date":"2017-09-20T17:18:40.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While I too very much miss the fans, at this point I just hope we get a new champion that uses them.
