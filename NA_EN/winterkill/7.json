For the past few years it honestly feels like the game is going nowhere and nothing is actually being improved. Instead of improving what is already amazing about the game and trying to make League of Legends a fun game for every player, we have an over complicated rune system that favors specific champions and contributes to balance issues and damage creep, the same roles being nerfed and then buffed again every preseason, some stupid little gimmick added to the game that makes it not fun to play, and champion identities being botched and changed to fit the pro player scene. We have a large group of Developers not actually listening to older players and feedback from the community as a whole, because if it doesn&#039;t align with how well it plays in the competitive scene it doesn&#039;t matter.\n\nWhy is damage still not being addressed? There are many things in League of Legends that are still contributing to damage creep. There have been zero attempt at actually addressing any of these problems and damage creep continues to be a massive problem. How hard is it to tone down damage and actually remove things that care causing problems?\n\n----------\n\n{{summoner:14}}  - Needs a nerf.\n{{item:3147}}  - Needs to be removed from the game. There is no place for this item in LoL if you are not going to nerf this item. It&#039;s free damage on a class of champions that are already hard to catch and do enough damage. It has also contributed to many balance problems and has been nerfed a lot. Remove the item or nerf it to oblivion.\n\n- Electrocute - It&#039;s still too strong and doing way too much damage. Nerf it.\n- Conqueror - Needs a nerf.\n\n---------\n\nThe biggest problem I have with Developers for the past few years is the favoritism they have shown to the same champions. There are champions who are worked on every single year and get substantial kit changes and even art additions to them. We have a few champions that have gotten more reworks, VGU and art updates than problem champions these Developers know they made mistakes on. Instead of owning up to their mistakes or even working on champion that are struggling, we have a Development team that prioritizes reworks and VGU based off of what new skin line they have coming out for that champion. It really shouldn&#039;t take this Development team 2 years to give Lissandra a new passive when Lux and Ahri get their kits reworked and receive art updates almost every single year. It really shouldn&#039;t be a problem to work on a champion like Malzahar, Skarnar, Morde or Karma when these Developers have literally prioritized 7 large scale updates/VGU on Ryze when they know champions like Malzahar, Skarnar, Morde and Karma are still waiting for actual work to be done on them. We have nothing but excuses for the past couple years as to why nothing is being worked on.\n\n{{champion:43}}  - Karma mains have been asking for art updates to fix a rushed visual update that has incomplete art assets, a poorly developed model, reused and rushed taunts, and no attempt to bring back her fans when it is one of the most highly requested things to return. Let&#039;s also talk about the kit that continues to be a massive problem for the past 6 years and is constantly buffed and nerfed right after. The recent attempt at actually doing some work on this champion is being very negatively received, despite Developers asking Karma mains for feedback and their opinions, nothing was implemented and excuses continue to be made. Yet again nothing is being worked on and nothing is being addressed for six years now, but there is another excuse as to why it isn&#039;t happening. The rework is still going through despite a massive dislike for the changes and just like 6 years ago, a kit with horrible functionality that is not cohesive is being shoved down our throats. Why bother asking for feedback and criticism if you are not going to make any attempt at implementing them?\n\nKarma mains understand she shouldn&#039;t get a visual update over other champions, even though it isn&#039;t fair to say her VU is actually completed. Just look at the new running animation and how it clips with her Mantle of Decorum and dress. Look at Shen&#039;s taunts and Karma&#039;s. Look at the new thematic that has nothing to do with her. Look at the splash arts that match nothing in game. The voice lines are terrible. The VU is a mess. Karma can wait for it though. What we cannot wait for is a stubborn Development team to get their act together and right some wrongs. I feel very bad for new players that never got to experience parts of old Karma because they would know how old Karma mains feel, but I do not blame them for sitting here getting upset with old Karma mains constantly bickering about this champion. It&#039;s these Developer&#039;s fault for doing literally nothing for the past 6 years and having nothing but excuses.\n\n{{champion:82}}  - Morde mains are waiting for something to be done for years now. This champion has the most bugs, his model is severely outdated, his gameplay was ruined by Developers, and he is ignored every single year. Where is any attempt at making Morde better by these Developers? The feedback has been given and suggestions have been made. Where is there a single attempt at making this champion better and rectifying mistakes? There isn&#039;t. He has a pretty good thematic to work off of. They know how he played before the update that ruined him. Where is the work?\n\nIt&#039;s insulting to prioritize 7 large scale reworks/VGU on Ryze and a rushed Mini VGU on Ezreal when you have a champion like Morde who can actually use the work. He is a mess to play and makes no sense. He looks terrible and still has pizza feet. Why the heck are we prioritizing work on Ryze and a popular champion like Ezreal?\n\n{{champion:72}} - It&#039;s the same as Karma and Morde: he was worked on and the work is not good. There has been zero attempt at rectifying mistakes or even making this champion better, besides an excuse as to why nothing is being done. Meanwhile we have the same champions getting the same type of work getting done on them every single year. It&#039;s 2019 and he is still sitting at an abysmal playrate.\n\n{{champion:90}} - I haven&#039;t met a single Malz main that likes the rework. Where is the revert like Developers did to Kog&#039;Maw? Malz was a lot of fun to play before the rework and only needed minor work. Now I see no one hardly playing him. I wonder why. It&#039;s 2019 and something needs to be done. Revert him.\n\nI am throwing {{champion:62}} into the argument too. Players have been literally asking for work to be done on him. Players want a new passive indefinitely but he could honestly use the mini VGU you prioritized on Ezreal for some reason. Is this going to be another two year wait for a champion that needs something done on them like Riot Game Developers did with Lissandra? Where is the work?\n\n===============\n\nHold Developers accountable for their problems guys. I know people are going to downvote, flame and get mad at me. Stop complaining about the problems if you are literally not going to hold these Developers accountable. Your voices can be heard if we are all giving them. It shouldn&#039;t take this much work by us to get these Developers to actually do their jobs. These Developers are literally not even considering anything if it doesn&#039;t align with the LCS. Damage is extremely high because they want competitive games to go very fast. Champion identities are being ruined and ignored because of the LCS and how well Developers want it to function in competitive play. Developers are constantly adding new gimmicks and over complicated features that ruin the game and make damage creep even more unbearable to play against, because having something new and flashy in the game is more exciting than actually working on even one single problem in the game.\n\nHOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE THEM DO ACTUAL WORK AND NOT THE SAME WORK THEY DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Like holy crap . . . . ADC are constantly being nerfed, buffed, and reworked every single year. Assassins are either to overpowered or under-powered. Mages are still bland in terms of itemization and runes, but remain in a state of either being even or too powerful. Tanks are not doing their jobs but they cannot have too much power in their kits or itemization or they become unbearable to play against. Supports are either too powerful or another group of them are useless.","replies":[{"poster":"le secret op","date":"2019-01-06T23:17:28.373+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep..the problems just keep stacking up every year. idk why it feels like they do close to nothing to fix stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Winterkill","date":"2019-01-07T00:02:24.367+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

It's 2019 and something needs to be done. Revert him.\n\nCongrats you found one. I don't play him much as admittedly I've mained Support instead of Mid for a few years but he's still one of my go-to mid picks along with Lux (actually Malz likely takes priority now that I've not used Lux is so long).\n\nNo one is \"hardly playing him\" because now he has to actually work for his damage and he's perhaps been nerfed too hard in the numbers department. I played Malzahar for years and no, you barely had to put any effort at all into getting maximum damage pre-rework. Literally your only struggle was chaining casts for Voidlings and landing the Q.\nYou practically couldn't miss your W\nYour E was point-and-click\nYour ult was point-and-click\nAnd they triggered your voidlings to attack the right target\n\nThis was, frankly, toxic as hell as either Malzahar was weak and not picked or too strong and picked. Nowadays to get maximum damage you need to chain your spells over a longer duration to get refreshes on the visions. He takes more effort now to use- of course this made him played less (not that he was played all that much before- let's be real about that) unless he received significant buffs to make up for it.\n\nKnow who probably likes the Malz rework? All the people who don't depend on the Malzahar being braindead to avoid eating all his maximum damage. You have more to appease than just the fans of the champion. Malzahar's problem is that he wasn't changed enough because the most toxic parts of his kit (visions and nether grasp) were unchanged because \"that's what people like about him\".\n\nKog Maw was reverted because he warped the entire game around his presence and more or less the only change was the attack speed change so easy revert for an easy change.

He's almost exactly the same except that they nerfed every part of his kit to cater to how powerful his passive is, removed parts of his kit, barely touched his model (if they even did)\n\nhow is anyone \"working\" for their damage.  Instead, it's hard work to get damage at all when the opponent can instantly delete your damage-dealing summons, you have no W, you have no passive (it's better suited to a tank than malzahar, I mean, really... 90% damage reduction and crowd control nullification every 30 seconds? )\n\n\"work for your damage\"  pfft, they made him even simpler and deal less damage unless he can get an **IDEAL SITUATION**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hotarse","date":"2019-01-07T13:49:33.877+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creating a champ for league of legends ended up being like this:\nThere were rockstar designers, well like by the majority of the company and most importantly, the bigwigs. They were given the freedom to create champs with game-breaking kits. These kits were stupidly overpowered, and no wonder their champs became popular, thus reinforcing the rockstar designer's position as a rockstar. \nInstead of looking at champ power as a possible reason for champ popularity, these rockstar developers instead claimed that their kits were simply more fun and the reason for their popularity was how well they designed their champ (of course). How very self-serving. So these champs got to go long periods of time without being brought into line with nerfs because they were popular and the rockstar designers who created them had the clout to keep it so.\nThen people stop playing immobile champs like they are the plague... because they suck. Face it, mobility is power. And death is the strongest CC. So if you make a champ that has mobility and a lot of tools to kill other champs without dying then you've created an overpowered champion. \nBut instead of looking at those champ's dwindling playrate as a result of a lack of agency over the game, Riot simply labels those champs as failed champs and continues to gutter them since, well, they'll make more money selling skins on the popular champs.\nThe champs in league of legends now resemble the ecosystem of any popular entertainment medium, with the flashy grossing millions and receiving tons of accolades while the more subtle \"thinking person's\" champs being relegated to the Indie circle. \nWhat a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not HeIping You","date":"2019-01-07T09:21:13.561+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing you do have to remember is that by them fixing what we consider major problems, they instantly admit that what they had originally done or implemented was not in the best interest of the game and therefore admit wrongdoing.

There is no place for this item in LoL if you are not going to nerf this item. It&amp;#039;s free damage on a class of champions that are already hard to catch and do enough damage. It has also contributed to many balance problems and has been nerfed a lot. Remove the item.\n> \n> - Electrocute - It&amp;#039;s still too strong and doing way too much damage. Nerf it.\n> - Conqueror - Needs a nerf.\n> \n> ---------\n> \n> The biggest problem I have with Developers for the past few years is the favoritism they have shown to the same champions. There are champions who are worked on every single year and get substantial kit changes and even art additions to them. We have a few champions that have gotten more reworks, VGU and art updates than problem champions these Developers know they made mistakes on. Instead of owning up to their mistakes or even working on champion that are struggling, we have a Development team that prioritizes reworks and VGU based off of what new skin line they have coming out for that champion. It really shouldn&amp;#039;t take this Development team 2 years to give Lissandra a new passive when Lux and Ahri have had their kits reworked and received art updates almost every single year. It really shouldn&amp;#039;t be a problem to work on a champion like Malzahar, Skarnar, Morde or Karma when these Developers have literally prioritized 7 large scale updates/VGU on Ryze when they know champions like Malzahar, Skarnar, Morde and Karma are still waiting for actual work to be done on them. We have nothing but excuses for the past couple years as to why nothing is being worked on.\n> \n> {{champion:43}}  - Karma mains have been asking for art updates to fix a rushed visual update that has incomplete art assets, a poorly developed model, reused and rushed taunts, and no attempt to bring back her fans when it is one of the most highly requested things to return. Let&amp;#039;s also talk about the kit that continues to be a massive problem for the past 6 years and is constantly buffed and nerfed right after. The recent attempt at actually doing some work on this champion is being very negatively received, despite Developers asking Karma mains for feedback and their opinions, nothing was implemented and excuses continue to be made. Yet again nothing is being worked on and nothing is being addressed for six years now, but there is another excuse as to why it isn&amp;#039;t happening. The rework is still going through despite a massive dislike for the changes and just like 6 years ago, a kit with horrible functionality that is not cohesive is being shoved down our throats. Why bother asking for feedback and criticism if you are not going to make any attempt at implementing them?\n> \n> Karma mains understand she shouldn&amp;#039;t get a visual update for other champions, even though it isn&amp;#039;t fair to say her VU is actually completed. Just look at the new running animation and how it clips with her Mantle of Decorum and dress. Look at Shen&amp;#039;s taunts and Karma&amp;#039;s. Look at the new thematic that has nothing to do with her. Look at the splash arts that match nothing. The voice lines are terrible. The VU is a mess. We can wait for it. What we cannot wait for is a stubborn Development team to get their act together and right some wrongs. I feel very bad for new players that never got to experience parts of old Karma because they would know how old Karma mains feel, but I do not blame them for sitting here getting upset with old Karma mains constantly bickering about this champion. It&amp;#039;s these Developer&amp;#039;s fault for doing literally nothing for the past 6 years and having nothing but excuses.\n> \n> {{champion:82}}  - Morde mains are waiting for something to be done for years now. This champion has the most bugs, his model is severely outdated, his gameplay was ruined by Developers, and he is ignored every single year. Where is any attempt at making Morde better by these Developers? The feedback has been given and suggestions have been made. Where is there a single attempt at making this champion better and rectifying mistakes? There isn&amp;#039;t. He has a pretty good thematic to work off of. They know how he played before the update that ruined him. Where is the work?\n> \n> It&amp;#039;s insulting to prioritize 7 large scale reworks/VGU on Ryze and a rushed Mini VGU on Ezreal when you have a champion like Morde who can actually use the work. He is a mess to play and makes no sense. He looks terrible and still has pizza feet. Why the heck are we prioritizing work on Ryze and a popular champion like Ezreal?\n> \n> {{champion:72}} - It&amp;#039;s the same as Karma and Morde: he was worked on and the work is not good. There has been zero attempt at rectifying mistakes or even making this champion better, besides an excuse as to why nothing is being done. Meanwhile we have the same champions getting the same type of work getting done on them every single year. It&amp;#039;s 2019 and he is still sitting at an abysmal playrate.\n> \n> {{champion:90}} - I haven&amp;#039;t met a single Malz main that likes the rework. Where is the revert like Developers did to Kog&amp;#039;Maw? Malz was a lot of fun to play before the rework and only needed minor work. Now I see no one hardly playing him. I wonder why. It&amp;#039;s 2019 and something needs to be done. Revert him.\n> \n> I am throwing {{champion:62}} into the argument too. Players have been literally asking for work to be done on him. Players want a new passive indefinitely but he could honestly use the mini VGU you prioritized on Ezreal for some reason. Is this going to be another two year wait for a champion that needs something done on them like Riot Game Developers did with Lissandra? Where is the work?\n> \n> ===============\n> \n> Hold Developers accountable for their problems guys. I know people are going to downvote, flame and get mad at me. Stop complaining about the problems if you are literally not going to hold these Developers accountable. Your voices can be heard if we are all giving them. It shouldn&amp;#039;t take this much work by us to get these Developers to actually do their jobs. These Developers are literally not even considering anything if it doesn&amp;#039;t align with the LCS. Damage is extremely high because they want competitive games to go very fast. Champion identities are being ruined and ignored because of the LCS and how well Developers want it to function in competitive play. Developers are constantly adding new gimmicks and over complicated features that ruin the game and make damage creep even more unbearable to play against, because having something new and flashy in the game is more exciting than actually working on even one single problem in the game.\n> \n> HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKE THEM DO ACTUAL WORK AND NOT THE SAME WORK THEY DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Like holy crap . . . . ADC are constantly being nerfed, buffed, and reworked every single year. Assassins are either to overpowered or under-powered. Mages are still bland in terms of itemization and runes, but remain in a state of either being even or too powerful. Tanks are not doing their jobs but they cannot have too much power in their kits or itemization or they become unbearable to play against. Supports are either too powerful or another group of them are useless.\n\nRunes Reforged needs to be reverted back to the season 7 masteries and runes made free then they should try making another system again but without fucking humping the damage dragon and maybe make the game balanced where there isn't 1 shots unless you're way ahead and play correctly, you know how shit USED to be YEARS ago?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowbrand","date":"2019-01-07T04:22:07.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Idk, I prefer this meta over tank meta and ardent support meta we had for a long time.

The MR reduction is more important to Evelynn than the charm itself, yet she can't even get that without telling the enemy to run behind a turret.  Or even moving the MR reduction to her first Q skillshot, subsequently increasing its range and giving priority to that target, then just reducing 2.5 second delay on her W to 1 second or completely reverting back to her movement speed/CC removal ability pre-VGU.\n\nYet another VGU gone wrong that just needs a little nudge to be viable, but nah, better give Akali true invisibility even to turrets, a dash that can be used offensively AND as an escape, her double dash ult execute and zero to full health after spamming two Q.

I've been with the game for several years and things have not been getting much better. Things keep going down the rabbit hole of focusing on a very select group of players within the player base and abandoning a majority of the others. Meanwhile they keep making bad decision after bad decision which ends up making them put MORE man hours into fixing, causing long standing issues to be put on the back burners even longer. On top of that, they decided to go back to the 50/50 new champ rework split, which is just going to add more champs that need to be balanced and push older champs even further into obscurity.\n \nA whole bunch of things last year made me dislike the game and made me end up hardly playing for most of it, so I decided this year I'm leaving it up to my main. If he doesn't get some kind of work done this year, I can't trust them to do any work on him at this point (especially if they are making a 2nd game) and it's just time for me to move on from league. I've had my fun, made some great friends and enjoyed the lore. But all good things come to an end at some point and while I'd hate to leave on a sour note, rather do it now then to keep hoping for something that won't come.","replies":[]}]}
