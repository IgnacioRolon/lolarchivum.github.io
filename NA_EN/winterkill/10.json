Players said the idea of using illusions to hide your champion would be great on LeBlanc. Here it is on a new champion and not on the master illusionist who tricks people. I think it&#039;s fair to say that these Developers just don&#039;t care about their older champion pool anymore. They do half-arsed work on reworks for older champions, unless the champion is a popular one. They are constantly prioritizing reworks and VGU on popular and new champions. It feels like all they ever talk about is the same crap over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe new champion looks fun and great. Unfortunately it feels like a concept that we already had in the game on an older champion. Yet again, concepts and abilities are being stolen from one champion and put on a new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2018-11-19T17:32:41.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Neeko's mimic is her passive and only works on allied champions.

From what we can see though she HAS to be near that champion so it might just be something that happens, such as Zyra's passive that just happens on a timer. Also I'd like to add another stipulation being she has to be stationary, but that bit with Hecarim might prove otherwise. We'll see soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Ravenhale","date":"2018-11-20T01:30:22.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just watched Red Mercy's video on her and it does work like Kindred's mark.
