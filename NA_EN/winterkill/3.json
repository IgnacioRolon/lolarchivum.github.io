Here are some reasons why this is a problem:\r\n\r\n1 - The game is not progressing much this year and not much has been done to address outlying problems. Summoners Rift didn't receive a lot of changes this year and Riot actually pushed the majority of it into the preseason, 5 months later, for the sheer reason that they don't want to work on anything but TFT. We were promised a lot of changes to address outlying problems and it's all been ignored for continued support towards TFT, but the Riot Fanboys don't want to talk about that. They want everyone to give Riot the benefit of the doubt and continue to blindly support them.\r\n\r\n2 - Work on specific champions is being ignored and the community wants for things to be worked on, are being ignored. This is partly because a lot of artists and Developers have been moved from the Summoners Rift team to the TFT team. The Developer in charge of the Karma GU earlier this year, asked for more time, a artist and other things to make the Karma GU amazing. Meddler denied all of that because of a time restraint and that the Developer needed to move on to a bigger and more important project, but she wished she could have worked on Karma longer. Well, the Karma GU gets cancelled and when TFT is announced, that same Developer is now on the TFT team and probably was on the team the entire time after the Karma GU was worked on and gets cancelled. The same thing is happening to Wukong right now, who is stuck waiting on artists to become available next. Unfortunately their artists all seem to be a little tied up with TFT right now.\r\n\r\n3 - Riot refuses to bring back iconic and fun gamemodes and they said removing Twisted Treeline is being done to make it easier for them to work on TFT and future gamemodes, which probably won't happen at all. Riot didn't bring back any of the past years gamemodes and is cancelling TT for TFT simply because they are lazy and can make more money off of TFT than TT.\r\n\r\n======\r\n\r\nThe Riot Fanboys who support these Developers with everything they do, even the bad things like Eternals, are blind to their bias and terrible work ethic. No one wants to call them out on their lack of a work ethic, but they are quick to praise incompetency. Riot is removing Developers from one portion of the game to work on a gamemode still in beta that is charging content that is RNG and not a guaranteed content that players want. All progress in this game has been halted and the things like:\r\n\r\n- toning damage down.\r\n- giving us another dragon.\r\n- doing more mini-VGU like Ezreal and Morgana.\r\n- addressing concerns with specific items, rune trees, and champions.\r\n\r\nIS BEING IGNORED FOR A GAMEMODE STILL IN BETA THAT IS CHARGING MONEY FOR CONTENT THAT IS RNG AND NOT A GUARANTEE OF WHAT THE CONSUMER WANTS. DEVELOPERS HAVE SHOWN A CLEAR HISTORY OF TAKING OTHER DEVELOPERS FROM SR AND PUTTING THEM ON THE TFT TEAM. WHICH IS CLEARLY HALTING DEVELOPMENT TIME AND PROGRESSION IN SR. RIOT IS ALSO GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY AND REFUSING TO ADD GAMEMODE LIKES SG INVASION, THE PROJECT ONE, AND EVEN REMOVING TWISTED TREELINE IN FAVOR OF MORE DEVELOPMENT TIME AND SUPPORT WITH TFT. WHERE IS THE FOLLOW UP ON THE KARMA GU, THE WUKONG REWORK, THE FACT THAT PLAYERS WANT MINI-VGU FOR CHAMPIONS LIKE VARRUS AND MF? No one wants to talk about their clear bias decisions and horrible work ethic that is effecting Summoners Rift.","replies":[]}
