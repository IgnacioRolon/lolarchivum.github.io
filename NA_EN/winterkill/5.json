Riot Games values new champions over old ones. Players wanted the proof. Here is your proof. If you think your main will get a fresh coat of paint to modernize them, you will be disappointed. If you think your main will get a new mechanic or work done on them to make them standout just as much as the kit overloaded new champions, you will be disappointed. \n\nThe fact of the matter is we have champions that look so outdated, so old, cannot compete gameplay wise compared to newer champs . . . . the answer is outright ingore them and let these champions rot. New champions have already been made a top priority with reworks and massive adjustments the past two years. \n\nYou know where these Developers alliances stand. Zilean mains, he will continue to look outdated and garbage. Karma mains, she will continue to have no gameplay identity and incomplete art assets. Where is the Yordle work to make them all look the same? Fiddles mains he will stay the way he is. This is all because these Developers only care about the same popupar champions every year and the new ones. Leave the game and let it sink. They clearly do not care about anything other than the same garbage they always have.\n\nReally horrible and bias company that has yet to convince me they care.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2019-04-23T20:26:02.307+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":11,"body":"I want to take a minute to answer this from my perspective.

There are many players that share your perspective, that they want their main updated, and changed. But you have to understand there are also many other players that love their Champion, and find it very frustrating when they are updated even if many other players think the update makes them way better. We have to care about these players as well, and whenever we do VGUs we also cause a lot of disruption and frustration from players over their Champion being changed. New Champions generally don't cause this player pain. Last year we actually saw a lot higher player frustration over change, partly due to how many old Champions we were updating and changing, with many older players feeling alienated by the changes. \n\nAt this point, after Morde, many of the Champions we would consider for a VGU have much higher players bases then the Champions we were doing VGUs on in the past. This isn't to say there isn't value in doing them, but if we were doing them at the rate we were doing them last year, on Champions with bigger player bases, then that is many more players that would feel frustrated or alienated by the changes, even if many other players like them.\n\nThis isn't to say we want to stop doing them as we feel there is value in the game feeling modern and up to date, which means we value updating the things that are getting old and dated. The Champions on the list just aren't as dated as some of the ones we did over the last couple years, and as a result the value in updating them isn't as high, and also has a higher disruption and player pain cost since the Champions have bigger player bases.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoli Ben","date":"2019-04-23T20:32:04.831+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":2,"body":"What about {{champion:81}} level reworks and champions that are unhealthy, binary and visually outdated and have low playerbase like {{champion:9}} {{champion:36}}{{champion:72}} , I would not consider last of the urgent candidates done until these are taken care of.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2019-04-23T21:49:47.336+0000","up_votes":31,"down_votes":1,"body":"Champs like Fiddle, Mundo, Skarner and such are still high on our list for VGUs.

Lol, sure. Model, art and visuals fugly af, inexistant lore (he was what Evelynn had pre-rework; 1 paragraph that says basically nothing) and TERRIBLE TERRIBLE gameplay (only really good part is his ult and he's just that, an ult bot who works better an an AP assassin rather than a bruiser/tank)\n\nAlso, with barely 4 done per year, many champs will be left to rot even more, awaiting for their turn. If anything, you should UP the frequency, NOT decrease it. Last year, when you announced you planned to make more VGUs and lay back on the new champs, produce overall less, the overwhelming majority of the community applauded and congratulated you for doing the RIGHT THING, this is needed. Player complaints never stop (and you seem to mention them only when it's in your best interest) but if something's done for the greater good (making a champ an actual champ from a fossil) then it must be done, #whateverittakes.

I can see why Riot would come to this decision.\"\n\nHowever, after thinking on it for several hours, I actually no longer agree with your statement. Last year there was too much change to old champions, but it wasn't because there were too many VGUs, it's because the same champions needed to be reworked _multiple_ times in under a year. Akali, Irelia, and Aatrox were all especially egregious examples of this. All 3 of these champions received VGUs that were _so_ broken that it became necessary to give all 3 of them mini-reworks that drastically changed their kits _again_ less than a year after they received their VGUs. Not only that, but Urgot also wound up needing a mini-rework as well once people finally clued in to his kit being degenerate as well (although it took longer in his case).\n\nThe problem isn't that there were too many VGUs last year, the problem is that the VGUs we got _simply weren't very good._ Many of them had serious game breaking kits that would've been just as problematic even if they'd been new champions instead.\n\nSo after thinking on it, I don't think that 'more new champions, less VGUs' is the right direction to go.

There are many players that share your perspective, that they want their main updated, and changed. But you have to understand there are also many other players that love their Champion, and find it very frustrating when they are updated even if many other players think the update makes them way better. We have to care about these players as well, and whenever we do VGUs we also cause a lot of disruption and frustration from players over their Champion being changed. New Champions generally don't cause this player pain. Last year we actually saw a lot higher player frustration over change, partly due to how many old Champions we were updating and changing, with many older players feeling alienated by the changes. \n> \n> At this point, after Morde, many of the Champions we would consider for a VGU have much higher players bases then the Champions we were doing VGUs on in the past.

No matter how much someone begs for a champion to get a rework, that same person will cry for a revert in a month. If you guys think of a cool new mechanic, you can just use it for a completely new champion and save yourself the hate mail from 'as a long time -champion name- 6trillion mastery point main' I hate this rework!!!.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GrandpaTheGreat","date":"2019-04-25T02:50:32.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could the issue with the frustration of old mains be mitigated by ramping up communication between the design teams and said mains when updating their champion (Or does this already happen to some extent)?

It just gave them new/different ones I know a champion cannot be perfect, but sometimes, pre-rework champ is less problematic than post rework champ, and that is an issue to me. Artistically, it's always very good though, the new champions and VGU always look very good. The fact that I played a lot most of the recently reworked champions probably influences the way I feel about them too.\n\nFinally, I have a question, you said that there would be a poll and the champion that would win it would be reworked by riot in 2020, but aren't you concerned the community might troll and chose a champion like Yasuo, or Ryze?","replies":[{"poster":"Morloa","date":"2019-04-24T22:12:53.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're correct in that often champions that are reworked lose there old style and don't necessarily have there problems fixed example Aatrox who one of his biggest strengths was if his Stats > Yours he enters god mode and can't be killed it just takes a different form in the fact that he just runs away half the time now the 9.9 changes look good at addressing this. \n\nWarwick and Galio are perfect examples of it being done properly. The only complaint i've ever heard about warwick is they miss being able to one-hit people with the old on hit build with his ultimate, they took everything about him and hit upgrade without making him more difficult to play.\n\nMy personal favourite rework is Swains, he went from this mostly useless dot/mid range control mage to something else entirely. He's easier to play now since his kit actually works together and his counter-play isn't \"Don't fight him in a minion wave cause his healing actually does something in that one scenario\".\n\nPersonally i'd rather see attempts made at modernising old champions rather than letting them collect dust even if it means we get some not quite right ones 50% of the time because even then they're usually an improvement.\n\nTo answer your question from memory they have a list of 5 champions in mind and small descriptions about what will happen to them and there design direction. It'll probably be champions like: Mundo, Fiddlesticks, Skarner, Kalista and Shaco.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hyperherb","date":"2019-04-24T22:06:33.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem u guys have is the lack communication between u and ur community. Good reworks are received well coz u didn't delete the champion and added freshness to their kit bad reworks are received bad coz u literally delete a champion for a new champion with the same name. The reason why many people dont want reworks for their otp's and mains is simply because u guys tend to delete champions people love. They are scared because of bad expiriences they made in the past (AAtrox u are at a better place now brother). I played Udyr for 5 years now and I would love a proper and well done VGU for him but at the same time am scared u guys gonna delete the champion I hv invested so much time and interest in. Just looking at Udyr's base model makes me actually sad he looks like a WoW npc who is trying  to give u a side quest to kill 5 wolves or something. He didnt get a skin in over 4 years now. The skin he got 4 years ago is a 975 Rp priced skin which doesnt change any of his effects. His kit baically consists of his Q and his E (His w is mainly for jng sustain which is again giga boring). His passive is extremely boring and doesnt add anything interesting to his theme. Udyr is the only champion that makes u feel punished for putting skill points into ur R. Like man idk I could go on and on why udyr needs some love but fact of the matter is he is really dated. Honestly simply ignoring the problem and adding new cool fun flashy stuff to the game is gonna cause more problems in the aftermath. I actually really want Udyr to be a modern version of himself but I hv seen what u did to the brotherman AAtrox...I just want it done right. I guarantee u most people who main or otp old and/or out dated champs will tell u a similar story. And I If u guys and the player base of the champions that need work done would communicate properly reworks would be received way better and would influence the game in a positive way :) .

Yeah there's always going to be some amount of backlash to change, but the quality of the change absolutely affects how much backlash there is.\n\nAs someone who is very unhappy with the VGU their main got I can assure you I was totally up for change. In fact I wanted more change than Riot was willing to do. But bad change is bad. Butt wings are stupid. Riot can do so much better than amateur hour writing. And worst of all, Riot seems to have no idea how to actually balance Morgana, especially mid lane where I primarily play her. So many, \"her kit is largely fine as is\" remarks were suddenly replaced with talk of, \"uninteractive wave clear\" all of which shows a big misunderstanding of the champion. The saddest part is Riot was aware of the potential wave clear issue... years ago, but seems to have forgotten completely.\n\nIt makes sense that the devs can't have a really deep understanding of every aspect of every champion due to sheer numbers. All the more reason making so many more is a problem. I feel like even 1 new champion a year pushes the limits pretty hard on Riot being able to actually manage the roster. There are so many major problems with so many new champions and VGUs alike. I'd rather see all of that fixed than see new champions.
