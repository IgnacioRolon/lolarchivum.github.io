I see the same f****ng champions getting the same high dollar skins and creative skin lines while other ones get ignored year after year. Now you are on this kick of giving the same champions multiple amounts of skins in one year. Two Yi skins, three Jhin skins and skins in amazing fashion for the same popular champions.

But the  \"no one plays x champion\" and \"this champion is not popular\" arguments are no justification for champions to stay without a single skin in 3 years and over. Without any intention to be rude but with this kind of \"champion is not played\" logic we might as well remove said champion.

For while it's true, and in Jhin's case it makes sense. Yet, this is Vayne's first skin to the public since 2015 (her Hextech skin is locked off to most people) and her popularity is always high, 20% pickrate high.\n\nIf we go by popularity, she would have had 3 this year, 2 the year before. Vi's popularity/pickrate is less than Shen's at the moment. He hasn't had a skin since 2013 and that was an eSports one so according to many, it doesn't count. :P\n\nOver saturate a market with skins for 1 champ and people who like the champ will not buy all 3 because why would they? they choose the one they like and buy that only. Yet champs without regular skins are guaranteed sales because they lack skins and not only will fans of them buy it but others might buy them too increasing their pickrate and therefore their popularity.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"alekzu","date":"2017-11-07T10:49:23.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't have a problem when a champion gets 3 skins in 1 year.

It&#x27;s just a little bit sad people have to make so many threads and beg :/\n\nI agree with you, Jhin can have as many skins as he wants as long as the skins are distributed nicely. For many it doesn't seem the case. Riot have had to ask us to vote for a new Illoai skin. Why? Why not just make one of them and then 7 months later make the other and release that. Why did it take 2 years to do a poll for a skin for a champion they should have been having ideas for instantly after release? This poll means that the result is only just in and in that turn they then have to work on it so don't expect the skin until next year.\n\nThe theme thing doesn't make sense though sometimes when Shen fits both Eternal Sword and Project, got neither. Cassio and Viktor can easily fit Program skin line, Heimer and Rumble would fit that skin line too.\n\nWeird thing about the popularity thing as well, Zed. Zed is a popular champion, has very few skins. He's like one of the poster characters for the game too. It's odd.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-11-07T09:45:39.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"For you to take that statement as literally as that means you're just looking for whatever argument you can.\n\nYou know when i said that i meant that there is a very small player base for said champion that doesn't warrent it nearly as much focus as any other champ.\n\nHow often do you see people wanting skins for like....

I am not here to argue for the sake of argue.

We wouldn't be seeing so much rise in skin complaining threads otherwise.\n\nI understand if Riot wants to make money out of skins. That's their job and that's how they make money. But if I had to be in Riot shoes I would show my respects to the fanbase. I would make an Ahri and Shen skin instead of Ahri and Ezreal. This way I earn money but also show I care for the community.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Brotha","date":"2017-11-07T15:26:35.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:19}} 2015 was a good year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frozen Diva","date":"2017-11-07T13:33:14.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair Lissandra got the impressive Program skin literally last year which is VERY imaginative and creative.\nI see an improvement.
