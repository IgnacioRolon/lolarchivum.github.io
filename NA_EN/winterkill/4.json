Support, if you even want to call it that now, is suffering a lot right now.\n\n1) Support is the role that is auto filled more than any other. It is the most undesirable role.\n2) The support role is very bland and there doesn&#039;t seem to be a lot of versatility.\n3) Enchanters all feel the same and play the same, in a sense. They all have a shield . . . a heal . . . . a move that speeds someone up . . . . and etc. I want to pick a certain enchanter and actually feel a difference between the other ones . . . . when I play them. They also all buy the same items . . . . to increase the effectiveness of their shields . . . . . button mashing that shield ability the entire game and really doing nothing else. Honestly, I feel like Nami and Soraka are successful supports because they feel different from one another and are somewhat fun to play.\n4) The grading system with supports is so messed up . . . . someone can have 34 assists, ward very good, and have hardly any deaths . . . . and get an A or A+ because Riot doesn&#039;t seem to recognize their good plays. Riot seems to only recognize a champion that isn&#039;t a support . . . . even if it is feeding.\n\nPeople can sit here and whine that divers and tanks need to be looked at . . . . the problem with that is people are actually queing up for those roles and find the role more enjoyable than &quot;support&quot;. If you walked up to a League of Legends player and asked them what role they are going to play in their next game, do yo think that person is going to say support? Most likely not.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-07T18:35:43.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Class updates always majorly screw up the champions involved.
