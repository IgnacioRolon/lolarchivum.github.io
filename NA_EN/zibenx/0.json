My PC isn't the best but when i turn off my setting's and do some stuff ive seen in videos i can get a solid 30-40 fps which makes no lag nothing even when spells get activated... Though for some reason some times in my game i get like lag spikes for 20 seconds that drop to like 4-9 fps which is freaking impossible to play in since I play nidalee with my friend and then i cant hit a damn spear...
