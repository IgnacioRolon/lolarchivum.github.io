Its really hard to buy champions now with the new rework and people rarely get chests, it'll get really boring quickly with only so little champions","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-13T05:47:22.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm glad to see someone trying to bring everyone together to see how the community feels overall about these changes, but it may go pretty unnoticed here in H&S.

The shard deals I would have to give up on the potential gains of the 960 for the 4800 and 1260 for 6300","replies":[]},{"poster":"league dead game","date":"2017-11-13T15:16:56.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would prefer a rollback do the old system","replies":[]}]}
