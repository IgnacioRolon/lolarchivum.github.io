The shop that I had before when i opened it is different than the options i have now. I would like to know why that is. Is it a completely randomized system? If so thats very disappointing because I would have bought 2 of the skins i had access to at discounted prices but now I'm not sure i want any of the skins. If there could be any clarification on the subject that would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-19T21:08:56.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the shop came back up after the bug, the offers were just refreshed.
