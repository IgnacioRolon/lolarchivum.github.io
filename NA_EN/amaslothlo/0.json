This is fair? I mean I was nearly honor 3 and it took forever and y'all just take it away because some troll reports me? It's clear this punishment system is not reading the entire scripts. What is this game coming to, no wonder there is so many trolls out there. They are low lives instigating crap to get them punished and it's working. My days here are numbered.","replies":[]}
