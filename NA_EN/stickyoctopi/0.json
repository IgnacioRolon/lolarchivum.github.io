I just LOVE repeating myself!\n\nHere's what RiotLyte had to say about it -\n> One of our philosophies is to try to not dictate what's OK or not OK in League of Legends unless we absolutely have to. We rely on data like Reports, Honors, social media, the Instant Feedback System and Tribunal to help determine the standards of what the community believes is OK or not OK. This is why all of our systems are intentionally designed to be community-driven, because we want players to have the ability to invest in and shape their own community. In saying this, looking at the data, \"GGEZ\" is considered a negative term, and is reportable. Players generally agree that the phrase is rarely used in a positive context, and is a pretty sour way to end a match.\n\n[SAUCE](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132069455298)\n\n\nhttp://www.reactiongifs.com/r/7844598.gif\n\nSorry?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterSomething","date":"2016-04-10T01:49:32.847+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It tilts, at the minimum level though.\n\nThe main things were \"retard shit\" that flagged it and the word \"cancer\".","replies":[{"poster":"SikhRS","date":"2016-04-10T02:35:20.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Alright, I'll address each of the comments one by one. \n\n\"GG EZ is technically a player saying stuffs to another like \"LOL THANKS FOR THE EZ WIN, YOU FKING LOSER HAHA\"\"\n\nThat's an over-exaggeration. \"ggez\" translates to \"good game it was easy\".

I'll elaborate more at the end.\n\n\"GGEZ shows total disrespect to your opponents, and is not in any way sportsmanlike at all. Its only meant to insult and degrade your opponents.\"\n\nIt's what the person thinks about the game. If the shoe fits, then wear it. Why was the game easy? Did the team not work together? Did someone miss too many skill shots or get caught out? \"ggez\" does not single anyone out itself. (The person who said ggez in this case did single out mumu in this case which was a step too far, but what I'm arguing is that term itself).\n\n\"It tilts, at the minimum level though. The main things were \"retard shit\" that flagged it and the word \"cancer\".\"\nI agree it's not the nicest way to end a game, and I'm not defending the guy who said it.
