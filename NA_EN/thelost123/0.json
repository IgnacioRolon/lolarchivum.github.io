MY TEAM WAS WINNING and yet for some reason three other players decided to bully me for not only accidentally choosing the wrong character but apparently taking kills from them...I cant honestly give two giant turds about this game and had a better time typing to the other team than I did my own. The fact is not that I forgot about the game itself but the fact that I was mercilessly targeted by three players for no reason even while we were winning! they threw racist,sexual, suicidal, mental and physical bullying threats at me and the other player on my team the entire game. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST NOR THE LAST TIME, me and millions of other players have played at least ten or more games with someone either on their own team or on the the other team throwing slander and hate in our direction. I hate to say it Riot...league of legends until you get your act together and start monitoring your game better your fan base is going to keep leaving because they feel harassed and honestly I dont want to play your game ever again due to how horrible people are... I want this to be an eye opener for any devs or site managers to see so if you want post your story about how you were bullied on this game and maybe the game devs will see how they have neglected their players....and if you troll well...your only helping this post. vote on the poll if you want as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2016-09-23T14:55:25.448+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot is the only game company I have seen that actively, consistently, and visibly removes players from their game for harassment, verbal abuse, griefing, and/or bullying.

Bullying is out of control, but not in league of legends. Bullying is out of control everywhere. Schools, workplaces, the internet. Anywhere not in direct vision of someone who is paid and trained to stop it is filled with bullying, and that is how the world is right now. It isn't right, it isn't good, but its the truth. At least in league you have an automated system watching everything that can deal with issues, learn about new issues, and works quickly relative to all other options, and will only get faster over time.\n\nIf you want to try to avoid toxicity altogether, there are a lot of guides but basically:\n1: Queue up with friends if you can.\n2: Be as visibly positive in the chat as you can if you want to talk at all.\n3: Mute anyone that is toxic on first sight.\n4: Report toxicity at the end of each game.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-09-23T16:13:21.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Definitely have to agree.

Especially during raid and endgame content. Hell I've even seen toxic people in starting zones or leveling areas who feel the need to shit all over you or piss on your dead dog if they could. If you try to pug a raid, you'll mostly likely end up with one or two toxic players who spew slurs at you or refuse to listen and kick you for no reason. Even had a buddy kicked from a raid despite being the highest DPS only because he told the RL his strategy was terrible (which it was, he didn't understand the mechanics at all and thought we could just DPS the boss down without moving. Needless to say that raid group gave up after 3 tries of constantly dying). The thing is, in Wow it's a lot easier to ignore assholes like that because you're either in a guild and don't worry about random players, or you don't have to stick with them for 20+ minutes unlike League. Hell you don't even need the chat anymore in WoW. So the toxic players are a lot less transparent, but trust me they still exist and are quite a pain to deal with during raid and dungeons.\n\nOW I've seen plenty. A lot of people shit-talking and cursing others using some pretty \"spicy\" language for making mistakes or wanting to play whatever hero they want. It's just a lot easier to ignore because rarely anyone pays attention to the chat in OW, but trust me it exists and there is quite a lot. \n\nHotS also has it's fair share. Even during Alpha it had plenty of toxic players who would even tell you \"KYS\" because you swapped a lane or focused on camps instead of killing heroes. Might have been some of the league players swapping over to HotS at the time, but trust me I've seen plenty of toxic players there in Alpha, Beta, and during Launch. \n\nLeague's toxicity is a lot more visible because of the reason you're stuck with that player for the whole game, and also because the chat does serve a pretty big function to communicating. Doesn't mean it's the only game with a toxicity problem, but Riot as a company so far is definitely the most active and visible when it comes to combating that issue. \n\nBlizzard does its fair share, but they aren't as worried about it as Riot is mostly for the reasons I suggested above. Chat doesn't serve a huge function in OW or HotS. In WoW it kind of can, but most players have addons and pull timers to communicate. Whereas league if you ping it gets thrown into chat, any notice is put into the chat, and sometimes if you don't have a ping that works for what you want you tend to have to use the chat. Also I still remember a time where we didn't even have this many pings, so Riot is definitely working hard towards reducing the need for chat but still allowing for lots of communication.","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2016-09-23T17:24:54.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Desolas Arterius,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UEsAy0TY,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2016-09-23T17:19:55.112+0000)\n>\n\n1) I hit endgame on WoW. I didn't see much toxicity. I saw many stupid plays, but that isn't the same thing. Note that was a healer and healers are known for being bashed on along with tanks.\n\n2) Overwatch has little toxicity. There is clearly some, but it's over things that are fixable by one action. Playing intelligently. People here refuse to do such a thing if it means swallowing their pride.\n\n3) I don't talk in heroes of the storm that much, if ever. I never had a problem. League of Legends somehow managed to force me to talk. I wonder why?\n\nLeague is not comparable to WoW. WoW has a larger chat system and I didn't use mods on WoW. The only thing that bothered me about WoW is the forums. The toxicity there is overwhelming. However, when a game toxicity can beat forum toxicity, something is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-09-23T17:51:11.730+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1: I've been playing since Vanilla +Endgame. Trust me there is plenty of toxicity. It's just much easier to ignore. I main a healer and tank (Paladin), so I get double the brunt of the toxicity. It's just easier to ignore it and honestly doesn't bother me because I only get it if I have to pug on off days for my guild. So it's not constant for me and again, I just use a lot of addons so typing isn't needed for me to play the game. If I need to chat with my guild I just hop on TS. Again though, toxicity is still pretty much there and I see it quite a lot whenever I pug. It's just waaaay easier to ignore compared to league because chat isn't needed in WoW. \n\n2: It's there, just again, easier to ignore **because no one really pays attention to the chat anyways except at the result screen**. Chat isn't needed in an FPS game, hence why it isn't an always present window on your screen. You only need the pings or the voice coms if anything. Which speaking of voice coms, I've had my fair share of hearing people yell out some nasty slurs randomly over coms because of a bad play or something meaningless. It doesn't just exist in League. It's just easier to see in League.\n\n3: There isn't a need to talk in HotS like I said. Hasn't stopped people from acting toxic before though, but it's just not as visible as League is because of how the coms revolve around the chat. \n\nI don't entirely understand why you're bashing the league community so much. I mean yeah, there are some pretty toxic people in league, but the same goes for every game. Forums or not toxic people will always exist. It just depends on how visible they are compared to others. Chat is the easiest way to spew toxicity, and like I said League does focus a lot on chat for communication compared to the other games I listed. \nAlso, Wow is still technically compared to League since they're both social environment type of games. However, WoW nowadays really doesn't need chat except for in Trade Channel (if you can dig through the thousands of spam posts). The game has become simplified and streamlined for new players, so chat isn't really needed as it used to be. League still does need the chat to function unfortunately, and that's why toxicity is a lot more visible in game compared to WoW. Because in WoW you can leave a group without facing a penalty if someone is toxic or acting like an asshole. You can leave a raid or whatever and simple carry on your way or find a new group. League you can't really do that. So it only feels like it's more toxic, but really they aren't that different.\n\nAlso, the LoL Boards are mostly filled with Memes or people whining about unjust bans/punishment/nerfs/buffs/whatever they feel like complaining about this week. Sounds similar to WoW Boards, but even then the boards are a very small percentage of the playerbase, and the games still share the same amount of toxicity. All that matters is the **visibility** of the toxicity. And because of how League works, it **looks** more toxic than WoW, but the same toxic players exist in both spaces. I mean shit look at Dota, still has a toxic playerbase (mostly suffers from elitism), it's just not as big/popular as League so everyone focuses their gaze on League's toxicity rather than other games that still harbor the problem. \n\nShit I've even met toxic players in _Destiny_ of all games. And there isn't even a chat function! (Come across some players who would purposefully fuck up fights or refuse to revive you during a strike causing your group to wipe over and over. Or if there was a mechanic involving grabbing an \"orb\" and placing it somewhere else, that person would grab the orb and run away from the objective forcing us to leave the strike if we wanted to continue).","replies":[{"poster":"rtbf221651412","date":"2016-09-23T18:03:16.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Desolas Arterius,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=UEsAy0TY,comment-id=000100010000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-23T17:51:11.730+0000)\n>\n> Snip.\n\nAll you did was bury yourself a hole.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-09-23T18:11:12.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bury myself?

You suggest that since you are stuck with people, it cannot be more toxic. The opposite is true. Since you are stuck with people, you will get extremely frustrated at their inability to play correctly. This, in turn, breeds toxicity.

Especially, when I am new to a map or make a mistake because I am learning a new champion. I just mute their pings and comments. It happens mainly in Summoner's Rift. They forget to realize, they were new once and people have to learn their champions and their roles in the map. I try muting those who I can or just let them know you're new or just tell them to stop bcs even if you get reported, admins can see you try to get them to stop with the harassment.  I don't want to vote bcs we are giving options to eliminate team and enemy threats.

The derisive way that you look down on the OP just gives me the impression that you have  a lot of free time and don't have to consider the time you spend on leisure activities carefully. \n\nThere are people that have to spend quite a bit of their day at work or at school and want to have fun playing the game. Which, given your attitude I'm not sure you realize this or not, is generally two teams playing against each other trying to win. Not 2 teams and a guy trying to see what kind of rage reaction he can get out of his team members because his/her enjoyment is derived not from the game but in the fact that he can irritate/frustrate/enrage other people without any particular consequences. \n\nThat being the case is it surprising that people get frustrated when they know that the game that they want to play and signed up for  is not something that they can do because of the frequent rate at which trolls appear. The odds of finding one on your team or the opponents team is fairly good. I'd say I find someone trying to get a reaction out of a team/deliberate feeding because they find it amusing is maddeningly common because unlike in real life where if someone tried this in a physical sport  there is no chance of being ejected from the game by the other players. The game cannot be reset and the other players really have no recourse. With the attitude of a lot of these \"internet tough guys\" I would not be surprised in the slightest that if they tried their attitude in a game of football/basketball/baseball/ a real world sport they'd piss people off to the point that they would be physically assaulted. Not that this is a good thing but it just highlights my point. The behavior even in a non-formal leisure environment would be unacceptable by most. But simply because it is online and in a video game its fine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GarenTopOrElse","date":"2016-09-23T21:59:59.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A post about ONLINE bullying.. is RIOT in charge of your self esteem too now?

If they did not place so much emphasis on their player friendly community and their willingness to enforce it, it wouldn't be an issue. But Riot often cites a friendly player experience where they carefully monitor the community for negative behaviors and actively work to inhibit them. \n\nKind of someone advertising as a bodyguard and all these reasons for hiring them but when someone walks up to mug and rob the client they stand there picking their nose, but when someone says something racially insensitive/homophobic/derogatory slurs, or starts venting near said client they come in guns blazing with a bomb squad robot strapped with .50 cal's that auto detect bad words and murders whoever says them. \n\nBasically the advertising is off and as far as player protection goes the way it appears/is is a bot system set up to detect certain behaviors that could get Riot into trouble by association i.e. racism/homophobia/hate crime related material. \n\nI have never encountered a situation where anything other than hate speech/verbal abuse/innapropriate names has ever done anything. To be honest I'd love to see some statistics on the frequency with which the various report functions lead to a disciplinary action. I'd feel pretty safe about putting money on things like intentional feeding/unsportsmanlike behavior being very very low relative to the frequency with which they occur because they are things that will not result in legal action against the company if someone tries to hold them responsible by virtue of being the platform that such things take place. \n\nAgain that is in comparison to things like hate speech/slurs/racism etc. which have had idiots taking legal action against the medium in which these actions took place i.e. forums/youtube/reddit/twitter.. Because apparently they are responsible for things that people say or do on their site. Same thing for Riot. They will focus on enforcing things that could get them into trouble legally and stuff like being unsportsmanlike/feeding will have few to no consequences because it will not affect  their bottom line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PC Trash Go Away","date":"2016-09-24T02:33:31.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really, whining about bullying anywhere is a waste of breath.
