When I go on the internet, when I play any videogame other than LoL, I never have problems with my connection (except some spikes here and there but that's normal). But when I launch LoL client, something very weird happens: I can use the client for about 30 seconds before it crashes for 1 or 2 minutes, and it keeps doing that over and over: 30 seconds, then wait 1 ~ 2 minutes, 30 seconds...\r\n\r\nSo if it was just the client I guess that would've been just a bit annoying and not much more, but at first it's very hard for me to find a game (I only have 30 seconds to queue and pick my champion, runes and masteries), and secondly the weirdest thing is that my ENTIRE connection crashes! I can't use Skype, Discord, or even watch a YouTube video, I can't use the Internet anymore for 1 to 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd It's totally the client, because when I close it everything is normal, and I never crash during a game (which is also very strange), I can play my game normally without ever getting disconnected during it, and once the Nexus falls, my connection crashes again, and blablabla.\r\n\r\nI started writing this a few weeks ago and when I wanted to make sure it really wasn't working, the problem disappeared, but now it's back and I really don't understand. I believe my drivers are updated and stuff, I don't really know what to do anymore :p\r\n\r\nSorry for writing so much and thanks for reading, if you've got any ideas or advice I'd love to hear them. Have a nice day!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-17T22:20:18.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries about writing too much, the more details the better bud!\n\nThis does actually sound rather strange. I can't think of any reason as to why the client would be able to cut off your network connection to other programs, but let's not rule it completely out. Check up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) making sure to reconfigure port forwarding and go ahead and flush your DNS as well. If that doesn't help, run a repair through the client options really quick and let me know if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dalai Kappa","date":"2017-09-27T17:17:17.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks a lot for your reply :D Actually I found out that Discord was the problem, so yeah LoL client seems working normally :p I'm really sorry I feel dumb lmao, anyway","replies":[]}]}]}
