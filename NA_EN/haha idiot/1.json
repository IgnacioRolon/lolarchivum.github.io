Welcome to the first issue of &quot;Who&#039;s the Champ for the Job?&quot; a new series in the forums that involves you, the player, to choose a champion that would be the best asset for fixing a problem in real life. I will supply the scenario, and y&#039;all vote in the comments as to which shape and skillset is right for the job.\n\nWithout further ado, here is Problem 1: Precarious Plumbing.\n\nYou drag your feet through the first-floor corridor to your apartment room after a long, hard day of work. Arriving at your door, you pull out your keys begin to unlock the door. With your key halfway inserted you notice a damp spot has spread from beneath your door, staining the carpet in about a two foot radius semicircle of wetness. Curious as to what might have caused such a spill, you turn the key, unlocking the door.\n\nThe door immediately slams open, hitting you to the side, as a wave of Olympic-size pool&#039;s worth of water and sewage crashes onto the floor before rushing down the corridor. There seems to be no end to the gush of water, and after a full minute of hanging onto the doorknob, struggling not to be whisked away by waist-deep sewage rapids, you manage to pull yourself close to the opening to get a glimpse of the far side of your room, where your bathroom is. To your horror, you see a huge hole where your toilet used to be, and what looks to be a high-tech hydraulic contraption is rapidly pumping whatever is in your plumbing pipes out into the room. You remember that you have your Walkie-Talkie to Riot Games HQ.\n\nBeep.\n\n&quot;Someone please help me! My room is being flooded by crappy water from the bathroom that&#039;s coming from-&quot;\n\n&quot;Okay, we&#039;ll send a champion of your choice over to assist you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#039;t you need the specifics? Anyway, the-&quot;\n\n&quot;No. No. That&#039;s not necessary. You know the situation best; you choose the champion you need. Due to the logistical constraints, we can only send you one champion. Please tell us who to send soon. Goodbye.&quot;\n\nYou frantically think of who to call. Looking behind you, the sewage has burst open the main entrance of the apartment and is spreading into the streets at an alarming rate. There also seems to be a strangely fluorescent, greenish fluid coming from the hole where your toilet used to be that is becoming more and more apparent as the violent pumping continues. Who do you call?\n\n**Note: Some things (besides the obvious), that need to be considered.\n\nRiot Games HQ is located approximately twenty miles away from you, and so the champion will take time to arrive based on that distance.\n\nAssume 100 units in-game equals 3 feet in real life.\n\nChampions are level six with no items, runes, masteries, or summoner spells.\n\nI will be taking a tally of the votes, and selecting the champion with the most votes. It would be appreciated if there was also a rationale for choosing a champion in each comment.**","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-08-04T00:29:22.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lissandra\n\nShe could get there somewhat quickly and freeze whatever is an immediate issue.  She could then fix anything with her never-melting ice.\n\nI'd argue Zilean going back in time to warn me to call someone earlier, but I'm not sure that's fair for this.","replies":[{"poster":"haha idiot","date":"2016-08-04T00:41:24.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, Zilean doesn't actually time travel in the game besides his rewind, which is a few seconds.
