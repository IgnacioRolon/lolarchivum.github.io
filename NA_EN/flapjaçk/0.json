I have been playing games and I did read that the RP resets everyday, but I've only gotten 8k RP once so far and after that I've got nothing. Is this a bug or do I need to play more games?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-05T23:22:20.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get that stipend when you dip below 8000 RP. There's not anything that costs more than 8k, so you should still be able to buy everything normally. Once you've used some of the RP you should get bumped back up to 8k RP the next day. \n\nWas there any specific reason you needed more than 8k RP at one time?","replies":[]}]}
