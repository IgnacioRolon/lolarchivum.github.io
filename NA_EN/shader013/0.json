A ward skin that was 213 orange essence, and I needed 214. I am really salty about not getting Project {{champion:238}} that much earlier than I wanted. Granted I recently got Championship {{champion:238}}  but I wanted to get Project Zed as well. Thank you for listening to my request.","replies":[{"poster":"Horse Grenades","date":"2016-10-18T14:10:46.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just gifted you 1000 essence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-18T04:36:08.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, but we're not able to gift you any type of essence. {{item:3070}} \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]}
