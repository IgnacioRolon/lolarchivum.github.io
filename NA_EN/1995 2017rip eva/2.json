Especially with fucking bullshit like Lucian triple procing the damned thing.\n\nADCs can get 2.0 attacks a second with little difficulty if they have an inbuilt AS steroid and a fairly normal build.  Do they really need to be hitting for ~16% of your current hp/sec, in addition to the extra damage they get from the AS and AD on it, and the fuck tons of lifesteal it provides (which, conveniently also heals for the on-hit) and the anti-kiting active?  Is 12%/sec that much worse when its 6 times better than Liandry's base effect?  \n\nHonestly, I never want to see it anywhere above 10%, which at 4% and 2.5 aa/sec you can still reach 10% current hp shred/sec without factoring in ***literally any fucking other source of damage, just the damned thing's passive*** And guess what, Lucian would still be able to use a spell, and hit you for 12% current hp-- it just wouldn't be the almost 24% he gets on live which is fucking disgusting as all hell.\n\nRemember, the spell version of this is 2% current hp per second for 3 seconds.  Additional damage also only reapplies this effect where as ADCs get the whole amount (currently 4 times higher) instantly, and without ***literally any*** damage lose from reapplying it.

For some reason I was under the assumption that his passive was 2 hits scaling for 20%/25%/30% AD, but now I see its just one for 40%/50%/60% AD.  He still absolutely abuses on-hit itemization when its paired with physical damage, but it's a little tiny bit less bullshit. \n\n> Very few ADC's build 2.5 as.\n\nGreat?  I talk about 2.5as only one time to show the max possible from a 4% BotRK, and to show how ludicrously strong 4% current hp as a passive which is priced at less than 200g fucking is.  RIOT blatantly and egregiously undervalues % hp damage and how fucking strong it is.\n\nThe rest is based on \"ADCs can get 2.0 attacks a second with little difficulty if they have an inbuilt AS steroid and a fairly normal build.\" which is absolutely true at 4-6 items. \n\n> Armor just got buffed to give more, reducing the % hp damage.\n\nBecause ADCs never get armor pen, right?  And the armor pen item that was just buffed, LDR, totally doesn't also increase the damage BotRK's on-hit does.  Additionally with items like Stoneplate tanks have been itemizing for more health, particularly in teamfights, which causes, guess what?  More damage than before, not less.  Not to mention, the armor values were barely even increased in the first place.\n\n> The spell version gives spell pen, which bork does not, meaning it also improves burst damage and gives a little extra to the sutained damage.\n\nYou mean like how you get lifesteal on BotRK and a nuke + anti-kiting active that has no parallel on the spell version?  You have attack speed, on BotRK as well as attack and it's passive for sustained damage, you have attack damage and its passive and its active for burst, plus it even has a better build path *AND* multiplicative scales off the rest of the ADC's itemization instead of having direct anti-synergy in the case of Liandry's.\n\nFuck, give Liandry's an active and spell vamp, *and* CDR then we can talk about how BotRK doesn't have a bit of flat armor pen. \n\n> Also, 16% current hp/sec is innacurate, after the first one, the second shot drops by .64% of where there HP currently was. 100 .92 .92 =/= 100 - 8 -8.\n \nNotice I had put \"~\" before the 16%?  That's an important part, you can't just ignore because you feel like it.  I literally cannot do any actual math as we don't have as information as I would need just to figure out how much damage they would hit for *in addition to* the Blade hit, let alone what sort of mitigation and hp pool we are even talking about.  It's still 8% current hp two times, but it is different from 16% of the hp at the start.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
