When I am against cutpurse twisted fate it is extremely difficult for me to tell gold card from red card.  I have to squint and specifically concentrate above tf&#039;s head for a good second or two.  This can be quite frustrating when playing against this skin even though it isn&#039;t that common.  It would be awesome if you guys could touch this up like you did Tahm&#039;s grey health.  Thanks!","replies":[]}
