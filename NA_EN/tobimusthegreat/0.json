The group stages and semifinals were not, but the finals on the other hand... well I think it&#039;s kind of obvious. Every game was so one sided, and it was back and fourth. EDG win, SKT win, EDG win, SKT win. Its not like it was a close match though, no. Every game had a clear winner from the start. Every game, either team had a huge lead. It was really what was so amateur about it. These LCS players have never &quot;acted&quot; before so Riot had to coach them through it. Specifically game 4, &quot;Hey EDG, let Koro feed so SKT wins&quot;. The players wouldn&#039;t be able to disguise a staged game without going through these motions. But anyone who thought about could see it.Why would the players be ok with this? It&#039;s ovious, they get more money! Why would Riot stage MSI finals? It&#039;s simple, FOR MONEY! Can you imagine how much more money they would make if the MSI finals went to game five?! Viewers on there twitch longer, people at the event longer, more bets being placed. And we all know how cheap Rito is *COUGH* Chroma skins *COUGH*. So if you have some thoughts on this theory please leave your opinion. I&#039;m new to the forums and hope to become more active through it. Thank you for reading to the end. Leave your comments on this subject. P.S. Sorry for any grammar mistakes ahead of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Marchy","date":"2015-05-11T02:21:44.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"you are mad you need to see a therapist or like {{champion:36}} or something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-05-11T02:14:45.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Conspiracy Theorists Unite, this guy is handing out tinfoil hats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GibonGra","date":"2015-05-12T03:37:18.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The production costs outweigh any stream revenue, and how would having people at events longer make Riot money? Riot only has the LCS and these international tournaments because it keeps people interested in the game. It indirectly makes money through champion/skin/icon sales from fans, and therefore Riot has more to gain by maintaining the scene's integrity. Even with bets, you can't actually bet enough that it would be worth Riot's time. And even if you could, someone would notice Riot getting that money and blow the whistle.\n\nThe individual games were one sided because both teams can perfectly snowball a small lead. It's part of why every analyst thinks they're the best two teams in the world.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kersh","date":"2015-05-11T03:57:57.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait so the last game was so one sided?

No.\nEveryone thought SKT would beat Najin Shield to make it to Worlds last year, Did they? No\nEveryone thought Najin Sword was going to beat SKT in Season 3 to go to the finals, did they? No\nEveryone thought Najin Shield would beat Cloud 9 making them go against Alliance for spot, did they? No.\nJust because someone thinks someone will win doesn't mean they will.\n\nEveryone in The World can believe the World will explode tomorrow? Does it mean it will? No.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Linthe","date":"2015-05-11T14:57:59.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot makes money from BETS being placed?

Dyrus is the only one who wouldn't be able to bet. but his team mates like Santorin would have been able to because he not US hes Denmark. because the fan voting for tsm is so high out of loyal fans the odds are higher then they should be SKT 1 could have made 5 times more money out of just those games on bets then what the whole thing is worth.","replies":[]}]}
