What Riot has done at PAX and it&rsquo;s employees have done on twitter is wrong. \r\n\r\nIf anyone doesn&rsquo;t know the dude from Riot recently told the community to &ldquo;Fuck off and sea lion somewhere else&rdquo; after politely messaging him on twitter. \r\n\r\nIt is disgusting that Riot is willing to stand up for this behavior. If I said the same thing to clients at my job I would be let go instantly. The customer is always right, Riot. The blatant discrimination towards members of our community as well as Rioters opinions means we should take action.\r\n\r\nSo what should we do? It&rsquo;s simple. We have to meme our way with our ingame names to raise community awareness until Riot is forced to give in. \r\n\r\nIn solidarity for the people Riot discriminated against change your name to things like &ldquo;Sea Lion22&rdquo;, &ldquo;Manbaby69&rdquo;, and &ldquo;NoWeebsTill230&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nTogether we can stop Riot. Gamers have faced many challenges before, this is just another boss fight.","replies":[]}
