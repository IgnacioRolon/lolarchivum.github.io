It looks like the last time you had 3 fragments were about 2 weeks ago, and fused into a chest.  Since then, only 2 key fragments were obtained.  I wasn't able to see anything missing here, but hopefully that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Erablier","date":"2016-08-02T18:39:19.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so it was probably just a text bug. Anyway, thanks for the help","replies":[]}]}]}
