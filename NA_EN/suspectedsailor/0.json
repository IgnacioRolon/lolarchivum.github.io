Ranked, Normal Draft) but in ARAM I can randomly get a free champion. Im not quit sure as to why this is but it worked before the Alpha Client. And I've already tried fixing my client and restarting it and such. Just wanted to know if anyone else was having these problems. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-06T02:57:01.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible that the assets for these champs is coincidentally missing. I'd recommend running a quick repair by hitting the Cog button at the top-right of the client and select the \"Initiate Full Repair\" button to see if this fixes it.\n\nLet me know what happens.","replies":[]}]}
