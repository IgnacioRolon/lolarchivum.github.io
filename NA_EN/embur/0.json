Is this fixed in new client? It's so stupid that I get remakes from this at minimum once a month. By the time I finish repairing the game is already long over and I've already got another AFK timer. I've been dealing with this problem for years how have they never fixed it?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T18:47:00.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patching server is different from the game server, so you'll always have to connect to the patching server as your first step to get back into the client.  Hot fixes and updates are going to happen and may be necessity in case of critical issues, so it should be expected.  The best way to resolve this is by fixing whatever is causing you to leave the game or disconnect from the client, so cases like this don't come up.  \n\nYou should run through the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help tune up anything that would cut you off from the game server.  Let me know if that clears things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Embur","date":"2017-04-08T19:48:09.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if something worked or not I doubt it. I've repaired my client before and it happens randomly, like 2 times per patch or so. I get no warning previously that it will happen I will just be loading in for a ranked game and instead of the loading screen I get a black screen saying I've been disconnected. I reconnect 3 times with the same happening. Then I have to relog and I have to repair. It's caused way too many remakes for me and AFK timers and I'm sick of it. Please fix this or give me some step by step to fix it myself that will actually work, not like one that support has given me in the past AKA \"reinstall or play a custom game every time you open the client\" which is completely ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-08T20:46:30.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A reinstall is not going to solve this because your issue indicates a connection problem, not your game files.  This is further affirmed by black screens because it's failing to download assets.  You'll want to go over each step of that guide to get this fixed up and back into a game.  You can also test it out in a custom game to prevent any further penalties.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Embur","date":"2017-04-20T20:00:42.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing worked so I quit for about 2 weeks, I haven't played since my last reply I made. I played one game first time today and my computer blue screens. This game is unplayable for me. I want to play but I get remade every single time I try to play. Beyond frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
