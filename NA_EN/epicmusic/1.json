Preseason ranked does effect placements since it's all about your mmr. Even in preseason your mmr fluctuates. \n\nSo by allowing people to start flex early there won't be a shit ton of people in silver and bronze only at the start","replies":[{"poster":"EpicMusic","date":"2016-11-10T17:44:13.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so are you saying that this is just for flex? so what are they gonna base our solo/duo mmr then? from scratch? lol gl to me","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2016-11-10T23:31:17.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"solo is going to be just the way it is now.

You don't say end plat 1. play placements in preseason start g1. placements to season 7 start s1.  No.\n\nNever mind the fact that if you are plat you could make it back from gold one pretty quickly but they take your end of season mmr and your preseason mmr into account (still less than seasons mmr) for your placements into S7. \n\nThe preseason can be helpful though as if you get a rank higher than you did in season 6 the system will take that into account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EverTokki","date":"2016-11-10T06:02:12.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea why placements, it's probably because of the new ranked queue (flex) but it's useless.
