However when i am about 1-2 mins in the game then my whole screen turns black and i am literally not able to do anything with my computer. Im not able to alt+tab or even ctrl+alt+del to close the game.  I don't understand why this is happening now cause i have been playing league on this computer for 3 years now. It seems to have started right after this most recent patch.  If anyone else had this problem could they please help me. I just started getting into the game again and then this happens lol","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-06-09T18:44:20.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's really strange.
