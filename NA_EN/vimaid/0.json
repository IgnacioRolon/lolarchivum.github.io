I have not been banned or chat restricted or anything.  This is one toxic game out of the hundreds that If I said something in chat it was something nice even if I was losing.  \r\nIf you were banned or chat restricted it was probably over MULTIPLE GAMES. I doubt that one game is what got you the ban. I have seen the action against box several times and sometimes  I see it after another game. it was probably after multiple instances of you being toxic  not just one.\r\n\r\nThere are those brave souls who just don't type no matter how tilted they are which is something I should pick up honestly. Yes I was toxic in this one game,however its one game outta many I slipped up and if they were to give me a chat restricion I would say yah no I deserved that. \r\nIm giving this example to show its not that one game that gets you banned its the many that you ruin simply by pressing enter every single game.","replies":[{"poster":"Eedat","date":"2019-12-22T05:52:23.898+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure \"banned deserved\" posts are not allowed.

Why create features like muting and blocking if instead you report them and they WILL get banned 99% of the time? Useless features at that point!\n\nits because riotgames is tencent and tencent is connected to the chinese government which is called communist party china..... and we all know how leftwingers love to punish those using words more than bad behaviour..... this comment will most likely be deleted because its somehwat political of nature pobably even though its why the punishment system is what it is...... the mod trolls delete anything they disagree with....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RyzeRework","date":"2019-12-22T09:30:15.389+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hmmm I dont think you meant to say wrong because he IS correct.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nørth","date":"2019-12-22T14:03:40.292+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":">If you were banned or chat restricted it was probably over MULTIPLE GAMES.

Just this single offence got me straight to 1 step away from a perma. Not gonna argue about whether it's deserved or not, but it does show that the system can really be that sensitive.\n\nAlso a guy in a Discord server I'm in has had multiple accounts suspended with shit like \"fuck your god\" on the Turkish server, but he's got friends that would do that exact same thing and haven't ever gotten even chat restricted, let alone suspended. So not only can the system be very sensitive, it seems to be so inconsistently.","replies":[]}]}
