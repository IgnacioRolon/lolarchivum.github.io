It appears they haven't changed much. \r\n\r\n-They are still playing favorites with nerfs and buffs.\r\n\r\n-They still balance the game around LC$.\r\n\r\n-The game direction they are taking league towards is the flashy oriented gameplay, rather than strategy.\r\n\r\nSome people appreciate this but its not why I fell in love with league. Hopefully next season something changes in what I consider a better direction, In the mean time ill be playing Hearthstone.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Pacman","date":"2016-01-20T05:18:15.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, This is the most bait post I have ever seen, but since im bored i'll bite.\n\nFirst off how the hell did you catch up on the game so fast after a season gone. I miss one set of patch notes and im confused as fuck let alone 10 plus a preseason patch which changed like 8 champs. \n\nSecondly I believe Riot has stated multiple times that they don't favs with nerfs/buffs.  Hell they even had a discussion with the community and one of the rioters said \"I have never heard the balance team say anything on the lines of, lets not buff/nerf this champ because I/we like them\"\n\nRiot has also talked about why they sometimes look to the LCS for balance help, however they have also stated that they don't balance the game around LCS.  the LCS simply has an environment where you can see a champs power without their mechanical skill being a problem to reach that power.\n\nAlso the LCS doesnt make them money. And even if it has gotten big enough by now to start making money (which I very much doubt), the money from the LCS would be chicken feed to RP sales.\n\nThat last point is more personal opinion so I can't refute it however in my opinion the game has tons of strategy.\n\nWhy the hell are you still following league if you straight up left for a season and are planning to skip the next one. If you don't like the game then don't waste time on it.\n\nDon't know why you fell in love with league but if you play hearthstone in the mean time then it means you weren't playing for balance or the free to play aspects.\n\nDamn I swallowed that bait hook line and sinker. Was fun at least.","replies":[]}]}
