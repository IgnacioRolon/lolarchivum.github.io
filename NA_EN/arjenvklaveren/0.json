Per a recent post on the client boards, our current work around is to perform the following steps:\n\n- Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system \n- Open user.cfg with notepad\n- Change the line that says leagueClientOptIn = yes to leagueClientOptIn = no \n- Save and launch League of Legends again.\n\nOur client devs are investigating a fix for this, so when you have a chance feel free to share your report in the linked thread.
