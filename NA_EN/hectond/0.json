I do not know will it work if the patch was different, but it's still worth a shot. It worked for me, and this method will help youtubers a ton.\n\nAnyways, here's how I usually do it.\n\n> Replays are saved in the folder Documents\\League of Legends. In that folder, there is a folder 'replays' and a folder 'highlights'. If you open the folder 'replays' you will see the file that contains an entire game. If you open the folder 'highlights' you will see all the highlights of a game you recorded in the client. The files in the folder 'highlights' can be played in your webbrowser or by using a media player such as VLC. The files in the folder 'replay' can be started by right clicking, 'open with....'. Then open the file with League of Legends.\n\nPosted by : sander599 (EUW)\nTaken from : http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/wEg0ZKAA-how-to-start-replays-with-a-cmd-or-batch-command\n\n\n\nEh... hope it'll help you :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH Usopp","date":"2016-12-05T21:00:45.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I would like to know as well, but I feel like it's something they already intend to fix before the new client is finalized. There's a lot of things that aren't complete on it yet like Ranked Teams, or the \"bonus modes\" like One For All, or the login music.\n\nBut I think (hope) that they'll maybe add it to the \"Collection\" area where you view your masteries and champions and whatnot.","replies":[{"poster":"HectonD","date":"2016-12-06T02:42:01.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad thing is: I don't get response, even tell me they won't.","replies":[]}]}]}
