The game is mainly played via poke and harass (all things which were TAKEN from her), not by going ham right off the bat. When will they realize that? There are assassins for this role and Cass lacks the burst and mobility to be one.\n\nHer overall performance is far too delayed and entirely unreliable since there's no guarantee you'll ever reach lategame.

So as new Cassiopeia, this should have been the ideal scenario: Free lane I can use to scale hard into the late game. Turns out that instead I discovered a major flaw in Cassiopeia's new passive.\n\nIt turns out that new Cassiopeia has an insanely difficult time getting stacks of her passive without an enemy champion to stack her passive with.\n\nThink of it this way: With no enemy champion in lane to deal with, Cassiopeia has to rely on last hitting poisoned minions in order to get her stacks. So I need to last hit 400 minions that are poisoned before hitting max stacks. That's the rough equivalent of getting about 1200 stacks on Nasus' Q in a free lane. That's insane.\n\nI actually was delighted whenever the enemy jungler or top laner was forced to appear in my lane because I could get 10-20 stacks quickly, as opposed to having to farm that out through CS.\n\nObviously this is a huge outlier, given that it's a 4v5, but the implications of this are simple: You can almost completely shut down Cassiopeia's late game power by not ever getting close enough to her to let her poison you. If you're willing to let her get a free, non-harassed lane, then Cassiopeia will never hit her late game hypercarry status. Fighting Cassiopeia in lane and letting her trade is what will let her stack her passive.\n\nI think the passive should be adjusted so that letting Cassiopeia farm an empty lane is dangerous for the enemy team. Maybe give her two stacks per poisoned minion kill, and decrease the rate of stack gain for putting poison on enemy champions, or something similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-10T21:06:42.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's both.\n\nIt's a nerf to her early game and a buff to her late game. They wanted to shift her identity from a lane-bully that punishes positional mistakes (and has the ability to all-in you after she softens you up first) to that of an AP-based hypercarry that bides her time before she can 1v5 the entire enemy team and get a pentakill.\n\nHer laning phase is a lot less safe now and she requires a significant amount of babysitting from her jungler, particularly if the enemy jungler is aware of Cassiopea's hypercarry capabilities and camps mid to prevent her from reaching her potential.\n\nIf you thought Cassiopea was team-reliant before (given that you're a short-to-mid-range immobile mage), this is even worse now. Especially in late game, your team needs to protect you because your only form of self-peel is your ult, and it's easy for the enemy to juke.\n\nOn the upside, if you manage to farm a couple of items (any two of the following: DFG/Zhonya/Rabadon's/Abyssal/Void Staff), and you have at least 75 stacks, you can now 1v1 anyone (even the enemy ADC) except for assassins or high-burst mages (unless you catch them face-first with your ult). The heal on your E lets you survive the consistent damage of a bruiser, tank, support or ADC, so your only concern is burst (and CC; CC is always a concern for you).\n\nOh, and managing your mana is now something you need to put some thought into. Don't buy Tear or Chalice; you need to rush your big ticket items as soon as possible, which means that you need to take advantage of your E's ability to restore you mana when it kills something. It must become second nature to you to, after a teamfight, go into the jungle or a big enemy wave, throw down a poison and then E yourself back to full health and full mana. This also means you need to think about last-hitting minions in lane with E (which is a good way to mitigate the damage of harass-heavy opponents like Ziggs, Syndra and Orianna). If you're careful, you will never run out of mana, and once you get 75 stacks (which should be your most immediate goal), you can start using minions as a source of health (much like an ADC with lifesteal).","replies":[{"poster":"MugyvrNinja","date":"2014-09-11T00:08:47.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Playing her to reach that 75 stack thresh hold is key to {{champion:69}} for sure and I don't think rushing tier would be a bad investment at all because she gains mana apposed to her max mana and she is pretty spammy so you can stack up the tier pretty easy, by the time the tier is fully stacked you should have a deathcap and a void staff making her the carry she is, that is to say that you farmed appropriately and got the rest of your stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-09-11T00:15:45.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with rushing Tear is that you come back to lane with 700 gold's worth of nothing offensive or defensive (or mobile, or sustain-y), while your opponent has something like Amplifying Tome + Boots or Null Mantle + Flask.\n\nWith how weak Cassio's new early game is and how she's going to get camped by the enemy jungler, I'd advise against a Tear.

I don't see Cassiopeia being aggressive in lane in the early phases of the game any way so buying something  like a deathcap first defeats the purpose of going for the stacks as apposed applying poison to the enemy lane and getting them that way.

Cass also naturally pushes the wave since her poisons are AoE and it's hard to harass with them without accidentally also hitting a minion (especially with W and it's expanding AoE).

Firstly, I haven't played old Cassiopeia for a *loooooong* time, and my mechanics have improved significantly since then, which can really affect how I feel on a champion. My [only game on new Cassiopeia](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1536626029/203721172) was vs. bots, and a Swain for that matter, who I think Cassio counters. Overall, I couldn't get the hang of old Cassiopeia last time I played her, but I had a lot of fun on the new Cassiopeia. I think others are right in saying her lane bullying has been reduced significantly; I predict against vs heavy harass lanes you should have a harder time, but you scale really well into late game, and building stacks isn't too difficult. I think you can sort of compare her to Ryze; play safer early and scale into late game where you deal massive DPSs. I don't know if old Cassiopeia players will like her, especially if the reason they played her was for the lane bullying, but she seems like a pretty strong late game champion so far.\n\nFor the most part I followed [Faker's build](http://www.probuilds.net/guide/KR/1488308143/1135567) on the new Cassiopeia, Tear -> RoA, maxing Q first, E second (Faker has [another build available](http://www.probuilds.net/guide/KR/1488178693/1135567) where he maxes E first, though assuming he modified his build accordingly, I assume the former skill order is preferable, since the former is his second game on Cassiopeia, where he modified the skill order). Two things I noticed about maxing Q first; it might cut your damage early game, but you are *far* less mana hungry, since your E gets very costly before you get a few items. I didn't have any mana problems after the very early game following this build. Also, at 90 mana a pop, I doubt you'll get many Es off unless you have the mana pool to support it (it's also technically more mana efficient at lower levels; 90 mana for 3 Es, 165 + 3(40% AP) vs 1 E, 155 + (60% AP). Of course you have higher DPS with max E, but it you probably won't have the mana pool to support it early game; E spam also helps you stack more quickly). Second, you get to use E more, which means more stacks on your passive. I think I managed the first tier of her passive (75 stacks) at about 5 minutes, and this was me CSing at like, 50% efficiency (had about 25 CS, but you can double proc your stacks by hitting poisoned champs with E). Once you get better at CSing with poison and with E, you should be in really good shape in terms of your stacks early game.\n\nOverall, I don't know if this can conclusively be called a nerf or buff; certain aspects of her were nerfed, and others were buffed, resulting in a pretty different playstyle. She seems able to harass early game, but don't expect to get lvl 2 solo kills like you can on some champions. I think her overall playstyle feels a lot like Ryze; you deal more DPS than burst, so you can lightly harass fairly well, but you're probably not going to all in pre lvl 6 unless you're really confident. Also, you don't have to chase kills, just like Ryze (though you *can*, since you have bonus MS and a slow), where if you scare them off just so you can CS and stack your passive more, you just become more and more difficult for others to deal with later in the game. Looking at your stacks; tier 1 basically gives you a bit more AP and spell vamp, tier 2 is basically an Athene's or Morellonomicon, but without the mana regen (which you get from other items), and tier 3 is basically a deathcap. Fully stacked, you basically have an extra two items late game; DPS with her E is pretty devastating late game, and also gives her really good farming through most of the game (it's sort of an extra auto attack; again, she's more geared towards DPS than burst). Ultimately, I think she's strong right now, but she plays a lot differently than she used to.","replies":[{"poster":"MrBuffington","date":"2014-09-13T16:29:57.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT (posting as a reply since the first comment reached character limit)\n\n[Another bot game](http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1539329785/203721172) with Cassiopeia, so maybe not the best measure, but it's a fairly controlled environment for judging things like damage output, imo. I tried the E first Q second build in this game. My awful CSing aside, I found that mana isn't as big a deal with this skill order as other people suggest, and I actually think it's a little easier to CS with maxing E first; you have extra damage with E that makes it easier to CS, and you get mana back with E so no worries about running oom. The improved trading with maxing E first seems like a bonus; I played a second game maxing Q first and E with 1 point is basically just an extra auto attack; very underwhelming for trading. Overall you're going to want to either favor short trades with this, or CS exclusively with your E, since you can run oom pretty quick if you use more than ~3-4 Es on a champion in a trade.\n\nBasically, you're going to need to manage mana more carefully before you get your Tear, maybe Catalyst; after that you probably won't have problems. Cassiopeia needs a little more ramp up time than say, Ryze (since he's gaining damage with his mana items), but you can probably modify the build I take (which is what I'll start to do next) to get more damage earlier (ie. go for hextech revolver/blasting wand/seeker's armguard/etc after Tear instead of Catalyst)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"You Taste Purple","date":"2014-09-10T22:22:59.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys this gives me some good insight, I mean I played it a few times and it was once I got rolling that I noticed its very very strong but that was also her prior to this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tolinar","date":"2014-09-11T04:59:51.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Nerf.
