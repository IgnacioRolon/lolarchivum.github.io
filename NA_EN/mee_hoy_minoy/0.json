Every time I'm in the loading screen and I'm at 100% I get the message \"You have been disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" So I close the message and reconnect. I wait for it to get to 100% and this time I spawn at fountain only to have the game not respond (it doesn't stop working it just has that white over the game). I have to wait around two minutes for the game to respond and when it does I have to wait even more because it's \"Attempting to Reconnect\". After all this waiting I am finally able to play the game and lane against someone with a level advantage (really fun losing lane due to something that isn't my fault). Please fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-16T04:29:25.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue definitely sounds like it's caused by an issue in your connection or network configuration somewhere.
