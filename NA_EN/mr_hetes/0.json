Unfortunately, we don't have a solid repro for this one. :c I use the Nami chroma pack often, and I've found that swapping off the chroma pack and back onto it ensures the proper chroma pack will load. It's not an ideal fix, but it's something I've found while we continue to dive into the issue.","replies":[]}]}
