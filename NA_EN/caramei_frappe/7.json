If that wasn&#039;t bad enough, our fed jungler disconnected when we _might_ of had a chance in a 4v5. \n\nWe had to surrender, just us 3 that were left ... how&#039;s this fair?\n\nThis makes me question if rank holds any value really. This isn&#039;t the first time people got mad, started to throw / do stupid things, or just rage quit because they didn&#039;t feel like playing in my line of games. Hell, I felt bad when one game had both an ADC and Support disconnect on the other team, ensuring that their allies lost. The game didn&#039;t feel satisfying, it felt like a cheap win and I knew we didn&#039;t win fairly. While this isn&#039;t Riot&#039;s fault, I just don&#039;t know if Rank could be taken seriously when stuff like this happens more often than I would like it to.","replies":[{"poster":"just OK jungler","date":"2017-06-01T13:55:57.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only in plat my dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"SnakDatSmilesBak","date":"2017-05-31T10:41:34.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/lEfmarRU-group-therapy-super-salty-mega-thread-blow-off-steam put your salt where it belongs\n\nRanked is fair because these things balance out.
