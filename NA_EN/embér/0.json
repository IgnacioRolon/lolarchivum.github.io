I tried all kinds of fixes such as flushing the dns, switching my dns, reseting router and more but none of it actually helped in any way whatsoever. I also tested a couple of my logs on your site and it reported no packet loss whatsoever. What i've noticed however is that other EU players are having the same issue so is it a serverside issue or is it ISP related ?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-22T22:12:25.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the third report I've seen in the last hour on EU regions, and I wasn't able to discover any server problems.  I'm curious if there is an ISP issue or change in routing to the game server.  When you get a chance, run a traceroute to get an overview of where your connection is going:\n\n-  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/)\n- Use 31.186.224.42 as your destination for EUNE.  (192.64.170.252 for EUW)\n\nLet it run for a few minutes and let me know what you find.","replies":[{"poster":"jam sand","date":"2016-11-23T10:34:12.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am in NA and having this exact issue any suggestions cause my ping is still around 121ms and before  i used to be around 40-74ms","replies":[]},{"poster":"Embér","date":"2016-11-22T22:37:05.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\n\nSo i downloaded the program as you said and ran the tests for both EUNE and EUW and here are the logs:\nEUNE- http://prnt.sc/dalcl7\nEUW- http://prnt.sc/dalc7i\n\nAdditionally i ran a traceroute via cmd as well and here are the results from it: \nhttp://prnt.sc/dalh00\n\nUPDATE: \nI just went for a custom game and the ping seems to have returned to normal.

Your best bet would be to reach out to your ISP and let them know about this drop, and share the results of your traceroute with them.  I've also removed your net analyzer, as it has personal information not worth having through the boards.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
