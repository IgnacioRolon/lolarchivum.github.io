They make sex, but they don't make it for fun or love. They just do it for their benefits. It is like a secret weapon for them. Why would you kill someone who you had fun with him/her anyway? Even if they're not asexual, they're pretty aromantic.\n\nSo, I think Ahri and Evelynn are asexual (or aromantic). Highly active asexuals. Ahri seems more emotinal though.

Many men have fallen prey to her allure - or simply fallen prey. Perhaps the most recent and unbelievable was that gypsy rogue, the huckster they call Twisted Fate.\n\n> The pair was first romantically linked earlier this year when they appeared together at the opening ceremonies of the Zaun Glowlight Festival. They were spotted once again at the League of Legend's Fan Appreciation Celebration. That's not to mention the many occasions this reporter has found them out for a quiet night together... but it appears that the pair does not see eye to eye.\n\n> \"Our time is pleasant,\" said Evelynn. \"But it is nothing serious. Nothing lasts forever. Well, almost nothing.\"\n\n> Twisted Fate's feelings were clearly in a different place. \"I'm a man who believes in keeping his options open. But sometimes you've got to take a chance, and that blue-skinned beauty is worth gambling on.\"\n\n> Sources close to the couple have claimed that vicious battle arena fighting on opposite teams has taken its toll on their relationship - and on nearby city streets outside of the Fields of Justice. It seems likely that Evelynn will once again eat the heart of her lover, creating yet another eligible bachelor in the League.\n\nFrom Issue 10\n\n> As this reporter shared several issues ago, the relationship of the blue-skinned beauty Evelynn and the gypsy rogue Twisted Fate has certainly had its share of ups and downs. On Sunday, it hit its final down.\n\n> What started out being a romantic couple's walk through Granoa Park in Demacia went cold just before sundown. Nearby sources claim that Evelynn simply dropped the bomb in the middle of a conversation, leaving Twisted Fate shocked and dismayed. She then kissed him gently on the neck and walked into the growing shadows.\n\n> Evelynn has so far been unavailable for comment. Rumors abound regarding the reason for the break-up, however. Sources close to the Widowmaker claim that this was a perfectly normal break-up for Evelynn, while others claim that there is some lucky soul waiting in the wings for her affections. The truth, as always, will come out.\n\n> This reporter managed to catch up with Twisted Fate at the Accursed Trinket, a disreputable bar in Zaun. While it seemed that Fate was open to the idea of an interview, particularly in exchange for help with his bar tab, the champion was unable to form coherent sentences. It seems that this reporter caught him long after many drinks had been downed. After what sounded like a heartfelt expression of loss (although he could have just as easily been asking for help to the bathroom), he passed out, fell off his stool, and flatulated loudly. It's this reporter's opinion that he is not taking the break-up well.\n\n> It certainly seems that the Bachelormaker has struck again! More as this develops.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-07-29T03:52:58.073+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kitcat300,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mPdaA2Kz,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-07-29T03:46:35.036+0000)\n>\n>and Evelynn is a champion who embodies that to the fullest\n\n(Mr Sulu voice)\nOh my.\n\n>\"I'm a man who believes in keeping his options open.

I remember because I was collecting all the available lore on Evelynn.\n\nFrom Issue 6\n\n>A certain pair of League champions were the talk of the evening after their scintillating display of dance expertise last month at the Royal Masquerade Ball, Demacia's yearly costumed carnival. Evelynn and Twisted Fate cleared the floor dancing a sultry tango, surprising guests from all over Valoran.\n\n>The Journal of Justice was lucky enough to be invited to observe a private dance session with the spicy couple. From our observations, it’s a no brainer why tango is the dance of choice for this couple. As they tore up the floor, their eyes never left each other, and the heat of their close embrace scorched the curtains of the ballroom. Watching Evelynn’s leg snake around Twisted Fate as he led her around the dance floor was enough to understand why this couple regularly ends up at the mercy of one Ram Steed.\n\n>Twisted Fate explained their choice of dance: “Tango is the dance style that best expresses our relationship - we aren’t just dancing; we’re competing with every step, dip, and spin.”\n\n>Evelynn and Twisted Fate are currently guest instructors at the Crown Dance Academy in Demacia. If you’re lucky, you might score a spot in their extremely popular class, though beware - many students have been seen fleeing out the front door after inciting jealousy while pressing too closely to either instructor!\n\nI'm actually not sure if Journal of Justice lore is still canon or not.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shadowkirby14","date":"2016-07-29T02:48:18.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that their relationship's no longer canon due to the retcon, however I have my suspicions that Evelynn and TF might have some kind of an encounter before once she receives her VGU.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digielf","date":"2016-08-02T10:47:04.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Evelynn is a pantsu no waifu , it was confirmed by Moobeat on surrenderat20 a while ago","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2016-08-02T16:06:06.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DoflamingoGT,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=mPdaA2Kz,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2016-08-02T10:47:04.939+0000)\n>\n> Evelynn is a pantsu no waifu \n\nI don't know what that means exactly but I like it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2016-07-30T18:35:35.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who knows.
