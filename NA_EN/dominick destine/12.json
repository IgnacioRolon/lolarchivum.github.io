I tried Lolreplay but it was buggy as hell so I am looking for an alternative but am scared I could get perma banned. I found someting called &quot;LoL summoner information&quot; but it looks like it has a bunch of bells and whistles that may be considered banworthy.\r\n\r\nAll I want is a replay system, I don&#039;t care about anything else. Is there one approved of by Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"DingleNutsMcGee","date":"2016-01-17T00:57:32.149+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"replay.gg. you sign up first and when u wanna watch a replay, you go to that website again.
