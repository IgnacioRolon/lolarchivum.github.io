She'll lose some DPS, sure, but she won't lose her E for the rest of the teamfight. That means she can position more safely in teamfights and just hit the tanks, instead of being forced to chase after whichever target she poisoned. Of course, that doesn't mean anything when you simply don't deal damage, period -- but again, a numbers thing.\n\nI'd also like to point out, any champion can be made viable by numbers buffs alone. The issue is whether those champions are healthy enough that Riot is *willing* to give them balanced numbers. We can't really answer that question until we see Cass in a balanced state, at which point we can ask ourselves whether that looks healthy.\n\nAwaiting 6.10, over and out","replies":[{"poster":"ProfDrDeath","date":"2016-05-09T06:41:45.278+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Awaiting 6.10, over and out\n\nFor Cass, I'd probably say she will not be wholly fixed in 6.10 - rather, I think that it will take till 6.11 or 6.12.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Battlecast Sona","date":"2016-05-09T06:44:34.357+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the benefit of the changes overall for Cass will be that her passive is no longer a confusing, ridiculous mess of gating mechanics intended to keep her from being a bully.

Grounded may not be functioning exactly as it should (I think W needs no minimum range, honestly, as the primary issue it has is that it removes Cassi's ability to deal with melee range divers...) but the debuff itself has a lot of potential. Her E no longer requiring the poison to have a short CD but rather doing good damage I think is also really nice for Cassi's spell rotations - she no longer loses her E for the remainder of a fight if she hits an unpoisoned target, she just does less damage.\n\nCurrently she's a sustained damage caster with decent CC and mobility tools, but her damage I think is too low. Perhaps base damage scaling on her E that effects the boosts the non-poison damage a bit? Higher ratios on E and W (the ratio on Q already got buffed pretty considerably) would probably help her take advantage of having an additional item. I think they've finally got her kit into a place where numbers changes won't be as polarizing as they were previously (where buffs would make her unbearable but nerfs made her worthless), but it will really depend on where they go from here.","replies":[{"poster":"Serpents Embrace","date":"2016-05-10T01:58:45.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd really have to disagree on the E.

That was the most important use case because it's the one that helped you survive. Also, doesn't the current iteration not give sight? So throwing it over terrain without that means that you're only going to get any value out of it if you're helping a teammate. She's not a support, but it seems that everything utility they let her keep is really only useful for helping SOMEONE ELSE, since she's too weak to capitalize on it.\n\nAnd I really just can't agree about the E. The current iteration is the dumbest garbage I've seen since the last time they reworked her. It does nothing alone, so the low base cooldown means nothing. The damage you get from it, even when they're poisoned, barely breaks through regeneration until late late late in the game. You can't harass. You struggle to farm with it. You can rarely help in team fights (you can...stun with your R maybe, that's about it). You just can't do anything. Even just the fact that you can't double tap someone with it after a Q in lane to harass with Thunderlord's means that it severely hampers her ability to have any presence early. And that's bad. If she doesn't have the ability to attempt to win a lane she will keep up with this 36% win rate trash. Right now, it's basically Pick Cass mid -> lose lane -> lose game or get carried.\n\nI'd be happy with them reverting everything, then going back to the drawing board. Serpentine Grace is a nice idea. Revisiting her Q's scaling or damage or whatnot to make it less powerful harass early is great. But all they've done with this is completely punish anyone who plays Cass by red taping up all her abilities that she can't function.

Lost the vision, minimum cast rangelast shorter, can't cast over walls, got 22 seconde cool down!  And for all those nerfs, what do we get? Wow the new spell can ground champions and is bigger...\n\nI use W to slow enemy, farm / harass because low cool down and vision. Now I can't do any of these well.\n\nAlso E does no dmg without Q. Now you must use a combo do some dmg. And because of the longer cd you can't hit your enemy more than 2-3 times. \nE is useless alone. You are dead vs melee now if you miss Q. \n\nAnd the movement speed passiv... Yeah have 6 items is nice but I don't always get 6 items. Also the old passive gave me bonus Ap%\n\nAnd please please for the love of medusa. Make the poison less confusing. The visual effects are kinda worse now. Poison effects are smaller.
