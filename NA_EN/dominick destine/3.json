'unique' people that think I am banned. It becomes increasingly amusing with each one.\n\nFor those unable to follow the plot , let me spell it out; I was hit with a zero-to-permaban about 7 months ago and after some back-and-forth, it was overturned... however I was extremely displeased with Riot's complete radio silence on the issue. I didn't even know what I had been permabanned for until days after it happened, I received no chat logs until even later than that.\n\nEven after it was overturned I still wasn't told what happened.... today (Well yesterday now) Riot Tantram has finally given me what I wanted from the first moment this happened, information. I am not currently banned but I was briefly paranoid because of the recent permaban wave coupled with what seemed to be a random permaban that hit my account by a seeming rogue Riot agent.\n\nThis has been shown not to be the case, my account is fine, I was not falsely permabanned, Riot did nothing wrong.
