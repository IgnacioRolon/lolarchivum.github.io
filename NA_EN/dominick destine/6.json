It sucks knowing that your favorite character simply *can not* be a viable pick beyond trashing scrubs simply because Riot didn't realize they were moving away from point-n-click abilities when they did Sona's first rework. If Sona's strong, she gets nerfed...to the point where literally 100 percent of her value comes from her synergy with builds, not anything in her kit. THAT'S the problem. Her kit's garbage, save her ult, but her synergy with things in the game has the potential to be strong, so Riot nerfs her, but that just makes her feel worse to play.
