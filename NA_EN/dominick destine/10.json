I'm NOT saying that.... what I am saying , by Riot's own admission he was NOT designed to be a primary healer like Soraka or Nami ...., which is fine that makes perfect sense, but he is saddled with primary healer mana costs for some insane reason and again, this is because POTENTIALLY, his heal can hit 5 people with 3 charges doing a pretty decent team heal.\n\nThis is not the case in 99% of casts.

This was because I firmly believed it was an important balancing tool.  I still believe this.  However I have also been doing some playtesting with different styles on my own time and have come to a couple conclusions.\n\nSo Taric has 2-3 general playstyles.  \n\n1) Kill Shit Taric.  This is the Taric I played for a long time.  E max, aggressive play, death is the best cc.  When playing this style of Taric his heal is very balanced because rather than being around the healing it is balanced around his passive.  It lets him do short trades but hurts his long trades and all ins so that he can't just do it over and over.  In regards to this it is quite balanced.\n\n2) Passive-er Taric.  This is the Taric that wants to sit around, go for the occasional trade, but mostly just wants to make it to late game and teamfight.  Not my personal favourite style but I put in the time on it to observe this.  This is the Taric that might throw a second point into Q vs heavy poke lanes.  He suffers early from the mana cost/limited heal on Q but I don't think that is a bad thing since this Taric is geared towards late game.  As this Taric will generally pick up a fairly early redemption a lot of the mana issues on Q fade out although the heal can still feel a bit stifling on a Taric who just wants to live until late game.\n\nI don't think his heal _needs_ changes here but a little something might be nice.\n\n3)  Healer Taric.  Recently the Taric I have picked up.  Q max.  Windspeakers.  A lot of mana regen in your runes.  This is the Taric I have been having fun with lately.  It is honestly pretty strong and in theory should be amazing outside of lane.  However it can suffer pretty hard there surprisingly.  This is due to his passive and not being able to always proc it as a healer.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSo what can we see here?  It is pretty balanced for an aggressive Taric but as you get more and more passive/more Q focus it gets worse, even though it should be your focus.  There are a couple actions that can balance that out though.  Two in particular that I have been considering.\n\n1)  Lower mana cost at higher ranks.  This keeps the same restriction on aggressive Tarics as it is the limiter on them.  However it lets Taric that want to get to late game or focus on healing still be effective as they level it up.\n\n2)  Change how it interacts with his passive.  Currently his Q CD is very punishing without his passive.  It is the main drawback of playing healer Taric because you are so squishy.  So what if we changed his Q CD from 15 > 10 and had his passive reduction change from 6-3.3 > 3.5-1.925?  It leaves his Q on the same CD if he is proccing his passive but cuts his Q CD down otherwise.  This makes his combo exactly the same in fights while helping out a Taric who is hiding under turret.\n\nEither one or both of those changes would help out Taric without touching aggressive Taric which is what his Q is currently balanced around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWaters","date":"2017-03-04T16:46:30.066+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"I max Q last.

Q is Bravado and his passive is \"heals targets with bastion\" lol. I rarely use it to actively heal someone other than my other front liner. Most of my games, I wait for the assassin to dive my carry, E Bravado, W Bravado and he's dead. Death is the best peel.","replies":[{"poster":"Dominick Destine","date":"2017-03-05T19:07:46.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skias,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uVEgf3kd,comment-id=002400000000,timestamp=2017-03-05T18:00:10.183+0000)\n>\n> This is basically how Taric uses Q now. \n\nExcept he has huge mana costs and extremely low benefit from lvl 1 Q.\n\nLvl 5 Q has extremely high mana cost.

Like, the 1st should be REALLY weak but the 3rd REALLY strong.\n\nBut they've already said outright that they dislike the healing portion of Taric, as in, he's NOT supposed to be a good healer. The heal is meant sort of as an added bonus and to top people off in certain situations... with the potential to function as a team-wide heal under ideal circumstances (Unique trait by Taric now, only ults can match this). \n\nIf we went by your idea, maybe we could make the 3rd charge give a second benefit? not healing, but, say... a huge armor boost for a few seconds? (+10 armor for 3 seconds per level of heal?) I'd be down for that and it would make perfect sense as well. Taric does NOT need higher healing numbers is my point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2017-03-05T08:12:50.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played a crap ton of taric earlier this season. Let me tell you...\n{{item:3027}} {{item:3504}}  you will not be complaining about the 400+ heal that you can get potentially every 6 seconds if you manage auto attacks properly. Wierd build I know, but his heal scales with health and ability power, very good ratios in fact. you can double the base heal amount with 10 stack roa, then the 20% amp will carry you to 400+ heals. After that you go {{item:3190}}  and standard tank. This build is much more practical than it looks.\n\nThe real problem here is that if taric is using his heals perfectly, then the heal is WAY TOO GOOD, if he is playing very poorly and not using his auto attack cd reduction on his passive, then the heal is complete garbage. There really is no in between here.\n\nHonestly they should not change him at all, at the moment he has a very high skill ceiling because of his cooldown reduction autos, and any change would be doing harm to the balance of the game. A buff to his heal would completely break him at higher levels of play.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2017-03-05T18:11:44.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Taric is unlikely to proc his passive most of the time... simply because he has no mobility and his CC is quite short range (unless he has an ally to jump in for him) which means he doesn't have any good way of closing the gap and actually getting in range to hit enemies (though he can hit minions if there are some around)","replies":[{"poster":"Jeanne fan club","date":"2017-03-06T04:53:04.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not really sure what you are talking about, I find it extremely easy to proc his passive.
