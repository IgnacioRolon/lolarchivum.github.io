The fact that players have always been concerned about whether an old element of a beloved champion would be retained after a huge change has always been present. It feels very unsettling to hear that during the first few conceptualization that no one in the VGU  team had made a conscious effort to retain what is core and unique about the champion. It shows how slow you guys are in catching up and learning from your mistakes. \n\nWhat more, every time someone asks when a splash art/visual update is happening, someone in the team can tell people Karma is in the list, but no balls to mention when exactly within the list she is slated for a splash art update. \n\nWhen it comes to Karma, all departments across Riot is strangely inefficient...

I think the former does a better job at conveying the fact they are supposed to be a duo working in tandem -- Valor shouldn't be accessorizing Quinn; rather, they should have equal presence and importance on the battlefield, which the Marksman update did not preserve in spite of how important that was to the character.","replies":[{"poster":"Reav3","date":"2016-08-05T20:34:59.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry I was speaking about or large VGU's not our roster projects","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2016-08-06T01:43:27.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree about Shen.
