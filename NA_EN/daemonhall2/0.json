Our account recovery team would be the only ones who could help you out here, but they'll only restore access if they're absolutely sure you're the owner.  If you fail to verify that, it's totally okay to keep trying!  Just fill out an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) and they'll get back to you.
