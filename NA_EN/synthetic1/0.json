My ping is fine, i have 0-1% max packet loss (watchig on the other screen i rarely have a ping timeout when this happens), and i will go for periods of 1-5 seconds of just not being able to move, use abilities, etc. I can see everyone else using their abilities fine when this happens most of the time","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T20:26:03.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The input delay does suggest an unstable connection or routing issue; though, it's interesting that the ping is sound with little packet loss.
