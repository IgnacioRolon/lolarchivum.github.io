Depends on the amount of games played in that time. Obviously you shouldn't just have your punishment level reset because you didn't touch the game for a year, as an extreme example. Assuming normal frequency of games, no, that wouldn't be okay.\n\nReturning from that hypothetical into the real world, however, the question remains whether that happens in the first place.\nIf you don't want to discuss your case specifically, that's fine. Not being sarcastic here, I know how these forums can be when people share their logs. If you don't want to subject yourself to that, then that is absolutely understandable.\nBut without that your argument that the system is \"garbage\" (great job at starting a civil discussion, btw) really has no leg to stand on.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueFire Mark II","date":"2019-12-05T02:23:08.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm fine with my case specifically- so long as it isn't begging for chat logs and after not giving it because it's irrelevant then calling me toxic and deserving then i would not want to right?

Whether that is me or not.. clealry some reformation has taken place, otherwise they or me wouldn't have honor 2 playing regularly. Buuut permanent for one game i got a bit mad.\n\nThe ban system does have statistics to know it's bad though. This example I'm having it a serious wtf moment. One game in a whole year after a 14 day of regular play results how? Not even a chat restriction between these. And hey, if people disagree that the BAN system (not punishment system as whole) is not broken when in my opinion it clearly is, that's fine! I can't change your mind myself. Normally i thought it was kinda reasonable but still kinda bad.. but OK.. now i just hate it. Not even because this was ME. I have other accounts anyway.. even if someone else made this to complain I'd get on their side and hate it. \n\nIs it possible I'm lying? Yeah. What's the point? Literally nothing.

Yeah. What's the point? Literally nothing. I'm just here to discuss, lying would do no good since you guys can't do anything and only rito games can.\n\nAnd yet people consistently do it. I'm sorry, but if everything written on these forums was taken at face value \"garbage\" wouldn't even begin to describe how horrible it would be. But most of the time people's claims just don't hold up, and rather than \"discussing\" the system, all they want to do is paint it in a bad light. For what reason? I have absolutely no idea.\n\nBut it happens. And it makes it very hard to trust anything anybody says about their own punishment.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm going to immediately assume somebody is lying, though. I'm willing to grant people the benefit of the doubt when they have no way of producing proof of a statement.\nA good example for that kind of statement would be your claim that you were behaving properly in the year leading up to this ban. There's no point in accusing you of lying about this, because it would not be falsifiable from your end. So I'm not going to question that, and I will try to operate under the assumption that what you are saying is true.\n\nBut what I *have* to question are things that people *could* prove; or at least support with much more tangible evidence. That is even more the case when there is the possibility for that person to merely misjudge the circumstances they are describing, rather than outright lie about them.\nA good example for that kind of statement would be your claim that the game you were banned for only contained \"ordinary flame\".\n\n**If** all of what you are saying is true, I urge you to write a support ticket. But I see little point in discussing the system based on a (from my point of view) hypothetical that falls into the second category.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GatekeeperTDS","date":"2019-12-05T02:00:34.708+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> what do you guys think?\n\nYou should show us your cha...\n\n> do NOT ask for my chat okay?\n\nYou want people to agree with you without seeing what you were actually punished for.

So, you can be infrequently, lightly toxic and you'll be fine.  However, if you're frequently toxic, or you're severely toxic occasionally, you'll be hit with the penalties.  In your case, you were hit with penalties at least 3 times before you finally reached a permanent ban.\n\nIf we take you at your word that your chat log showed \"ordinary flame\" rather than severe flame, then most likely you are frequently toxic.  You can still gain honor even if you're validly reported, though it does slow down honor progression.\n\nMost players are never toxic frequently or severely enough to receive any punishment, and your frequent toxic behavior negatively affects the experiences of those players.  So, tasked with answering, do I think it's fair or not, I find myself considering whether inflicting you on those players is fair or not.  From my perspective, and from Riot's, the answer is no.  It is not fair players who can generally get along with each other to have you ruining their games with your flaming.  So, given that you haven't reformed after multiple warnings, and given you don't dispute that you were toxic, I think your penalty is justified.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueFire Mark II","date":"2019-12-05T04:33:45.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well again you don't need to talk about ME because then you worry about whether i am lying or not.. now, no it is not consistent.

Why Riot decided that's a good idea is beyond me, but I would guess it's because there are actually two separate systems that are being synced together in some way, which would make sense as people were getting penalized long before honor was introduced.  Again, penalties are based on Frequency x Severity.  Low Frequency, Low Severity might not get penalized, but any other combination definitely does.  So, somewhere in there your story is not consistent.  You may want to ask Riot for the stats on how often you're validly reported.\n\nAs for toxic players making new accounts, I agree that it's not ideal.

(I got Honor 4 about a week after pre-season started).  If you're moving at 1 checkpoint a month, it's because you're being validly reported and that is slowing down your progress.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueFire Mark II","date":"2019-12-05T16:45:38.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honor 2+ is not equal to a lock and starting at zero. 3 checkpoints after a lock to 1 then 3 to 2. \n\n2=/= 0 with a lock.","replies":[{"poster":"Subdue","date":"2019-12-05T18:26:15.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlueFire Mark II,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=WhoREh4p,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-12-05T16:45:38.383+0000)\n>\n> Honor 2+ is not equal to a lock and starting at zero. 3 checkpoints after a lock to 1 then 3 to 2. \n> \n> 2=/= 0 with a lock.\n\nRight... the point was that I did 5 (almost 6) checkpoints in 2 months.  You're saying you're gaining 1 checkpoint a month.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueFire Mark II","date":"2019-12-05T18:29:00.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and I've tested it across multiple accounts and made sure there was no reports with bot games and such.

It took them 252 games over 172 days to reach Honor 2.  That's roughly half the time it's taken you to get to the same point.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/yBXTyjAO-dishonorable-to-honor-2-edit-3-12219","replies":[{"poster":"BlueFire Mark II","date":"2019-12-05T19:06:01.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thst doesn't necessarily mean it's equal for everyone. Yes it could take half the time, but- BUT- you're also taking into account specifically games, I'm saying overall time. 4 days a week max, avg 2 hrs each of those days, sick days, vacation, too busy to play, and stuff also in the way. So when i say a year i mean until now, slightly under a year, including the actual 14 day itself into january, and keep in mind he is playing *bots* not PVP where people constantly report for the fun of it ot because they disliked you but really only they were reportable. You are leaving out a ton of information to make yourself look like you have a valid argument when you really don't.. \n\nBesides, honor doesn't do Jack squat anyway, rito doesn't care if you're honor 5 best player ever they'll still perm ban ya after one slip up game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
