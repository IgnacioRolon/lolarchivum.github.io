This is becoming a serious problem because I get slapped with queue dodge penalties for having to close out during champ select. Basically if I do something that requires the display to change, there's a chance it will come up completely black and the sound effects / music will stop. \r\n\r\nThis has happened to me three times, here are the specific things I was doing.\r\n* Once when opening Nami's details in the champions tap\r\n* Twice after accepting a match in the queue (the screen goes black when normally the champ select screen would appear).\r\n\r\nAlso when I attempt to exit out due to being black screened in champ select, the popup telling me I'm about to queue dodge does appear normally on top of the black screen. If there's a known solution for this, please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-22T05:04:47.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely sounds like your connection to the server is pretty unstable.
