Since for some reason all my gifting and rp purchase history is empty I need some help on how to get a refund or how to get this skin to my friend without spending more money. If it wasn't a 35 dollar skin I wouldn't be even bothering with this. \n\nPlease give me some tips or help.\n\n\nhttp://i900.photobucket.com/albums/ac204/King_Necrow/wtf_zpsxw1nihzx.png?t=1485836220","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-02T00:27:59.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this, I don't see any gifts that have been sent from the account you're posting from.
