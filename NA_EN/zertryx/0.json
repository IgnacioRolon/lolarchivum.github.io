Don't call me a liar if you did not even look at your own data.\n\n*   1) I did explain to you why it has not been a tank meta for multiple reasons.  Maokai has always been a reliable pick and has received a constant stream of nerfs because of it.  He has a 1.8% pick rate.  Do you know what that means?  He will be seen roughly 2 matches in every 100 matches.  Does that say powerful to you?  Compare that to a 5% to 18% pick rate in season 5 during the tank meta, or if we count minimums, 2 - 18%\n\nI also explained the reasoning behind the other picks.  Maokai had 6 - 9x the playrate as he does now...\n\nI also explained that if picks have the SAME CONCENTRATION OR PERCENTAGE AS OTHERS, it can NOT BE A TANK META.  If we look at the same time period RIVEN HAD A HIGHER PICK PERCENTAGE THAN MAOKAI FOR THE DIVISION YOU CHOSE\n\nI also explained to you that these websites only show information from season five to present.  That is very bad at showing the overall picture...and even worse if riot has no data on it either\n\n* 2)  the win rates and pick rates show differently from the same site you chose.  Compare Jax to maokai.  Jax had between 5 and 8 percent pick rate during the tank meta and has only INCREASED since then.  Riven has averaged around 10% pick rate, yet during the season where the tank meta came about, she peaked at 20% and never dipped below 6%\n\n* 3)  you literally just admitted that tanks were not picked more than fighters or other top picks.  \"you don't pick tank as mid or ADC\"  that is false.  There are multiple picks for these roles, especially during the initial chaos of the critical update.  Since the introduction of conquerer, tank picks have fallen and picks that can use it have increased.  Another interesting little tidbit.\n\n#JAX IS ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF DATE KITS IN THE GAME...RIOT QUITE LITERALLY FORCED HIM DOWN, NOT TANKS.  He has few ways to deal with ranged kits, has little to **no utility** in a fight, is **ITEM RELIANT** .  To the best players in the world,  Utility is more important than a dueling split-pusher who is not the best at either job.  What went wrong? Riot increased the base damage of tanks, so they could compete with him\n\nmeanwhile the playrate of tanks has dropped considerably, about 75% for maokai for instance.\n\n* 4)  {{champion:57}}  has a 1.8% pickrate of about 651,000 people.  With it so low, his numbers are going to inflate.  What else:  He focuses on utility in a damage meta among the best players in the world, where utility is better than other statistics\n\n{{champion:54}} :  3.1% pick rate, still fairly low but this is around the \"average number\" in gameplay health so we can essentially say that his pick rate and win rate have balanced out.  He has one of the strongest engages in the game and is good at combo'ing, which high level players can work to their advantage.  Let's take a look at his winrate in lower divisions:  it drops to 51% in platinum (which is average at best) , 50% in gold , and 51.5% in silver.  If we averge those, that comes to roughly a 50.8% winrate for low divisions\n\nhis high rank divisions are:  53.7% in diamond and above, so it's already averaged but with 0% pick rate in LCS\n\n{{champion:31}} : chogath has consistenly been below 50% winrate and averages at about 50% .  His pick rate averages at about 3% and he saw a spike in popularity this season.  His popularity went down during the tank meta not because he was not durable but instead because he is completely immobile and predictable.  Current winrate in diamond plus:  51.6%\n\n\n{{champion:78}} :  i'm not sure if you can call her a tank by today's standards, given how unreliable her crowd control is and her method of engage, but I will do her stats.  Average:  5% pickrate since season 5 with her popularity changing after her rework.  If we consider it from that, her average pick rate is is about 6 to 7 percent.  Her win rate since her update is about 51 to 52% average and 49% current\n\n#now, let's take a look at the competition, shall we?  There are currently 19 marksmen.  Their numbers have been kept low because they have CONSISTENTLY BEEN THE FOCUS OF THE GAME!  and adding more too frequently upsets what little balance they have\n\n#annoying, this website you use is not even consistent with its data.  On {{champion:236}}  page, it says he has a 0.8% popularity in diamond+ .  On the all champions page, it lists that he has 37.8% PICK RATE IN DIAMOND+ ! with 53% winrate average.  Do you know how much that skews the data!!!???  He is so powerful, he is literally a 1 in 3 pick of 651,000 players!. \n\nKnow what's even more annoying?  His average winrate even before his buffs is about 55% and his current is 53%, but his pick rate used to be an average of 1%  **AND SINCE HIS STATS ARE SO EXTREME, I'LL START CHECKING ONLY THE MARKSMAN RATINGS...**  \n\n{{champion:236}} :  35.7 pick rate;  53.6% winrate;  28.5% ban rate\n\n{{champion:202}} :  25.2% pick rate;  51.9% winrate;\n\nand then annoyingly strong damage champs:\n\n{{champion:121}} :  15.4% pick rate ;  54.9% win rate ;  21.1% banrate!\n\n{{champion:104}} :  11% pick rate ;  53.2% win rate ;  10% ban rate\n\n{{champion:107}} :  7% pick rate;  56.5% win rate ; 10% ban rate\n\nooh, Pantheon {{champion:80}}  is REALLY STRONG right now...  3% pick rate;  57.4% winrate ; \n\n{{champion:24}} :  is doing average in the jungle at 3% pick rate;  49.8% winrate but his banrate is really high, likely from top lane:  23.5%\n\n{{champion:92}} :  riven is BUSTED STRONG in high divisions with 14% pick rate and 53% win rate in top lane\n\nJax has similar numbers to her for this season\n\n\n\nWell, I'm tired now and I really don't have time to compare multiple years of data for 141 champions across 5 roles\n-\n#short version, tanks have only been meta at one point.

Tanks were optimal untill conqueror was added to the game, and they are still optimal if your teamplay is on the spot. ADC DOESNT HAVE COMPETITION. You are wrong on fundamental level. Adc meta never matters, if you play your best, statistically you are going to win more than loose even if your lane isnt as impactful as bot lane. However when tanks are meta, WHICH MEANS THAT TANKS ARE MORE USEFUL THAN FIGHTERS, IT DOESNT MATTER HOW GOOD YOU PLAY, IF YOU DONT PICK TANKS YOU ARE STATISTICALLY FUCKED.\n\nLet me tell it this way, when adc are \"meta\" you have 50/50 chance of getting the better one. You have 50/50 chance of getting better bot lane. Even if your contribution means +5% win chance, you matter. If however you talk about tank meta, a class of champions that is unpopular, boring, and offers 3x smaller roster than fighter/battle mage meta, not playing tanks means you are fucking yourself over. Noone is forcing you to play adc in adc meta. You can still play what ever you like and you will statistically win more games if you play good. Tank meta however forces you to play 2 different classes on top. Tanks, or anti tanks. Nothing else. You are forced to play two types of adc, hyper carries and lane bullies. NOTHING ELSE. Only lane that is somewhat disconnected from this fuckery tanks cause are mid laners. This is why top lane is least picked lane since season 5 up until season 8. NOONE WANTS TO PLAY SAME SHIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-11-30T18:15:16.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously, compare Riven and Maokai: both see winrate spikes at the same time, both see winrates drop at the same time, both have high popularity in high ranks\n\nif we want to see a difference, the \"winrate per ranked games played\" makes a difference, but the graph does not contain enough information.  Maokai, for instance, achieves 100% winrate after 80 games played?  Yet, so does Quinn and Riven has above 70%\n\nif we want to look at other misleading factors, take Camille.  Her banrate for top is 42%, her average winrate is 55% and her pick rate is 7.2% , but supposedly if she gets 4 kills with one death before 20 minutes, her winrate is greater than 80%, while maintaining a winrate of 60% if neutral\n\nAgain,  it has not been a tank meta.  Tanks are efficient for high-ranking players because of all they bring to the battle (durability, crowd control, potentially disengage, etc), but their pick rate has not outdone other role types.\n\nIf you compare that to season 5, where you could have 4 tanks on the same team...there is no comparison\n\nyou also seem to ignore that the bottom lane position has been so mandatory that it developed its OWN META WITHIN IT ;  for example, Lucian, who now has a 38% pick rate! or greater than 1 in 3 players pick him in the highest division in the game","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RizenDragon","date":"2018-11-26T10:11:43.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I 100% agree.
