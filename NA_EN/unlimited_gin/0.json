However, I don't want this to be \"You nerfed my favorite character bring him back he's never op at all qq\" post, or a \"a rammus beat me one time nerf him into the dirt\" post. I want to talk about what's right, what's wrong, and what's OP, and what's UP about him.  I encourage people to politely disagree with me and change my mind about things, or add their own experience.\n\nDisclaimer: I play a little ranked, but it never really struck my fancy. I think I didn't even play my promo matches last year. If you are going to say \"Shut up noob you're not even gold,\" then I beat you to it. Yeah, I'm not gold, but I understand healthy game design and I do think I can provide insight to this particular champion.\n\n\n**Let's start with the Preseason 5 nerf:** Here is the patch reasoning:\n> Rammus's uptime between ganks have made him quite the monster, and we're not even talking about what happens when he finishes his Homeguards. Scaling the cooldown on Rammus' Powerball should give opponents better windows to react to his ganking cadence, while lowering E's shred makes him less of a duelist (how is Rammus dueling!?). That said, we're not quite sure how Rammus will be affected in the preseason. If the Armordillo's eating a healthy portion of struggle salad in 2015, we'll double back to make sure he's staying healthy.\n\n**I can say I appreciate and accept the motivation behind this change - Rammus could gank all day, from anywhere.** Yes, being mobile is part of his kit, but there is a point where being everywhere at once (*cough MS Udyr*) can be too frustrating.  However, I'd say the unintended effects of the change were more damaging than the intended nerf.  **With a nearly doubled Q cooldown, Rammus cannot use Q on jungle mobs as often.  This means more damage taken, less damage done, and more time spent on a pack, all on a champion who already had a very weak jungle clear.**\n\nTo make things worse, Q wasn't just a mobility move or a jungle monster damager, it was one of Rammus's crowd control moves.  **Before the change, Rammus typically would Q in to initiate, taunt someone, throw down an ult if post-6, and then use Q again to catch and CC stragglers fleeing from the fight, or, in bigger fights, to interrupt a channel or peel an enemy. Now with the longer cooldown, it's changed his ganking pattern. I've found that, until very late game, he cannot use Q twice in a fight.  That means that he can either initiate well, or have that second CC in a fight.**\n\nThe end result is that Rammus feels gold starved and ineffective in the early half of the game - **he can't gank as often, he can't gank as well, and he can't jungle as well, whereas the patch indicated that they only intended to nerf his frequency and distance of ganks.**\n\nOne solution that came to mind is that, like Thresh, Rammus's Q could have a shorter cooldown if he hits a champion or a jungle mob, and a longer cooldown if it expires or hits a minion.  That would preserve his ability to initiate and still have CC in a fight, preserve his ability to use it to damage mobs, but reduce his ability to powerball all over the map - particularly for ganking multiple lanes in succession and that ever frustrating Rammus retreat.\n\n**TLDR for Preseason 5 Nerf:** The purpose of the Preseason 5 Q nerf was to slow Rammus's ability to use powerball to get all over the map and gank willy nilly, but it had the unintended consequence of giving him one less CC move to use in a fight and fewer damaging moves to clear jungle camps with. ** I propose the cooldown gets reduced if he hits a champion or a jungle camp, and increased cooldown if he hits only minions or nothing.  That would restore the unintended nerfs on his Q and preserve the intended one.**\n\n**But Rammus NEEDED nerfed power**:\nMaybe! It's really hard to judge what champions are OP and for what reasons, but I would say that Rammus's ability to throw down two CC's in a fight instead of one isn't why he's OP, if he is/was.  Leona certainly gets away with more CC than that, as do Blitz and Thresh. So what is the difference? If people hate playing against Rammus, why is that?\n\nHere are some reasons that you may hate Rammus:\n\n**1) **Taunt is one of the hardest CC's in the game, and it's a point and click.\n**2) **He can flee very well, and people that are impossible to catch are very frustrating.\n**3) **For being one of the tankiest and most mobile characters in the game, he does surprising damage, between his armor pen, his reflective armor, his ult, his comically high AP scaling, and his passive that gives him AD. \n\n**Let's talk about #1 first.** League is moving away from abilities with low counterplay, and **taunt's counterplay amounts to \"don't get close to Rammus,\" which is kind of silly, considering the fact that Rammus can get close to anyone he wants.**  Even other hard, point and click CC like Leona's stun has more counterplay, because you CAN stay away from Leona if you don't let her hit you with skill shots.\n\nSo, if you hate Rammus, the nerf to his Q might give you the reprieve from your nemesis that you wanted, but it doesn't fix the reason you hated him, probably. You hated getting unavoidably CC'ed.  So, what's the solution? A skill shot is one option, but for a champion who can walk up to point blank, skill shots almost become point-and-click moves; perhaps it could be a ranged skill shot that had better effect at longer range, but I'm not sure if that would fit well into his current kit of \"get up in your business.\"  Maybe make it a suppress where Rammus can still move and attack, but getting CC'ed himself ends the taunt.  **Taunt TLDR:  If Rammus had power problems, it wasn't in the *amount* of CC he had, it was in the low counterplay of Taunt - you just can't avoid it.  How to add counterplay? I am not sure... suggestions welcome**\n\n**Problem number 2, his fleeing, is partially solved by my suggestions to Q in the section above, in my opinion**\n\n**Problem number 3**, his high damage for a Tank.  Even though it would make me sad to see it go, if it was deemed that his damage was the core problem, this is an easier fix that can be done while maintaining his core gameplay and utility. Sure, they'd have to account for his reduced Jungle clear, but **I would say having a healthy set of initiation and CC is more important to me on Rammus than the unusual amount of damage he can do for such a tanky dude.**  I mean, I will be sad to see the day where I can't get mega fed as a pure tank, but it's not a necessary part of who he is.  One point that comes to mind is his Ultimate.  Perhaps take some of the damage out of it and replace it with a slow, or something.  Hell, maybe he doesn't need ArPen on his taunt at all - they're already hard CC'ed and taking damage from the spikes and thornmail - do they really need to blow up faster? Maybe have it shred just jungle mobs. **However, maybe that's just the way I play Rammus. If other people disagree and think his damage is essential to how he's played, then maybe I'm wrong.**\n\n\n**No way, Rammus needs a power buff**:\nAlso maybe! I'm running out of time to discuss this, but if Rammus needs a buff, it's not in his Taunt, if that's what you're getting at. If you want taunt to go back to a three second CC, I would disagree.  If anything on Rammus needs a buffing, I'd say it's his currently abhorrent jungle clear.  If you think some part of Rammus needs a buffing, I'd love to hear your reasoning.\n\n\n**Total TLDR:**\n1) The Preseason 5 Q nerf might have been necessary to reduce his map control and gank frequency, but I think he needs his ability to use it for jungle damage and in-fight cc back - give him a reduced CD if he uses powerball to hit a champion or jungle mob, perhaps, or something similar.  It has the added bonus of adding conterplay to his Q - it makes using minion shields more potent.\n2) His Taunt has no counterplay, and for the life of me, I don't know how to add that.  This is probably the most annoying part about Rammus.\n\n**Edit: A lot of people in the comments seem to disagree with this statement above.  Specifically, people are saying that his Q isn't guaranteed to get him to the enemy, and that's where the taunt counterplay is. Perhaps they are right - I was simply trying to be balanced about it and presenting the opinion of someone who doesn't like Rammus, and it seems I might have overcompensated and invented a strength that doesn't exist.**\n\n3) He does unusual damage for a Tank... maybe that needs to change? Maybe not?\n4) I'd love to hear a healthy discussion about what you think about Rammus, and I'd love to hear it be thoughtful and balanced, and not \"QQ, and good riddance, devil-turtle\" or \"dingos nerfed my baaaaaby give him baaaack.\"","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-05T17:02:16.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) I agree with your proposed Q change.\n2) There's currently some range on his taunt, yes?  Cut it down to melee range.  Sure, it'll still be point-and-click, but he's a melee champion: the counterplay against melee champions is to stay away from them, and the fact that they have gap-closers is their counterplay against being relentlessly kited.  Plenty of people can CC or dodge the ball.\n3) Eh, he does it weirdly: some in a big AoE over time, some with his slow autos, some on people who attack him.  Given that he reflects damage with one of his skills, his other skills have to either hurt a lot or inflict great CC for him to avoid being ignored, and as you note, he's not at the top of the CC pack.  I reckon it's in a good place.\n4) He should be every bit as scary as someone like Amumu or Blitz.  Amumu can lock down a team for the wombo, and Blitz is the pickmaster: Rammus has just a little bit of both going on, and I'd like to see him more often compared to those two.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlimited Gin","date":"2015-02-05T17:22:41.991+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's basically melee. It's pretty minimal. The issue is that his powerball can get you into melee with anyone.  I don't think it's the most unhealthy moveset, I'm just trying to account for the fact that I'm a rabid Rammus fanboy and maybe I gloss over his design problems.\n\nAs for his damage, maybe the problem is that it's all deceptive damage. Reflected damage, a slow AoE dot, invisible ArPen, and unusually strong, but slow and unreliable auto.  Still, I *like* his damage, but see fanboy comment above.\n\nEdit: I would agree that I'd like to see him a scary as Amumu or Blitz.  It feels like Amumu was in a very similar position at the start of this preseason - high mobility, high cc potential, okay damage - and that's why I feel that Rammus Q-in-fight nerf was unintended. They looked at both champions, thought they both needed adjusting, and I'd be very surprised if they came to the conclusion that Rammus needed less in-fight-CC and Amumu did not.","replies":[{"poster":"McAllister","date":"2015-02-05T17:57:23.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Xin's CC unhealthy, or Riven's?  It's hard to stay out of melee with those two, and essentially impossible to avoid CC once they're up close.  At least ballin' Rammus respects slows.  I'm glad you acknowledge your bias, but it's fine.\n\nI don't know, is the damage deceptive?  The ult is loud and visible, the only subtle thing about it is that each tick isn't enough damage to make it worth repositioning most of the time, so it ends up dealing more damage than Nunu's.*  Reflected damage?  He's covered with spikes, it's much better than Thornmail.  I will agree about the ArPen and the auto, though.  The ArPen could disappear for all I care, and as for the auto, the only thing to do about it would be to change the automation.  What does he do, headbutts and swipes with his stubby paws?  It just doesn't look like it hurts.\n\nIf they removed his ArPen and threw in the cooldown-reducer on his Q, let's pretend he's neither stronger nor weaker.  What sort of minor buff would you give him, or would you reckon he's fine even if his play rate is low?","replies":[{"poster":"Unlimited Gin","date":"2015-02-05T18:10:42.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I like the idea of removing the ArPen and adding the CD reducer on Q.  ArPen might be the only real problem area, if it even is a problem, simply because the average player that doesn't use Rammus might not have any idea that it is happening.  While we're at it, maybe make DBC have a more spiky animation, a la MechaRammus animation.  Most of us know it has reflected damage, but I'm all for visual clarity.\n\nI'd honestly be happy with those changes - even if his winrate isn't at the golden 50%, but if there's a wishlist, I'd like to see him a little less mana-and-health starved in the early jungle.  His clear can still be slow, but I feel like those bars are always empty.  If Bluebuff gets stolen (and a good counterjungler will see Rammus pick and immediately do that, and there's very little I can do to stop him), I'm in a really rough place mana-wise for a looong time.\n\nOther wishlist buff - give me King Rammus.

You don't win the game by going 50/0/50. You do it by killing the enemy nexus. And to do that, you need to be able to take towers down. The new portal helps, but it got nerfed pretty hard damae wise after it came out. It also gets caught on minions. Which Rammus is bad at killing. \n\nAnd there is nothing wrong with Rammus top lane. He has no poke, he has no sustain, and he has NO wave clear. His Q CD is now huge at rank one.

Truth be told, I'm still figuring out how to Rammus right in S5 and had been trying purple smite to counteract his very rough jungling experience.\n\nI would say that Chilling Smite might not be a healthy addition to the game. **If many junglers become OP with an added crowd control button, I'd rather see the Junglers themselves preserved and the added crowd control removed. That way, these characters aren't suddenly constrained to the jungle role, and rebalanced for a \"new moveset.\"  Moreover, it seems like Rammus got a little more of a nerf out of this than other strong chase junglers.**  Lee Sin has enough chase and got more, Jarvan has good CC, and still kept it with the patch. Amumu got nerfed, but it was a damage nerf - the amount of CC he has didn't change.  Rammus effectively lost the ability to use two powerballs in a fight in exchange for a 75 second cooldown slow.\n\n>I don't see anything wrong with point and click CC.\n\nI don't think it's the end of the world, either, but it is potentially one place that could be frustrating for people playing against Rammus.  Lots of champions have it, but I don't think Riot *likes* that they have it (hence Scion and upcoming Taric reworks), and while it is predictable, it's still unavoidable.  Again, not the biggest design problem in the game, but the way the game is heading, most skills have a way to avoid it, and Mikaels and QSS are for when you inevitably and occasionally fail to.\n\n>The only thing I would change is his ultimate\n\nYes, it adds to his unusually high damage problem. It makes him quite a fearsome ganker, and maybe having loads of CC should be enough.  Late game I think it does do a deceptive amount of damage, but you're right, it feels more like a button to push because it's there - like a filler - instead of a decision to make.\n\nI wouldn't cry if the ability to damage towers was taken away, but I think it's a nice feature on him.  I think part of the problem is that he's good at killing a tower with it and then powerballing away. If the CD on a only-for-funning powerball was increased, perhaps Rammus players would have to ask themselves if pushing top was a safe decision more often, instead of doing it whenever Tremors is up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hawkefire","date":"2015-02-05T18:27:03.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so here is my deal with Rammus.\n\n\nI personally play Rammus top lane now, and in fact I greatly enjoy playing him top lane (a lot of people really underestimate how good he is up there, although he does have his weaknesses to things like AP mages, such as lissandra, AP bruisers, such as Maokai and Rumble)\n\n\nI greatly enjoy playing him top lane, it is very fun, and he has some well defined strengths and weaknesses that your opponent (and yourself) can take advantage of.\n\n\nFrankly, right now I don't think Rammus really needs any buffs, except to his Q, and the ONLY (and I really do mean ONLY) thing that his Q could use would be a cooldown buff for when he uses it on monsters/creeps, this is because jungle rammus (especially with the jungle changes) has to use his Q to be able to clear the mobs in his jungle during the early game (and partially into midgame as well) otherwise the jungle mobs simply destroy him and he is forced to go back too early.  But when he uses his Q to clear jungle mobs he cannot use it to gank, and a Rammus without his Q cannot gank...it just wont work (I mean I guess it can when the enemy is really REALLY being stupid, but still).\n\n\nYour point on his Taunt (his E)....I disagree.  While the counterplay is \"don't get near him\" it actually works in the case of Rammus, and here is why:\n\nRammus has only 1 form of gapcloser built into his kit, and that would be his powerball.\n\nHis powerball has some pretty specific and potent weaknesses to it, such as:\n\nIt can be body blocked (a friendly champ can dive in front of Rammus and stop him dead in his tracks, or Rammus could make a mistake and clip an enemy minion)\n\nHis powerball is a movement speed steroid, this means it isn't a hard gap closer (IE, it isn't a dash like Lee Sin's second Q), which also means it is counterable by slows (such as red buff, ever try chasing a skilled Kalista with a runaans + redbuff?  You aren't going to catch her on your own without flash...ever, you can trust me on that one)\n\nHis powerball has a wind up time (as in, he doesn't hit full speed immediately), this gives you more time to react against him, thus allowing you to slow him, CC him, or get some minions/friendly champs in between you and him.\n\n\nAll that combined, and it actually shows that it is kinda difficult to get to the enemy that you want to CC.\n\nSure you could flank them, but that is counterable by good ward coverage and not overextending off on your own(and this is one of the reasons why he was so good in soloQ, it takes a little bit of coordination to stop a good Rammus)\n\n\n\nHis damage for a tank is fine.  In fact, it is solely because of that damage that I feel that Rammus is viable.  If you take away his damage, then you can simply ignore him (this is one of the problems with most of the true tank champions, such as Nautilus, once Nautilus has blown his CC, the enemy can virtually ignore him because he isn't going to hurt them and they know it).  Rammus on the other hand, does just enough damage that you cannot ignore his presence in teamfights.  You actually have to acknowledge that he is there, and that he actually hurts.  However, his damage isn't too overbearing either because you can still take him down, and he is very susceptible to CC.\n\nJust my 2 cents.","replies":[{"poster":"Unlimited Gin","date":"2015-02-05T18:33:37.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps you're right - the counterplay in his Q is the real counterplay in his Taunt.

Keep in mind that this skill is reduced by tenacity, and has to actually get to the target. Using his Q to get to the desired enemy is rather difficult if the enemy team is even half aware, and with the vast number of slows/hard cc on almost every champion, your only sure bet is to come from a blind side and flash onto them. \n\nThe one single thing he actually does have going for him is his damage, but it sure as hell does not come from his ultimate. It comes, at least when I play him, from the bonus AD he gets from defensive curl(and items) as applied to his basic attacks. Once you are in the fight you will not be walking around trying to keep the entire enemy team within the range of your ult. What you will be doing is taunting the squishiest enemy within range that is either a huge damage or cc threat, and trying to kill them. When you have at least 1 good armor item, sometimes 2, and a maxed defensive curl, the bonus damage from his passive is enormous, and like me, if you build a phantom dancer, or some other attack speed item, you can often 100-0 squishies before the taunt comes off. The ultimate is just a scary thing to pop and cause confusion. It does respectable damage if they take the entire ult, but more often than not the ult is used to help push waves, or to take a tower. I am sure the only reason people get mad is because they don't expect to be taken 1 v 1 by a rammus, and when they try to run away and cant, they thinks its unfair. Thats just funny haha.\n\nRammus can do ok against some matchups, but for the most part he has way too much trouble early game, whether you are in the jungle or not. His ability to actually catch and lock down his enemy targets is too difficult to be worth the pick if you are going for a ganker/roamer. I mostly play him as a super tanky fighter/late game pusher but you have to survive till late game.\n\nIf anything, I would like to see the rollerball cooldown reduced, and/or a revival of the 3 second taunt, and/or a massive reduction in mana costs so that he can use his spells more frequently without a blue buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakedLotion","date":"2015-02-05T22:14:01.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why people suddenly started playing him.

A well designed tank is supposed to be able to soft taunt you on their own due to their CC threat and/or burst, and an actual taunt is a cop out. They really have to replace his taunt in some way, not just because it is low counter play, but because it shows that he was not designed properly to begin with.

I don't agree with you at all.\nYour argumentations about why Rammus should have a different kind of CC instead than taunt make little sense\nA slow on ulti + some other generic CC on his kit  wouldn't allow Rammus to accomplish his goal, which is to pick a single target, an heavy AD damage dealer most of the time (due to passive, Thornmail) , and make him irrelevant in a fight for quite some time to allow your team to defeat the enemy team\nRammus having generic CC would mean that even if the generic new CC on Rammus hit the target, after the expire of CC duration, no one right in his mind would focus or care about Rammus, that would represent a sitting duck for the rest of the fight until his Q come off CD again. And enemies that coordinate well each other could just save the Rammus target from this new generic CC, allowing the enemy team to ignore Rammus for the whole remaining fight making him completely useless. \nIf Rammus hit his target with Q or is capable to get pretty close to him on a fight, his target shouldn't be allowed to ignore Rammus, and taunt is the best form of CC to accomplish that goal. The way to avoid Rammus taunting and counterplay him are there, taunt range is a measly 325 range, so avoid rammus engage and enemy team engage or hainvg your frontline peeling properly and Rammus taunt is shut down\nWhen you originally said that \n> Defensive Ball Curl, Powerball, and his R are the three spells that everyone says \"yeah, that is totally Rammus\"\n\nYou are obviously right, but the taunt define Rammus as much as his other skills , since can be clearly see how all of them are connected in the Rammus pattern. You get on an enemmy with Q, taunt him and activate the defensive ball curl), and at the same time press R for further damage. And if enemies are escaping from the ulkti, you try to hit them again with Q to keep them in range (rammus ulti range is short too, it has 300 range)\n\nTl;DR  Taunt is GOOD design on Rammus, generic CC is BAD design on Rammus","replies":[{"poster":"junglerboy16","date":"2015-02-06T13:19:47.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't seem to get what I'm saying at all.

I'm not saying they should up and remove it entirely, but a real tank is supposed to be enough of a threat outside of forcing you to attack them that they feel the need to focus you. Think of Cho'gath: his ult is one of the best soft taunts in the game, because EVERYONE knows that you want to kill him to make him lose stacks. The fact that there is no fall back pattern for Rammus outside of taunting somebody is exactly what is so bad about it.

He is a tank, he is not a good target by definition for anyone\nThat's where the core of your argumentation fails. He isn't a good target, so he has to get a way to NOT be ignored. Other tanky champs got different kind of tools to get that (Mundo health regen or Malph knock-up for example), Rammus, looking at everything else got in the kit, got a taunt instead\nThe same Cho'Gath example is bad, Cho'Gath can be not only a tanky champ, but also a relevant ranged damage dealer once he gets stacks,  that's why he becomes a good target (alongside the fact that he also become less tanky once he loses stacks)\nAnd the fallback pattern argumentation for taunt removal/change is a bad argumentation too, because the \"lack of fallback pattern\"  depends on Q, not on taunt. If Rammus fail Q he can never get in range for enemies nor set-up for his own damage or his allies damage; the taunt is the cream on top of the cake when, AFTER you hit Q, you keep an important target busy on facing you. \nAnd since Q is so powerful, and no one would think to remove power from it on Rammus, he can/should not have some other kind of powerful fallback pattern. His \"new\" E could be changed and become a relevant fallback pattern if you took power out of Q - which would be stupid since it is his signature move -, otherwise you would just make another champ ala Lee Sin with a kit where he can do 100000 milion things\n\nSo, to make you understand, TAUNT ON THE ACTUAL RAMMUS KIT IS GOOD DESIGN\n\nSide note: If you are searching for an ability in his kit which is not completely representative of Rammus and could be enhanced to make his playstyle some kind of different giving him some kind of different pattern, don't look at taunt, but look at his ulti instead...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grouchy Poro","date":"2015-02-05T17:46:25.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with the 'taunt not fitting him' bit but yes, it does have low counterplay.
