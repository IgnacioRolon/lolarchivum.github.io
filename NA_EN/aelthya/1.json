It said I completed four, one of which being the blue essence orb quest for the 60,000 essence. It said that I acquired the orb, but it does not show in my inventory. Is this a bug that is going around? I know some people were having issues opening them, but I just haven't received mine from completing the quest yet. Do I need to make a ticket or wait it out? \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for taking the time to read! \r\n&lt;3 Aelthya","replies":[{"poster":"phoenix maximus","date":"2017-11-17T14:11:41.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for me it doesn't show the orb in my loot, even after logging several times.
