Aelthya here! \r\n\r\nJust tried to log in and received an error. Okay, no problem. So, I went to log in again, and now I'm stuck on the authentication part of log in. I've been sitting here for about five minutes and was wondering if I should simply try again or if there was an issue that wasn't updated on the server status? Is anyone else running into this problem? If so, and you were able to get on, how do I fix it? \r\n\r\nAny and all help is appreciated and I'd like to thank you in advance for reading through and/or assisting me! \r\n&lt;3 Aelthya","replies":[{"poster":"Aelthya","date":"2017-11-17T02:16:52.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!
