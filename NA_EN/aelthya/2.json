We were able to get through champ select and load in just fine. It was right as minions reached us in the middle of the Howling Abyss that the game crashed for everyone. We both received \"Attempting to Reconnect\", but when we exited out to reconnect and load into the game, the game was just gone. No match history, no leaver buster (thank goodness!), just the regular client. \r\n\r\nWe checked the server status and everything was online and running, so we chalked it up to a glitch in the system. Queuing up for another game, we invited a third member and went into the game, but both of our team members we DCing and lagging too hard to even more or play, meanwhile we were getting spikes and disconnects, too. We wanted to move from the Abyss to the Rift, but now we're too concerned about the disconnect and lagging issues that we're unsure if we should even attempt to play. \r\n\r\nRiot, help! What on earth is going on?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-14T21:42:00.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of potential things that could have happened here. This could have been a regional network issue, ISP-specific issue, or even an issue with that the specific game-servers that you were connecting to. To determine this, I'd need quite a bit more information. \n\nAre you still running into these issues?
