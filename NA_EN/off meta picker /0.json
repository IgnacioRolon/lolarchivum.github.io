I'm sorry but I'm frustrated with the endless 4 men chasing 1 kill while I'm on an ap support trying to push objectives because no one else will and even if I am on an AD champion my team ends up getting baited half the time in these fights and then the enemy team just pushes faster and harder?\r\n\r\nI know I'm not perfect, I'm trying to work on improving what I can in my game, which is mostly mechanics in my opinion. I'm trying not to be toxic, I really am, but I think I'm on the verge of a ban because I try to be kind, I try to communicate and then I get told I'm stupid and feeding, and when I try to explain I get told to uninstall or kill myself (but I'm the one currently close to being banned mind you because 4 people is greater than 1 and because I'm the target of the 4 because I dont want to push mid every game all game) my harsh complaints about how im being treated/the game are going to get me banned, meanwhile I'm told to kill myself on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSo the question stands, does anyone have any ideas about this? How can I practice for ranked because I don't want to just tank to B5 by practicing in ranked, but I'm getting very little out of normals because \"It's normals, who cares\".... I do ... I'm trying to practice for ranked :(.","replies":[{"poster":"SnackieCakes","date":"2015-01-23T19:26:56.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're describing isn't exclusive to normals - it also sounds like ranked until at least Gold. Playing ranked probably isn't going to clear up your problem, but I don't see any problem with your giving it a try.","replies":[{"poster":"Daaaaang","date":"2015-01-23T19:53:00.732+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is right unfortunately.  Sometime's it's even worse in ranked.  Here's what I would recommend.\n\n1.  Play bots.  Seriously.  I go into bot games by myself sometimes so I can practice my CS.. or maybe put myself 1v1 so I can practice CS with an opponent pressuring me.  The only thing you can't get out of bots that you can vs players, is that bots won't gank you.  Take advantage of that so you can get a good feeling for when you think you're overextending, or not csing well enough, etc.\n\n2.  Mute button.  I abuse my mute button.  Sometimes I mute people before the game starts, just because they seemed like a tool in champ select.  They don't need to give you a good excuse to mute them - if you feel they aren't contributing to the team or the game in a positive way.. just mute them and forget they exist.\n\n3.  Duo when you can.  Find someone wiith a similar attitude and schedule of your own and duo queue.  Chance of getting a douchebag on your team goes down a little bit, and you can pull off some good plays if you keep your communication.  Plus you can practice together during your offtime.\n\nRandom tip: GET COMFORTABLE WITH AS MANY CHAMPS AS YOU CAN.  In norms, people generally play champs they want to learn or practice, which means they haven't mastered it yet.  Playing in ranked, you have to assume your opponent has mastered their champ.  Do **NOT** pick your champ because they counter them, **pick your champ because you are good with them.**  This means you need a large array of different champs you can play.  If you get stuck playing top lane, and your only top lane is {{champion:122}} and they {{champion:10}}'d you, it's probably over.  Be flexible.\n\nGood luck man.  Just remember the children in this game will never leave, so you just have to change your approach.  They will be more useful to the team because you won't tilt when he flames.  Chances are if you stop responding to him, he's flaming someone else.  Higher chance of being reported/banned.  :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Off Meta Picker ","date":"2015-01-23T20:09:44.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wish I could stop getting so invested and angry!

I quickly reconnect and get told \"fk you\", then I snap like crazy lol.\nI think imma just spend more time on other games. League is just not worth this frustration. In general, I find team games/multiplayer games very unreliable. I hate having to depend on people. They give up too fast. I'm the type who will keep going and try again 100 times until I get it right.\n\nI tried listening to music, it does help a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Albireo","date":"2015-01-24T11:22:32.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get premades, if you can go 5, awesome, otherwise, well, either try to get them or play something like team builder, and just search for the roles that you don't have.\n\nIf you don't have many friends, try to get some people from the chats, there are a lot of people actually loking for people to play specific roles.
