Ahri lacks the damage most Mages have and only has one CC that is a skill shot.  Janna lacks defenses and damage.  Hecarim is melee.  Nidalee needs to land an easily dodge-able(when not used in the fog of war) skill shot,  Kalista has a bad time in the early game, teammate needs to know how to effectively use her ult, and she needs her soul linked teamate in order to get her damage.  Azir needs his sand soldiers to do anything and he has a high skill floor compared to most champions.  I agree with everything else.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-06T01:29:45.557+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Hecarim is melee.\"\nPlease elaborate.","replies":[{"poster":"ShadyWolfe","date":"2015-07-06T02:20:10.209+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=iy70lTam,comment-id=000200040000,timestamp=2015-07-06T01:29:45.557+0000)\n>\n> \"Hecarim is melee.\"\n> Please elaborate.\n\nHecarim's basic attacks do not go that far and he lacks projectiles.","replies":[{"poster":"ahferroin7","date":"2015-07-06T16:53:08.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim's lack of projectiles really isn't as much of a weakness as for most other melee champs.
