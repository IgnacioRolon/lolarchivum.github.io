In Hots one or 2 kills to any person doesn't put the enemy team ahead. But in League that's almost GG if the person abuses their lead.

CSing, warding, itemization -- none of these exist in HotS. it's definitely a less frustrating model to deal with because there are fewer windows of opportunity to punish mistakes.\n\nbut at the same time, if someone manages to establish and maintain a lead over their opponent(s), do they not deserve to win and rise in the ranks? it feels great to have a huge impact on the outcome of your games, after all. as far as the struggle with silver goes, just remember that the dead weight will sometimes be on the enemy team as well. if you play to the best of your ability and continue to improve, you will climb regardless of who's on your team. i don't think the ranked system is problematic here outside of how promos work, tbh","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Genuwhine","date":"2015-08-03T03:43:02.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"i shit on kids in gold.
