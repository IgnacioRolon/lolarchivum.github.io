(capping framerate also had no effect, i'm playing with medium graphic settings)\r\n\r\nhonestly makes league unplayable for me, the game just feels terrible to play because of the stuttering.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-12-14T17:29:13.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, your game files might be struggling to render which can drop frames.

(hard to tell i had no time to properly test since our nexus was dying)\nso as for the \"stuttering\" that's caused by the terrible framerate i have this patch, turning on vertical sync might be the solution.\ni'm also playing on a (msi) laptop btw\nE: turning on vertical sync makes the game feel very laggy, so not a solution at all.\n\nfor clarification: the framerate i'm getting is still just unacceptably low\nbtw on first glance it doesn't seem like there's anything abnormal in my r3d logs compared to before the patch (seems to be roughly the same amount and type of random errors)\nbtw2 is it normal for the client to take up 1gb of ram while in game, seems like an awful lot. (not that it matters since closing the client doesn't affect these fps issues)\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"47MbG47","date":"2017-12-14T18:13:58.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just tried to full repair and play another game, sadly enough the game ended quickly so i couldn't see the lategame (post 30 min)\nit doesn't seem to have fixed the issue. for example at 20 min just standing in base resulted in 70fps and i still dipped into 50fps when fights were going on on my screen.

I usually play well above 100fps when snowdown launched I was fine for a day but when the small update happened in between games on 12/13/2017 I lost frames exactly as you described.\n\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled. I have updated all drivers graphics included. and I have tried the repair tool. nothing seems to fix it.\n\nThe issue is the patch. I have taken graphics to low and res down too but it still has no impact on those skipping frames. I'm using an Alienware 15 laptop been playing league on it for years.\n\n\nEDIT: Wait for vertical sync fixed the jumpiness I saw but it lowered my 100 plus frame to 60....its smooth tho and doable","replies":[]}]}]}
