This is essentially the exact same you're saying to your teams. \n\nIf you want to be constructive, there are ways of doing that. I get that you were upset the jungler missed a good opportunity, but don't let your bad attitude come across in text. \"That double kill was so free if our jungler would just gank for once xd\" is a far cry from \"Hey Vi, next time you get a chance, come bot.

Not to mention in the first game you spammed the chat with some pretty negative stuff and you weren't helpful to your team. Regardless of what they did, you didn't show any \"constructive criticism\" in the game. You are responsible for your own behavior, so flaming back like this will still get you reported and punished regardless of what your team was doing it. There are no \"he started it\" or \"self-defense\" claims when it comes to Instant Feedback system. You acted negatively towards your team, and that's what happened. Not because you played Ashe support.\n\nRemember, you were already on thin ice regarding your account when it came to negative behavior due to prior restrictions, so getting enough successful reports will push you further through the punishment tiers Riot has set up before receiving a permanent ban. This is essentially your 3rd warning to change your behavior or you will risk losing your account forever. \n\nI'm assuming you don't want to lose your account, especially if you've reached Diamond, right? So I would really recommend taking a break and perhaps taking a breather when playing. You don't have to constantly criticize everything your teammates are doing. No one likes it when others are breathing down their necks when they play. Focus on your own play and don't worry about the others. Only use chat to call out game related objectives, such as Baron, Dragon, Flash, etc. \nIf your teammates do decide to flame at you, then simply report and move on. You don't need to fight back, you don't really need to say anything to them really. Just report after the game and move on to the next one. Chances are they'll get punished if they continue that behavior, but nothing will ever happen if you don't report and just fight back. If anything, it'll get you reported like it did now. So it's best to avoid that. \n\nI hope that helps. Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Vastayan Boss","date":"2016-10-26T21:54:21.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Two things. \nI don't understand how never using derogatory language or ever using chat to say anything but respond to a teamate claiming that their \"trash teamates\" hold them in their elo and they used to be good enough to play in diamond 1. All I ever did was tell the guy to stop crying about a lane that is down 2 kills becuase a jungler gank. BECAUSE that takes away form the ability to win the game. If i got in trouble for Trolling or Int feeding for having a bad game with an off meta champ i could fully understand. But that isnt what happened.\n\nAnd secondly, this is why it doesn't make sense to run a system that \"enforces the rito law\" with a bot instead of the tribunal like it used to be. And there are 2 reasons why, If people saw how much i was flamed and saw how nicely i responded in context, this ban would make no sense and they would pardon it. I 100% believe that if i had an official person look through the past games otehr than like 3 normals i played with friends where i called them trolls as a joke where no one reported me because it was a joke. This ban wouldn't make sense with context. The chat restrictions, they would. But a 14 day ban for THIS? laughable at best.","replies":[{"poster":"Desolas Arterius","date":"2016-10-26T22:35:50.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: Because you did more than just \"respond\" to them. You argued with them, made remarks at Vi for \"being a bad jungle\", and in the second game you called your team \"crybabies\" and kept arguing about their bans. That's not helpful nor constructive criticism. All you did was talk about their mistakes and pin blame on them. Nothing you said was positive or helpful. You got in trouble for that because that is negative behavior. You don't have to cuss or use derogatory names to be considered toxic. You can still be toxic if all you do is type in game about how X is bad or type to argue. Everything you said wasn't needed outside of the small amount of gameplay you did talk about (Like Kled's Flash).\n\n2: Tribunal was not as effective as you think. It was prone to false judgement and was plagued with IP farming of players just \"banning\" everyone to get that easy IP. The new system has reduced false punishments drastically and provides little room for error since the system filters through flagged games that are up for review. It's not just 100% automated just so you know. There are Riot support members combing through the games that are flagged for review. The system just helps reduce the amount of false flags, or handle easy to detect games, such as language. \n\nContext doesn't matter since you are responsible for your own behavior. It doesn't matter if they were flaming you first, you do not flame back or stoop to their level of attitude unless you want to risk getting reported. Having a Rioter won't change the fact that you personally chose to act negatively.\n\n You already received chat restrictions, and Riot warned you ahead of time that continue this behavior will result in harsher punishments until you reform. At this point, if you continue this behavior it will result in a permanent ban, and as I said before, I'm pretty sure you don't want to lose your account. So I would stop finding excuses if I were you and own up to your behavior. Riot wants you to reform, so they've given you 3 chances to do it. I would highly suggest trying to so you don't lose your account forever.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FurriesAreHot","date":"2016-10-26T21:42:15.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Something tells me you cut stuff out","replies":[{"poster":"Vastayan Boss","date":"2016-10-26T21:45:47.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no\ngo on my stream rn twitch.tv/zyket\ni will show you the log\nfirst hand","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrazyBear1987","date":"2016-10-27T09:19:18.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did anybody ask for your opinion or \"constructive criticism\"? i didn't think so.\n\n\"Teach me senpai, teach me in all your knowledge of league\" - Nope.\n\nLets be honest, you were banned for other things, but \"constructive criticism\" was not one them.\n\nwake up and smell what your shoveling.\n\nDon't like how others are telling you your wrong? now you know how it feels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timethief49","date":"2016-10-27T06:34:10.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there go your ranked rewards","replies":[{"poster":"Vastayan Boss","date":"2016-10-27T08:19:49.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For no reason too lol.
