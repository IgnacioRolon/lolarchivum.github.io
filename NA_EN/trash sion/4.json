Vayne was good at 1v1s even before the changes to stealth broke her because she still offered agency to both her and you. It was about outplaying, so it's fun and intense. Late game she was still squishy and vulnerable to being 1 shotted even by not-so-full-combos, so the lack of pink ward slots kinda balanced that.\n\nNow, no matter what you do it's up to Vayne to fuck up instead of you to necessarily outplay her unless you're full skillshots. Even then, she has the advantage.
