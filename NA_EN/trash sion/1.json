I mean, the fact that everyone returned back to the thinking \" mordekaiser nerfed it's useless again as before \" is totally wrong and depends just on the fact they don't understand how it works. Some champions are unpopular and will be unpopular forever or till they are picked in LCS. It's not like low playrate = unworthy champion. There are some strategies like taking drake and diving bottom, or soloing baron with drake at 20 min, that if successfully work are really gamebreaking for the opponents. Maybe some rework here and there on his kit should be done since he needs rylai, but.. it's the first time i'm thinking on that: You can't add random slows to morde, because then they will build rylai again and permaslow people making it broken.. it's a bit tricky.\n\nWhat i certainly know is that you should view again the IA of the drake because it's bugged and most of the times morde has to keep telling him who to attack each autoattack the drake does, making the morde itsellf impossible to play with the champion in the meanwhile.\n\nAll the other spells are pretty much good for me and should stay untouched to prevent him become useless or too overpowered. Maybe the E needs some changes because it does no damage if you build it tanky ( and he's supposed to be built ap tanky as riot said ).\n\nFor the rest.. morde will anyways remain a champion made for teamcomps and will perform relatively bad in soloq all the time, that's not important, not all champions are made for soloq. But with a great teamcomp, like IVERN ;) .. he can do really good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AgeOfTheMage","date":"2016-09-22T21:06:48.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DDDDD:\ni'm okay with you updating galio and urgot, but no re-work plz ;-;","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCYOUNG888","date":"2016-09-22T20:25:16.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which champions are top priority for a rework after Warwick and Galio?","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2016-09-22T20:39:31.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a constantly shifting list, but they've been talking a lot about Urgot and Eve.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sohleks","date":"2016-09-22T20:15:50.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the Runaan's synergy there too the interaction would be bonkers...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unstoppable Monk","date":"2016-09-21T23:41:17.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:57}} maor trees","replies":[]}]}
