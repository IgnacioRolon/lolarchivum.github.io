Support is 20% of a teams roster. The population of support mains in high level play is significantly less than 10%. There aren't even half enough to go around.\n\nIn short, its not a matter of waiting 5 or 10 more minutes for your preferred role at this level of play. You will become gated by such a feature according to how many players are playing support at a given time. If you do what you desire here you might not be waiting 5 extra minutes to get into a game as your preferred role. You might be waiting HOURS, as players who queue ahead of you, who also need support (or any other role depending on the situation) finally get a support paired, play the game, finish it, then the support is immediately plugged into the next set of people who queued up. In order. That means wherever you were in the ORDER of players queuing up is when you will be matched for a game. This could make queue times for diamond and up increase by orders of magnitude as multiple games might have to be completed by a support player before they can finally be matched with you. And you will HAVE to remain in queue for the ENTIRE duration of the wait time or you lose your spot. So if you exit out of the queue before it matches you, you are now the BACK of the line. Meaning however long you already waited... was in vain.\n\nThis would be a very, very bad change and is why it will never happen.\n\nHonestly, if you are playing in diamond level play you SHOULD be capable of playing any role to a functional degree, even if you aren't good at it, you should be able to consistently perform your job and role function in games even if you perform it at a less than optimal level.\n\nThis is by far the best thing for the health of the game.\n\nRole Selection did nothing but give poor players a crutch to avoid having to learn basic gameplay fundamentals.\n\nThe quality of matches in all past seasons was infinitely better than it was in this last season. The best thing for the health of the game would probably be to revert to pick order and require players to \\*GASP\\* use teamwork skills in lobby and effective communication to get each player in an ideal situation to contribute to team success. The game was MUCH better when it was done that way.","replies":[{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-11-24T10:46:30.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont really have a problem with the queue times.

You end up wasting just as much time anyway.\n\nWell NOW you aren't even discussing issues related to autofill when you are talking about players being better in one role than another. This is a given and a fundamental fact. Players are going to be better or worse at different things depending on the amount of time and experience they have put into working on these things. But this isn't an issue that has anything to do with Role Selection, or even autofill.\n\nThat's a straight up issue with the ineffective and largely pointless ladder system which, for years, has consistently failed to accurately capture a players skill set and, in turn, failed to accurately pair them in matches. If you want THAT issue solved you need to rework the ranking system so that is no longer largely affected mostly by chance and luck and retool it to take into account more information about a person's individual skill metrics. Once you do this you can can more appropriately distill a player's skill set and then, with this new, more accurate ranking, players can be paired better to improve the quality of matches, even those in which a player must \"fill\" instead of getting his desired role.\n\nI wasn't exaggerating when I said that doing what you want and making autofill an opt into option would increase wait times for those choosing that option by orders of magnitude. That's just basic statistics. That's reality. And because that happens to be the way things work its not a practical solution.\n\nThere IS, however, a practical solution that would help in the types of situations you are concerned about.\n\nModify the ranking system to include all of a players individual skill metrics, with respect to every role, as well as utilize their overall W/L ratio (currently W/L ratio is used in a vaccum as a catchall for a player's \"skill\"). Give each player a W/L ranking. Give each player an individual performance for top lane ranking that accounts for every action this player takes as a top laner (literally everything, these stats are already tracked every game for the purposes of match history, so it shouldn't be at all difficult to utilize them in an algorithm that incorporates things like income rate, farm rate, KDA, objectives secured, kill participation, ward score, proximity to large engagements or objectives taken, etc etc). Give each player an individual performance ranking for every other role. Now you have 6 separate rankings for a player. Overall win rate (overall performance metric) and separate independent role ratings (specific performance metrics). Combine all this information as a 7th, composite ranking.\n\nOnce you have a system set up to do this the problem becomes much simpler to solve. Now, each match that is paired is paired on a greater amount of information. It starts by finding players within the acceptable composite rankings. Then it compares the individual rankings with respect to role and identifies players with similar individual role rankings as well as similar overall rankings. Finally, it matches players more evenly based off this greater amount of information. What this will mean for autofill situations is that whatever role a player is autofilled into is going to be a role where the enemy player is roughly equal in skill to them at that role. This eliminates the inherent RNG/luck factor that autofill seems to exihibit. It would prevent players from being autofilled at a significant disadvantage and prevent such lopsided, low quality matches.\n\nThere really isn't a way to effectively allow players to ONLY choose 1 or 2 specific roles to play all the time, particularly up here in high level play. But there IS a way to ensure that teams consisting of players matched under these circumstances have a fair competition. And the solution to this isn't anything to do with Role Selection or Autofill, the solution is to fix the broken ranking ladder system that is incapable of functioning in its intended fashion in the first place the overwhelming majority of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-11-24T11:31:54.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think autofill makes it even worse.

I main support, but i can play other roles at a decent level too, because that is needed.\n\nSecondly, don't bullcrap about runes. You can easily make 2 rune pages that cover almost all champs.

If you force me to fill something I didn&amp;#039;t queue for, I&amp;#039;m not doing it. Whether that mean we duo top or jungle, or I pull the trusty Singed Support, I&amp;#039;m not doing it. Sorry, not sorry. I want quality games, not a ton of shitty ones.\n\nSo we are now upvoting people who say \"top or troll?\" or what is happening right now?\nThanks boards, you disappointed me again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Weathered","date":"2016-11-24T04:18:29.707+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"What really bothers me is all these people up in arms about autofill but not too long ago guaranteed roles didn't even exist and it was a lottery pick of what you got regarding pick order.\n\nIt's like giving people ice cream with sprinkles, but then having a recall on the sprinkles and all of a sudden there are riots in the street.","replies":[{"poster":"1 800 Top Lane","date":"2016-11-24T07:30:21.705+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, are all the riots on the news actually about sprinkles?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-11-24T01:29:39.929+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pity the adc that gets stuck with me if I ever get auto filled to support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThePartyLeader","date":"2016-11-23T23:07:08.445+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":4,"body":"So you wouldn't have played in ranked anyways since before the new queue you were even less likely to get your role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wolf Queen","date":"2016-11-24T12:34:06.164+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":6,"body":"Your seriously complaining? We all used to auto fill before this queue system came out, everyone used to complain about that too. Now your sitting here complaining because its not 100% perfect? Stfu already. If your going to troll your team on purpose cause your an immature child having a tantrum cause he didn't get his way then you'll be banned rather quick.\n\nAlso Diamond players and sometimes plat players already got auto filled long before they made it happen for all ranks.
