She is intended to be interrupted by cc\n\nYes, there is some wonkiness in her ult, but most of it is intended for balance reasons, because of how powerful her base kit is.

That amount of damage is easy to estimate when it comes to deciding if you should go in on an enemy or not. However, you have to prepare for the worst case scenario in which your ultimate doesn't connect and may actually take you away from your target.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, to be a successful Shyvana, you have to only put yourselves in situations where your base kit would be enough to kill someone, just in case your ultimate whiffs. If your ultimate does land, now it's overkill and you've likely missed out on situations where, with your ult, you could have killed someone but were too afraid that it wouldn't do what it should.\n\nI would gladly take a compensation nerf to her base kit for a more reliable ult. That way, she would have a higher routine damage output in a full combo, without having to account for the random chance that your Ult doesn't work properly and you don't have the damage to finish the enemy off otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"LordForrest","date":"2016-09-19T03:52:49.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh, its not a random chance that her ult won't work.

The only people who need her ult for damage are Wizard Lizard players.\n\nHonestly i am confused by why you are asking for this, because to make her ult reliable in the way you want would require a kit rework just so she doesn't become just an ult.  Basically it would make her warwick,  only really useful for his ult.  Guess what, hes next up on the Champion Update schedule for pretty much that exact reason.  As it stands Shyv's kit is good as it is and i would rather keep what we have instead of nerfing her just so her ult can be reliable.","replies":[{"poster":"trash sion","date":"2016-09-19T13:23:18.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of alluded to this in my previous reply, but even if you aren't using the ult for damage, the knockback would give you time for 2-3 more autos and a few more seconds of burnout damage. That's a lot of damage with a Titanic Hydra and Bloodrazor. Because of its unreliability, you have to go into a gank expecting to not have that extra damage, so it seems a bit unfair that you have to bank on a chunk of her damage not being able to connect to gank successfully\n\nAs for your Warwick comment, there's a bit of a difference between a ~2 second supress that deals 350 base damage with a 200% AD scaling that applies On-hits 5 times and a short AoE knockback with 425 base and 70% scaling in a stat she doesn't even commonly build. A simple change to make the cast range box match how wide the actual ultimate is and a mention in the tooltip of how far Shyvana drags the targets is all I ask. It's simply a QoL change, not a gameplay buff. \n\nSure, Rito could increase the hitbox to match the cast indicator and make Shyvana drag her target the entire duration, because those changes would match the current indicators in this iteration of her ult, but that would be a gameplay buff.

You make it sound like she is the only one doing anything.  Also on you don't have to ult the entire distance, you can make it shorter if necessary to avoid overshooting the target.\n\nWell, you never said that you just want a clearer picture of her current hitbox for her ult.  I was under the impression that you wanted the hitbox to match her model and drag them the entire distance.  Which if made, the power it grants would basically make her Warwick because her base kit would need to be nerfed in to a lackluster state and only really be used for her ult.  An ult that could reposition the entire enemy team.\n\nI would have to look at it again, but i think the indicator is only as wide as her body, which is the actually hitbox.  Not her wings.

How do you reconcile the fact that Shyv's ult (when hit correctly, which I do most of the time) does exactly what you're saying she isn't meant to do?  \n\nFixing the hitbox isn't even a buff...it's a quality of life fix.  It would change Shyv for the players that aren't really good at playing her, and possibly bring her back into the meta.  Personally, I don't need it because when I miss my ult, I miss it because someone flashes or clicks a lantern.

I brought him up once saying he needs to put his life on the line to Shurima Shuffle. And no, they're not applicable on Shyv. Gnar and Poppy are most certainly tanks, though in mini-form Gnar is more fighter like, since their abilites focus on DISRUPTING and CC'ing teams.

That Shyvana, a fighter, is defined by her ability (or thereof lack of) to shove people in a fight? Because that is not what Shyvana is defined by. She is defined by her tanky, hard to kite, DPS, not some mediocre engage that does not need to be buffed. \n\nLet me clarify something which i may have mistyped. When i said\n> Shyv is a fighter/juggernaut and like one, does not need to CC to back up her strong late game dueling.\n\nI had meant she did not need the CC brought on by a change of her Ult to make it more reliable. The CC she gets from her ult now is fine because her dueling powered is also really good. By giving her better CC and keeping the same dueling power, than you're just overloading it. \n\nAnd just because you don't agree with my arguement, doesn't mean I don't have a point. That is twice you've said that I am not being logical but I have. Shyvana is a fighter, who has some CC with her ult, but that CC does NOT define her ult. What defines her ult is the fact that it upgrades her abilities and gets her into the fight. \n\nShyvana is NOT a tank and does not need a mass aoe engage. Look at all the Juggernauts (Darius, Garen, Illaoi, Mordekaiser, Skarner and Olaf), except for Skarner none of them are based around engaging teamfights. They're god like in teamfights, but they lack the mobility (dashes, not speed boosts so we're clear) and CC to engage them, usually relying on another member to start the fight. \n\nAlso let it be clear that catching someone out is not engage. You simply caught them out. Engaging is like Naut's Q, Malphite R, Kled R, etc. Those are abilities that FORCE people to fight. Catching someone out at least allows the enemy team to ditch that caught out dude. Shyvana may be a variation of a Juggernaut with some engage, but engage is NOT what defines Shyvana.","replies":[{"poster":"Kinetika","date":"2016-09-19T22:39:44.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dr Mercy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=vULmHoIc,comment-id=000b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-19T21:36:34.893+0000)\n\n> Shyvana is NOT a tank and does not need a mass aoe engage. \n\nThen why does she have one?","replies":[{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2016-09-19T22:59:01.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She doesn't.

Your ult as shyvana should be used to either 1: turn your single target attacks into AoE attacks, 2: add a bit of burst to finish off an opponent or 3: use it as a form of movement.\n\nShyvana's ult's main focus isn't to cc, but it is part of her kit.

Counterjungling, objective control, split push, those are all options.\n\nLast point, I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT THE HITBOX IS WONKY.
