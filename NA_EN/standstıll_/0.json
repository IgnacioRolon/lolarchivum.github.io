Fair enough right?  NO!

I did my going-to-be teammates a favor.  There should be a system for this.\n\n<removed  by moderation>\nThat&#039;s a screenshot i took before I dodged.  Plz Riot.

But you should submit a support ticket for this. And remove the image, or edit it, as it is naming and shaming.\n\nI just though of this: maybe there could be a button, indicating that player had done something bad, and set it as a **reminder** for your post-game report. It shouldn't kick a player from lobby, as he/she hasn't affected the gameplay yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Umbral Regent","date":"2017-12-30T00:41:15.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I just though of this: maybe there could be a button, indicating that player had done something bad, and set it as a reminder for your post-game report.

That said;\n\n...Shit. I can't even really think of anything negative to say about this idea. I gotta admit, I'm stumped.\n\nI think that'd be a really good tool for pretty much everyone.
