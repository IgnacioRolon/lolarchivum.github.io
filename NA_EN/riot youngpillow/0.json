This only happens while im playing league of legends. I have tried changing usb ports. I use a logitech g-402 mouse, intel core i5-4690k processor, 8gb ram, nvdia gtx 750 ti graphics card. my copy of windows is not genuine. Any help/suggestions on to what might be causing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-08T00:48:08.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like something might be shifting the focus of your OS to a different window, but it's still showing League at the front for some strange reason. We could try resetting your config to make sure your mouse settings are still setup properly for it the work in League, but before jumping to that I'd like to see if clicking a few times will make League respond or not. Test it in a custom game and if that doesn't work then go ahead and reset your config files using these steps.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Riot YoungPillow","date":"2017-08-08T23:57:16.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the reply!

That helps me to narrow down the main issue at least! This might be something to do with your mouse drivers, so let's check for that really quickly.
