It just really affects how the game feels, and trying to get off a perfect Ryze combo is really difficult when you can't see it happen.\n\nMy friend said he's also experiencing this too, and it's only been occurring today.\n\nEDIT: I am not in Canada or the NE United States, nor do I have Bell. I have WideOpenWest for my ISP, and I live in South Carolina. Perhaps my problem is different than the others on this board, but I'm still experiencing massive packet loss, up to 20%.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-08T02:02:09.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeeeeaaaa this is definitely a packet loss issue as well. 20% packet is no joke, so it's no wonder your abilities aren't firing off correctly. Even though you're not in the same areas as others, packet loss is still going to weigh pretty heavily on your connection. \n\nGo ahead and reach out to your ISP to confirm whether or not yours is having issues as well. If so, please let me know so I can pass that word along too. If not, reach out to our techies in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if they can adjust anything for a smoother connection.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanderling","date":"2017-08-08T01:03:34.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/qLmCZ\n\n[](http://imgur.com/a/qLmCZ)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ignis","date":"2017-08-07T23:16:16.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[It would be useful to consolidate these threads](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/1VluGcrg-lag-spikes-in-rankeds)","replies":[]}]}
