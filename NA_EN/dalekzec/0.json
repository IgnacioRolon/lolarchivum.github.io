I am from Lebanon and our Arabic compared to the traditional Arabic are very very VERY different.\nWhat you were using (or probably at least) was the traditional Arabic.\nHowever, I am not aware that Senna can mean brightness in Arabic, but...honestly I'm sure most of us don't because Arabic is like the 2nd largest language to learn. Even Arabs can struggle when it comes to mastering it.\n\nAnyway, I actually learned something from this.\nI bet it's a lot of fun being the narrative write for the champions' lore. I'm someone who loves stories very much and even make my own stories (can't say I'm pro though) and I love League's stories completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Cairo King","date":"2019-11-06T23:17:31.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From Egypt, we also have our own dialect and yes it does mean tooth lol.
