I've seen players reporting others for \"cheating\", now you'd assume it's due to scripting but in fact it's actually simply because they're playing champions that are strong af, and stomped the enemy into oblivion.\r\n\r\nI've even seen a thread of someone who says he report every Akali player regardless if ally or enemy team, whether good or bad, or anything. Simply for playing a toxic champion basically. I don't know if I can link the thread to you (due to naming and shaming rule), mods, can I link it?\r\n\r\nSo I'm curious to know. Is it possible to be punished for falsely reporting other players?\r\nI can imagine a new report system about champion balance, but that's another thread i'm planning to make later on.","replies":[]}
