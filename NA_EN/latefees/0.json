I was thinking for a suggestion to change the question mark ping. Or please make it something I can report a player for. It tilts me off the planet when people spam ping me and induces 30 tons of rage. You cant mute the pings from players. You just get pinged occasionally by players and its not really spam, so its not something I can put as spam. I also dont feel as though this is being taken seriously. Theres literally nothing other than {{champion:126}} top that can tilt me harder. I&#039;d hate for this to be a reason I get reported for being &quot;mean&quot; to my fellow players because it honestly pisses me off. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the world I can do to remove the BM pings from flooding my screen. I can mute a player (Which by the way, really irritates me that I have to mute about 90% of my teammates), but I cant disable pings from other players. I really dont want to see their pings to be honest. I&#039;d vote to remove them completely if I didnt think other players would defend the idea of keeping the BM pings around. Anyone else here on this one with me? \r\n\r\nAlso, maybe there&#039;s a way to disable the pings through editing the league of legends folder? My god plz help.","replies":[{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-02-11T19:15:41.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"You can type /ignore PLAYERNAME (or ENEMIES or ALL too)and it will block pings as well as mastery emotes.
