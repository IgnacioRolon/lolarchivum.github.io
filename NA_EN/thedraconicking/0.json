Example for a minion it grows into the size of a normal champion if they turn into a larger monster it shrinks you down to the size of a normal champion and it gives you unique abilitys based off of the creature you take over your ultimate you always have is to exit the creature. (Or its a unique ultimate im not sure) now in your normal base form you have an auto attack that doesn't do a lot of damage and you have an ult which you can get at level 6 and the level 6 ultimate is you can dive into an Allied or enemy champion and create a clone of them with has reset cooldowns and the items they are building. I think it should last for like 1 or 2 ultimate cooldowns so like 2 maybe 3 minutes and once that time is up you go back to your normal form and your Ultimate goes on cooldown\r\n\r\nI think another thing is they cannot access the shop instead at specific levels they can choose to upgrade his stats like health mana cd ration etc (still unsure about this)\r\n\r\nI guess i should specify that in melee minions theyre auto and abilities= to other melee champs damage wise and the ranged auto and abilties= to ranged champes damage etc etc so that way the champion is comprable to other champions\r\n\r\nVisual wise probably a gross monster but i dont realy have an image in mind\r\n\r\nLore wise probably some form of changling or such","replies":[{"poster":"Disco Swiss","date":"2020-01-04T06:28:21.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neat.\nI like the idea of a jungler gaining abilities from neutral creeps.\nThere is actually a hero from Dota who does this \"Doom\" he munches jungle creeps and gains a special ability from that creep until he munches a new one. That's a unique concept league could use.\n\nAbathur from HoTs has ultimate that clones an ally and resets cooldowns too. Can't clone enemies though.\n\nNone of this is outside the realms of possibility\n\n The only crazy idea is the idea that this champ couldnt access the shop.\nThats just a key feature to the game.\nWould you use gold for upgrades instead of items?\nHow much would upgrades cost compared to items?\nWould upgraded abilities transfer to clones?\nCould you sell upgrades?\n\nI also want to say it makes me happy you visualize this champ as a gross monster..  Instead of just... Slim Guy/Girl with anime hair and no distinguishing facial features..","replies":[{"poster":"thedraconicking","date":"2020-01-09T13:08:10.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate the reply.  The only reason i had an issue with giving the character gold is you build different items based on if your ranged or melee etc and i didnt know how to balance that without adding items (unless theres items that would work idk the item list very well). If it went the upgrade rout i would just remove gold completely like you dont even gold.  And switch it with something like blood or essence or something. And at x amount of essence you can upgrade. (Kinda like kayne but not realy lol)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xUnRavelx","date":"2020-01-04T04:05:27.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great concept, I love it.
