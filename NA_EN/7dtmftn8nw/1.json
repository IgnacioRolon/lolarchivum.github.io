(Since they had a nice time)\r\n\r\nWhile the current price for dodging a troll is around 5 LP per case, I highly suggest to have a \"Dodge Threshold per Day for Trolls\" that a player can resort to, which by clicking on it will automatically dodge the game for you.\r\nOnce or Twice a day is fine.\r\nDodging through this manner should result in the collection of the chatlog and situation in the champion select phase.\r\nRiot observes the case later on, and if the player has been found to have abused the Dodge Threshold, they will get severely penalized.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","replies":[]}
