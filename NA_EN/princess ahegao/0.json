It mostly goes to the right or top but its getting out of hand! How do I fix it?\r\n\r\nMy other problem is that whenever I get gifted, when the box with the gift pops up saying \"you were gifted\" and the little text from a friend, well the sound doesnt play. It did a couple week ago for a short while but I dont know what changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-23T23:46:52.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with Smart Pings is typically caused by a background app, so I recommend [performing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to prevent those apps from loading with your PC at boot.\n\nAs for the missing sounds, try [running a repair of the client's files](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq5).
