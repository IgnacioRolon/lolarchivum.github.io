Upon trying to login however, I discovered I had been suspended for 2 weeks. Turns out Riot is accusing me of MMR Boosting. Im in silver 5 currently, but I seeded into bronze 4 at the beginning of the season and it has been a TRIAL to move up out of the darkest depths of \"elo-hell\". I've moved from Maryland to Florida, back to Maryland, and now am in Washington state. I travel a bit but what in the world would make them think i was boosting my MMR? \r\n\r\nIf i was boosting wouldnt i be in gold? lol not silver 5... but what aggravates me the most is this. They are taking ALL OF MY REWARDS FROM ANY SEASON. EVER. I made this account in season 1 and have never been above silver 3. I am devastated. I spend a LOT of time on this game and have grown considerably as a player. but boosting? no. i did it MYSELF. and now it means nothing?","replies":[{"poster":"cluvie","date":"2015-08-04T22:30:44.129+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Nazarith -\n\nI appreciate your concern with ensuring that our detection is accurate and only catching those that should be detected for elo boosting. As such, when we receive disputes, we investigate each case just to make sure we didn't miss anything while configuring it for detection; it's totally possible we could have, so we want to check the integrity of the system by reviewing cases. \n\nFor your particular case, your boosting happened early on in the season and had nothing to do with travel between Maryland and Florida. Looks like you made some quick trips to Canada and back though, within ~20 minutes.\n\nPlease keep in mind that even sharing your account with a friend  or even a family member is still account sharing and that any behavior that is found on the account while the sharing takes place, is ultimately the responsibility of the account owner.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2015-08-05T01:32:59.561+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"☐ Not REKT \n☑ REKT \n☑ REKTangle \n☑ SHREKT \n☑ REKT-it Ralph \n☑ Total REKTall \n☑ The Lord of the REKT \n☑ The Usual SusREKTs \n☑ North by NorthREKT \n☑ REKT to the Future \n☑ Once Upon a Time in the REKT \n☑ The Good, the Bad, and the REKT \n☑ LawREKT of Arabia \n☑ Tyrannosaurus REKT \n☑ eREKTile dysfunction","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nazarith","date":"2015-08-05T20:08:47.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so turns out my friend who lives in Canada was on my account.

As long as you look guilty its good enough for a ban and a strike on your record. They don't want to be lenient on people regardless of rank because at this point Riot is treating the game as an esport and that everyone is a professional player. \"Spirit\" of the game or not, there are far worse offenders and there are probably plenty of real boosted player that are still out there trying to weasel themselves into the highest of ranks just for the sake of having challenger rank. The idea that riot could be slightly reasonable about this is a pipe dream and they couldn't care less. I don't think I can view riot the same way while they let people say some of the most malicious things and give them a slap on the wrist. Quite frankly I can't view league the same way or even want to give them my money anymore after spending 100s of dollars only to be treated like the worst criminal for an act that I was accused of without the evidence being presented to me. Instead I have to go out of my way to go on the forums to have the evidence presented to the public and people actively humiliating you on the sole basis that you look guilty even if it may not even be the case.

Riot is literally automating the whole punishment process taking the human thought out of the whole process and Riot takes pride in this.\n\nYou have to understand this from a development standpoint.  What they were doing was taking it case by case.  Boosters were getting punished when they go reported or were going over board with it.  Their player base has grown immensely that by automating it to find accounts within their typical banning parameter made it more feasible for them as a company to manage.   It doesn't matter how much man power you dump into it, a computer will always be faster and more accurate.  Human thought is put into the parameters.  It's not like the machine chose the threshold to choose when to punish and not.  That was programmed by a human who was given a lot of data that in a nut shell said \"This is when we determine an account gets banned.\"\n\nAutomating it let the system find accounts that were boosting, but not reported.  If someone was really boosting, they know it and probably wouldn't risk saying they were innocent.  It went from a reporting system with less scope to more scope, so more players are going to get affected.  Because of this there will be more false positives.  Meaning there will be hits on accounts that hit the 'ban threshold', but really are innocent and need a human to make an exception.  It's easier to manage the false positives on a high scope system compared to manually managing all the true positives on a low scope system.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Syrax,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=bedNZrhg,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-08-04T07:41:40.596+0000)\n>\n> Same problem here.

It may possibly be seeing a spike in performance with said champ that is irregular.  However that is just one of the risks you play with when playing on a smurf like that.
