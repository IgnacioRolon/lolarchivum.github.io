You got an S- and not an S or S+? \n\nThat *shouldn't* give a mastery 7 token, as those require S or S+'s. \n\nBroporo there might be seeing an S game from a few days ago, which you probably did get your token for, but you wouldn't get a mastery 7 token for a S- game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-03T03:18:14.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a very good point.
