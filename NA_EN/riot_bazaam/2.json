I'm doing a multi-part study on the perspectives of League of Legends players, and the understanding and communication between Riot and the community.\r\n\r\nThis is the second survey of the series, focused on understanding expectations and comparing it with how Riot has lived up to these expectations. It's only 2 questions, should take less than 3 minutes. Feedback is absolutely welcome! Please comment with suggestions for future research\r\n\r\nHere it is! http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2157517/Player-Expectations\r\n\r\nPart 1 can be found here. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/gttJej4G-league-of-legends-player-perceptions-study I've left it open, so if you missed it the first time around feel free to go check it out!
