Her q,w,e are very difficult to differentiate animation wise which makes it very hard to dodge and counter play effectively, and even worse when she evolves you can have any number of abilities flying over the wall and you have no clue what your dealing with. this skin is honestly unbalanced in my opinion.\r\n\r\nis there a mod of some sort that i can revert elemental lux back into plain on normal lux. You know so I can play a free to play game without having to face wallet warriors with broken skins. thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-02T02:51:45.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a way to change what skin shows for other players, but perhaps you can tweak your display's colour and picture settings to make it easier to see. Most monitors allow you to change Brightness and Contrast at least, and I feel maybe changing these values around could help for now.\n\nI hope this helps in some way. Let me know if you have any other concerns.","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Poodle","date":"2016-12-07T10:44:57.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone _*made*_ a custom mod that would make all champions use base models and animations for the player it was installed for and only that player, would it violate the rules?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rabblerouser","date":"2016-12-01T21:09:03.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just stopping by and showing my agreement that her abilities are indeed hard to differentiate and even notice sometimes.

Suddenly that Q isn't gold anymore, but some sort of wispy orange and then maybe an aqua-ish color. Hard to keep up with the color changes. All the other Lux skins have obvious hitboxes to their Q's.","replies":[]}]}
