The heal was broken, and honestly probably still needs a nerf, but the 200 ad is crazy. i think he got one Q off and an auto on rekkles and the bleed alone killed him because of his bonus AD. \n\nthe dunk resets will always be a thing as they should be. this is what makes him a threat. If you take this away there would never ever be a reason to pick a darius. Think of darius like the risky top lane version of katarina. If you get the resets you leave enemy team wondering why they didnt ban you or focus you. If you dont, you look silly and useless (much like all the other darius have looked so far). \n\nI hate darius, I think champions like him and katarina are frustrating to play against. but to say he needs to lose all the things that are good about him is a bit ridiculous. the passive 200 ad and heal are the main thing.  the pull is essential or he'd be useless and his ult is what makes him darius.","replies":[{"poster":"SymbolicFear","date":"2015-10-04T18:08:18.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I am not saying take away his ult, I am saying he shouldn't be able to sustain himself to such a degree, deal so much damage, and then ult to instantly delete 75% health targets, yet have 4k health and tons of armor.

The issue with countering Darius with a Quinn in the top lane is that you will lose valuable cc and tank options for the rest of your team.\n\nQuinn top build BoRK then pure tank. Use passive to harass.\nQuinn can be a cc tank with her vault and blind and just generally being annoying and in the way. She builds tank pretty well. And still decent map control/splitpush/sneaking a tower kill in here and there with her ulti.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonShea","date":"2015-10-06T00:36:43.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet Vanye and Jinx are still on the loose.
