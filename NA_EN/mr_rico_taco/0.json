Can Rito do it?.","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are many trolls , some people hide with agressive passive words or with simple text, provoke other that got blamed by his fault, duos that see his duo is trolling and say nothing, spam pings or things like that like spam laugh  animation sound...\nso i was wondering if Riot has a record of the people that got the pings time lapse so they cann t continue with that ...for some bigger time or the reports of passive-agressive people that provoke others, etc... because sometimes people can report the wrong person and  Riot could probably punish the wrong one.\n\n\nCan they be punished?\n\nFor example,\n\nI am new at this game , but i always played other kinda strategic games so...i just played with someone that in chat was trying to make be the bad guy, when i was vs 2 or 3 at toplane ,  so he was with his duo, this one  didnt say a word at all  and that wasnt helping the team or to enjoy the game because of his teameate, but at my perspective, this duo was trolling, well maybe not the one that dindnt talk, but they made a lot of mistakes, this was from a Xaya and Rakan players, and the Xaya was the troll to me , this adc just let people die so he can  get a kill,  said things like &quot;rumble dont use ulti on minions&quot; \n on chat when iam fighting vs 2 or 3 at toplane, &quot;re-group rumble, go baron&quot; when i am at mid in a open nexus vs superminions and enemychamps ,  this guy was playing just for his KDA and i was all the time 1 vs 2 or 2 vs 3, so was something frustrating to hear this troll, at the end in all chat this guy say &quot;all your troll for nothing Rumble&quot;  &quot;please report Rumble&quot;. The enemy said i was the only reason that this game didnt end at 20 min, but i think they didnt report him.\n\nCan I do something so this guy never be again at my team?\n\nThanks for ur opinion and sorry if my english is not too good, am trying. xD\n\nGreetings summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"eazymakaveli3","date":"2017-04-27T16:52:47.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would love to have chat in replays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OnlyYouCanHearMe","date":"2017-04-27T02:32:33.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely report players like that if they are trying to get you in trouble in game.  Try your best to never say anything back to them in chat, mute them if you need to.  And, since you are on North America, you shouldn't have too many problems with seeing that player again.  Especially at the earlier levels, there are so many accounts that you could play a hundred games and never see the same players twice.  But if you do happen to see them again, you can always put them on your ignore list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-27T01:10:04.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot records and knows, all of it is automatically checked if you report someone.
