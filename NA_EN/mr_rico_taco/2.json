Notice others responding talking about  Leo, Thresh, and Rakan.  Gotta have a play maker like that (Blitz, Bard also work) and then make a play or two.  Not saying you can't get honor on traditional supps, but you still gotta make a play noticeable.  The other day, I got a Janna shield on our jg Rengar who was basically carrying, as he was running out of the enemy base with like 10 life.  I saved him from an aa or a minion or something with a quick shield, and he was super grateful.  I think I got my 1 honor from him for that one play.\n\nOther times, I just set up my adc several times with a CCer like zyra, morg or nami and i get honor from them.\n\nBasically, you have to stand out and  your 0-0-40 stat line isn't going to impress if your carry is 15-4-10.  K is worth like 5x A in most people's eyes. \n\nSO, make plays.\n\nIn essence, your theory is correct....harder to get honor on support, you really need to stand out, but it is very possible.  I prob get honor in 3/4 games.  Once in awhile I get 2.  Think I got 3 once.","replies":[{"poster":"Killed Inaction","date":"2017-07-24T14:31:45.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well, technically the kill _is_ worth about 2 assists in most cases. Up to 4 assists can be obtained per kill. The assists can be gained from a single auto-attack or dealing 90% of the enemy's HP or by applying a small slow, or by stunlocking them to death. There's a lot of variation—in some cases, the assist is pretty much worthless, while in others the assist is worth much more than the kill, but I notice that in teamfights assists pop up everywhere without necessarily actually meaning anything.\n\nSo, 0/0/40 as a support is still better than 15/4/10 in most people's eyes, but the real difference comes down to, _how well_ did you actually play as _support_? Do you have good warding? Good pings to tell people to back off for incoming ganks? Did you make calls on objectives? Were you there for every teamfight, making a difference with your CC, shields, and/or healing?\n\nI've noticed that both good supports and bad supports can get a score like that, and the good ones will always get honors, while the bad ones almost never do. If you're not actually contributing anything other than the occasional auto to grab those assists, nobody will enjoy your \"assistance\". It just comes down to your perceived impact—saving someone will mean a lot.\n\nAs a burst mage support, I often have the highest damage in the game. But if I'm not actively _supporting_ rather than racking up the damage and kills, people don't want me on their teams. That's the difference between a good Lux support and a bad one—you _must_ have more impact than just assists and kills. The same goes for the carries—if they just pick up kills with one last auto, people will recognize that they aren't actually contributing, so they won't be getting honored either.\n\nI guess I agree with you, but the way you addressed the kill/assist difference seemed somewhat dismissive, though there's some truth in that perception. Sure, it's inflated, but that doesn't mean it's not legitimate in some ways.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-07-24T14:58:26.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think I'm being dismissive of assists at all.  I don't recall a single post game chat where a teammate said....\"OMG look at all those assists our supp had.\"  The only time people make a big deal about assists is when they have too many and they aren't supp. \"OMG, guess I'm supporting this game,\" says the 1-1-8 ADC.\n\nI had a 3-4-32 Nami game yesterday...bubbling this and that, healing everyone, helping them escape with my passive.  No honor, no comments.  SO even sometimes when making plays, there's no honor....even with 32 assists.\n\nBTW, people don't care about warding and other supp duties.  They are glad it's there and miss certain things when it's not, but again, never have I had anyone congratulate me on my vision score, which is stellar.","replies":[{"poster":"Killed Inaction","date":"2017-07-24T16:36:19.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstood. I felt like you were dismissive of the perception that assists are worth significantly less than kills. Many people, as you said, seem to think it's 1 kill = 4-5 assists. But there's some truth in that; as a support main, I'd estimate 1 kill = about 2 assists.\n\nI think it's more about the pinging, which you can only do if you have those wards down. If you ping someone to fall back when a gank is incoming, and they listen, they'll be appreciative when they survive. Usually.","replies":[{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-07-24T18:07:58.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"oh... haha.  no.  i think we are on the same page, just misread each other.\n\nanyway, a side note.  i think the team mates you get come into play ofc.  i just had a similar nami game.  i didnt carry, but i was all over the place, helping out team mates and i got 3 honors.  so each game will have its own honor even if you perform the same exact way.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beas7ie","date":"2017-07-24T15:28:21.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they're good, then I usually favor the support when honoring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauchmelder","date":"2017-07-24T14:03:11.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I play with my friends (4 man premade) we only go for ARAM.

The role of healer isn't the best play maker. It's like when you have a very well played Leona or Thresh; the visual is very easy to see. You notice their playmaking. With Soraka she's just a heal bot that mostly goes unappreciated. Also when Soraka does well, it means everyone else is doing well.
