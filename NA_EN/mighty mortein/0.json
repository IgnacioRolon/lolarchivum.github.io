And for whatever reason, I can't log in today. I checked the server status for my ISP and for the OCE server on League and both are fine. I followed most of the steps of the suggested support page and no avail. The only thing I didn't touch is my DNS settings but I don't think I need to since it's not a patching issue. What should I do? I also ran the Hextech Repair Tool if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"LocaButt","date":"2017-05-09T07:42:49.131+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am logged in now on NA.\nThanks whoever flipped the power back on! ;)\n\nEdit: I am logged in but none of the content is showing up.
