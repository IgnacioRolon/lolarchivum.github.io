We&#x27;re going to look into addressing this so things are a little more cohesive.\n\nHello, Just wanted to point out some things. \n\nThe Splash art gives a really \"light as air\" feeling, for example, the light accented color scheme, the thin silky robes that give off the idea of an classic female Warring Kingdoms era Chinese warrior, and it pulls so much of your interest. But the in-game model has much sharper color tones and a much much thicker robe, that if you look at the model at first glance it kinda looks like warring kingdoms riven skin. Speaking of robes, there are a lot of messy details in the in-game model. Someone made a comparison picture of it ( **https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/3ckfAmWN-everything-wrong-with-soaring-sword-fiora-detailed-analysis** ) and I hope these points will not be overlooked and Fiora mains do hope that players can make a difference. Good luck with you works.\n\nPS: Is anyone reminded of Pre-rework Fiora looking at the splash art. Kinda reminds me of the aloof Noble Swordswoman who would keep diving you  under tower  when she gets fed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gubigubi","date":"2017-09-20T05:00:34.128+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they need to change the ingame model to match the icon and splash.

Honestly I think they should have held off on revealing these skins until everything was more ready, because Fiora's differences are very large. There needs to be more cohesion checks between the teams so that everything matches up, because both the Fiora and Janna icons don't match the splash arts very well. This has also happened before with Conquerer Karma and her icon- they look so different that the icon doesn't even really look much like Karma at all!\n\nIt's disappointing because League is such an amazing game, and the creators behind the scenes are just phenomenal, but there are some problems I've been noticing as of late when it comes to skin quality, and it's concerning. I just think that overall, the teams should be checking in with one another more frequently to make sure that everything matches, and creates a cohesive story, rather than having one thing portray the character one way while another thing portrays them a different way (I.E.: icons and splashes, or splashes and models).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TricolorStar","date":"2017-09-20T06:23:40.661+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want them to adjust the colors if only for the fact that Winter Wonder Karma has a huge difference between her splash and in-game model and it's really off putting\n\nEx.
