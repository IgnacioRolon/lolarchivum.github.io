Our VFX bros Isaac and Nate definitely knocked it out of the park on that one, along with the modelers and splash/concept artists. I'll pass your hype along!  I mean, I kind of already did when I bought the skin with my own hard-earned Riot Points. Like a coal miner grabbing some smokes from the company store. {{sticker:sg-ezreal}} \n\nIn general, it's always kind of fun working on updates, and watching as some of the most unloved skins (from a project scope, if not player perspective) start to pop and come to life. I love how awesome Crabgot became at his price pointâ€”I believe he's 520. And I'm not sure what 975 skins are supposed to have, but I think Hyena Warwick probably has some extra value squeezed in. It took a few conversations to get his extra VO approved, nowadays that sort of thing is becoming standard!\n\nThe reason we do it, usually, is we don't want the skin fantasy to break. We have to get them to a shippable level for 2018, even if that means adding more than the price point usually calls for.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbidden Siren","date":"2018-03-02T06:55:43.740+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you guys ever revisit Sabretusk Sejuani's skin and at least change the colors of the particles like you did with Shadow Evelynn and Artic Swain?currently, the icy blue particulars does not match at all.

I'll mention Sabre Sej to some folks. There are slightly different considerations in play when we do (or rather, _[did](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/06/champion-roadmap-june-2017/)_) class updates compared to VGUs. With multiple champs, the work often grew at a faster rate than the team working on it.
