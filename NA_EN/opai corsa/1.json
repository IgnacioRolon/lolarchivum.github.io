As a first step, disable any third party programs if you have any running like play.tv or recorder.  They can tend to cause issues with the client and crash, especially after a patch.  I also recommend going over our [game crash](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes+) guide in case there is a corruption with your game files or driver problem causing this.
