I had selected Caitlyn Rebel Pink earlier today and when I picked her in the new champ select, Rebel Pink remained selected. Perhaps you could play a custom game, select the chroma you want, leave the custom game, and then start up a game using the new champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Mıkø","date":"2016-01-16T15:43:11.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will definitely have to try that.
