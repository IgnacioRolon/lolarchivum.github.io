My game bug splats in every game mode regardless of who I am playing, runes/masteries I pick etc. I've tried every option laid out in the support link for troubleshooting and nothing has worked. Has anyone else experienced issues like this? Really want to be able to play and I've been unable to for weeks now.\n\nI should mention that I have the same issue with both the updated and legacy console. I've tried reinstalling, repairing, restarting my computer, shutting it down completely, the works. I'm at a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-12T23:35:14.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you make any recent changes to your computer setup? Something like changed your monitor, any custom modifications to game files or install any recent windows updates or programs? If you're running Windows 10, be sure that the Windows Game Bar isn't enabled, as it has caused bugsplats upon loading in the past. You can find a guide on how to disable this feature [**here**](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html).\n\nLet me know if this caused a change.","replies":[{"poster":"PopeOnARope","date":"2016-12-13T03:28:22.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks man, the issue was 100% the gamebar. I hadn't found that mentioned anywhere and it worked just fine as soon as that was disabled. Thank you so much.","replies":[]}]}]}
