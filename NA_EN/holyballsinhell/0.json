If your files are still scanning, it hasn't had a chance to even reach our patching servers yet.  This scanning usually happens if a corruption was found or the patcher was closed while still in the process of updating you to a new patch.  Doing so will force your patcher to scan your game files before proceeding, and continuing to close that out will cause it to restart the whole process.  \n\nIf you continue to have issues, I recommend downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and run a clean ruinstall for a fresh update.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
