Y'know, like Lee Sin has pulled off every single season in the past? Ringing any bells? I sure friggin hope it is, those're some killer ostrich-in-the-dirt skills if not.\n\nThe dude needs a role, a weakness (besides the *seriously* bogus \"falls off lategame\" cop-out), and a rework. Very badly. Just because he's not * utterly dominating the jungle role* does **not** mean he doesn't have significant problems, it *just means they're not in the spotlight*. I would've thought that was common sense.\n\nThe \"bigger fish to fry\" argument in the Cinderhulk-meta makes sense. The \"we've taken him completely off the priority list we pretended to put him on because obviously his kit problems aren't problems any more\" argument does not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-04-06T23:16:43.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i take it the no response and downvotes means im right in that only Tier 1 and Tier 2 junglers are allowed in the jungle now and everyone else is ignored? So oldschool off junglers and such are not meant to go near it unless designed for it? If so you should update the tags on champions to reflect it and not allow others to take smite based on who they choose for a champion. This may seem angry which it is but since its all good now that a few champions more than before can jungle the game is in perfect harmony? I don't see the logic at all behind that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobold","date":"2015-04-05T23:37:56.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"By other jungler picks you mean who exactly?
