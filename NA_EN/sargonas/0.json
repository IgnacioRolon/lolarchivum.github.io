(If you just want a TL,DR then hit the bottom).\n\nHere’s how we look at things:\n\n1. Our top priority is to preserve the consistency of the in-game player experience.\n\nLeague’s a competitive game, and it’s critical that players have a level playing field. We’ve definitely heard your passion on this point and we agree.\n\nIt’s also important that the game experience you get when you download League of Legends is the complete experience - you shouldn’t have to go digging for other apps and addons just to stay competitive.\n\nFinally, it’s important that the games you play are stable and secure. If any third party can potentially affect the stability of the core League experience, we’ll always act in the best interest of all players. \n\n2. We strive to make League of Legends the most sportsmanlike competitive game.\n\nPrograms or applications that warp your first interactions with other players have a direct impact on the sportsmanship of the game, and everyone deserves a fair first handshake.\n\n3. We want the community to be empowered to contribute to the League of Legends experience (as long as it doesn’t clash with the above!).\n\nThere are a bunch of awesome resources out there for the League community: websites that have champion guides, stats, videos, fan art, wikis, mobile apps – you name it. We like that, and we think these resources are responsible for tons of growth and nurturing in the League community.\n\nRiot’s Policy on Third-Party Apps\n\nWith the above points in mind, we’ve recognized that our existing policy on third-party apps needs an adjustment. Currently we’re just too ambiguous in some areas (what constitutes an “unauthorized” app?), and too restrictive in others.\n\nSo here’s our clarification - we’re still working on properly wording it for a potential TOU update, but we wanted to share it with you as soon as we had a clear direction:\n\nNo software should interfere with the League of Legends player experience between when you press “Play” and the end of game screen.\n\nThis policy allows for all the cool stuff we mentioned before, like websites and apps that don’t interfere with or grab data from the player’s actual game client. This also allows us to explicitly disallow anything that directly integrates in between the in-game experience and after-game stats.\n\nWe think this is a hell of a lot closer to an ideal policy, but we don’t think it’s completely locked down. We are taking a hard stance that nothing should interfere between pre-game and post-game, but we’re always open to improving the player experience.\n\nThe Riot Games API\n\nPart of of this plan will be continuing to focus on developing the Riot Games API, which is our official channel for the developer community to gain access to League of Legends data in a secure and reliable way. This is just part of our ongoing effort to respond to players' and developers' requests for data and to arm the community with more ways to contribute in a stable and healthy way.\n\nTo date, we’ve given out several hundred API keys to developers who are working on awesome stuff. If you’re a dev and want to contribute, visit http://developer.riotgames.com/ to sign up and learn more.\n\nSo, what does this mean for Curse Voice?\n\nTwo elements of Curse Voice aren’t allowed under this new policy:\n\n1. Automated timers: while our design team is still exploring whether we’d want to add any kind of built-in timers to League of Legends, we agree with many of you that having it accessible only through a third-party app is a clear competitive advantage between those who download it and those who do not, and isn’t acceptable.\n\n2. Automated voice calls: We have no problem with players hopping on Curse Voice (or any other voice chat client) to coordinate with their friends in-game, but when the application begins directly connecting you with dozens of other people in unfiltered (and untrackable) voice chats, it can make for a huge negative player experience in a space where we can’t help. \n\n---\n\nA summary\n\nUltimately we recognize that our initial third party application policies were unclear, so we’re clarifying them in line with a few core philosophies:\n\n1.) The League of Legends in-game experience should be consistent and fair.\n2.) We strive to make League of Legends the most sportsmanlike competitive game.\n3.) We want the community to be empowered to contribute to the League of Legends experience.\n\nThis has allowed us to formulate a more comprehensive policy for third party applications:\n\nNo software should interfere with the League of Legends player experience between when you press “Play” and the end of game screen.\n\nWe always want to improve League of Legends in the best ways possible, so this will be an ongoing project, but we think that as long as we adhere to our core philosophies, we can uphold this policy. \n\n---\n\nI’ll be hanging out in this thread to answer questions and hear your feedback and ideas. Hope this clears things up!\n\n**10-14-2014 EDIT**\n**We just added an update to all of this, [posted below](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/EbE4QMZW-an-update-on-3rd-party-mods-and-curse-voice?show=flat&comment=000f) In the interest of making it clearer, here is a copy of what that update says...\n**\n*\"Hey everybody!\n\nI wanted to jump back into this discussion to share some updates.

From a player security perspective, we can't have third parties doing that as it opens you guys up to potentially having your accounts compromised by other parties.\n\n> for us mac users out there we are now at a disadvantage :/ there is no Curse Voice for macs as far as I know.

I've tried Curse voice, and honestly I wasn't very impressed with the timers. Then there's the concept of being put in a voice chat with a completely stranger without initiating that voice chat on my end; it's just weird. I tried it all out but wasn't impressed and didn't feel as if it added anything to the experience other than being a bit of a resource hog, and so have since uninstalled it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GG Beers","date":"2014-10-14T20:58:41.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the stance on client side skin mods?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChroniclerC","date":"2014-05-03T19:20:21.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not entirely related to 3rd party mods, but directly related to the \"fair first handshake\" idea; will anything be done about the sites that track all players' game stats?

I think if that happened alot of people who are crying about not having it would be pleased. Because tbh Curse voice is nothing special besides some timers and voice chat if you choose to use it.\n\nTL:DR League Client + Curse Voice (Both included in League Download) equals best solution if you are not willing to put the time into creating something similar.","replies":[{"poster":"Shentok","date":"2014-05-03T05:59:57.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda screws over people who want to play vanilla.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Foxy Himiko","date":"2014-10-14T21:22:55.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"\" Also...
