Her dashes are like of Sylas or Akali, which is how champions are being made now, everybody has to have a dash for some reason. Her passive's indicator is like of Shaco and Vi and MF and Akali, don't know what it does tho. Her W is literally Akali's R, but shorter and grabs some elements on the way (didn't know that walls, rivers and bushes were elements, its usually water, earth and maybe fire, air or something, like, she combined water and earth and uses mokuton, fucking Hashirama wannabe), her Q is nice, uses the ability of element, great thing and quite unique, but her E is again literally Akali's R, this time without making it shorter and her R is ok. I like the champion but ... WHY THE FUCK IS SHE AD. That is my only fucking problem with her. There are like 3-5 viable jng ap champions and 20 ad. And we get another ad jng champion that has dash? Ok, we have above 20 ad champions in jng because I counted it now and 10 ap (if you count Amumu, Zac, Diana, Ivern and Sylas as AP jng too). Like, we need AP choices in jungle, because of Yasuo and Zed players that don't care about being full ad. They are morons so we need AP and we get another fucking ad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2019-06-09T17:39:29.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

Qiyana feels entirely unique, and entirely welcome although the access to stuns on an assassin is a risky proposition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mack9112","date":"2019-06-09T17:34:21.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"HotarÂµ","date":"2019-06-09T17:28:56.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you could maybe(?) make the case that she's similar to Akali.\n\n They're both faster paced assassins with dashes, stealth, light CC, and a unique mechanic (true stealth / elemental leeching.) Even then that might be a bit of stretch :p","replies":[]}]}
