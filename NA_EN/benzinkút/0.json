There are more champions that counter him but I think that's enough for now. Though, I would stay away from a few of the higher-skill champions like {{champion:268}} that I mentioned unless you plan on playing them a lot.\nYour friend is wrong by the way. Yasuo ISN'T able to beat every champion in the laning phase. I know this because there are certain champions with extremely linear, un-outplayable kits like {{champion:86}} and {{champion:75}} for example.\nYour friend can beat you in 1v1s because he has runes and masteries and more overall experience playing the game.\nIf you have any more questions about yasuo or his matchups feel free to ask me, I have 500k mastery with him.","replies":[{"poster":"Benzinkút","date":"2016-03-09T19:19:51.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you \nthat is a very extensive answer :)\nI would immidiatelly take the offer and ask who has an ability to easily dodge thetornado?

This is very good because now Yasuo has no tornado and you can pull off your combo on him. Be warned that Yasuo can wind wall Talon's W and R to stop the damage so try to bait it out before you all-in. His wind wall is on a very high cooldown (26 seconds) so you have a good window to all-in once he uses it.\n{{champion:238}} W allows him to blink to his shadow to dodge Yasuo's tornado and his R makes him untargetable, along with giving him another shadow to blink to. You do a lot of damage with your combo as long as Yasuo doesn't wind wall it so Zed is pretty good against him.\n{{champion:7}}  has so much mobility. You can use your W to dodge his tornado and you can W again to teleport back to where you were and you can also use your R to clone that ability, giving even more potential to dodge. I would recommend mostly using her W to deal damage though. Be careful not to run into his Q while trying to dash at him with your W.\n{{champion:57}} W allows him to go untargetable while ALSO dashing onto a target. You're able to also stay very healthy in lane assuming you don't take too much damage from his Q and E harass, because your passive allows you to get a % of your maximum HP back every ~6 spells that are cast around you, including yours and his, and any other champions around you. Yasuo spams abilities a lot so make sure to abuse this by basic attacking every time your passive is up.\n{{champion:58}} E is a dash that lets you dash twice if you damage an enemy with it on your first dash. Be warned that this ability has near a 20 second cooldown at rank 1 so try not to just spam it whenever it's up as he needs it to dash onto Yasuo and deal damage to him.\n{{champion:8}} W lets him get a short movespeed boost and also makes him untargetable. Note that you should only use this in really close situations that you think that you will absolutely HAVE to use it as this ability has an EXTREMELY long cooldown (26 seconds at rank 1) and also costs 20% of his current health. You can start using this ability more freely when you have lots of CDR and have it leveled up a bit (do not max this ability first or you are going to have a bad time.)\n\n\nLosing where you are in teamfights is pretty normal for new players. I used to do this a lot but once you gain more experience with the game, you will definitely start being able to track of what is happening a lot easier because you will know every ability and all of the champions well enough.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Malicious Metal","date":"2016-03-09T17:53:10.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mordekaiser eats Samurais for
