Also the client seems to suck up memory or something on my computer when I'm in game, cus I'm having FPS issues with the new client always being open even in game.  Also the chat boxes are really laggy and cumbersome, idk.  I wouldn't be able to play the game anymore if this was released without addressing at least why its causing FPS problems in game.","replies":[{"poster":"BabyNaix","date":"2016-12-08T16:25:19.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue where the client is still running when I'm in game. When I'm in game I have the beta client open on the chat screen, and the game is running on what looks like the old client logo.

Not sure if it is my internet spazzing out, not sure if other bugs are affecting it (started lagging alot after several consecutive queue dodges from people). Potatoes mode didn't help me there.\n\nMaybe I'll try it again later, see if there are any differences.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GuitarWorld","date":"2017-12-13T23:11:10.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to bring this post back, min is still laggy on 2017. It lags when I press accept a match. Takes ages for the match to load. Bare in mind I do have a kind of low end pc. I just added an AMD A6 7470 to my pc and 8gb ram. It should be a bit faster, with low spec mode tho. But no, this doesn't change much. Every time I play Aram for example with friends the match ends and they still are waiting for me to load in order to invite me for the next one; which should be fast enough imo. The pc I have now let's say it's low end to mid end specs... I only miss a gpu to make it right. But that's not the point. It is still laggy. With 8gb of ram on the machine and everything is to slow... Please if Anyone from riot reads this they need to change it... {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼ro","date":"2017-06-29T00:36:28.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue.

My laptop is 3 years old so i know its not very powerful but it can run the game fine so im worried that i wouldnt be able to play anymore because of the client when the new one takes over :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mqgnus ","date":"2016-12-07T20:06:50.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For it's better only for the first game, after that there's too much memoery loaded thus overwhelming my pc.

It's still a bit laggy, but now you can actually do things inside champ select again, instead of taking a full minute to initiate your champ grid, waiting for the comp to process the choice and locking it. Now this process runs a lot smoother. \n\nHowever, I still have some glitchy lines running through the screen at champ select. as well as some other screens like settings > hot keys. Just some flashy lines which are on the screen for an instance and then disappear again. \n\nI play on a MacBook 2013, running macOS Sierra. I didn't use the low-spec option.","replies":[]}]}
