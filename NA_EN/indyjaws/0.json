(I get that the answer is no, so....&gt;&gt;)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems weird to me because his interactions with other champs are limited to 2 quotes with {{champion:11}} Master Yi -&gt; and Yi is the one doing the interaction.\r\nA bit disappointing, considering {{champion:157}} **Yasuo **laughs about Yi&#039;s wuju style,\r\n&gt; &quot;Wuju? Hmph. Never heard of it.&quot;\r\n\r\nbut Wukong shares his methods (and the quote: &quot;Wuju Style&quot;) \r\nAdding the same interaction from Yasuo to Wukong as well is easy, and it seemed just like riot forgot about the wuju-monkey.\r\npls riot?","replies":[{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2015-12-18T01:48:39.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, The monkey king needs respect","replies":[]},{"poster":"Variks the Loyal","date":"2016-02-10T05:03:55.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adding quotes is actually the hardest part of the updating process.\n\nThings like models, effects, mechanics, so on...
