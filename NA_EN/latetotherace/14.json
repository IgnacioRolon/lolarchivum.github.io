Just read the URF bonus stats. (other than the 80% CDR, yes, there's more.) \nIT's not because he's op or whatever, it's because he ruins the gamemode for the other team.

Doesn't change the fact that characters like Syndra, Morgana, Brand, Vel'Koz, Gangplank(1 second parrrley), and a lot of champs are busted as hell in URF, and would be picked non stop.","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2017-08-13T15:49:26.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3194}}  = syndra counter. just saying","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lùmen","date":"2017-08-13T11:07:50.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, I am aware of all the changes made to champions in URF ever since its debut.
