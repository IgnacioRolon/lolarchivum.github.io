(0 AP items) Or full tank Alistar and Braum. How about we imagine Gragas and Maokai before they built fighter and mainly existed to cc and soak up damage, not dealing it.\nAm I the only one who is absolutely disgusted by tanks dealing significant amounts of damage? I realize that enough people whined and complained about not &quot;being significant&quot; as if disrupting the entire enemy team and giving yours a huge opening isn&#039;t enough. These little bastards insisted that they get to do damage on top of all that! \nGuess what?! The entire balance of the game went to hell. Now that tanks started doing damage we needed to make everyone else do more damage to somehow balance out this new crapshoot. Now tanks can&#039;t even reliably tank due to new items that are quite honestly too strong. {{item:3036}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3071}} Not only that, but riot has had to severely limit the options for tanks and nerf the ones that are still viable. How.... why is this fair? Especially when the champions they&#039;re supposed to beat destroy them with unnecessarily strong Armor/Magic pen items, %Health damage and even excessive true damage! (That&#039;s right, I&#039;m looking at {{champion:11}}  The champion whose main damage output turns to true damage the second you build 120 armor) \nIt&#039;s about damn time that Riot revitalize the concept of Tanks without ending up with champions like {{champion:32}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:106}} Throwing everything out of proportion. \n\nI&#039;d like to think that there are several things that would need to change for this to happen. \n1. % Max health damage needs to vanish. \n2. True damage as a main damage output needs to stop.\n3. Unnecessary shred needs to disappear. I get this is to stop fighters, but there&#039;s certainly better ways to do the job.\n\nIn return we&#039;ll likely see.\n1. Assassins being unable to kill tanks, as it should be.   Tank&gt;Burst&gt;Sustain&gt;Tank.\n2. Tanks ({{champion:54}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:106}} ) will stop bursting carries, you know why? Cause it&#039;s not their job. Will they set stuff up? Absolutely, but there&#039;s only so much a tank should be able to do. \n3. Better distinguation between fighters and Tanks. Fighters will lose the benefit of building tank, and thrive when building damage. {{champion:105}}   {{champion:245}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:114}} ) and once these changes are in place, we&#039;ll never see another Assassin/&quot;high mobility duelist&quot; ever benefit from a full tank build.\n4. Much better and balanced games. Team fights won&#039;t last a glorious 3 seconds, but closer to 10-12. Why? Because everyone will be doing less damage overall. (This would really go well with the new assassin update coming here soon.\n\nUgh, writing this though. I seriously felt as if this should be common knowledge, but I suppose the glory of just tanking for days died when flashy little champions that out damaged and out tanked the competition became popular. \n\nBtw, don&#039;t mention the word &quot;juggernaut&quot; to me, that&#039;s an abomination that riot was forced to make in an effort to give people what they only thought they wanted. (Similarly to DQ) Just look at those champions now. Garen has a dwindling winrate, Mordekaiser is so niche you&#039;ll likely see more or rammus. Skarner has such a high skill floor that he&#039;s rarely played correctly. Then Finally we have Darius, oh boy are you fun to deal with..... There&#039;s also a couple of other champions that could qualify for the title of juggernaut. For instance Nasus, Illaoi, and Cho&#039;gath. Whome all have problems at their core. Cho&#039;gath has a serious itemization problem that often changes drastically from game to game as does his relevance. Illaoi is just a balancing mess that teaters from broken to weak. And Nasus either steamrolls or fades into oblivion all depending on his opponents team-comp.\n\nTl;DR Stop \"tanks\" from doing large amounts of damage, and let them CC and tank as intended. Distinguish between tanks and fighters, while giving each distinct strengths and weaknesses. Finally change assassins so they can't kill tanks with any efficiency. Also, don't mention Juggernauts, those are abominations which have turned out to be only balancing nightmares.

If top lane tanks don't have that damage, they will get pushed in by Bruisers who will do the Tanks job better. Same thing with Jungle tanks, if you don't have the clear speed, the likes of Lee sin, or Elise will out level you. The only tanks that don't actually need any damage is supports.\n\nAnd the reason this wasn't a problem in seasons 1-3, is because Philosophers stone and heart of gold were a thing. You could worry a little less about farm because your GP10 items had you covered. But now that Gold gen is pretty much Support only, you need to be competitive in the laning phase. If you have no laning phase, you have nothing. \n\nAnd that's why Tanks need a basic damage level, and if Carries are dying to that, it's probably because they don't have a basic defense. (maybe cause their range and kiting are their defense.)","replies":[{"poster":"LatetotheRace","date":"2016-07-03T22:15:19.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. {{item:3068}}  or {{item:3075}}  + Basic attacks are more than sufficient in pretty much every case. \n2.

Base damages (in most cases) are fine, it's when they have tank steroids built into their kits in conjunction to having scalings similar to that of a mage.
