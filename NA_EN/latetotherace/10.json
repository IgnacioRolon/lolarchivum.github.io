I noticed they had been particularly toxic that game, yet I decided to see what this child had to say. I expected the worst, and oh did he surprise me. It was even WORSE than I had expected. Not only did he attempt to pin the loss on me (which I don&#039;t really care about,) he proceeded to insult my rank, and the means by which I obtained it. (Full solo baby) Then for the icing on the cake, he told me to and I quote &quot;off yourself.&quot; Whereas this leaves myself unaffected as I have no interest in &quot;offing&quot; myself I realize that many people nowadays struggle with depression, and this would _NOT_ help them in the slightest. Is there anyway we can add a reporting feature, and possibly even a &quot;quick-block&quot; function to where you can block someone without having to type their name into the menu for friends chat? \n\nPlease, for the sake of protecting your players from these bastardized trolls roaming the fields of justice do something.\nAnd you better do it quick.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2016-07-14T06:47:33.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much anywhere you can see a player's name (friends list, post game lobby), you can right click it and press block to add them to your block list.\n\nAs far as reporting goes, best bet is to take a screenshot and email player support about it.","replies":[]}]}
