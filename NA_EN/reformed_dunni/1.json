It's only the laner who should ward, never the jungler. \n\nFourth: If you dive i won't follow u up if it's a stupid decision, if you die, still your fault. I guess you are one of those guys diving an Irelia. \n\nFifth: I love these pushing junglers, only pushing half a wave so the enemy gets free two waves, is two lvls above and just wrecks my lane. \nIf you push, do it right or only lasthit and freeze the wave. \n\nSixth: Oh yeah i love it when jungler does dragon with enemy mid alive, bot alive and jungler alive, i am (if i'm mid) pushed to my tower and spam the pings out of me to HELP FFS WHAT ARE U DOING, yeah i just walk to drake i guess they won't suspect anything...\n\nAnd your last phrase shows u should just uninstall the game, i have no idea where this godcomplex came from you jungler and supports have. \nI guess it's overcompensating for years of being irrelevant.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-03-06T18:46:14.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":11,"body":"you're stupid, because you don't understand why you need to do what we need you to do. in jungle we get to make the calls, because we don't have the time to spare on anything that isn't perfect, not these days.\n\njunglers calls are seldom bad. lets say your low enough to lose a one on one, but it would be semi close. if i gank, then i expect you to die for that kill, becuase kill+assist is more valuable than a kill, and our team is better off for it than if you were to just back, as well as it reducing the enemy income by killing the enemy as well, which leaves you in a more even spot than if you had just backed.\n\nits not often that junglers can counter gank, and it can happen, but hoenstly, as a jungler, if i didn't see them on my run in and im coming form a normal route and you as the laner have warded effectively than this should not be an issue unless the enemy junlger was already in the right place to pounce. the chances are very slim, and its a risk worth taking, becuase it has a monstrous effect on winning your lane, as well as setting me up to be able to continue ganking without needing to stop afterwards and focus farm to catch up.\n\n\ntowerdives are decent, but only if we get something guaranteed. if the enemy is low, sure, if they are full health what the fuck do you expect me to do about that. junglers are the weakest members of any team, due to a massive gold and experience deficiency. as well as the fact that yes, It is your fault that your shit isn't warded. its not very hard for jungler to just walk around the normal paths for counter jungle to a position behind you, so you need to make sure that you are warded in the right spot. also, if you get ganked once, don't let them do it again so easily, prepare escapes and watch the enemy junglers pattern, they often do the same things over and over if it works.\n\nif i decide that we are diving, and you don't follow up, it is 100% your fault if i die before they do. of I am diving, then you can literally walk up and fight them without tower aggro. if you don't then you're a selfish and stupid bastard. also, irelia is an easy fuckign dive, she has one hard cc that she will probably use on me, so you had better get your dumb ass over to murder her or i swear to god. people that come in late are the reason why dives seem so bad all the time.\n\nfifth, honestly, as a jungler, if you acted like this post to me in game. I would literally try to sabotage you in any way i could,. also, if the enemy laner comes back and i don't think i can take them, i will just pack and leave before you get there, but that is about the only reason why i wouldn't push your lane all the way to the enemy tower. stop being an entitled prick and lording over your minions, we need gold much much more desperately than you do.\n\nhonestly, that is just a stupid jungler, but a normal jungler needs you to be there, if we have killed the enemy jungler and maybe their bot lane and we are kind of low, we need the mid laner to get out of their lane to come down and help take the dragon.\n\nalso, other buffs, if we get invaded, you help us. no questions. no, \"I was fighting my laner\", no \"but I need to farm\" none of that. you want a jungler that game you help him out.\n\n\nand this whole stupid shit that laners like you have about supports and jungler being irrelevant is fucking stupid as all hell. when you carry you forget about us. but when you lose it's always somehow our faults. if we are so irrelevant how come you can't win without us.","replies":[{"poster":"BetaDude40","date":"2016-03-06T19:36:23.732+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MmMcm5kb,comment-id=000600020000,timestamp=2016-03-06T18:46:14.864+0000)\n> junglers calls are seldom bad.\n\n[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlwaysByMySide","date":"2016-03-07T03:01:18.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=MmMcm5kb,comment-id=000600020000,timestamp=2016-03-06T18:46:14.864+0000)\n>\n> junglers calls are seldom bad. l\n\nYou're bronze I.
