I enjoy coloring in my free time sometimes just as a relaxing activity that enables some creativity and focus (I would recommend it for anyone on tilt, as well). With the recent posts for the \"Unofficial Skin Templates\" I thought it could be a fun, profitable project for Riot to create a 20-page coloring book of all of our favorite LoL champions, Summoners Rift, icons, etc. It obviously wouldn't have anything to do with official lore or storylines. It would just be something fun for fans and players to maybe create their own chromas/skins. They could even share them online and see what others have done.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2016-02-07T19:51:37.630+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the delay in replying - I should do searches for my name more often :/\n\nI'd love this idea, though.  There was a piece of concept art that I saw was in progress internally that I think would be pretty good for this sort of thing, but I've no idea how to go about kicking off something like organizing a book.  Maybe it's something that could be begun over a [Thunderdome](http://thunderdome.riotgames.com/) if there were enough artists involved?  I'll ask about that specific image tomorrow when I'm in the office, and put out gentle feelers as to whether we've already considered this in the past.  (We may have done - but I'm not privy to all the information.)\n\nWith no promises implied (please don't murderize me if this isn't something that eventually materializes!) would you mean a physical, dead-tree-edition, book - such as one might curl up with, or do you think players would prefer something digital they could print out themselves?\n\nRandom aside - it'd be awesome to have a box of LoL-named coloring pencils.  Garen Blue and Rek'Sai Purple, anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"TBakes","date":"2016-02-07T23:17:48.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, I'm glad you found it! \n\nI was referring to the coloring books that are trending all over the place for adults right now. For example, look up [Johanna Basford](http://www.johannabasford.com/). My girlfriend and I have quite a few of these and like to color them meditatively in our spare time. I could imagine some of the login screens or champions splash arts or shop posters as blank pages for people to color. It would be really cool as an actual physical book (the paper quality is a bit different than standard printer paper), but printed pages could work too. \n\nI'm trying to figure out a way to attach a copy of a dragon page I just recently finished, but I cannot figure it out :/\n\nAnnnnnnd I like what you are thinking with the colored pencils!

I particularly like the fractal and mandala patterns, but some of the more nature-inspired pictures can be fun too. \n\nI really like the Brodsky and Utkin piece you linked. Something about the shapes of the buildings and all of the little multi-shaped windows is appealing. \n\nAnd here is the dragon I was talking about (it is a fold-out page in the book):\n\nhttp://imgur.com/6OGHAvU","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2016-02-07T20:18:21.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only if the {{champion:117}} one tastes purple.

I was thinking more along the lines of, say, a Pokemon coloring book. Where it is just another way for their company to make money while players get a new way to interact with the champions and characters. It would be less about art and more about merch.\n\nBut print-off pages could work. I just think these coloring books typically have higher quality paper than simple printer paper, so you can use pencils, markers, or even paint or pastels to color with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
