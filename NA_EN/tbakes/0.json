It turns out over 5,000 customers in my area lost their electricity for about 8 hours. I have not gotten a chance to go back and see if we won or lost (and even if we didn't I think I still get a loss for disconnecting), but I'm assuming we did and I feel really bad that I ruined the experience for others as well as earning myself a promo loss. \r\n\r\nMy question is: Do we ever get loss forgiven for disconnections out of our control? I could send a news article and/or direct you to the power company's website for proof that there was a large blackout which prevented me from finishing the game. I'm sure it is a long shot, but just curious if there is a precedent for this type of thing. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-15T15:42:16.234+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"DTN's information is solid.  Loss Forgiven activates for the region when it impacts a high amount of players at once.  It's not something that can be turned on retroactively or individually.

I figured that was the case, but I just wanted to be sure. It wouldn't have been a big deal if I hadn't been in my promotion series with one won already. Also, it would be unfortunate to have some sort of extended queue time for something completely out of my control. \n\nI read the Loss Prevented guide, and I think I understand. It is basically only activated when something happens on Riot's end that is not players' fault and they know it will negatively impact the games they are currently playing, right? It is never used for instances such as blackouts, power outages, internet outages, etc. that are not directly associated with Riot and/or League of Legends? \n\nAgain, I have no problem with this, I'm just making sure it is clear moving forward {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-07-15T06:43:59.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Riot only turns on loss prevention when there is a widespread issue on their end.

Beyond my control but now i have to wait 20 minutes before i can even attempt to get in a game for 5 games in a row 1 hour of just waiting when it takes 10-15 minutes to just get a game started... Totally fair and just... Oh and Riot will not reduce punishments under any circumstances or so I'm told if any Riot employees see this and know otherwise feel free to comment.\n[http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/twgWAMcK-internet-down-for-my-town-during-ranked](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/twgWAMcK-internet-down-for-my-town-during-ranked)","replies":[]}]}
