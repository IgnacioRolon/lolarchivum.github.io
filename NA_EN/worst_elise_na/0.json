I am dying to get lvl 7 on elise but if i play her as a jg should play im punished. Its common for jg players to get hardly any cs in exchange for game carrying plays all throughout the game. RITO, WHY MUST YOUR RATING SYSTEM PUNISH US FOR PLAYING OUR LANE PROPERLY. PLEASE FIX THIS GARBAGE SYSTEM. GETTING 200 CS BY 20mins SHOULD NOT BE THE STANDARD FOR S RATINGS.\r\n\r\nSincerly,\r\n\r\nA tilted player of your great game.","replies":[{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2017-03-11T01:52:59.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your farm.","replies":[{"poster":"WORST ELISE NA","date":"2017-03-11T01:55:00.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know why i didnt get it, but a system that encourages junglers to abandon their most important role, especially champions like lee sin, elise and shaco who all do really good ganks early game makes no sense.

There's no reason you should only have 74 cs in a 28 minute game.

I won the game with really good efficiency, i didn't have a single minute of down time. Clearly the amount of cs i get is subjective to my ability to win a game. I only farm if im falling behind and need to stay with it. \n\nSo, if i did my absolute best to win a game and succeeded, my question still stands, why do i need to have high CS to be considered good? Of course i know the importance of Cs in other lanes but it makes no sense to focus it in the JG.","replies":[{"poster":"Micbran","date":"2017-03-11T19:11:50.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because high CS means more gold and more gold means a larger lead. If you're fed it should be easier to farm since you'll have faster clear and when you gank you should be taxing, provided you don't take the kill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-11T01:54:29.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are not competing against a \"standard\", you are competing against how well other people playing the same champion and roles do.\nCS does not matter, what matters is _gold_.
