I think Ghostcrawler answered a question about increasing the number of bans on an Ask Riot post a few months ago. I believe he said something ridiculous about not wanting to increase the number of bans at this moment because it would hurt role diversity. Which is again, absolutely ridiculous seeing as how there are over 130 champions in the game. But don't worry man, I'm pretty sure he also mentioned that while they have no intention of increasing the number of bans at this moment, they are \"exploring the idea\".
