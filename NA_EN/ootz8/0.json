Since the patch it takes almost 3 minutes to get to that screen. Wondering if this is patch related or not? I use a mac and hear there are bugs for mac on this patch.

The game is running on a SSD so it usually got to 100% on loading screen very quickly. After the patch, when champ select is completed, I get a white screen followed by a loading screen freeze (the little wheel in the corner doesn't move) and only after a few seconds does it start loading normally. I can only assume it's related to the patch since I changed nothing on my computer. The only thing that changed was the patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mkrist","date":"2017-05-06T15:04:32.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am actually experiencing this as well. I think it might be related to the other Mac problems that have been in patch 7.9 although my capped 60 FPS seem to have been fixed. I actually think this issue with freezy/slow loading screen came after the 60 FPS cap seemed to disappear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-06T04:16:01.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hmmmm if it's taking awhile to load the champion loading screen, it could be due to one of two things. Either your pc is just taking a while to get the game to load from hardware issues, or your client is having a hard time getting connected to the game servers. Let's first make sure that your network is able to get a solid connection with our servers by going through [**these steps**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
