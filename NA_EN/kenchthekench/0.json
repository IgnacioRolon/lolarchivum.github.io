Hopefully find some stuff to help him out a bit in the meantime without reintroducing any of the problems that lead to him getting heavily nerfed in the first place.\n\nHello, Mr. **Meddler**, sir (*& team*)!  =D\n\nI have some ideas regarding a *short term* fix/**rebalancing + QoL** for {{champion:6}}, that may put him in a better spot, in terms of more intuitive gameplay.\n\nIt's mainly a *minor kit swap* between his **W-Terror Capacitor** & **E-Noxian Corrosive Charge**.\nI was wondering if the **Movement Slow** from his *W-Terror Capacitor* could be switched with the **Armor Reduction** from his *E-Noxian Corrosive Charge*..?\n\n-----\n\nSo, the abilities would now be:\n\n* [W] - Terror Capacitor:  Urgot charges up his capacitor to gain a shield.  While the shield is active, Urgot gains **armor reducing attacks**.\n\nWhile the shield is active, Urgot's attacks & missiles **reduce (*possibly \"steals\", instead?*) the target's armor by 12/14/16/18/20%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).\n\n* [E] - Noxian Corrosive Charge:  Urgot launches a corrosive charge that damages enemies in an area and **slows targets**.\n\nEnemies afflicted by the charge have their **Movement Speed reduced (*possibly \"stolen\" as well?*) by 20/25/30/35/40%** (*same as current/live values, unless you guys intend to change it?*).  Urgot's basic attacks & missiles also **slow** the target **while they're afflicted**.\n\n-----\n\nMy reasoning for this switch is basically the same reasoning as with Rework {{champion:72}}'s Movement Slow shift to his E-Fracture, and Rework {{champion:79}}' Movement Slow shift to his Q-Barrel Roll (which I also posted about, a *long* time ago:  [Gragas - Switch Enemy Speed Debuffs](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2572371)  .)\n\n* Thematic cohesiveness/intuitive logic\n\n* Using a spell that activates a shield (*W-Terror Capacitor*), **just** to be able to use its Movement Slow function, just isn't intuitive in terms of gameplay.  And swapping these functions in his kit would certainly make his gameplay become more intuitive & improve his learning curve.\n\n* Also, using a spell that looks very chromatically similar to {{champion:29}}'s W-Venom Cask (*E-Noxian Corrosive Charge*), but *doesn't* **slow**, is just plain *confusing* (*especially for players who like to play both champions - {{champion:6}} {{champion:29}} - and are trained to think that the abilities are consistent with each other*).\n-----\n\nAdditional Fixes:\n\n* Allow Urgot to move while casting Q & E. \n(**QoL Fix**, *for more intuitive gameplay; helps with learning curve/improving gameplay skills.  I don't remember if he can, or can't, as I haven't yet..'retested' him this week & it's been forever since I've played him, but it doesn't look like he can from his videos*.)\n\n* [R] - Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser:  Both Urgot & the suppressed target are untargetable until the reversal channel is completed.\n**Reasoning**:\nThis helps solidify the..\"fantasy\" (*original intention/design/vision?*)..of the ult, so that it doesn't simply turn into a glorified Root/Stun, allowing both teams to kill the champions being reversed, while the reversal is still in progress.\nInstead, it forces both teams to wait for the reversal's channel to end, & decide whether to engage a teamfight, peel for/protect their displaced teammate, somehow manage both, or disengage & leave their teammate to die.  (*\"Counterplay\"?*)\n\n-----\n\n(*Trying to think of what else to say, to further flesh-out my ideas, but that's all I've got.  I think I've said it all?*)\n\nAnyways, I hope you guys consider implementing these fixes for Urgot!  =D\nHe's a fun champ that I want to unlock & play more often (*especially with his Battlecast skin!*  =D ), but the current state of his kit has kept me from playing him to the best of my abilities, and my proposed changes would certainly allow me (*& possibly others*) to play him better.\n\n(*I also have some ideas for his larger rework, but I'll save them for when the official thread for that appears*.)\n\nThank you for your time & for reading this!  =D\n\n[Will be posting this here & in the other thread you've posted in, since I don't know which one is the official Urgot Rework discussion thread - the original thread was in the old forum & it's been archived.]","replies":[]},{"poster":"FirstSergeantBim","date":"2015-03-03T19:49:59.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please consider increasing his Q, E and auto attack cast speed while also allowing Q and E to be used without interrupting movement.

As a legit Urgot main.  I caught wind of a possible rework.  I am terrified what will happen to my champ of choice.  Coincidentally, my two mains are Urgot (primarily top, but I play him mid and adc as well) and Galio, between the two I would say that Galio needs the most work because after QandE are used, he's pretty much run out of options.  I have laned against 95% of champs and to be honest Urgot can go toe to toe with the majority of them, people just assume he is complete and utter garbage, but he pokes down the most feared champs, especially champs such as the vaunted Darius (fervor boot upgrade was absolutely devine).  The three major faults with Urgot are his wave clear,he has absolutely no pushing power...even at full build, lack of sustain and no scaling MR.  Urgot should be given an identity and I feel he thrives most as a top lane champ.  \n\nA suggestion I would make would be once noxian corrosive charge is landed  maybe the acid hunter can actually live up to its name and  spread to all affected targets.  This would help with lane clear and potentially help in team fights.  Maybe acid hunters dont have to stop at their first target either.\n\nI never post on the blog, but to be honest I am afraid my champ of choice will be changed into something unrecognizable.  If you change anything I could sacrifice the ult (not entirely), but his standard kit is golden if utilized correctly.\n\nI appreciate your team considering upgrading Urgot but please be gentle :).  \n\nThank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AikidoLawnNinja","date":"2015-02-16T21:07:26.856+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't think Urgot is a bad champion at all, just misunderstood and out of place in the meta.\n\nIn short, he's not an ADC, he's a solo laner. When built as a tanky ranged bruiser, Urgot is actually a rather intimidating lane bully. His EQQQ combo can chunk a squishy down to nothing mighty quick. With tank items, you can actually use your R to engage and get out alive, which is something ADC Urgot can rarely pull off. \n\nThe problem is that Urgot is dead-last in the popularity contest, and player bias pretty much prevents anyone from getting real practice with him. If you try to join Team Builder as Urgot, you'll be waiting for an eternity, only to be kicked from the party when the team flames the captain for accepting an Urgot. If you're the Team Builder captain, everyone will leave the lobby the second they see an Urgot on the team. If you're in blind or draft, someone will dodge out when you pick Urgot. \n\nAnd if you're lucky enough to actually get into a game with Urgot, you'll probably be stuck playing ADC in the bot lane, a role for which Urgot is subpar at best (since he's out-ranged by just about every ADC and his ultimate is useless if you build damage over tank, which you HAVE to do if you're the team's designated ADC). Trying to get practice playing Urgot in top or mid lane is usually a fruitless endeavor.\n\nIt's really a community bias that puts the nail in the coffin, and I believe the brunt of that bias stems from the word \"Marksman\" that comes attached to him. If Riot were to \"re-launch\" Urgot with minimal changes, but actively promote him as a solo laner instead of an ADC, I think it would help his popularity a whole lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Heal and Forget","date":"2015-02-20T06:57:55.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Except Urgot was designed to be played in the bottom lane.

LCS doesn't play champs in their designed roles, they play them in their most OP/useful roles that they were not neccessarily designed for. You cannot tell me with a straight face that Nid was designed to mainly be a jungler, or Lulu was supposed to be a toplaner for example.\n\nLook at the official champion spotlight! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bQtJZW1x08 He's being played Top/Mid. He was supposed to be an AD scaling Mage/Bruiser type thing. This is why his kit has  a shield, this is why his ult puts him in the enemy team, this is why he has a huge armor/mr steroid and etc. \n\nThe pros noticed he had amazing harass and used him as an ANTI-ADC to stop the enemy from farming. He was never ever ever a competent ADC on his own, but he could deny other ADCs from getting gold/items at all making it easy to end the game early since the enemy had one useless ADC taking up a character slot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imotekh Kharn","date":"2015-02-20T07:16:29.711+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his q should be able to apply on hit effects since its so vital to the kit.

I had seen that the team at riot was working with the gate like ability and have a similar idea that is less broken and would be able to code by coding in the opposite fashion of yasuos windwall.Here is my idea for the urgot rework:\n\nQ: Increase the range of his q but not the scaling and allow for a passive that when his ultimate is active his auto attacks have increased range equivalent to his acid hunter.  The reason being for the ultimate and E change\n\nW: Shield applies a stronger slow but at the cost of a reduced shield scaling and has built in damage reduction scaling up to 20% as a passive (can be altered it just seems like he would need it since his ult no longer would contain it but wouldnt want his shield to get destroyed immediately opening up the option for kiting and for counterplay since it would only take a small amount of damage to stop his shield.) \n\nE: have his autos and acid hunters apply a DoT effect and armor shred but not have a tracking ability when activated and call it something that implies the person is marked. this correlates with his new ultimate. (allows for bully potential as well as a possibility for correlation with the ult to make him a single target anti-carry focus)\n\nR: His new ultimate can either be for him or himself and allies but is stated as such \"Urgot opens a Dimensional Transfixer for 3 seconds that allows for skillshots (his or his allies depending on the gameplay riot chooses would be balanced) and his auto-attacks to auto target a designated character effected by his e as long as the character is in range of the skillshot. (this allows for correlation with the e so that he can be an anti-carry and allow focus to a single character for burst.)\n\nThis rework would allow for counterplay in the fact that the q w and e would remain very similar to his gameplay and only the ultimate paired with the skillshot of e would allow for a single target burst to fulfill his roll as an anti-carry. it strengthens his other abilities to allow for a kiting off tank bruiser who has a small to medium margin in which to kite his enemies depending if hes auto attacking or casting. This also allows more playstyles and build paths since his acid hunter as well as his auto attacks are affected by his kite. The decision would be to go with either attack speed like an adc or a typical urgot build towards a caster anti-carry you normally see. This would improve gameplay and strengths of his core kit while maintaining the style urgot currently embodies and puts him on a very limited window to burst his target down. This requires the player to be skilled enough to pull off his burst effectively or be punished for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"No Good Deed","date":"2015-02-23T03:05:02.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey now, if were talking about Urgot, then would you guys mind if I just throw my idea into the hat?\n\nQ: Change up the base and scaling to fit the changes, but now applys on hit effects except crits.

Applying its dot with some changed numbers, BUT now acid hunter passes through all targets affected dealing the same/reduced damage. I think this would add some better play/counter play without having to worry about getting chunked at huge ranges.\n\nR: Fires a low cooldown passthrough line nuke kinda like a very small very narrow lux ult but (maybe) with a mini stun attached.
