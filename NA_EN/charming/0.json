Or are Rioters going to keep commenting on people's post basically saying it is not on their end but the player's end. Ever since the new patch people are having issues, more-so today than other days. On patch day I started having constant disconnecting from client, and chat while also lagging out as if I had packet loss and disconnecting from in game. I was pretty convinced it was my internet, but I guess it was not as my ISP technician said everything was fine and I even replaced my router... uninstalled and reinstalled LoL, I also checked firewall settings.. DNS settings.. Port Forwarding.. Used the Hextech Repair tool..Checked for driver updates.. Followed your \"Connection Issue Guide\". People are getting bug splats, or getting popups while trying to enter loading screen saying Network Error... which just results in remakes and people getting penalized for something we have no control over.People have lost LP, lost promotion games and have been reported because of this, including myself. Apparently people can't even log into the client at all, or being unable to connect to the client or constantly getting the pop up in client about disconnecting from the client and trying to reconnect stating that \"if your connection is otherwise fine please go here and follow these steps\" being prompted to exit the client... on top of the other issues I, or other players are experiencing that have been mentioned. This is not just a single region/server issue either. I also know that your servers were having issues with Charter based off of reading posts in the \"Help &amp; Support\" section of the forums that also stated there, however my ISP is Comcast and people disconnecting from my champ select also use Comcast or other ISP's _**PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS**_ \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Broporo,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=5ZYcAjcc,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2017-10-02T03:46:57.947+0000)\n>\n> I've been seeing quite a few players talking about possible server issues today, but it's strange that the servers themselves haven't been messing up. However, I have actually been noticing more and more player's mentioning the ISP they're running, and I was able to figure out that Charter Spectrum has had quite a few outage issues today. Let me know if you're on Charter as well, and if so you may need to contact them to report this as well.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T21:04:43.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've definitely been looking into the few issues that have popped up in H&S about getting disconnected.
