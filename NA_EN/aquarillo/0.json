For some reason, **my draft pick does not function anymore**. Whenever I want to play it, it's just display \"please wait\" and don't even get to the queueing interface. This is the first time I have this problem. I have tried to force a repatch and it did not work. If you have experienced this and solved this bizarre problem, please give me detailed instructions on how to fix this! \r\n \r\nI truly appreciate your time and help! Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"NightTab","date":"2016-06-10T22:22:44.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still not working","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wholy","date":"2016-06-10T22:15:54.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"still having these issues along with many others","replies":[]},{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2016-06-10T21:49:26.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that there was indeed a brief issue with Champ Select where games weren't starting properly.
