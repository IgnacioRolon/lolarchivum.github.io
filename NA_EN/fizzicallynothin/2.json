You're either the one that duos, or you have some other duo on your team. Same goes for enemy team as well. So your next ranked match, may as well ask \"So who's duo??\". Though some might want to hide it, some will actually admit to being duo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erronius","date":"2015-01-21T19:19:37.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo que can be beneficial or detrimental to your overall success, honestly. \n\nOn one hand you have (hopefully) better communication, and more experience with one person on your team's play-style.\n\nMost duo que partners are friends, and they expect you to treat them as such.. So when you try to give them feedback when they're playing poorly, they take offense -because they (or rather, their ego) feel as though you are talking to them in a superior form rather than an equal one (teacher vs friend). \n\nAlmost all of my duo que experience has been negative. My friend(s) always expects me to tolerate their tom-foolery, and rarely takes my feedback positively. \n\nI've played very little ranked in years because of it. \n\nPlaying by yourself is also much less enjoyable imo.","replies":[]}]}
