My big problem now is in normals I feel way more confident and have a 70% win rate. In ranked however i always have little confidence in my skill. Also in ranked i think i have something like a 33% win rate. I can not understand why there is such a gap. In-between normals and ranked and that just ticks me off. I am not scared of ranked and my goal is gold or at least silver this season. \r\nHow can I gain more confidence in ranked? Anyone out there know how to help me?","replies":[]}
