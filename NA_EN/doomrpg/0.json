To clarify I'm not having issues with the client itself I haven't had any issue logging in or with matchmaking. However when attempting to enter the game itself after picking phase my computer completely crashes. Sometimes instantly and other times only League crashes leaving background processes (such as YT or discord) to work fine for 5-10 seconds. It has been happening less as each patch roles it's still completely random. I've already tried to fix it with Hextech repair service to no avail\r\nNot an issue with specs. My old literally trash computer never had this issue.\r\nNot an issue with anti-virus/firewall exceptions for League.\r\nHelp please?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-01T05:09:12.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it doesn't sound like these crashes would be related to firewalls or antivirus(but it *would* be smart to troubleshoot that by [**turning off your firewalls or adding exceptions for League**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq3), best to cover all your options!), but more than likely related to background processes like youtube and discord.
