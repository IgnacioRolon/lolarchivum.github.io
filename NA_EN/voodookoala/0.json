I then checked my account email, and it happened to be my old email. When I tried to reset my email, it sent an email to the old account. However that account has been shut down and I no longer have access to it. How would I go about changing this now, if even possible? Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-24T23:49:02.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can assist you in changing your email if you reach out to our account specialists by submitting a ticket with [this form.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) Simply fill out the request with as much info as you can remember about the account and specify that you'd like to change the email associated with your account.\n\nWe've been pretty slammed with tickets, so it may take a bit longer than normal to get a response.
