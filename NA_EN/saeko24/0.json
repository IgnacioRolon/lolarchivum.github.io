The dark/purple one. I really dont care(sorry) about everything else and i dont care about that little &quot;minigame&quot; where you have to change your models. :/\r\nI&#039;d like to get the skin but can you pls just let us toggle it like with DJ Sona?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T17:09:00.528+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya Saeko24! \n\nFor Elementalist Lux, you will not be able to toggle between forms like you are with DJ Sona. This isn't a feature we're looking to add to this particular skin. In order to get to Dark form, you'd need to combine elements - Fire and Water OR Air and Nature.","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-18T17:12:29.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KateyKhaos!\n\nLove your work and this skin! I just might start picking up Lux again for this skin! ^^\n\nJust a quick question, does it get a sale on release or is it the base 3250 RP?","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T17:39:56.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! \n\nI mained her several seasons ago, and I'm right there with you, about to pick her up again. What's your favorite form, out of curiosity? \n\nAs for release information, nothing's been announced at the moment, so I don't have details to share. Generally speaking, this kind of information isn't provided until the skin itself has launched and is available on live. :c","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2016-11-18T18:10:32.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's hard to choose. First off, her Light form is absolutely stunning.\n\nOut of the first 4, Fire all the way. :D\n\nI love the look she has in her login theme btw, whoever did it really went all out!\n\nOut of the next bunch, Magma totally.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-11-18T18:38:41.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suke was the artist for the login screen - they always pull off some amazing work! ^-^ \n\nI can totally agree that Magma is awesome. Nature has my heart for the first form, and I think Ice is my pick for the second. :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
