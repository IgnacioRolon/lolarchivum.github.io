This only happens when you get out from playing a game,  If for example, you go straight into the crafting it is find and works properly.  Just wanted to let you know about that if did not know about it already.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nShackmanpro","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-04T00:12:00.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey shackmanpro -\n\nThanks for the report!
