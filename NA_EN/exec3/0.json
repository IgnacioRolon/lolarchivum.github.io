Is there anywhere that non PBE players can talk about these changes to ask questions and voice concerns? Like one of my main issues right now is that a lot of people like to focus on Q damage however I have a different style and use Q and W to apply E (so I focus on E) but it seems like you're now forcing everyone into my playstyle which i'm not the biggest fan of (I like being unique! :( ). I'm also not a fan of you guys locking out CDR builds, free CDR is a very silly thing to give a champion because when all is said and done if you want a champion to have lower cooldowns, *just lower their cooldowns*, you guys thankfully realized this and removed it on Heimer (though Zyra still has it atm) so it's very disappointing to see it being tacked onto Cass.\n\nIt's also not clear what exactly has been changed to make E more reliable (is it what I've suggested in the past?) and imo Q's cast delay should be removed, you're trying to emphasize the speed boost it gives but having her stand still to get that boost makes no sense and just makes the act of chasing really clunky imo.\n\nOverall i'm not flipping tables but I am a bit concerned and wary given I feel she's currently the best designed champion in the game and my #1 favorite champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ceteral","date":"2014-08-28T01:25:21.311+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am so sad about this.

Riot said that they want ziggs to be the main siege champ, but cass was a siege champ before ziggs was even released! Shouldn't she have priority over this gameplay space?\n\nIt frustrates me, first riot guts my old karma(who could wave clear like no other) and now they are gutting cass. It's like riot has a vendetta against any champ that can wave clear really well, except for ziggs.\n\nI've always felt like cass's twin fang felt rather tacked on on her kit. It almost seemed like it didn't belong, but just barely fit with everything else. But now they want it to be her only source of dmg.\n\nBut riot's not gonna listen to us. No, they've already invested too much time and effort into these changes. There is no going back now, now that it's already hitting the pbe. At best, we'll get a few number tweaks.

For a dot mage to focus all of yer dmg onto a machinegun spell is a red flag to me. This is cass, not ryze here. She has always been about siege warfar and melting ppl in teamfights. She had her reset mechanic on E as a form of offensive defense for when ppl get too close she can burn them down fast if her team can peel for her, or she gets a good ult off.\n\nBut now, her only option is to sit back and wait till someone gets locked down and pray to God she can burst them with her weaker kit, because .05 increase in her ap ratio is insignificant. Especially compared to the huge hit her q took\n\nAlso, I think riot has a distorted view as to what a real carry is. A carry is not a champ that can 1v5 the enemy team with tons of dmg. A carry is not a champ that simply deletes targets in team fights.\n\nA carry is a champ that directs and controls a fight from start to finish. They out put significant dmg, don't get me wrong, but a real carry is a champ that can litterally put their team on their back and CARRY. The reason we have adc's is because they can do that. But the main reason an adc can carry isn't what they do in teamfights, it's what they do AFTER the team fight. -taking objectives- And old cass could do that, she could take jungle objectives just fine, but struggled to take towers cuz she was a mage, not an adc. But in exchange for not being able to take towers, she had great wave clear. She was able to siege towers down and stall out a game so that her team could get built, then win team fights with her huge aoe dmg and zone control.\n\nShe can't do any of this anymore. Her burn dmg from her spells is far to weak to reliably take jungle objectives like dragon and baron. She still has no means of taking towers. And now she can't even clear minion waves. How are you supposed to carry if you can't do anything that is required for carrying? If simply winning a team fight made you a carry, why isn't velkoz or viktor or annie or veigar considered carries? Because they are just dmg and cc. Their role is to win the team fight and let their carries play safe so that you can take an objective afterward.\n\nCarrying is about objectives, not teamfights.

That goes for any champion changes. This is how science approaches it; would you trust a source that claimed to have improved a drug if they only tested one subject? No of course not. They don't have the amount of information required. \n\nI'm not saying you are wrong. I'm just saying that the proper amount of samples would give you a better informed opinion. Just because something initially seems bad doesn't mean it is. When Syndra was first released, I hardly saw anyone play her, but currently she is counted as a really strong AP burst champion. Sona is a recent example: I will be the first to admit I didn't like her changes, but after playing many games with her, I found her kit felt better than I expected. \n\nSpeaking on Cass specifically: she now relies on a \"stack\" system to grow in strength. Most champions which rely on stacks to build them up tend to be really powerful later on in the game. Nasus comes to mind right away: be becomes a huge tank with the ability to rip through towers in a few auto attacks. Veigar is another good example. But instead of Cass just getting AP, she ALSO gets essentially spell vamp on her E, 30% CDR without items, and at full stacks she essentially has a Deathcap (30% AP added). Call me crazy, but that sounds like some pretty good late game potential. Of course, if she is too weak early and can't ever get to this potential, then that would be a major problem, I'll admit. But the basis for a really high DPS is there I think.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShadowKnight1224","date":"2014-08-27T23:19:55.170+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cassiopea's playstyle was always to land W or Q (preferably Q, for maximum damage) and then spam E until the person died, refreshing Q and/or W as necessary.

Wasted CDR is the worst on supports, because even if you don't buy lucidity boots, you are still burning CDR by late game.\n\nI don't think Cass is 100% completely irrelevant, but I do believe that she's not currently 100% relevant either. She's an immobile, close-to-mid-range squishy mage whose main source of CC is on a very long cooldown, which makes her easy prey for highly mobile opponents (particularly assassins). The current top-tier mages are either long-range (Xerath, Ziggs, Orianna), have a spammable form of hard cc (Syndra, Ahri, Xerath) or have a degree of mobility (Ahri, Ziggs). And they all have extremely fast wave-clear. I believe Cass may be up to par in terms of wave-clear, but perhaps she needs some AP before she can take out a whole wave with W and Q.\n\nThe wasted CDR is probably the only truly bad part of her kit. I feel something like 10% CDR would be fine. We don't need to overburn it when CDR is so ridiculously easy to get from items.\n\nThe damage reduction is actually a necessary part of the identity they want for Cassiopea. They don't want her to be a burst mage, but a late-game hypercarry, which means that having good base damages is counterproductive. Hypercarries are defined by their awful early game and their amazing scaling. This means that, much like Vayne, Tristana or Kog'maw, it's perfectly okay for Cassiopea to lose lane so long as her team can stall long enough for her to farm up her items and get a kill or two. If the enemy team can't push Cassiopea's disadvantage when she's at her weakest (early game) and finish before late-game rolls in, Cassiopea will easily wipe out teams like your average Vayne.\n\nSo basically, playing Cass will be a game of patience. You will suffer early game. You are likely to lose your tower. This is okay. Just bide your time, focus on CSing and get your big-ticket items. When late game comes in, let someone else initiate and then just drop a W on them and take them all out.","replies":[{"poster":"exec3","date":"2014-08-28T01:15:48.291+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"The CDR is really the only thing i'm truly against but a lot of these changes just make her look like she's going to become extremely binary and just an E bot.
