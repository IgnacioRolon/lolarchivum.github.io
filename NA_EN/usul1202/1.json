This got me wondering about fast food in Runeterra. Could Galio really be serving fried chicken in Demacia? Is Shurima into pizza enough to warrent Sivir's violent delivery methods? Do noxian happy meals have spikes on their boxes, and do those have a mortality rate if so?

They may be more into magically cooked food, solar cooking, chemically cooked food (acids like lemon juice or vinegar), fermentation, drying, and the like.

With Ionia, it's tricky to work out the line between what is actually magic and what is nature, so I personally don't know if the spirit of Ionia is offering up the creatures as a reward for living in harmony, if it's a natural phenomenon when populations of the creatures get too high (due to favorable conditions) or if there's some other mechanism at work.\nThere are likely other groups of Ionians who hunt for food (we know there are Ionians who hunt for protection - see the Varus comics) but do so in a way that reinforces the natural order, rather than upsetting it.\nLastly, not everyone in Ionia is successfully living in harmony with the land.  I'm sure there are some who kill and eat what they please, and to hell with the consequences, maybe due to a lack of education, lack of options, or as intentional snub to the old ways.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-07-26T18:03:18.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is some grade A animal wingmanning right there. \"hey mate, I see you've got a date tonight.

I would see bilgewater as being one of the more homogenized states, whereas I think an area like Demacia would be much more regional in their food. Ionia would have some decent variance due to their varied environment maybe, but with its size I'm not sure that will be the limit. Education definitely would be though.

Mortal food was usually bland and tasteless compared to the smorgasbord of flavors she was used to, but the fish in this part of the world – Ionia, she’d heard it was called – wasn’t half bad.

It would still be pretty far back since the dynasty fell in 1644, 400 years ago. Also, I think noodle got smaller as the year went on, not bigger; after all, the ability to make them thinner only came later with the development of techniques and later the machines (Northern Chinese food still prides itself of making their own noodle by hand, tho, and their noodle is a lot thicker than the ones made from a factory).\n\nThe \"fast food\" of Ancient China wouldn't be like today's take-away menu. Depending on the region within China but it would probably be something like getting steamed buns and take it with you, communal township eating place of sort where you sit and eat very casually, or small food stands that typically provide very casual food like giving you a bowl of watery rice or soy milk and you finish it there and return the bowl and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2019-07-26T17:53:23.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do, autocorrect strikes again.
