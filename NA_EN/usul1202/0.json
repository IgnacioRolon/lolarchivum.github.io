In my imagination, she is based on the ghost tale of the kuchisake-onna. White mask with a mouth that is slit wide open, her legs are each one half of a scissor. Chains with kunai at the ends for her hookshot. Her passive would be either a blood orb swirling around her (AD shield) or blue ghosts (AP shield).\n\n{{champion:113}} Chemtech Sejuani\nI would _absolutely love_ a chemtech motorbike. Basically Sejuani as a Zaunite, chemtech driven motorbike instead of bristle. Her weapon is a flask with green goo on a chain. Passive lets the tubes on her bike glow green if it is active and the Zaun crest on top of her. Q is a wheelie, E covers the enemy in green goo instead of ice. Same with R, instead of an icestorm in the area there are green fumes.\n\n{{champion:51}} {{champion:254}}  Star Guardian Caitlyn &amp; Vi\nI want them to be together in a team of Star Guardians. They would be so great. Caitlyn is the intelligent, responsible class represent. Vi is the always brawling tomboy.
