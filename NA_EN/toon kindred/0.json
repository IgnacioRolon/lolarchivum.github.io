Rather I choose to become an artist who makes fine art to have maybe just maybe my own gallery, or study something that I would love to do too, is design games for a small game.\nWhat happens if can&#039;t handle other technics like 3D models or make a program for a game?\nIf my art is not good enough to live with?\nI want to accomplish my dream to become an artist, but the question is so hard, that I can only imagine if I fail I will not know what to do..\nSome help me with your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2018-09-10T17:48:51.942+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is not a binary decision.

Hope to see you in future Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fasmodey","date":"2018-09-10T18:21:34.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh please...

Perhaps you can talk to whatever form of art teacher you have at your school? Either way I very much suggest that you try to study up on the industry, the expectations, what you'll need to do and what the possibilities are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KestrelGirl","date":"2018-09-09T01:20:33.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can do both!
