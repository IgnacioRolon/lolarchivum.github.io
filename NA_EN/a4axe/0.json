Currently, there's no method of earning additional tokens.  We have a [Refund FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ) that can shed some more light on how refunds work.  Please let me know if you have any questions, and I'd be happy to clarify.

Once you use those 3, you will be unable to refund anything else. Triple check that you are purchasing content that you want before you do so, because it's going to be permanent.\n\nIf you need advice on purchases, feel free to post on the forums to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"A4AxE","date":"2016-07-17T23:02:00.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it .
