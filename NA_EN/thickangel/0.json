Keep in mind that although others have had Blood Moon skins before Diana, that doesn't mean she *couldn't* receive one in the future. We don't limit five champions (team comp) to a single thematic, which means there absolutely could be more Blood Moon skins (or other thematics) in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-05-29T18:12:50.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Great news.
