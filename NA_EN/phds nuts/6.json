I've never disenchanted a champ shard since the new system came out, and the odds of getting the shards for any of these mastery token champs looks super low with how biased the system feels against getting a 4800/6300.  I feel like some weight should be added towards the side of champs with mastery tokens.","replies":[{"poster":"Hopeslayer","date":"2017-12-30T23:43:20.069+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i DE champs i hate playing and dont want to grind mastery on, otherwise i save them too\n\nbut some champs i have got 2 or more shards on i started playing so i could use them. \n\ni wouldnt doubt they put in a system to reduce your chance of shards for champs the higher your mastery with them.\n\nkinda like how that post some one made calling out their skin % drop from rerolls not being equal and they \"fixed\" it within an hour of some one calling it out, meaning they knew the whole time and were just screwing people over until it got attention.","replies":[{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-12-31T08:32:09.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hopeslayer,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E2byBYW1,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-30T23:43:20.069+0000)\n>\n\n> i wouldnt doubt they put in a system to reduce your chance of shards for champs the higher your mastery with them.\n> \n\nThat seems almost too tinfoil hatty to me, but the orange essence changes and skin shard rerolls left me jaded.

You don't need more than that to get to mastery 7.  And it wouldn't be a guaranteed drop.  It would just be a slight quality of life change.  I haven't gotten a single shard for a 4800+ champ that I have mastery tokens for, and I'm level 53 now.","replies":[{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2018-01-03T04:30:14.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reverse issue is also a thing though, where people would be incentivized to *not* get mastery tokens for cheap champions.\n\nTheres also a sizable fraction of the player base who would much prefer shard drops for champions they *don't* own for the juicy BE discount, so any sort of biasing towards mastery tokens (which implies the champ is owned) would be counter productive to that.\n\nIt's most likely fairest if it's uniformly random. There will be some people who are 'unlucky' and will be grumbly about it, but since what 'unlucky' even means isn't the same for every player it's quite difficult to justify any sort of biasing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-31T20:09:52.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't gotten a shard for a 6300 yet.","replies":[{"poster":"P R I S M Corp","date":"2018-01-01T01:13:46.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got 2 sivir shards in a single chest, it literally said ''2 Sivir''\n\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhDs Nuts","date":"2017-12-31T21:22:36.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Bandle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=E2byBYW1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-31T20:09:52.370+0000)\n>\n> I haven&#x27;t gotten a shard for a 6300 yet.\n\nYeah they're rare.

This was pre-change, so my BE was pretty low, and I had to burn IP on shards to disenchant just to activate the mastery tokens. That was frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]}
