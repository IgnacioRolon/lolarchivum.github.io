That&#039;s also what this comparison does.  Is this just a &quot;Third parties aren&#039;t representative...&quot; type thing?  Because when I saw &quot;A&quot; for this Lucian game, it didn&#039;t make much sense, especially with how much weight is seemingly put on CS.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-02T04:59:40.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"third party thing.\n\nthe actual is based on a mix of kda, cs, game duration, and other misc herbs and spices that I can't fathom, as well as having a role to character relation.\n\nEdit.

I had the same wards/minute in the 'S' Trundle game as well.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-02T05:12:13.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"duration has to deal with the whole package. if it's a 40 minute game and you're kda is 1:0:1, that will hurt your score. high cs scores balance it out of course, so don't let it stop you from farming if that's what it takes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sheldonbunny","date":"2016-06-02T05:07:35.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2204625887?tab=stats\n\nYou had less than 50% team kill participation. Your cs was good, you definitely could have warded more. Biggest issue is likely the participation. And as always, the disclaimer: You are compared to other Lucians in the marksmen role, not other champions.","replies":[]}]}
