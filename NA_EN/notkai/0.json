Here is the specific chunk of rules that mention this: \r\n\r\n> No spamming or trolling. Some common examples of these behaviors are listed below.\r\n> \r\n> Posting content not related to the discussion.\r\n> Posting a discussion or comment repeatedly, or across multiple sub-boards.\r\n> Posting designed to bait conversation or falsify content.\r\n> Posting designed to spoil things (movies, shows, books, etc.) for other players\r\n> Posting repetitive non-constructive or low-effort content.\r\n> Bumping of discussions while adding no meaningful content.\r\n> Excessive emoji / icon spam.\r\n> Necromancy of old discussions.\r\n\r\nMore and more, I have seen posts taken down because they are low-effort. And frankly, I just don't get it. \r\n\r\nFor reference, I cannot find anything in the UBR that clarifies what \"low-effort\" means exactly, and I've yet to see a mod clarify it either. Some people are interpreting low-effort as being a single sentence post, while others are positing that a low-effort post is just a complaint without any suggestions on how to remedy the problem causing the complaint. And I disagree with all those interpretations. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is such think as a low-effort post. \r\n\r\nI believe that there is room for discussion and discourse in everything- even a single sentence complaint. For example, if I were to head into the Gameplay board and post, \"I think Garen is broken because his Q deals 30 base damage, and he's the reason I'm stuck in bronze\", that would be considered low-effort by most standards. It is a single sentence posing a complaint with no constructive criticism about Garen, just dissatisfaction. But that is still opening room for discourse. From that single sentence, I could open up a conversation about what it means for a champ to be broken, about how to get out of bronze, or about how a single ability does not make a champion \"broken\". I could agree with the statement, I could disagree with it, or I could qualify it and engage both elements. My point is: just because something is a complaint or a single sentence without \"thought\" does not mean it is low-effort, nor does it disqualify itself from being a gateway to discussion and community engagement. \r\n\r\nBecause there is no clear definition (that I have seen) about what it means for a post to be low effort (and I encourage moderators to share their interpretations of this rule, so I can better my understanding of it), there is a lot of room for subjective moderation of \"low effort\" discussions. This is causing quite a bit of animosity from posters who feel that they are being insulted or silenced, or not meeting an invisible \"effort\" standard. I've watched this rift grow deeper for the past few weeks, and I firmly believe that lack of clarity in some of the Universal Rules and when they are to be enforced is causing this. \r\n\r\nPersonally, as I mentioned, I don't think there's such thing as a low-effort post. Moreover, I don't think low-effort posts cause harm. The great thing about boards posts is that nobody is forced to read any of them. I can scroll for hours if I want and not read a single post if I think it isn't up to my personal 'effort' criteria. So that does away with the explanation that low-effort posts clog up boards- there's no clogging of a river if nobody is forced to swim in it. I just don't see the point in moderating low effort-posts. \r\n\r\nAnd as a quick note, this is not at all meant to diss mods. I understand that y'all are doing your jobs to the best of your abilities and are not maliciously silencing players who dare insult Garen, or whatever posters are now claiming. But I do want to engage both mods and non-mods in a larger discussion about the purpose and clarity of some of these UBRs. \r\n\r\nAaaaaaand as an even quicker note, this post IS NOT encouraging people to make low-effort posts in an attempt to challenge the rule. Please do not go out actively breaking rules because you think they are dumb, here or otherwise. I am seeking to open a discussion about rules, not start an insurgency over them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-12-01T04:52:37.478+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's language we're working to change.

The most obvious part of moderation is removing offensive or inappropriate material, but another part that often gets overlooked by the community is curation. Think of the Boards as a newspaper. People go to specific sections looking for specific things. The thing we hear most often about Gameplay is that people don't want to use it because it's riddled with complaints. It's good that you don't personally have a problem with Gameplay, but we don't feel it's in a good place right now. We know from our experience with G+ that people will post great content, but not if it gets drowned in a sea of \"OMG Senna OP, RITO NERF NAO!!!\".\n\nWe're going to be posting the new Gameplay guidelines in the next couple days. With luck, that should provide some clarity. We also have some other plans, but as an all-volunteer group headed into the holiday season, these things take time. Ultimately, we want to change the culture so that Gameplay is about _discussion_ and GD is about _conversation_. Trust me, if we could move these threads, we would.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-12-01T04:55:55.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Discussion is about conversation, got it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ulanopo","date":"2019-12-01T05:17:14.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MagicFlyingLlama,realm=NA,application-id=6heBIhQc,discussion-id=w2TdLt9M,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-12-01T04:55:55.065+0000)\n>\n> Discussion is about conversation, got it.\n\nI know the verbiage is a little cumbersome, but I didn't name the sub-Boards.

I agree that in practice, low effort posts usually don't generate the conversation I would hope that they are capable of. I know there are people who do take simple ideas from complaints and run away with them, generating great discussion (I mean, just look at Exil's YouTube channel), and I wish there were more of them. Buuuut I totally hear what you're saying. \n\nI wonder, then, if it would be more effective to have a place where people can put their complaints, just to vent. I know the RANT board serves an adjacent purpose, but as far as I know, the UBRs still apply to RANT- including the low-effort rule. I think if people had a place to bitch as loud as they wanted with as little effort as they wanted, there would be less post removal, and therefore a little less animosity between mods and posters (which is my main concern with this). Every step counts for something, y'know? \n\nAs I mentioned in my original post, I think part of the issue is that there isn't a clear standard for what low effort means (a Herald mentioned this is going to be addressed soon, yay!). Because of that, I believe, I see a looooot of posts accusing moderators of getting a power trip off of removing posts they deem low effort. If changing the low effort rule itself wouldn't do anything, perhaps changing the way in which it's moderated would. But that's all just hypothetical, of course. \n\nStill, thank you for your input. This sort of discussion is exactly the thing I was aiming for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Inkling Commando","date":"2019-12-01T05:41:14.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I could make a smartass response but i'm not going to.","replies":[{"poster":"notkai","date":"2019-12-01T19:19:15.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooookay?","replies":[]}]}]}
