( I was the one who lost the RP no one else)\r\nI have been supporting this game since the early Beta's and have easily spent more than 200 euro's in skins and other items on my account.\r\nI do not think something like this should be allowed as you are taking my account away that I have had over a few years and I have played on with so much dedication and fun.  \r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that the customer support of riot games and league of legends offers more than a permanent account ban at a cry of help.\r\nAlso I hope this for the community of this game that is supposed to spend their money to support your game and as in any other game can be hacked even if it is not their fault. I have not ever been punished in any other game for being hacked and losing my actual own money and I hope this can not be seen as support!\r\n\r\nPlease Riot support your long supporting players in a descent and loving way the same as we support you!\r\n\r\nKind Regards, \r\n\r\nYngvar (also known as Gatuuc)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-21T18:27:59.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and I see that the account received a security lock.  It's not permanently banned, but made inaccessible so unauthorized parties can't get into the account.  Per the ticket you received, the specialist asked for an [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to be filled out, which will help get the account back into your hands.
