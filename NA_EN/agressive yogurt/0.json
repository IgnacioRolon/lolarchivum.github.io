I looked around and i haven't seen anyone have this problem. please if anyone knows how to fix this problem, contact me.

I've never heard of this issue before. Is it possible that you can take a quick recording of it and post it somewhere so I can take a look? There are many potential causes, but a video would give me more context. Also, can you let me know if you use smartcast with your keybindings or not? Thanks!","replies":[]}]}
