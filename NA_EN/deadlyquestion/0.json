So I am 100% confident in my allegation that no real person is working those support tickets. Use my experience as a warning.. you're not being listened to.\n\nAs Jubbinaut said in his reply down there, though, the system supposedly detected something wrong. I understand typing \"I agree\" was just a warning, which is why I typed it instead of refusing to. But I in no way left that match even for a minute, I didn't troll or do anything that was not towards the aim of winning the match. The only time I was sitting around idle was when my champion was dead and i was waiting for them to respawn. Like always, it seems Riot is releasing product before applying enough to tests to render it functional (every new champion is an example of that).\n\n\n==================\n\nI'm either being trolled by the support staff for having a bad attitude (it was a test to see if they'd acknowledge the attitude), or sending in a ticket is only mass answered by a server of bots and pre-written messages and pre-written reply messages.\n\nLeaverBuster made me type \"I agree\" for leaving/being disconnected from a match. However, the last time I disconnected from a match was in September, probably August, when League was having DDoS and other server problems. I doubt they're issuing punishments from that long ago. So I sent in a support ticket, not to get anything changed, but to get information on and let the support staff know that \"Hey, Leaver Buster is flagging me for no reason. Look at my account and tell me if I'm wrong, or acknowledge LeaverBuster made a mistake and you'll aim to fix the system.\"\n\nAfter this experience I'm concerned as to why Riot even has a support system.","replies":[{"poster":"WookieeCookie","date":"2014-12-17T22:25:35.804+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DeadlyQuestion,\n\nI appreciate that you bubbled this up so that I could take a look.  As the Leaverbuster Revamp is still a bit new we've been cautious about the level of information that is shared to prevent players from abusing the system.  I think this approach may be a bit too conservative and I will talk to the specialists to see what additional information they can share to help address the issue.\n\nAfter looking at your situation, I believe I think I've found the point of confusion.\n\nThe system audited you on December 12th, 2014 in a Normal Summoner's Rift game where you played as Quinn.\n\nYou can see the stats of the game on our website here:\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/1665691057/49890579\n\n\nI was able to verify that you did actively stop participating after the 12 minute mark, and that the leaver penalty applied to your account was justified.\n\nHowever, I agree that we should work on the messaging and information provided to you and other affected players in the future.  I will work with the team to see what we can do on that front.","replies":[{"poster":"Slaaneshine","date":"2014-12-17T22:30:30.031+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really see that on these boards that people don't think Riot listens to them at all, and yet for the past two years they have fixed literally everything I can think of that needed fixing that the community has asked for. \n\nI appreciate everything what you guys working at Riot do.

We don't use any bots or automation to answer our support tickets.  We do have some rather big challenges given the size of the player base and the type of questions that players ask us.   For those reasons we have some specialists that have more generalized training in a number of issues.  Their answers will usually not be as deep or complex.  And to be honest with you, for the majority of the tickets that come in this is more than sufficient.\n\nThe trick for us, as an organization, is training which helps Generalists identify when an issue requires a more in depth answer and how to escalate that issue to the right people.  When I look at the interaction that DeadlyQuestion had, what I take away is that we need better guidance on these escalations.  That way, in an alternate world, DeadlyQuestion gets the answers he needs in a more timely manner.\n\nFor me, this brings it back to my original point, which is we're still trying to figure out the limits to the information we're looking to share about Leaverbuster to prevent any abuse of the system.  I think we may be able to give Generalists more information that they can share with players to stop this from happening in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Jingerbeardman","date":"2014-12-18T01:03:51.732+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"you dont use bots, but you do use scripted responses.

In the message I state that I know why I received the restriction and that I deserve it but then go on to say that there needs to be more clarity when the restriction gets applied. You can read the ticket yourself to see what I said in detail. What irritates me is that the second response to my ticket was the exact same as the first response. It just said that they wouldn't lift the restriction...\n\nI never once asked for it to be removed... Both support specialists apparently skimmed my ticket, saw chat restriction and assumed i wanted it removed. If that is what all of your support specialists do then they all missed something during training. It is pretty important to read a ticket in its entirety in order to give a proper response. It is disappointing to find out that your player support personnel do not.\n\nI have sent in many tickets but this is the first one that I must say I am not satisfied with.","replies":[{"poster":"Nezqi","date":"2014-12-18T10:08:59.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Paul is a hard working riot ticket responder.

The \"I agree\" message is not representative of any form of sanction placed on your account. It's a one-time notice issued the *first* time the updated Leaverbuster system takes note of you.\n2. Judging from the posts about it, the game it detected was the one *immediately* prior to your receiving the pop-up.\n3. No information has been given about changes to the detection algorithms, leading me to believe that they haven't been significantly adjusted from those used for the old Leaverbuster, which implies:\n4.

You simply wouldn't have known about it.\n\nAll of that said, while I absolutely believe that you were *connected* throughout that game, I'm also forced to admit that the very fact of its detection implies something off. The detection algorithms used for LB are pretty clever, and very capable of recognizing idling, afk farming, and other, less obvious forms of being afk.\n\nThe *way* that they do this hasn't been fully established, but I've heard (and seen evidence) that experience gain is part of the equation, and I suspect that enemy interaction may be involved as well.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it *too* much, at least not yet, but I would try to remain aware of how I play, and how active I was being.\n\nOf course, your mileage may vary, and none of this may be particularly meaningful at all.
