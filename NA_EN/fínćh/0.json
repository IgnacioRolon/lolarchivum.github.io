This only shows me that you aren't the average player. You are slightly more toxic than the average punished player, which means you'll need more than 3 months to get back into good standing.\n\nRemember that all of your games are rated on the toxic scale and that if your game has the slightest hint of toxicity, it sets you back.\n\nSo during those 4 months, can you say with absolute certainty that you had 0 toxic behavior in every single game you played? This includes never insulting a person, never spamming pings or text, never talking down to anyone, never being passive aggressive, never flaming, never being sarcastic, etc...","replies":[{"poster":"fínćh","date":"2018-02-25T19:39:59.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that being \"Sarcastic\", \"passive aggressive\", and \"Spamming pings\" is even considered toxic, is the fault that Riot has, they need to realize that they arent running a day care.","replies":[{"poster":"YerroFever","date":"2018-02-25T19:54:43.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fínćh,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Tv1B0q2R,comment-id=0001000000000001,timestamp=2018-02-25T19:39:59.944+0000)\n>\n> The fact that being &quot;Sarcastic&quot;, &quot;passive aggressive&quot;, and &quot;Spamming pings&quot; is even considered toxic, is the fault that Riot has, they need to realize that they arent running a day care.\n\nSarcasm and passive aggressive are considered slightly toxic, thus why I still listed it. The purpose of sarcasm and passive aggressiveness is solely to be damaging to someone. It's like poking someone in the arm. It's not super harmful to do it once or twice, but constantly doing it leaves a bruise. Thus why it's slightly toxic. No one wants to be around someone who is sarcastic and passive aggressive to everyone 24/7, ya know? \n\nAs for pings, I don't know when you started playing league, but there was a time where we couldn't mute pings and we couldn't lower their volume because they were in the same volume control as game sounds so we would either have to listen to ear piercing sharp pings non stop or mute our whole game and not hear any sounds except our champs talking, the announcer, and background music. This basically meant we were at quite a disadvantage if we wanted to stop some guy from spamming ear piercing noise at someone. What's worse is that everyone on the team heard it, not just the target. This is when the spam ping became a popular harassment method and so Riot gave us tools (ie the ping mute button and also limiting the number of pings someone can do within a time frame) to save our ear drums. Just because there are tools to keep our ears from bleeding, doesn't mean people should try to make them bleed.","replies":[{"poster":"fínćh","date":"2018-02-25T22:05:19.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing this game for 4 miserable years","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2018-02-25T19:39:59.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget amount of games.

False reports are thrown out. \n\nI would say it works pretty well considering how many \"false bans\" people claim to have been given have been deserving.

The morganna can be a troll and toxic and the game but doesn't get anything. The morgana was being a dush and he gets in trouble for it.

Despite what many think there isn't a simple no no list of words to avoid aside from hate speech/encouraging self harm.\n\nAfk runs on a different system than IFS.\n\nHarder to detect because people always wants to scream that someone is intentionally feeding or trolling when in truth they are having an off game or out matched. Granted this isn't always the case, it does make verifying claims more difficult. If you report for this, please include description in the box about what happened.\n\nHate speech is simply worse verbal abuse.
