Him making a point to say that he was new, is odd to me, but maybe thats just me. I have posted on many different games boards. Never once have I announced myself as being new. It sounds like an attempt to appear vulnerable and important to Rito.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anastaecia","date":"2017-04-13T14:36:24.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are having a hard time in normals, I would suggest bots until you get better at the basics.  The number one thing new players should learn is how not to die.  This will end up being more important than anything else.  And it is VERY easy, just need a little discipline.  Don't fight just to fight, don't chase, don't dive, don't wander through the jungle if you have no vision (btw, WARD WARD WARD), etc.  If a play seems risky, don't do it (until you learn what is safe, which just takes playing a lot of games).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starcraft243ver","date":"2017-04-13T13:42:55.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next ban is **permanent** (it means FOREVER) and will occur after a SINGLE deviation from the rules, so i strongly advise you to just unbind your chatbar, glue your \"enter\" key.\n\nBe aware that : being negative in ANY MEAN, asking for others to report a player, etc will get you ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-04-13T12:47:55.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't like what they are saying then mute them, report them, and move on with your life.
