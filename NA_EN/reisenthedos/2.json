It did appear after playing a match.\n\nIt seems that this is a common issue going on with the Dawnbringer RIven icon not being given after completing the first mission.\n\nhttps://68.media.tumblr.com/dd17b49ac7d690c94a69e2a8642e02a0/tumblr_ormbcilB3C1qjhi0ao1_540.png\n\nPlus why does everyone not have that lifesaver tube as the very first icon on the top right corner (besides those never obtaining it)? Is mine just glitch in place there? It's been bugging me ever since I notice how it never lets newer icons take it's place.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T02:54:39.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes Riven gets a little of a slow start.

As for my other question is Why does that lifegaurd innertube the very first icon on my list? It literally bugs me as it isn't on the exact spot when I earned it and any new icon I gain is always the one next to it, with some exceptions like the Soy Lolero being next to the Project Ashe icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-16T04:57:12.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeeiiiiiiird!

This is the case for everyone who has them. Not sure why. Might be a bug.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
