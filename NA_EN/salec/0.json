I'm excited about most of it, but Academy Rush has me a bit confused. Not the concept of it, I've watched NFL RedZone (in fact that's the analogy I used when describing it to my friends).\r\n\r\nMy issue is that League of Legends is not like Football. And here's what I mean: An NFL game is about a 3 hour affair with long drives and some potentially big plays that you want to see. I'm going to use some League terminology here to help convey what I'm trying to say.\r\n\r\nIt's a lot of Laning Phase. So you can simultaneously show three or four games (e.g. Sunday afternoon slate) and bounce between them with relative confidence that the ebb and flow of the game itself will produce entertaining content.\r\n\r\nThe issue with League is that it is 1/6 the length of that football game and as a result it doesn't ebb very much once the teams start moving around the map. Sure a key gank or team fight might break out early and spice stuff up, but most of the time those first ten minutes are setting up the real show.\r\n\r\nLeague flows FAR more than it ebbs and as a result, the situation will arise where the casting crew is trying to cover 4 teamfights simultaneously and that simply won't be quality entertainment.\r\n\r\nIf I were running the production here, I would either bump the start time up 30 minutes or push the 5th game back 30 minutes and stagger the starts. Game 1 at 5:00, Game 2 at 5:10, Game 3 at 5:20, Game 4 at 5:30, and Game 5 at 6:30. This way you're more likely to have the few ebbs that do happen late in a game of League not happen at the same time in multiple games you're trying to cover.\r\n\r\nThat will use the game's natural flow to it's own advantage and produce a more entertaining viewing experience.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, hope this helps the production team. I'm looking forward to the new season for LCS and Academy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot SwampWTFox","date":"2020-01-10T02:03:47.457+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Salec,\n\nI'm the lead broadcast producer for Academy Rush-- I'm glad you're interested in the show, and thank you for your comments. You've highlighted one of the challenges that this format will face when applying the concept to League of Legends Esports, and believe me when I say we've been thinking about these same challenges (and more) for the past few months. We've tossed around the idea of staggering start times, both in real-time and artificially through a broadcast delay, and the jury is still out on which method will be most effective.\n\nAcademy Rush will be an iterative process, and we'll be listening closely to community feedback about how the pacing of Academy Rush feels. The goal will be to highlight the most pivotal and exciting moments in each matchup-- but we don't want to lose sight of each game's larger story in the process. Ultimately, I think this will come down to how the games pan out on the day. One game could start with a level 1 invade and continue with constant kills, while another has first blood at 15 minutes. Some games will end at 25 minutes, others will end at 45 minutes. Staggering start times is good for some, and bad for others. For as much thought as we've put towards having an excellent debut on the 24th, we recognize that this is breaking new ground for watching competitive league of legends, and we will be looking to make tweaks as the split goes on to make the show better.\n\nThe pacing of Academy Rush is going to be more art than science, and we're going to do our best to bring you the best balance possible. I hope you'll be watching throughout the split, and please please please let us know how you think we're doing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Academy Kayn","date":"2020-01-10T20:53:19.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw Academy in this post's title and got really excited for nothing :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeminiRune","date":"2020-01-09T00:18:03.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't think Football is the best comparison to use. From what I got off of Academy Rush (which I'm still digesting the article as a whole as I comment) is more of a Twitch Rivals kind of approach. Given the varying interest of Academy in previous splits, it's a good change of pace on the objective to make Academy feel more significant to the overall LCS infrastructure. Also account that more Academy games will be played live on a suitable channel for such. A single Friday where it's being played in a free fire viewership dynamic; I can imagine that teams will still be able to stream their games; hence...Twitch Rivals style.\n\nI dunno...still digesting all of this.","replies":[]}]}
