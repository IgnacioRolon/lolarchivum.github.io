I was unable to locate any support tickets for you, and we prefer not to discuss sensitive account information on the boards.  If you have a ticket open, your first step towards account recovery would be verification of ownership.  I recommend checking out our [account recovery](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) guide in preparation of getting your account back.
