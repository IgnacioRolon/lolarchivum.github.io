I would like to find a jungle who can have an immediate impact in either ganking or counter jungling.  It would also be nice to have this jungler be able to take a lead and build in a way where I can carry the game if needed, but also build to support my team if somebody else is doing well.\r\n\r\nAn example of what I mean is me playing J4 top.  He has a very strong early laying phase and if I get ahead on him and build damage I can seriously hard carry.  BUT if I don't get ahead I can also be tanky and very useful still.\r\n\r\nI have had some success on Vi as of late but am unaware of how hard she can carry if need be.  Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2015-03-11T11:28:12.658+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf!

All 4 have pretty strong engages for team fights and they fit into just about any team comp.  \n\nVi is a great one as you already said and while she might not \"carry\" some games, she can certainly set up the game to be won fairly easily. Her ability to lock down and kill a single target is really good for taking out priority targets, especially considering her ult is point and click (so if someone gets fed on their team you can basically turn the tables on them)\n\n\nI'd definitely give those 4 in specific a try and see how they work out for you P:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frank327","date":"2015-03-10T16:04:38.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure {{champion:5}}  fits the bill.

I will always work on getting deep wards in the enemy jungle since it helps everybody to see their jungler rotations even early on.\n\nIf you win lane you then need to go win everybody elses lane OR put a ridiculous amount of pressure on your side of the map so they have to 2v1 or 3v1 you.  \n\nFor example:  I am playing Malphite top and I can't kill my lane opponent for whatever reason.  So when my ult is up I try and get bot to ward the lane bush for tele or I walk down mid and ult mid to get my mid a kill.  \n\nBasically, always be doing something!
