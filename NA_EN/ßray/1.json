I strongly recommend running a traceroute so we can take an in-depth look at your route to the server. You can accomplish this by grabbing [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/), then plugging in **104.160.131.1** into the host address area before starting the trace. After it has run for roughly 5 minutes, export the results as text and paste them in a reply.\n\nLet me know if you encounter any issues doing this.","replies":[]}]}
