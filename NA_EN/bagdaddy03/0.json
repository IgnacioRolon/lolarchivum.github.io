The problem happens in the game usually before 5 minutes in (though it has happened after) and has been inconsistent in occurrence.\n\nThe game loads just fine, and i manage to get to lane without something happening (most of the time) however after a little while the game screen freezes for a few seconds (2-5) and then both my monitors go to a black screen. during this time i still get game audio and any audio from music i might be playing. my computer stays like this for up to 30 seconds. then the audio cuts and buzzes for a second or two. then my computer restarts.\n\nAs i mentioned, i have looked at other threads for similar problems, as such i have disabled the Microsoft \"game play\" or whatever recorder. Even after doing so this still happens, and this problem has caused me to be demoted from silver 2 to silver 3, and also given me the \"leaver buster\" 20 minute wait time.\n\nNow this problem has mostly happened in games in Ranked on summoners Rift, in order to both trouble-shoot and remove the 20 minute queue timer i played some games on \"Definitely Not Dominion\" and had this happen once in the game mode.\n\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled the game 1 time and before doing so used the repair tool about 5 times to try to fix it. \n\nI am posting this after a few days because i was looking for anything else that might help fix this and also to make sure it wasn't a hardware problem, and the only thing i can guess is possibly a RAM problem, but it doesn't seem like it is, as this is only happening in league. I would like to get this fixed soon if possible because i am trying to get to gold this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-10T22:19:42.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This definitely sounds like a poor driver or hardware interaction going on.
