When I got back on only a few hours later, it wouldn't connect after champ select. I changed literally nothing. After champ select it's just black for a while, and then an error message pops up saying it can't connect to the server. I can connect fine to bot games, but not normal games, ARAM, ranked, or custom. I press retry, it doesn't work. I press cancel then reconnect, doesn't work. I've restarted my computer twice, repaired the client, and even looked into my firewall settings. Nothing worked. I would really like to find a solution to this, and soon. I haven't even been able to finish my placement matches because of it.\r\n\r\nAnd I know I could submit a ticket, but last time I did nothing the support people told me to do worked at all. I appreciate the effort and thank you for the response, but I just think having a topic here for many more people to see and respond to might have better results.","replies":[{"poster":"Mooshykin","date":"2016-12-18T06:02:13.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I know how you feel I have been having this issue as well with 90% of my games. Sometimes pressing the cancel button helps and then clicking reconnect on the league client gets you back in but not always. It's not a fix but it might help you for right now.","replies":[{"poster":"DrinkGameRepeat","date":"2016-12-19T14:36:46.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried that several times, and it unfortunately hasn't worked. Thank you, though. If you find another solution that at least sometimes works, please let me know and I'll try it out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T16:32:34.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"These issues, especially the mentioned black screen, are due to network issues that can't reach the game server or download assets.  You should go through each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to fully troubleshoot this towards a resolution.

Bot and blind pick are the only game modes that have been able to work for me. I've now tried uninstalling it, but now every time I go to the page to download the installer again, it completely crashes my browser. Everything else is working fine on my computer except your game, and your website.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-17T23:01:19.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for trying!

I really don't feel like going through that again, only to get nowhere. And, like I said, I can't download the installer again anyway because your website is crashing my browser completely. If there is anything you can recommend to me - in this topic, not in a ticket - please let me know.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
