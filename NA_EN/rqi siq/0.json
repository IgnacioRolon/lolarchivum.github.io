On my account where i spent hundreds of $ to support RIOT. I spent on my acc over 5000 hours.  Can you imagine the time i was building my profile and how many games i had to play? There was good games and there were bad games. Ofc there is a type of people that can´t handle words and i am one of them... From the other side i didn´t go troll afk or something so i would made the game bad. I had chat ban for more over 4000 games... It was really good becouse i was able to play and i had no chance to type with others...If this was continuing i would never get perma ban. But Clever RIOT after some patch deleted this chat restriction and i get my words again....And ofc i got perma ban. And iam asking why you want to do this? I am not bad player.... I just sometimes can´t handle dumb people.....If iam perma muted it´s ok..I play anyway on other account but with that difference i will never ever put my $ in. !!!!!! But biggest responsibility was that riot took that chat restriction..i didn´t asked for that....everything is ruined....RIOT should think about solving problems not runing from them...and i think that perma ban is worse then chat restriction becouse people simply make new acc and go on...With chat restriction they just stop being toxic but still can do everything good for game even for riot. I wish i could get my acc back. This is just pure robbery of people shame on you","replies":[{"poster":"xJLx MCHammer","date":"2017-03-01T18:02:40.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao \nAhahhaah \nI never heard of this argument before. You blamed riot for keeping the muzzle on. \n\nImagine a convicted felon says, \"you gave me 5 years probation. You should have kept it for lifetime but you didn't so I couldn't hold it and killed the entire village\"\n\n\nLol.10/10 for effort","replies":[{"poster":"RQi SiQ","date":"2017-03-03T07:32:36.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well in real life it works like this...we should still count it is a game and it is not any question life and death... but 4000 games i wouldn´t be able to play so i would be already punished for rest of my life (kinda of perma bann). But i didn´t kill anyone i was only rude my other behaviours are fine i am always teamplayer and i want to do the best...like i was silver and i was able to get to diamond which was really outstanding for me.... But there is already lot of changes becouse many rages came from pickorder in champ select so on when for example i was in promo and somone went troll becouse they couldn´t respect pick order...which they already solve and i am very happy about new system where you choose your position and its clearly said what role you gonna play...so i believe lot of those reports from past wouldnt happen again...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"videorfeak","date":"2017-03-02T05:02:58.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@RQi serious advice, unbind enter and disable all chat and all text you type wont be submitted; you can type and wont get banned its like a self imposed chat restriction. That being said stop typing in game and actually play said game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RQi SiQ","date":"2017-03-01T20:03:56.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can say what you want but it is true....in social when you meet dumb you can as well tell your opinion in rude way and not to be punished its a part of a life and some kids dont deserve anything else...I dont understand how u can´t find out that it is how it is...ban don´t sort out flamers or something...You will simply create new account...that is not solution they just disabled income from addicted person that´s the only thing they will reach....i got like 4 bans for like 14 days or something which can be a part of punishmet but as i said my opinion is that mute of those people make much more and don´t interupt income. It ´s not a cheating or whatever...not everyone is fine when someone is trolling ya...and why couldnt i just tell my opinion....if my problem is chatting then punish me with chat restriction..thats´it...i say again i am not a troll don´t use any cheats etc....I am one of the long term players which help riot grow up...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maddmazz","date":"2017-03-01T15:56:10.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are so immature and infantile you just shouldn't play.

I wonder, were you dropped on the head as a child? Even if I try to consider the option of this thread being trolling, how can one even wrap their brain around that argument? In what conceivable way does it make any sense? \n\nAnyway keep up the good work Riot, always gladto read these posts of people crying on the boars that they were perma banned for being toxic; shows us that Riot does care about its playerbase and is doing its job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T05:01:03.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, we're unable to address Account suspensions here on *Help & Support*.

Ofc that those will have many more reports... and in this amount the same %  would mean 500 reports. And i am sure that i didn´t recieve that many reports...so for example if i had 5% games out of behaviour... I don ´t know the % of reports that would be tolerated but ....I think that if someone got 90% of games how it should be  isn ´t risky person or how to say that...and if they want punish these type of people not with perma ban make no sense...","replies":[]}]}]}]}
