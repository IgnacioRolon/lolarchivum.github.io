Is it something that you plan to keep viable as an alternate build, like blue Ezreal or mid Varus? I vaguely remember that Riot wanted AP Tristana to remain viable during her rework, but I guess her 100-0 burst playstyle was too unhealthy to keep in the end. Is it likely for AD Malzahar suffer the same fate as AP Tristana?\r\n\r\nI tried him out during free week and it was really fun, but I don&#039;t want to fall in love with him and then be heartbroken when it gets removed a few months later.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2016-01-12T06:25:55.532+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know there aren't any concrete plans on what to do with Malzahar yet, but could you offer any preliminary thoughts on AD Malzahar?\n\nSeems like something worth preserving in some fashion or another. As less of a Malzahar-specific thing and more as general principle, I think it's probably best to try to leave things like off-builds in a roughly equal state following updates, though it can be difficult. This assumes they're not causing large scale gameplay problems, and that they're not forcing the champion to be balanced around an off build. It's something I tried to manage well with Kog'Maw, though it's hard to say to what effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Solideus","date":"2016-01-12T08:44:52.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is making Voidlings more relevant to (and scaling with) an AP build also an alternative?

Personally I think it's a good separation between AP and AD Malzahar, where AP relies more on his skills and Voidlings as a distraction/secondary DPS, while AD relies on Voidlings primarily, and uses skills for utility/summoning. Furthermore, AD only really excels in the jungle, since the targets are stationary, and AP is better for lane. I think this difference in strengths is interesting and should be kept.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blackcat1300","date":"2016-03-18T06:02:39.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why was he chosen? I mean wouldn't Karthus or Swain of made more seance Karthus is synonymous with the term immobile mage but ever since the changes to mana pots the nerf to his wall the spike inprice to all of his core items come on give the guy a bone that was a terible pun.. \n\n\nSwain is all fluff and feathers with no real punish potential. Okay he still has some damage but his idenity used to be the anti assassin mage with a pore laning face his passive needs work as dose his kit it seams a bit lack luster. Death fire tough is not good enough to make warrant  a nerf and his stun was always a high risk reward now it is less reward mor rick and it isn't the ability you want to level first.  \n\nwhy did they get left out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ariaflux","date":"2016-01-12T09:20:22.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering!

He's my main and I don't want him to be messed with. Him and quinn are the only interesting Champs keeping me interested in league. The last thing I want is malza har to get is some sort of true damage or \"AA 3 times for some effect\" passive.\n\nMalzahaR is plenty strong, it's just that literally all his abilities have a delay on damage for some unknown reason.  W an enemy then wait 1 full second for it to do damage.  E and wait 1 full second for it to proc.  Ult and wait 1 full second for the suppress to go off.  It's really annoying.\n \nI remember petitioning to fix Quinns AA for forever tho, and we got a solid rework in the end. So if we're gonna mess with malzahar, let it be the same person who reworked Quinn, if not, some body with the same unbiased and un-op mindset (in other words not  CertainlyT)\n","replies":[{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-01-12T15:15:40.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn's ult is more fun now if I'm being honest.\n\nI'm cool replacing her, kinda unfair burst, for a roaming badass that can attack any lane as long as she has the mana.\n\nMax rank ult Quinn is just... Ohhhhh I love it.\n\nBut tbf, Malz does have his passive be \"Every ___ spells\" so It wouldn't be _too_ far of a stretch to give him a 3 AA passive, but I am in no way in favor of it","replies":[]}]}]}
