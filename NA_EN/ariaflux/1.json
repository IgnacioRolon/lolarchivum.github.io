And also, enemies with long range abilities could just work on minion waves positioning to let you miss a good chunk for minions by moving the lane before you can make the barrell ferment or activate it\nHis E gapclose has very long CD until you get consistent CDR, and it still hit relatively few minions even if minions are positioned  up in a way that he can hit a good number of them with the collision range; you won't hit more than 3-4 minions with the E, while receiving enemy minion damage because you went beyond your minion line, and on top of that putting you in a bad position if you are facing the enemy laner because your minions can't bodyblock the enemy abilities \nAs solo laner, against enemy pressure, Gragas has just bad wave clear. He is not bad at splitpushing and clearing an empty lane to defend tower/inhibitor and shove lane back to let your minons take down enemy objectives(also because he has the possibility to escape or at least keep busy multiple enemies with his kit), but the Q damage reduced on minions is a big blow to him as a laner and make him mostly unviable on every role","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Feathermane","date":"2015-02-07T13:32:10.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Items don't support a bruiser AP build very well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CoolKnightST","date":"2015-02-06T22:47:43.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slayer of Booty,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=y4oElWXN,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-02-06T12:28:50.835+0000)\n>\n> Gragas has 4 aoe's, poke, a gap closer, percentage maximum health, soft cc, hard cc, and sustain.
