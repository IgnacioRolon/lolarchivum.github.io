We already have several melee champions who can temporarily or permanently ignore unit collision, and just one ranged champion who can do the same (Jayce), so technically melee champions do tend to have more tools against creep block on average, but the reality of it in the end is that creep block only feels impactful when we least expect it to be, and when that happens it generally tends to screw players over in the worst possible way. It's a mechanic that lacks in clarity, whose intended gameplay feels similarly unclear to players (I don't think Riot themselves have given a definite statement on what it achieves in the game, currently), and which is only felt negatively: if it does exist to serve a purpose, e.g. to stop certain lane bullies from bullying too hard, there are likely far better ways of achieving it, and I think removing it could be a good first step towards allowing melee champions to be designed without gapclosers or abilities that let them ghost through units every time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Acheron16","date":"2017-08-30T13:57:28.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just remove allied creep block, it feels retarded when you die because your own minions blocked your escape because they were trying to \"help\"","replies":[]}]}
