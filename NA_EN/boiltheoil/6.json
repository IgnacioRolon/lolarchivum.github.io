Additionally, you completely disregard the fact that Drain is *designed* to function in this kind of situation where he channels and takes hits while doing so. *That's why it heals him for a large percentage of the damage dealt.*\n\nI pointed out the high damage of a fully channeled drain for the sake of reminding everyone that he is already a comparatively mana efficient jungler for the damage and sustain he has. This doesn't mean he isn't mana hungry at times (because he often is) It just means that he trades mana heavy clears for finishing them extremely healthy. The cooldown reset is already a large enough buff that giving it a mana refund would break his clear (unless it were very small refund, at which point I'd argue they should just reduce the mana cost outright).\n\nMaybe it's your turn to quit being a Nub.","replies":[{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2017-05-03T12:38:26.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=junglerboy16,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Qg1wdfyW,comment-id=000400000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-05-02T21:11:58.785+0000)\n> \n> Drain being a DoT is irrelevant to this discussion\n> \n\nNo it isn't.

It would be much more appropriate to simply reduce the mana cost of drain (especially at later ranks) than offer any sort of refund. It's a cleaner fix that addresses his mana issues head on. \n\nAlternatively, like what some other people on this thread have suggested, Drain could just cost mana per second, e.g. 20 + (12/14/16/18/20 Mana per second), (still totalling to 80/90/100/110/120 mana for full channel). I think this would also be a fair buff, but it would mostly boost his mid and late game where he is no longer channeling full drains.\n\nI'd appreciate if you stopped being so aggressive, I am trying to have a discussion and you're being combative simply on the grounds that you disagree with my logic.","replies":[{"poster":"Jmman","date":"2017-05-03T20:12:15.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still effects clearing the jungle.

You think it would be too strong but it would only put him up to par with the Meta damage junglers.  Then fiddle doesn't have the mobility of these damage junglers.  Not to get on the topic that most have reset their auto attack for more damage.  All the while Fiddle can drain and waits to do anything else.\n\nFine we can have a discussion why can some junglers do more damage, have same life stealing, and have mobility then fiddle would be OP to increase his damage or mobility when he is miles below them?\n\nAggressive isn't the same as disagreeing with you.
