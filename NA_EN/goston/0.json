{"poster":"Goston","date":"2015-10-20T16:50:37.639+0000","title":"Can't enter loading screen, results in leave and loss for no reason, RIOT PLEASE LOOK","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I try to play a game I can log in perfectly fine, champion select is flawless. Then when it goes to loading screen... A black screen. After a minute or so? An error message saying, \"Failed to Connect: Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.\" After this I would try again, and again, and again, and again, you get the picture. I tried restarting the launcher, restarting my computer, but nothing worked. I just kept trying again and again to reconnect until the game comes to an end, and this has occurred more than once. It is infuriating that this is happening because the whole time it is happening, I have a flawless internet connection and I know for a fact my firewall is not the issue. I am able to log in perfectly fine again and again and even have my web browser open and watch youtube videos, but the League of Legends loading screen had to have so many issues connecting to the game. It is frustrating to know that no matter what I do or how many times I try, the game will result in a loss and a leave due to things that were completely out of my control, and maybe even in Riot's control. I also feel terrible for my four teammates in game who are left to play a 4v5 as I hopelessly try again and again to reconnect. This is something that should never happen for a game, considering the amount of money Riot Games is receiving, especially now due to the World Tournament. I know things can come up once in a blue moon, but this issue is something that will pop up every so often with no warning at all. I am fed up with being unsure if I can play League of Legends without running into some annoying problem. If a Riot Representative asks what I want I would demand match forgiveness for a ranked match I lost due to this and demand to know what they are doing to solve this issue. \r\nThank you for your time reading this post. I know that I am not the only one who has run into this issue and I hope for the sake of those like me who are running into this issue and for the sake of those on the teams of people having this issue, that this gets resolved as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoArachnos","date":"2015-10-21T20:42:11.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing is happening to me and nothings working","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-20T22:41:40.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blech.
