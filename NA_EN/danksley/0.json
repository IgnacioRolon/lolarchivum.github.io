Does your team not care about shipping a finished product before you force it onto mature systems that have been in place for 8 years? Are you just not accountable for the quality of your product the way other teams at Riot are? I want to understand why this takes priority over actually finishing your product.\n\nHonor 2.0 feels more like Honor 0.2. You have TWO YEARS to finish up Honor 2.0 before tying it into other systems and you have made literally no progress. Not a single new feature (even ones that were explicitly confirmed) has been added since Honor 2.0 launched.","replies":[{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2018-11-10T02:14:31.621+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cz I highly doubt you need an upgraded Honor system to just **not be toxic**.","replies":[{"poster":"Danksley","date":"2018-11-10T04:17:41.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"A.
