Then you can practice them over time become good be fed have cs. However there are champions &#039;&#039;cheap&#039;&#039; 450BE brainless and unbalanced ones who will win game in anyones hands.\n I loved this game but now I think that this is waste of time to put effort in game where some yi wipes 5 player in 5 seconds even he is 3/15 and he  has 100 cs at 34 min. Maybe leblanc rework is better when you can have 90 cs for entire game but you will still deal shitload damage. Oh I forgot about kaisa who has AK 47 in passive or maybe balanced zoe is answer. this game is garbage when it comes to value BE and effort you put in. Disgusting.\nKeep nerfing bard riot.\nI get now why big youtubers don't play this garbage ","replies":[]}
