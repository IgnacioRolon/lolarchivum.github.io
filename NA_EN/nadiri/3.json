People doens&#039;t cares if they are AFK in ranked no one cares about 20MIN low priority queue as I see. This is extremly tilting for people and everyone in team wants to surrender because AFK.\n\nIf there is perma ban and 14 day ban for toxicity why AFK counts less tilting? at least player who is toxic plays match and you can mute him/her and AFK is just -1 player which tilts another players in team and leads them to surrender.\n\nI ask Riot to make punishment for AFK&#039;s in ranked valuable. \n&gt; **I don&#039;t mean to make it longer right away but if there is player who left one game he/she got 5 queue 20MIN ban right? if he does same some time later again and again then make it longer same way as chat restriction it 5 game  at first and it increases if you are toxic.**\n\n Just make the AFK punishment same way,yes maybe someone had problem okay internet sucked and guy left game it once so he will get regular 5 queue 20MIN ban but there are fucking people who are trolling and they don&#039;t care about AFK ban because its same again and again. You can literary click find match and go watch something for 20min. It also drops our KDA as well simply because you suck in teamfight map pressure is stronger for enemy team and you die and die again for having  you and 3 player who are likely to think surrender against fed af enemy team.\n\nPlease increase punishment for AFK&#039;s in ranked. Each player must RESPECT and VALUE other players experience in game and punishment must make this work, like most people are less toxic after chat restrictions it can work same way on AFK&#039;s. if you want to troll go to blind pick.\nPlease let me know your opinions about this players who had experienced this.","replies":[]}
