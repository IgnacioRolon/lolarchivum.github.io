This also makes it possible for players who haven't bought *any* rune pages a chance to play with different options. You'll be able to make more custom pages by buying them in the shop, and I believe I heard someone mention the possibility being able to hide those presets in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Clôude","date":"2017-11-21T14:29:25.283+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really scummy move there. Pretty much every champion needs custom rune setups now, whereas you could get by with just a few in the old system. I've lost games because I forgot to change my runes, and I'm forced to dodge every time I get autofilled because I don't have a support page and don't have time to 100% familiarize my self with support runes. I know you don't control this stuff as someone in support, but I really don't see anywhere else that a rioter has responded to this. You need to pass it up the chain that people are NOT happy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Linkttp","date":"2017-11-20T02:40:42.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/eqp0b4Yh-too-few-rune-pages","replies":[]},{"poster":"Linkttp","date":"2017-11-18T16:51:26.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would nominate a few more starting rune pages. 2 seems a bit low for something that costs 6300. And it's a quality of life thing, why _Not_  have 1 or 2 more?\nbtw I love the new runes you guys made, awesome design.","replies":[]}]}
