They are a nice middle ground.\n\nBut I agree that they need some buff, you need 4800 HP for % HP Seals to draw even with Scaling HP Seals at 18.\nThough due to Scaing HP Quints being weaker, you only need 3240 HP for % HP Quints to draw even.","replies":[{"poster":"All Day Tay Tay","date":"2015-05-29T21:57:58.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right i messed up my numbers. no idea where mine came from. but the point still stands.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2015-05-29T12:57:28.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree except with MS Quints\n\nThose are extremely decent on roaming champs. In S2, if you weren't running MS Quints mid, you weren't a decent mid-laner.\n\nDon't forget with 3 points in Utility, you'll have a 6% speed boost, akin to having Aether Wisp or the Zeal line - it's significant. Janna's passive got neutered because of how good/clutch early speed can be.","replies":[{"poster":"All Day Tay Tay","date":"2015-05-29T21:57:13.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but all of those are stronger than 3 quints. in s2, the only way to get movespeed was boots and zeal/pd (which gave 5%). in todays game, movespeed is very easy to get. the quints are almost redundant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-29T15:53:22.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"revival per lvl pls -15% time spent dead at lvl 18 per quint, -45% for 3 quints","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeraldOfDemacia","date":"2015-05-29T12:50:41.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention they're all far too expensive...","replies":[]}]}
