Some people STILL do the &quot;i called it even though im last pick&quot; thing, so we end up with 2 mid laners and no adc. I cant dodge cuz ill lose my series, and i cant play cuz ill lose the game. we need some type of protection.","replies":[{"poster":"My Desired Name","date":"2015-04-16T10:49:01.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play alot better when I'm drunk.

Who cares if I want to use mine because I don't like the matchup or because there's a troll on my team. Stop making me play with people I don't want to play with! This is absolutely ridiculous, I would rather go through 5 matchmaking processes that don't make it to the game then play an at least 20 minute game that I know I'm going to lose before the match even starts. This whole thing is outrageous and there is no reason this cannot be fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kairya","date":"2015-04-16T13:02:48.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest people have to play to earn dodges, similar like earning Rerolls in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"Occams Raiser","date":"2015-04-16T23:16:43.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be cool actually","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mirage Seraph","date":"2015-04-16T18:54:45.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this count for placements?
