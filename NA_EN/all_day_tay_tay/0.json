I have determined at the very least it is not my headset, since when i plug in earbuds it does the same thing. I am 99% sure its not the soundcard. They only crackle when i play league, and its at random points. I cant find anything common going on when it starts. When it does start, i have to tell my soundcard to shoot the sound to the speakers (which i dont have) and then tell it to shoot the sound through my headset again. this fixes it, but its only temporary. No other game causes the crackling. Any suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-30T00:12:19.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey All Day Tay Tay, \n\nIt may be because I'm slightly obsessed with Morg and all of that stuffz >.> \n\n<.< \n\n>.> lol\n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2015-10-28T18:25:55.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey All Day Tay Tay, \n\nThe most likely solution to this problem is to reinstall League of Legends following the below steps. \nPlease follow this guide carefully:\n\n- Reinstalling LoL Guide: http://support.leagueoflegends.com/entries/234176\n\nI recommend that you take care to ensure the following:\n\n- Verify that you are installing to this directory (it is the default one): C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n\n- Make sure to perform the optional step of removing Adobe Air.\n\n- Verify that you have acquired all available windows updates:http://www.update.microsoft.com\n\n{{champion:25}} {{summoner:4}} {{item:3157}}","replies":[{"poster":"All Day Tay Tay","date":"2015-10-29T09:37:42.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while i dont understand the morg flash hourglass thing, the rest of your advice seems to have worked. did a full match and no crackle. thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Boss Apple Sauce","date":"2015-10-28T15:18:58.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried using your onboard audio to see if the problem persists?","replies":[{"poster":"All Day Tay Tay","date":"2015-10-29T04:30:12.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would, but my onboard doesnt have enough power output to power the headset.","replies":[]}]}]}
