If it doesn't, can you try a Custom Game and see if she's available to use? I'm taking a look at the account--and assuming I'm looking at the correct one--you should have Annie in Wonderland available to you.\n\nIf you're still having issues, please reach out to my colleagues through the Support Site to see what may be causing this weird issue where you cannot use a skin your account has: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2019-05-07T00:40:34.921+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Son Golin said, sometimes skins don't show up in your collection after you unlock them in Hextech Crafting.
