I haven't see any issues server side, but there are quite a few reports here.  We can run some logs to get more visibility on what's going on, and see what we can do from there.  Download [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) and run a traceroute to the NA game server:  104.160.131.1\n\nRun it for a few minutes, then post your logs here.
