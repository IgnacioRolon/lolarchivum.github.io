He reconnected once midway through the game (~10 min mark or something) and the \"summoner has reconnected\" appeared so the game clearly recognized that he was DC'd. No items purchased, no chat, no emotes, no movement until he reconnected way past remake time. \n\nI believe you when you say that you've tested this, but wanted to give you an example: game length was 28:36 and played today ending ~4:45 in case this issue resurfaces. Then again, if the player is attempting to reconnect -- but never does -- does that block remake as well? My interpretation of \n\n> /Remake becomes available at 3:00 if a player is disconnected or flagged as inactive for 90 seconds\n\nMeans that it should go through regardless of whether they're trying to reconnect or not. If I'm right, then there is some bug with /remake. Might not be biscuits but there's something there.\n\nSorry for the bother, hope this gets resolved or the remake page is clarified","replies":[]},{"poster":"TryMucinex","date":"2017-12-09T18:22:03.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello! In the past, I often roamed the bug section of the boards, and whenever this issue came up, I often find the reason of the \"bug\" and inform the players about the requirement needed to use the /remake function.
