The stem(for lack of a better word) looks like it sunk into her head and the light is not there. Strangely enough though it pops out during her dance animation.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HIhIZTY.png\r\n\r\nIdk if this is intentional or not but I knew something was fishy(hue) when I loaded into the game earlier.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqdwZuYqgI4      Skin spotlight video from the skin&#039;s release for reference.

It seems to be a weighting issue with her lure, which is causing it to appear and disappear during several animations. :c","replies":[{"poster":"Ferezilla","date":"2017-01-21T00:26:11.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the response!
