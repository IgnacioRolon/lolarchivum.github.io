Tonight I tested jungle akali (spoiler alert its complete SHIT) I told the team in champ select it would suck, gave them a win rate, and said buckle up and they decided to stay in SO OFF WE GO. Well we get inavded blah blah blah i end up with no leash and a stolen buff on a jungler thats shit so yeah i was EXTREMELY far behind then my team starts going mental (which i somewhat understand I was doing NOTHING). You really dont get to be mad about this outcome simply because if youre told that someone is going to do something thats going to make you mad and you say nothing and choose to stay its on you.","replies":[{"poster":"xKELSOx","date":"2020-01-09T08:44:43.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Norms and I mean I could try it in bots but TBH after being on the other end for so many years I basically dont care anymore because 98% of the community doesnt.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenKnight","date":"2020-01-09T08:54:45.278+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xKELSOx,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NRWd6GiF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2020-01-09T08:44:43.360+0000)\n>\n> Norms and I mean I could try it in bots but TBH after being on the other end for so many years I basically dont care anymore because 98% of the community doesnt.\n\n... so you are to blame too.

Why be negative right from the start?\n\nSecondly, it's YOUR responsibility to play the best you can. Others shouldn't have to take into account that you might suck in that particular game, because League is a game of trust. Everyone had hope in you, and you betrayed their expectations. It's really common in matches, but that doesn't mean you can blame someone JUST for believing in you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-09T22:32:13.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenKnight,realm=EUNE,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=NRWd6GiF,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2020-01-09T09:32:17.186+0000)\n>\n> Firstly, why would you even say that it's a bad idea to play like this?

How did he betray them?

I picked it because I wanted to try it and I dont care if my teammates choose to deal with it, I gave fair warning which is more than most give so again idgaf.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KFCeytron","date":"2020-01-10T07:38:28.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've played since beta and you're level 38?
