You can&#039;t help bot lane, it&#039;s an easy lane to get ganked in. I&#039;ve been looking at the top lane smite strategy that&#039;s come up, and that&#039;s when it hit me. Why not make a top laner champion that&#039;s designed to roam and take camps while your jungler is in bot jungle? Bard is the first ever roamer to go in bot lane, why not make something similar. An extremely mobile champion that can jungle, yet also do top lane and STILL jungle. Shyvana and Teemo can definitely do this.. but howabout a champion whose kit is created for this? And it would make a good champion to roam to far away areas like Dragon or Bot lane to grant reinforcements.  A Champion that can for once go without teleport. I guess Rek&#039;Sai can sort of fit the bill.. but she&#039;s soley meant for jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"TeemoJenkins","date":"2015-05-05T19:57:50.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:98}} I help all the lanes.... but lose mine... but do not worry, we will win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valorin","date":"2015-05-05T20:01:42.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my issue..how are you planning on doing this without allowing the opposing top-laner a free farm? I would think you'd be required to put down the enemy laner a couple times before you can roam, or you will get out-scaled hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Legendary Misaka","date":"2015-05-06T03:31:48.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking about that. Actually imagine a passive that grants extra experience for killing monsters. Something that allows you to top lane roam without getting outscaled. Of course it might make a jungler that's too powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-05-05T21:51:33.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A champ that's super mobile, can jungle and go top? {{champion:64}} I can't see anyone having a problem with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-05-05T20:11:20.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually designed a champion to do exactly this!
