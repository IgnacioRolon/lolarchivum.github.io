Even if she does have ult it's so easy to force it as fizz and just kill her during the down time instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LuroiTheUmbreon","date":"2018-10-23T21:37:37.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would say it definitely depends on whos playing.

I feel like the fizz player has a little more wiggle room where the ahri player loses lane if he dies once.  Because it has relatively easy snowball potential, this is probably a lane junglers should hard focus early if a kill hasn't happened yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2018-10-23T16:38:21.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is Fizz tilted, but ahri has some pretty good opportunity here.\n\nAhri is Ranged, she has 3 dashes and a CC ability. Early game fizz can't do much against her, many a time i have been the fizz or the ahri in this match up and as the ahri you have a pretty nice advantage levels 1-3 afterwards it's dead even level 4 and 5, at level 6 is where it goes into fizz's favor. The thing is that as the Ahri player you MUST keep your distance to give yourself enough time to dodge Fizz's R or to be able to get back to your turret before he can catch up to you when he does land it. After you dodge his R or if he already used his E, your pretty golden in this match up, there isn't much he can do to you if he misses a primary damage ability or if your too far away for him to finish the combo.\n\nIf he R's you and you get hit, run back to your turret with as many R charges as it takes, the slow matter's a bit but your dash distance will always be the same, if you do this immediately he might not be able to Q you to close the distance, and if he has to use his E to close the distance you can charm him and prevent him from being able to kill you.\n\nEdit: As other's have mentioned its really easy to force Ahri's R and if she doesn't have that she can die pretty easily but she's ranged and fizz is melee so that kind of helps her out a lot, better waveclear as well to keep fizz off of her, so i still think it's a mostly skill match up favoring fizz. \n\nAll in all i think this is a 48% Ahri and 52% Fizz, it's mostly a skill match up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OtterlyLost","date":"2018-10-23T16:24:53.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends. If Ahri has her full combo up, lands the charm, and uses her ult to successfully dodge Fizz's, ahri could win feasibly. By the same token though, if the fizz uses his troll pole right to dodge her combo he wins.

It depends on if Ahri can land her charm and/or Fizz can land his ult. There's a lot more that goes into this matchup, too, such as Ahri being able to punish Fizz early and gain a cs lead.
