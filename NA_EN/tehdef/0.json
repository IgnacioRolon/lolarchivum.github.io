I have it set to 94hz right now, but I noticed that anything above 60 hz results in the launcher just acting like I didn't tell it to load. Any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Pryotra","date":"2013-09-22T04:12:35.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lucky SOB...\n\nBy launcher, do you mean the Updater? or where you login? Also, have you disabled the overclock and gotten it to load?\n\nAlso, seeing as I am not up to snuff on Monitor overclocking, could you disable it, start up the launcher, then re-enable it? That might be a work around...","replies":[{"poster":"tehdef","date":"2013-09-22T12:49:21.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I can do that, but I don't want to. In fact, I shouldn't have to. I'm only overclocking with the basic nvidia control panel that is available to everyone. Seems stupid, especially since there are a ton of 120/144hz monitor.\n\nAlso, not too lucky. It's only 350. Look to get it for Christmas. I got it from Amazon. Got here in 1 day. Shipped on Monday from S.Korea, arrived on Tuesday. Free Shipping. Pixel perfect. Have to deal with a bit of light bleed but nothing outrageous.","replies":[{"poster":"dArtagnan","date":"2013-09-23T21:04:14.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi tehdef,\n\nWe have heard multiple reports about people having issues launching the patcher with monitor settings with more than 60 hertz.  You are correct in that it can prevent the patcher from currently opening, and we are currently investigating this issue.  I can't promise any kind of timeline in fixing this bug, but we are looking at it!\n\nIf  you have a monitor of 60 hertz or more and are unable to open the patcher, make sure to try lowering the hertz level to see if this fixes your issue!","replies":[{"poster":"tehdef","date":"2013-10-01T16:18:11.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks bud. Hopefully you guys can get this fixed up. 120/144hz monitors are becoming more and more prevalent in gaming, so it would make sense to get it going.\n\nThanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
