Then I realized my error and that I would probably get chat restricted, so I thought &quot;whatever, it&#039;s just a smurf account&quot;. A few minutes after the game, I got temp banned for 2 weeks. I was confused because I never had any infractions up until that point (new account). So I sent Riot a ticket asking them why I got temp banned, and they said it&#039;s because they have 0 tolerance for hate speech.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s so fucking stupid. Being toxic is being toxic. It shouldn&#039;t matter what you say, everything should be punished equally. Everything you say are just words, none of them have more meaning than others. If I said the n word and a bunch of people got mad at me for it, then they&#039;re the ones making the situation worse. They&#039;re giving the word the power that they so desperately want it to not have. (idubbbz quote) But seriously though, if you&#039;re going to temp ban me for &quot;hate speech&quot;, then ban every other person who has ever been toxic. Don&#039;t chat restrict some people and ban others, they&#039;re all toxic, give them the same punishment.
