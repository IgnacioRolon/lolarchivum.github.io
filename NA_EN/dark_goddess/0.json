I took a look at the based as compared to Head Hunter Caitlyn, and it appears as though both of these particles are playing at the same speed. The one thing I would say is that, due to Head Hunter Caitlyn's AA particle having a longer/more wispy trail, that may be why the particle is appearing slower than the base AA particle, where the trail is a bit different.","replies":[]}]}
