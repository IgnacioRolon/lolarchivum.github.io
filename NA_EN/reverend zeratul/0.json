I waited to see if I would reconnect, then used Task Manager to force League of Legends processes to stop, since rebooting the client is often faster than waiting. While doing this, the League client brought up the \"skip waiting for stats\" button.\r\n\r\nI started the client again, logged in, and... no \"reconnect to game\" screen. Just the normal home screen. I checked match history and there aren't any ranked games listed for today. No LP is missing. It's like the game never even happened.\r\n\r\nTried reporting this as a bug (since that seems to be what this is) but my post was deleted. So I guess I have to make a post here?\r\n\r\nPlayers in game:\r\n\r\niLuVLamps\r\nSnaynran\r\nTheMango\r\nCHINOHISFATHER\r\nBest Ezreal\r\n\r\nReverend Zeratul\r\nb33f st00\r\nDiamondParadise\r\njonakwong\r\nXx 2KOBE4 xX","replies":[{"poster":"Digital Ram","date":"2015-02-03T02:04:48.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Reverend Zeratul,\n\nIt looks like there was a problem with the game recording to our database. This can happen when everyone disconnects, or when the game server you're playing on is experiencing problems. The game was not counted for or against you. I'm sorry for the inconvenience :c","replies":[]}]}
