Many people also speculate {{champion:56}} {{champion:35}} are also demons (not sure if they are confirmed, please enlighten me if so). We know for sure Darkins are not demons, but another different race. What we do currently know about demons it that:\n1. They tend to prey on humans\n2. They need to form some sort of contract to be able to do so\n\nThere is also the speculation that demons are related to the seven deadly sins. Regardless of that, there is actually 1 more being in the lore that fulfills these requirements.\n{{champion:60}} \nNot exactly her, but the Spider God she &quot;prays&quot; to. From Elises lore, we know the spider preys of humans, but cant get them himself for some reason. Instead he uses Elise as a medium to start a fake religion and lure humans to him. Perhaps them having faith in him, to lower their pride for him, is the contract he needs to fulfill in order to prey on them. Since his contract is particularly hard to fulfill, he made a deal with Elise. \n\nEven though he is from the Shadow Isle where there are plenty of other weird creatures, the Spider God does seem to fulfill the criteria of being a demon.

In the current era, the 7 deadly sins has already far evolved from their ties with any religion to a more global perspective. The title of \"7 deadly sins\" doesnt make people think of Christianity, but instead shows like Full Metal Alchemist and Nanatsu no Taizai. People think of them more as \"pseudo-evil beings\" rather than the concept of sinning against god thanks to these shows. Then again its 2k17, people try their best to find offense in everything, so i understand the caution. But speaking of global themes, champions like {{champion:103}} {{champion:62}} are extremely culture-specific (Korean and Chinese), even more so than the seven deadly sins. But hey, LoL is famous in those places which makes it ok i guess. So, agree to disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"Zella Dae","date":"2018-01-27T04:55:50.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GrReaper96,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xtipuNor,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-10-04T00:18:17.165+0000)\n>\n>But speaking of global themes, champions like {{champion:103}} {{champion:62}} are extremely culture-specific (Korean and Chinese), even more so than the seven deadly sins.

The two sealed a pact; the Black Rose would provide Elise with acolytes to offer up to the Spider God, and she in turn, would return any artifacts of power she discovered upon the isles.\n>\n>Centuries have passed since her first voyage to the Shadow Isles, and whenever Elise sees streaks of white in her hair or crow's feet at her eyes, she ventures forth to cull easily swayed souls from the Black Rose and set sail for the isle of black mists. None who accompany her ever return, and with each voyage, it is said she is renewed and invigorated, bearing another ancient artifact for the Pale Woman.\n\nWhether or not vilemaw is a god or a demon is a possible discussion, but he's currently slated as the same entity Illaoi's god is and because of their existance, doesn't rule out gods in the LoL universe.","replies":[{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2017-10-04T00:19:19.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see.
