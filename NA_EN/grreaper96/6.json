Isnt he like the most freaking cutest amazing thing youve ever seen? Damaging enemies by making faeries pop up beside them; how cool is that? Not to mention that bubble SFX that comes with it.\n\nYet Syndras \"My potential is limitless\" super lame snobbish VO completely ruins the theme. Why waste the potential? Why not make this a legendary skin? Why does it have to be Ahri again? Syndra NEEDS this to be a legendary skin. Its her calling.\n\n---\n\n\nhttps://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/littlebusters/images/5/57/Yuiko_Icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20121019000824\n\n---\n\nThis is Yuiko Kurugaya from Little Busters. Shes tall, smart, self-sufficient and is pretty much like the cool big sister. This is exactly what Syndra should be in the group of Star Guardians. The calm, collected, somewhat intimidating of girl. \n\nIf Janna is like the mother hen, then Syndra should be the scary big sis.

It's likely far too late to turn back now. I doubt they'll send it back to the drawing board like the 2015 SKT skins, unless the whole universe yells for it.\n\nThis also brings up the questions: Why was Ahri made into a Legendary rather than just being a 1350 & calling it a day?

This is the second batch of skins in a row that I feel like one of the skins was a half thought and efforts were lost midway.
