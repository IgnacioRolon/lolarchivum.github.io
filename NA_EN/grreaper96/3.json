When you compare that to for example Trundle, who only has 750rp and lower skins, thats a lot.\n\nSure he could do with another good (fantasy themed) skin, but 2 skins is overkill.

More and more these days Riot has been looking into re-releasing Limited Edition skins, as seen with various sports/holiday skins, Championship Riven, the recent addition of Neo Pax Sivir (recolor of Pax Sivir) and now upcoming Urfwick.  So, I'd say that Rusty \"never coming back\" isn't quite true. It's very possible we may see it available in the future in some way.","replies":[{"poster":"Nickfer2510","date":"2017-10-21T20:29:20.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sukishoo,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FIhFJuVM,comment-id=001200010000,timestamp=2017-10-21T06:27:45.948+0000)\n>\n> Well, we don&#x27;t know that for sure.

The skin wasn't discontinued because it was only available for a limited time in the store or at a PAX event. From what I could find, it was discontinued because Riot considered the skin to be too low of quality. That's why I say that Rusty Blitzcrank is never coming back.\n\nRiot may re-release an improved version of that skin, but unless Blitzcrank gets a rework, and therefore all his skins get improved along with him, I don't see it happening.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2017-10-21T09:57:32.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually Rusty Blitzcrank is limited,meaning that at the moment,there is no way for you to get it.\nAnd I think this will most likely remain the case until Blitzcrank gets a visual update(which won't happen anytime soon)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nickfer2510","date":"2017-10-20T21:01:15.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, he was owed a skin ever since Sewn Chaos Blitz was canceled.
