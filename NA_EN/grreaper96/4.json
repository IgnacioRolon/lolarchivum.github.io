A lot of people love URF\n2. A lot of people love URf a bit too much\n3. If URF became a normal mode then less people would play rank\n4. Draven wouldnt be able to show of in ranked anymore (DRAAAVVEEEENNNN)\n5. Manatees are cute\n\nSo what I propose is Ultra Rapid Friday\nThat&#039;s right ladies, gentlemen and yordles. Every Friday URF will accessible and we can all play our beautifully chaotic mode. With this we can play URF for roughly 23.99 hours a week! All the fun, tears and\nbloodshed, available once a week throughout the year\n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\n\nEDIT: Changed 1, 2 and 3 to avoid offending people\nEDIT2: Some people suggest to mix up the special game modes instead of just urf which i think is great. Maybe every month can have its own special mode.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsCalledALance","date":"2016-02-02T18:15:48.958+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":5,"body":"Why don't we have urf?\n\nno no really, why not??","replies":[{"poster":"Wulf Helhammer","date":"2016-02-02T18:29:13.352+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":12,"body":"Because it is a featured game mode that if available regularly would grow stale and un-fun (people were already saying that after it was extended in the past)","replies":[{"poster":"ItsCalledALance","date":"2016-02-02T18:34:23.148+0000","up_votes":40,"down_votes":8,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AvantelWings,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=HEpLGnk4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-02T18:29:13.352+0000)\n>\n> Because it is a featured game mode that if available regularly would grow stale and un-fun (people were already saying that after it was extended in the past)\n\n....like aram?","replies":[{"poster":"GrReaper96","date":"2016-02-02T20:45:43.656+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah nobody plays aram its so boring now.

Perhaps it's just me, but ARAM succeeds because there's no way for you to always pull the same stupid annoying team comp you'd probably see every URF game or every One For All.\n\nBut, I'm not a opposed to a weekly URF for those that want it, just giving my two cents on the whole ARAM and URF thing. Perhaps URF should be made permanent in the same way as ARAM? Random champions, but with the same URF twist?
