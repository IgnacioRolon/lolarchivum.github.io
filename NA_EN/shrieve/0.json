While Zac&rsquo;s strategic elements feel pretty interesting (see above), we feel tactically he falls pretty flat (see below). On top of that, we think we could expand even further on what it means to be League&rsquo;s shape-changing, bouncy, goo-man. \n\n**Here&rsquo;s what is likely to change with Zac: **\n\n* Zac&rsquo;s current kit encourages him to activate all his abilities in a single burst for maximum damage, instead of spreading them out to disrupt and bounce around the enemy team\n\n * After initiation, there is very little variance or mastery to his combat pattern, consisting of primarily sitting on one target and spamming his Q and W\n\n * Keeping in line with our overall Tank update goals, we&rsquo;d like to shift some his reliable damage into additional forms of CC (we already felt that his two passives provide unique forms of defenses) \n\n* Although some of his abilities hit the mark, we feel that his kit could further stretch the blob man fantasy and give him a more distinct sticky feel in the Vanguard space\n\n * _Stretching Strike_ does little to explore the stretching punch idea and ends up having a very similar output to _Unstable Matter_ (AoE damage when you&rsquo;re right next to someone)\n\n * _Let&rsquo;s Bounce!_ is a more chaotic version of Wukong&rsquo;s _Ultimate _(Cyclone) rather than the potential teamfight-defining moment that Zac&rsquo;s unique, sticky, bouncy nature promises\n\nWe&rsquo;re looking to turn our resident goo-man into the premier displacement Vanguard, shuffling his opponents around the battlefield with sticky, stretchy, chaotic abilities that feel uniquely Zac. \n\n_Let&rsquo;s Bounce,\nShrieve\n_\n\nP.S. we&rsquo;re not supposed to give you details yet&hellip; but yes, his voice now pitches up and down as he changes in size","replies":[{"poster":"Keevalroy","date":"2017-02-28T20:33:46.704+0000","up_votes":95,"down_votes":1,"body":">P.S. we’re not supposed to give you details yet… **but yes, his voice now pitches up and down as he changes in size\n**\n\nYou're doing god's work.","replies":[{"poster":"Shrieve","date":"2017-02-28T21:13:08.743+0000","up_votes":37,"down_votes":1,"body":"Gotchu fam. \n\n(really props to our audio guys... they did all the work there)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot 10YearSanta","date":"2017-02-28T21:59:40.154+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"How do you expect AP Zac to change as a result of this update?

I've always thought his Q and W were a little bland, especially the W. Notice the pattern among {{champion:154}} , {{champion:113}} , {{champion:54}} , and {{champion:32}}  how they all have Strong AoE cc and at least one ability that is \"damage in an AoE around them,\" with something just a little different for each one. {{champion:154}} 's W cooldown is reduced by picking up his passive, {{champion:54}} 's E reduces enemy attack speed, {{champion:113}} 's W applies her Frost and is an auto reset, and {{champion:32}} 's W is a toggle that drains mana, and his E's cooldown is reduced when taking damage.

The unfortunate truth is that we didn't feel like we could give champions like Malphite, Amumu, and Rammus the attention they deserved given the smaller scope of these types of projects.\n\nWe ruled out Amumu and Rammus early on since they deserve full-on VGUs.\n\nMalphite on the other hand we took a crack at, but didn't walk away with anything we thought that fit him or the game well enough. We tried things like turning him into a wall (sick Poppy / Vayne combos that never actually worked out heh), echoing earthquakes, etc. that all had some promise but just didn't work out as expected. Maybe we'll figure it out in the future.\n\nFor Amumu, we think there's some small quality of life changes we can do, that could even go out in the fairly near future just to help modernize and clarify some of his current mechanics.
