You only provided the 3rd game (you left out 1 and 2), which was the least severe of the game evidence provided to you. Your penalty was not caused by that game.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-01T21:44:03.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"But doesnt it take 3 games to get punished, so it was caused by that game technically.In hind sight i was dying down in toxicity (because i knew it wasnt going to end well for anyone) which is why the chat restriction utterly surprised me.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2017-08-01T21:44:45.446+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope. It can be caused by as few as 1 game. Even if it was caused by a single game and the system sees other logs in your recent history that are relevant to your penalty, it will show them to you.\n\nBut honestly, cherry picking the least severe log and presenting it as though you have no idea how you were penalized, is a little disingenuous. I'm assuming you knew the first 2 were unacceptable, which is why you excluded them.\n\nIt's only a chat restriction. Take it as a learning experience, which it is intended as, because your next penalty will likely be escalated if you continue.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-02T01:08:48.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Tbh Tantram i didnt know that which is why i was so tilt in the first place, This is my second chat restriction i just got off my first one.

You were definitely being very negative (asking for report on vayne).  You were mildly flaming the vayne, repeatedly pointing out her k/d/a and cs with the intention of shaming her.\n\nYes, you were directly flaming the vayne and you got a very mild punishment for it (compared to the other straight-to-14/perma-banned cases).  If I were in that game as one of the other 3 teammates, I would report you for being negative and generally making the game very unenjoyable for me because you won't stop typing.","replies":[{"poster":"SwiftSwifties ","date":"2017-08-01T21:37:30.129+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"Directly flaming the vayne? She was flaming my entire team and even flaming the enemy team and it was around a 35 minute game, that was close but the 0-8 vayne with 45 farm 35 minutes in held down the rest of the team with quite literally positive kdas.

If the Vayne was flaming your entire team (and the enemy team for some reason...), you report her and that player and only that player will be punished.  If you want to partake in vigilante justice, then there are consequences to that satisfaction (very much the same as in real life).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
