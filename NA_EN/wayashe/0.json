Especially since E should be the last skill you level up as Sona.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"gameipedia","date":"2015-01-06T01:14:00.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"if youre building luci boots, I question wtf youre building on sona, sone should only go mobis or mpen boots, she shouldnt need luci with 5% masteries almost any ap item, pref morellos and an ardent censor, or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2015-01-06T01:27:59.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gameipedia,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kbjuFaw3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-06T01:14:00.021+0000)\n>\n> if youre building luci boots, I question wtf youre building on sona, sone should only go mobis or mpen boots, she shouldnt need luci with 5% masteries almost any ap item, pref morellos and an ardent censor, or something like that.\n\nlucidity boots as an early item, CDR is an important stat on supports, in a game where I'm going even I usually end up with lucidity boots, talisman, sightstone, 2 slots for wards for a large portion of the game and a mana item, tear/chalice. If I'm going for morellos I might skip them for sorc or swiftness boots, or merc treads vs other AP supports with heavy CC. If I'm snowballing I usually sell the lucidity boots and go for sorc shoes, especially if I'm going a lichbane build.","replies":[{"poster":"Origami Kaiju","date":"2015-01-06T02:31:30.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> talisman\n\nWait, you aren't building spellthiefs on Sona?
