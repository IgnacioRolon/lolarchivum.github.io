She isn't (quite) the op ad bruiser that she was before, and she isn't the insanely op 1 hit spear + trap (anyone remember that game with xiaoweixiao? XD) She still hits like a truck with the spears, but with the width changes and such, I think she's fairly balanced. Idk I don't play her much :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worgslarg","date":"2014-10-17T02:34:06.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her damage is ok, but her laning phase is complete shit. AP nid doesn't have reliable poke because of how hard it is to spear inlane, her traps trigger off of nearby minions and ignore champions which they are directly placed on, and her auto's are terrible. Forget leaping to the target for trades, you're never gonna land that spear/trap on them. \n\nZed, Fizz, Kat, Talon, Kassadin and Akali( post 6) all have actual gapclosers.\n\nTo give her an actual laning phase, she could get a way to trigger the hunt from normal auto's from her e, or traps could actually be worth a shit inlane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"12tales","date":"2014-10-17T02:05:11.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's in this kinda unfortunate spot where, even tho she was nominally buffed recently, the nerfs to her AD and AS intended to hurt AD Nid actually hurt her laning quite a bit. She's probably viable-ish, but you'd be better off running Jayce in most situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2014-10-17T01:41:18.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it because ad nidalee's cougar q was alot more annoying plus lifesteal would affect it\nnow nidalee is just damage with her only sustain being her heal so she atleast has to use a big chunk of mana to heal instead of just life stealing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darkmind1212","date":"2014-10-17T01:51:30.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From what I can tell going ap nidalee only seems to work in terms of burst, stop, burst, stop. so in a way its like making her a mage that is weak to proper auto attacks. So I would say a little under balanced I guess but there are better options now than ap nidalee.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sukishoo","date":"2014-10-17T02:00:21.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"She is dead.
