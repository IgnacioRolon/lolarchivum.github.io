If it keeps filtering over on EUW, I'd suggest reaching out to one of their agents to see if they could update it possibly?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-11-20T20:33:18.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually language filters are server specific to my knowledge, and so it's probably best for you to post this either on the EU boards and/or file a support ticket for them to look into it - it may be filtered on the North American servers (as the supported languages here do not include Hungarian to my knowledge), but may very well be an oversight on the EUNE servers. It could also be that it was commonly abused and so it was just filtered for everyone.","replies":[]}]}
