I got to a point where I have to actually say something about this bullshit. I lost my promo to plat ONLY because of my teammates. I understand that sometimes you get people that may not be that good or they are having a bad day or get disconnected because of a thunderstorm. But why should I be punished for it? If I am playing well and I lose the game why should I lose 20 LP and then when I am having a bad game doing absolutly nothing but feeding the whole time and somehow I get carried by my team I get 20 LP? This is just bullshit. Players should be rewarded for performance and not for winning or losing. Also the promotions should be redone aswell. The system where you have to win the majority of the games is bullshit since you can&#039;t controll the other 4 players. Well then... I apologize for my poor grammer and I wish you a good day. PS: the screen of my last game is just for demonstration... I am not saying I am the only one always carrying, all I am saying is that maybe I should lose less lp then when I had 1/10 with kindred.","replies":[{"poster":"Vyntrius","date":"2018-07-29T16:19:05.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning/losing always will and should be the only factor that determines lp gains or losses. If performance mattered, people would just do things that made their score look good rather than necessarily doing what wins the game. Winning the game? Try to farm kills as much as possible rather than close it out. Losing the game? Time to afk in fountain to protect my kda. How you or your teammates happen to perform in a single game doesn't matter in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madsin25","date":"2018-07-29T15:55:22.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are rewarded for performance.\n\nWhen you destroy the nexus.\n\nBro if you don't like the way the game is played go play a new one.
