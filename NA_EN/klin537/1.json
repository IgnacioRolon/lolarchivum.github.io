The players aren't banned, they just get matched with other hackers.\n\nSo league could have a \"toxic pool\", for all the toxic people. This would allow toxic people to keep playing but not bother any one else, and it would also be a little more generous considering that many people (mostly banned people) are opposed to long term bans especially when it comes to an account the money was spent on.\nIt would also clean out the massive amount of threads on this board that are just \"Should this have been banned [insert easily bannable toxicity]\" or \"I spent $x and now I'm banned aaahhhh\".\n\nI think it's a great idea but let me know what you guys think!\n\nedit\nwell it looks like the votes speak for themselves. Wow you guys really hate toxic players huh? Can't even give them a place amongst themselves to play? Honestly it seems that you're more interested in punishing people than actually cleaning up the community. And to be honest I find that toxic in and of itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Kuthillick","date":"2019-11-11T02:20:37.708+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has repeatedly said that they do not want to create a prisoner's island for these types of people.

The number of toxic players is significantly smaller than the total player base, leading to poor matchmaking in a toxic pool.\n2. Toxicity breeds toxicity, so the solution makes it harder for players who are not yet at the point where they would be permanently banned to reform.\n3. Not all toxic players are the same kind of toxic, so the environment would be pretty awful, and some players who were only slightly toxic to many times would be forced to play with those who spew hate speech in every game.\n4. It cost money to support a separate server, and money to develop a system like this. From a business perspective and the community perspective it's simply not worth investing that money in a small portion of the player base who has proven unwilling to accept the fairly reasonable rules.

Chat has to _remain_ unmuted for all of them. \n\nBasically, out of all the number of toxic players registered in a month. Only 0.5-1% of the least toxic ones get to retain their accounts while 99% get permanently banned. They could also make an entertaining stream out of it. Stream the last few games/moments of toxic players, showing off their account level along with the number of skins owned etc. before a certain phrase or string of sentences result in them getting _tilted_ so hard that they wind up responding in kind, and getting _insta. banned_. \n\n**Imagine**. A game where you end up winning _not_ because you are the most skilled. But because, you're the least toxic. The remaining 9 ended up getting banned and you were the only one left to finish off the Nexus! I'd chuckle watching this happen.
