He was under his tower the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nThen the reverse happened, the yasuo was on my team. And he got owned. He kept trying to push his lane too, and just died over and over again.

Anivia can form a wall, Taliyah can form a long wall, Trundle can form a short wall. Mundo doesn't form anything. He just exists.\n\nAnd Mundo seems to be the true early game bully, tossing out cleavers with substantial damage but nearly no cost or CD, which opponents must dodge (although that's really difficult, given the projectile speed) because the slow is so strong that it'll make dodging follow-up shots impossible. That cleaver literally starts with more damage and 33% lower CD than Ziggs Q. And that's _minimum_ damage. While Ziggs and other mages actually have to build offensively to increase the damage they deal, Mundo's damage scales automatically while he builds defensive items.","replies":[{"poster":"Wordse","date":"2019-11-27T01:37:10.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I suppose some of this is based on a difference of opinion on what is interesting - I find Regen Tanking things interesting and exciting and he doesn't just exist he still has to interact through his cleavers auto attacks and decision making if you hit zero keys on the keyboard Mundo will do nothing and not succeed. \n\nAlso people who build offensively deal way way way more damage than Mundo and he can be killed  I dunno I enjoy that Mundo is a simple champ whose entire Idea is \"Recover health and build tanky you won't deal a ton of damage but you will survive a bunch.

He can't get that regen if he's out of combat, if he misses his abilities, if his enemies dodge his abilities, if he's CC'ed... Meanwhile, there are no such restrictions with Mundo's regen. He presses a button and that's it, double health bar. And it's (for some reason) balanced around enemies applying GW to him 100% of the time. If that doesn't happen, he's basically unkillable, by design - a terrible design.\n\n\"Do more damage to sustain more\" is much better than \"do nothing to sustain more,\" which is what Mundo has.
