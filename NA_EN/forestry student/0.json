It&#039;s important. I am trying very hard to improve my behaviour and reform, but it is difficult when players that display symptoms of mental illness run it down my lane.\n\nI don&#039;t want scripts. I don&#039;t want just dragging it off the screen, I just want the chat functionality to be removed for me, it is not helping my gameplay, nor is it helpful in reforming my behaviour. \n\nI am disgusted by some of the things I say, and I recognize that, which is why I am desperate to stop myself before I go into a toxic mindset again. \n\nJust because someone runs it down my lane and trolls doesn&#039;t mean I can call their parents a series of racial profanities and threaten violence. I have sent Riot a support ticket on my banned account, but they refused to do anything other then offer advice. \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-06-07T19:21:07.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You cant, aside from manually blocking chat.\n\nI have seen people say they have been punished for muting all or ignoring chat, but i am not sure if that is actually accurate - it makes sense, since someone who cant communicate is a huge liability to the team.\n\nIf you cant handle dealing with ~~idiot monkeys~~ other people, you should be playing single-player or PvE games.","replies":[{"poster":"Karunamon","date":"2018-06-08T14:59:35.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those people are full of it.
