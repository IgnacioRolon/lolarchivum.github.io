While I was playing a game yesterday LoL kicked me out of the game beacause something happened. The next day i went online and it gave me a 20 minute leave buster ban for 5 times. I've already went through one of them but I need the rest to go beacause I find it not fair that LoL kicked me out of a game and then banned me for leaving.

This is one reason why the system treats all disconnections equally and why modifications cannot be made to any penalties. The only way to get rid of the penalties is to play consistently without disconnecting.
