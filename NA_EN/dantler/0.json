After this I got stuck on the loading screen of buying it for about 20 mins and previous rp purchases took seconds so I that I decided to cancel it and try again. Without knowing this I had accidentally purchased two 35 rp bundles now adding up to 70. And yet again it was stuck on the loading screen forever and didn't load through. In the end my credit card was charged with the two purchases but my account was never rewarded any rp. Its been 6 hours now and nothings happening to my rp balance. I'm hoping that there's anyone who can help me out cause I would like to get my money back or at least receive my rp I purchased. Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-03T22:46:46.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Between the service incident that occurred shortly after 9:00pm PDT and the store getting hit hard with all the transactions due to the new content, RP purchases were acting a bit wonky.
