It would make a lot more money then the pc version. You can make it link to your league account. Would be awesome. If riot needs someone to take the lead on it hire me and I’ll make sure you have an app that is beautiful for TFT that makes lots of money.

When an adc misses a common minion in lane don’t rage quit. There are loads of other games with 100+ mill players on mobile that are more complicated then TFT. \nI never said it would be easy to develop. “The fact you think it is this easy shows how utterly unqualified you...” LOL so funny how into it people get on the internet. \nJust because I’m pooping before work I’ll explain myself. When I said “gg ez” I said it at the end of the post, it was less about how hard development was and more like an ending to the post. Like at the end of a league game in all chat ppl type “gg” or “gg ez”\nAnyways have a good day","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2019-07-01T22:46:57.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you drunk?
