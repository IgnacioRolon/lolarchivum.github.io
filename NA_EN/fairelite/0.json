I figured I would create my own thread and maybe, POSSIBLY, get some insight on this problem. This can be an issue alone, due to the fact that most of the threads are pre-new client.\n\nYesterday League was working great, no problems whatsoever. Today when I came home, I tried to open League (as admin as always) and the only thing that happened was the little League of Legends banner came up for all of about .7 seconds, disappeared, then nothing. I didn't receive any error messages at all.\n\nI've tried the resolution trick, I've tried deleting the launcher, I've tried deleting all of the possible files that I've read online to fix the problem, I've tried the Hextech Repair Tool and nothing has worked.\n\nSo, I decided that I should uninstall and redownload, and after downloading the launcher the same exact thing happens. I'm unable to even open the client to patch. \n\nI know that there was some maintenance earlier, but could that really be the problem? I've opened a ticket with Riot, but as we all know that could take a literal year to be replied to.\n\nAny suggestions or tips? Any and all advice would be SO greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairelite","date":"2017-10-04T22:36:52.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, now when I try to run as admin the window doesn't even come up asking for permission.","replies":[{"poster":"Fairelite","date":"2017-10-04T22:58:18.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T21:38:02.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maintenance wouldn't impact you from having the patcher launch.  The loop is that once you click the icon, your patcher needs to get permission to launch and then access the patching server before taking you to the login screen.  Running as admin is a good step because it does seem like some setting or anti-virus update is blocking game files from being read. \n\nI do recommend going through each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to rule out some more possibilities, and restart your PC as well in case something crashed in the background.,","replies":[{"poster":"Fairelite","date":"2017-10-04T22:29:37.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried everything in the permissions guide as well as restarting the computer (I did several times before posting) and still no luck. When I first attempted after this initial reboot the banner did stay up longer, along with the little silver bar that sometimes shows up beneath it. It stayed stuck there for a bit but went away all the same. Windows says \"Thank you for installing the latest version of Windows 10\" when I checked there. Nothing.\n\nThis is super frustrating. :\\","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-04T22:34:04.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, yeah, this whole thing sounds awful.  :(  Don't give up though, we'll get this figured out.
