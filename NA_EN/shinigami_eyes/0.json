Never have had any problems with running league of legends, or any game for that matter, with my current computer set up. Ever since the new client update I will dc (attempting to reconnect pop up for anywhere between 10 seconds to a minute and sometimes full disconnect) atleast once a game. Key word atleast. Basically every game is more than just once. I mean my last game i was literally in it for 30 seconds before the entire screen froze after an attempting to reconnect message popped up. I was in ranked so i hard reset my computer (power switch) and got back into the game way late, resulting in a loss in my placements. Before people ask, my wifi has not changed and is fine with internet and always has been with every game ive played including league. Even now in the games where I get the DCs i will have constant 30 ping and then ill just randomly not be able to move. My setup runs a constant 120+ fps but I cap 60. Currently have no problems running any other online games so I have only to conclude it is Riots doings. SO if you are a riot employee reading this, please fix ur shit, its killing me. In game and literally.\r\nSincerely,\r\nPissed of League of Legends Player","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-04-28T04:38:09.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty damned frustrating having to see that reconnect button pop up so much. One thing, in particular, stood out to me with all the issues you're running into. \n>  i will have constant 30 ping and then ill just randomly not be able to move\n\nTo me, this almost perfectly describes packet loss. Sometimes your ISP can send your connection along a pretty shitty route, which can cause parts of the data being sent to get lost along the way. When that happens you can start seeing all kinds of weird lag issues like rubberbanding or champions basically ignoring your commands. \n\nTake your last game logs that had troubles and toss it into our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743). Take a screenshot or post what it says here, and that will be able to tell us for sure if it's packet loss.","replies":[]}]}
