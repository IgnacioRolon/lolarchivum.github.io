What should I do to fix this? The popup reads: \"Patching failed and we're not sure why. Please restart the client to try patching again.\" Then, when I click the \"OKAY\" button, it reads \"There was a problem patching League of Legends. We'll restore a backup version and try updating again once you restart the patcher.\" It says that the Live Incidents that may have caused this are the Account transfers and Matchmaking Issues in Ranked. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-23T23:15:18.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It certainly sounds like your connection to the patching servers is pretty unstable, which could cause this type of issue.
