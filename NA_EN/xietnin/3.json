It does not happen every time, but it does happen quite often. This bug will continue to lock my cursor at a direction until the ping is made or cancelled. Once again, that process is:\r\n1. Hold G (default hotkey)\r\n2. Left click and drag cursor\r\n3. Cursor will change direction after going a short distance, and possibly accelerate in movement\r\nMy Operating System is Windows 7, and my mouse is a Razer Naga 2014. I have already filed a ticket and have had no such luck with the possible solutions.\r\nIf you have any suggestions, I will certainly be open to trying them.","replies":[]}
