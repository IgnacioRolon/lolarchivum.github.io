Like Saves?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Supports only get assists for people that get kills. This is very respectable and should certainly be rewarded. However, when a healer support or a shielding support saves a person with a skill from dying, shouldn&#039;t that be similar to countering the enemy&#039;s kill? Shouldn&#039;t that be rewarded in some manner? I bring this up because I feel like support is boring and the thanks of teammates is enough, but I feel like there should be some compensation for smarter play in this regard. Nothing too big, just like 50 gold and diminishing for each \"save\"(EDIT: diminishing for perhaps a 30 second time limit). This not only rewards supports, but teamwork, baiting, and overall smarter play. What do you think about this, community? Would you feel like playing League of Legends with an extra mechanic like this? How would this be a bad thing? I look forward to hearing your responses on this topic.","replies":[{"poster":"UberAffe","date":"2015-04-26T16:24:55.744+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with granting gold, there are too many edge cases for what should and shouldn't count as a save.\nHowever I do agree with tracking the statistics of saves because that should definitely be something that is taken into account for mmr in ranked.\nIt would make support main viable in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Xietnin","date":"2015-04-26T17:55:44.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UberAffe,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lIEoNtQv,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-26T16:24:55.744+0000)\n>\n> I disagree with granting gold, there are too many edge cases for what should and shouldn't count as a save.\n> However I do agree with tracking the statistics of saves because that should definitely be something that is taken into account for mmr in ranked.\n> It would make support main viable in low elo.\n\nYeah I was thinking about that in being abused. Being saved as a stat would make me pretty happy to play support, knowing how many kills I've denied to the enemy team =)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Meserion","date":"2015-04-26T16:12:33.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What hes asking for is some sort of acknowledgement that, that close save that pulled their teammates butt out of the fire was noticed. Some sort of stat - tracking. This I can approve of because often times it is the strategically brilliant maneuvers of your support or your jungler that scores the kill, the tower, or dragon; not the guy who got the kill.\n\nI agree, there should be a system in the game that tracks and scores players points based on support-centric moves; not only to encourage supports to make those plays but also to allow other players to determine what a good support is. The only problem is how does one go about tracking such things?","replies":[{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2015-05-02T21:59:28.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the very least, a damage prevented stat would be nice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"straight4free","date":"2015-04-26T16:06:11.556+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reward for this is the enemy team doesn't get gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Mint","date":"2015-04-26T16:54:27.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this. \n\nAnd you don't kill people for Gold, you do it so you can capitalize on the fact that they're dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Provengreil","date":"2015-05-02T22:08:13.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure, if you're silver 2 or higher. Support mains having issues getting above silver 5 (aka myself) could use some built in recognition, especially if it can be checked mid game.\n\nTo explain if you're unsure of what I mean:\nSay I'm Janna, and my jinx lane partner gets a double kill bot while there's a triple gank going on toplane, so nobody on their team could help the tower. Assume it's an appropriate point to actually take the tower, as well. Jinx starts to recall, I ping the crap out of the tower. she ignores it to get another item, probably tier 2 boots and longsword or something. in the meantime, janna can push a wave but not THAT fast. so nothing truly happens, because even though we gain a moderate edge over the lane opponents, we should be out of lane phase and looking at trading mid outer for bot outer in about 2 minutes with a dragon followup. instead we get more of jinx's questionable CSing and I have to find a way to set up the safest double kill of all time to get the tower down.\n\nHowever, had I had a numbers recognition somewhere, it'd be the support version of going 6/1 in a solo lane with a 44 CS advantage, becasue even in silver 5 people listen to that guy. So I ping the tower, she says \"this guy might be onto something\" and we just get a better game out of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xietnin","date":"2015-04-26T17:50:05.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Anyael,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=lIEoNtQv,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-26T16:06:11.556+0000)\n>\n> The reward for this is the enemy team doesn't get gold.\n\nI can certainly agree with that.
