I'm wondering is there a way to tell if your account has been through the cycle or can a rioter check my account? Thanks so much if you can help me {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-07T17:30:13.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try to recover the password for your PBE account using [this guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751904-Public-Beta-Environment-FAQ#h2q3).
