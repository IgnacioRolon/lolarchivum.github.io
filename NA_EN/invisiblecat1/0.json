Obviously as a new champion there are some issues that they will have to work with, like that shield and also the heal on his W, but at the same time he's not a champion that you can just spam abilities like {{champion:11}} or {{champion:86}}, there's a certain amount of skill that goes into playing Sylas well, and I think a lot of people don't understand that he's only a broken champion if you play him well, but he won't be as good if you can't, especially after he is balanced a little","replies":[]}]}
