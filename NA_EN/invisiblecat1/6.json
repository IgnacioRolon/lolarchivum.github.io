That way towers don't disappear in 5 seconds, ADCs don't get killed in 0.08 seconds, one hit doesn't chunk for half or more HP (eg. Gangplank) and people actually feel like they had a chance to play a strategical game, all at the cost of a somewhat longer game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ahristocats","date":"2017-02-08T11:35:31.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"split pushing is already inferior in this meta \n\nso no","replies":[]},{"poster":"FalconPawwwwnch","date":"2017-02-08T07:57:40.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody even splitpushes in competitive play lmao\n\nJax/Trynd/Nasus etc are all fuckin garbage tier","replies":[{"poster":"83241804DEL1","date":"2017-02-08T11:31:30.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is garbage..?\nI like him :c","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrDrBudd","date":"2017-02-07T20:21:23.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you want to destroy probably the one way to actually solo carry in low elo in this meta, is what youre telling me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IceKingChernobog","date":"2017-02-07T10:09:08.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game right now is already ridiculously snowbally, this sounds like a bad idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Death and Doom","date":"2017-02-07T05:53:21.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why? split pushing as a mechanic is pretty well-balanced and gives people a chance to come back when they r losing to a team-fight oriented team. learn how to play against instead of asking for nerfs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doozku","date":"2017-02-07T04:15:19.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Split pushing isn't even that strong.
