What changes can they POSSIBLY make to set things out as fair?\n\nNone.  They're going to raise the effective rank for premades or something... to make the numbers show them having 50% winrates overall.  That isn't balance.  That isn't fair.\n\nFair is all ten players being on the same footing at the start of the freaking game.  Either they are ALL premade 5v5 teams, and thus all have access to the same level of coordination... or they are ALL solo players, and are ALL dealing with the issues of solo queue.  No number fixes will make dynamic queue fair to everyone playing it.  Some players will just have an inherant advantage from the beginning and NOT because of skill or proper runes or champ select... but merely because they are playing with a group.  They're playing the \"right\" way.  \n\nDynamic Queue will NEVER be fair.  It will NEVER be reflection of skill.  The only way to make it fair, would be to take away what it is, and revert it to true solo queue.  Riot won't do this. And thus... none of the changes they have in mind will make me hate the mode any less.  They're just going to push numbers around until they can point to some impersonal computer data and say \"this is even on paper\" and call it settled.","replies":[]}]}]}
