If there's anything in AP itemisation it's an effect creep. The old S2 bulk standard AP build was something like {{item:3174}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3026}} , because in earlier seasons you actually needed defensive items. This was a super high damage build at the time, Athene's was 90 AP and Zhonya's was 100, you ended with over 600 AP from a 4 AP item build.\n\nIn season 3 this spiked even higher, Athene's was nerfed to 80, Zhonya's was buffed to 120 and GA fell out of favour in exchange for DFG. This was the absolute peak of AP damage output, no other build has ever even been close.\n\nSomething about these builds though, they're very simple. All of the passives and actives boil down to 'do more damage' or 'survive longer'. There's actually no utility in the most common and arguably best builds of the time.\n\nSince then there's been more utility on builds at the expense of damage. To say that AP damage has creeped is factually incorrect, the difference between now and season 3 is that now dedicated burst mages can blow you up in a fraction of a second, in season 3 any mage could. You could be blown up by champions like Karthus and Sona utilising DFG in season 3.\n\nThe only class that has truly damage creeped in LoL is ADCs, the reason why is that Riot gave them a premium damage item that doubles as a perfect defensive item. There is no tradeoff to going full offence on an ADC. I find it funny that you pick on Zhonya's, Rylai's and Abyssal for this when they all make tradeoffs after the Rylai's nerf yet you completely fail to look at Mercurial Scimitar, which is the epitome of an offence/defence hybrid item that does everything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"black adc 2k17","date":"2016-12-09T14:22:14.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Lul, people think blue buff was the important buff nerf.
