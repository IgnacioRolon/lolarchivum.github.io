This gives her more burst, which is something the ult changes already did. Now she can easily 100-0 squishies without even the use of her ult at 20 minutes, and with black clear, which (imo) is core, can easily get all stacks and 100-0 tanks at a little slower speed.\nToo much burst!!!\nAnd for all of you who will say that I am just salty, Riven is my second most played champion. ~~dirty riven main~~","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-08T20:05:45.301+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fast combo being made a lot easier was an unintended result of the autoattack system change, and Riot themselves said they were looking into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2016-10-08T20:27:53.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nep2une,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=9Neq3oEA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-08T20:05:45.301+0000)\n>\n> The fast combo being made a lot easier was an unintended result of the autoattack system change, and Riot themselves said they were looking into it.\n\nI would say just rework her into a more sustainable kit, but when I think of the Riven mains who have poured so much blood and sweat and tears into mastering their champion, the suggestion dies in my throat","replies":[{"poster":"Astôlfo","date":"2016-10-08T20:40:32.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
