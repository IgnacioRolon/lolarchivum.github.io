I personally am getting sick of the sensitivity from every single Liberal player out there and yes political views do play into playing league more then you think.\r\n\r\nlook i don&#039;t care what political party anyone is from, but when someone tries to tell me im being one way or another and i am being far from it then we have a problem, so what if i get a bit annoyed with players who refuse to listen to the facts and actually listen to someone trying to help them.\r\n\r\nSo what if i have to call someone an idiot because i just told them to not go into that fight when they are new or they are a little behind. Players that i call idiots which are 90% of anyone who started playing in season 4 onward and yes that is when alot of them started, are just that idiots, they dont listen and i shouldnt have to continue to deal with it since they dont have the skill, the desire to learn or the brain capacity to Drop the liberal BS and just play a game with common sense.\r\n\r\nLook i know we have all been there, but when you have every player in the world afraid to say something because you coddle those idiots that we all hate but are to afraid to say something to.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about this but if i were to actually sit down with riot and talk with them they would see this is how i and many others normally talk and they would be forced to change their policies and trust me they need to be changed.\r\n\r\nI miss how everything was perfect in season 3, the matchmaking the way you could talk with players no matter how annoyed you got and nothing, the only thing that was a big no no back then was trolling and cheating.

Wake up Riot and stop caring about things that are not trolling and cheating those are the 2 things you should be worried about not what players say to each other. \r\n\r\nAll i got to say about that is Riot must be full of fools to care about every little word that is typed if they spent those resources they spend of trying to ban players like me for literally nothing and actually using them to improve things about the game or better security then maybe the majority of the player base would be whining about certain things that need balancing or optimization issues or bots in every pvp match or whatever is is that you are ignoring.","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-02-18T09:27:21.409+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"You signed away parts of your free speech when you agreed to their written terms.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-18T17:05:16.137+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually, the free speech amendment only protects you from the government anyway.

They have the logs to prove it.   \n> \n> All i got to say about that is Riot must be full of fools to care about every little word that is typed if they spent those resources they spend of trying to ban players like me for literally nothing and actually using them to improve things about the game or better security then maybe the majority of the player base would be whining about certain things that need balancing or optimization issues or bots in every pvp match or whatever is is that you are ignoring.\n\nPerhaps you should volunteer for bot detection duties?","replies":[{"poster":"GodJormungandr","date":"2017-02-22T01:20:09.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TyrekGoldenspear","date":"2017-02-22T01:23:10.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How are they spamming?

So I will take it seriously and respond with my thoughts in details as well.\n\n**So first of all, let's talk about freedom of speech and its limitations. **\n\nFreedom of a speech as a constitutional right only applies to the government's actions against citizens, but let's just expand its principles as our guideline. The free speech is the idea that everyone has the right to express their political opinion without retaliation. It is designed to have an environment for discussion, regardless your agree with the others or not.\n\nHowever, it has its limitations. Check here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions\n\nYou cannot incite violent actions, provide false information, defamation, etc.\n\nThe related case here, is \"Fighting words and offensive speech\", because these words are known to either incite violence or inflict emotional stress, and thus not protected under the free speech.\n\nCalling others \"idiots\" for bad performance does not add to the fact they are performing bad, but its genuine intention is to make others feel bad. It does not help them improve or change the phase of the game. \"Idiots\" is broader and more severe than \"bad player\", and thus calling others \"idiots\" base on game performance is not considered factual either. Calling a bad player \"you're bad\" is factual, but without explaining why they are bad, or how they can improve, the main purpose of it is still insulting.\n\nEveryone has different resistance to offensive speech, thus we have the different opinions on P.C. culture. I, as a part of the liberals, am more sensitive to insults than conservatives (maybe?). Some people are more okay with them, and sometimes enjoy it as a culture. Some people find plain statements like \"your build is bad for your champ\" offensive too. \n\nYou can argue people should grow some guts and be more resistant to offensive languages; but we can also argue you should grow some heart and think about the more sensitives groups. In the end it doesn't matter because they are about feelings, and it all comes down to how many people think the same.\n\nHere's the thing, the majorities make the rules. Or in this case, Riot does based on the company's profit. Riot lose sensitive players if they don't stop people flaming, so a majority of sensitive players in the game means flaming is a bannable offensive. Based on the number of downvotes, you should probably figure out more players in this game care about this. \n\nIf you genuinely think you are helping with the players improve, just remember **wording matters**.  If you give advise by blaming, chances are people will try to nitpick your mistakes  and question your qualification as well (it's in our nature, we don't take blames from strangers with no authorities over us easily). And since people are more blind to their mistakes, chances are you've got something to be blamed too. So the blame game begins and it never gets anywhere. \n\nJust take a moment to think do you find me annoying by telling you what to do? You would be more annoyed if I do so in an insulting way.\n\nIf you like to be able to argue responsibility and enjoys slight insulting, you can try to do so with premades that also find it acceptable. But if you want to argue with the majority that should be an acceptable behavior generally, you probably won't find much luck. \n\nIn the end, how much toxicity is acceptable is not factual argument, it's a \"feelings\" argument. There's no truth behind it, just how many people think the same way. \n\nIn terms of whether Riot is lying about the toxic data, there's no way we can prove because Riot has exclusive access to those data; and arguments based on your personally experience doesn't tell the big picture of whole player base. I can argue my games doesn't have too much toxicity. I ran into mild insults 1 in 15 to 20 games, and really bad arguments in about 50 to 100 games. But it doesn't show the game isn't toxic either. \n\nIn terms of why Riot doesn't focus on punishing trolling and feeding, it's because they are really hard to catch. (I can tell as a programmer myself). \n\nWell I probably ended up sounding condescending again *sigh*. I am not sure if you still want to read the comments since you haven't replied to anyone, but I know I generally don't like reading people criticizing me. But if you want to talk it all out of you, I'm happy with more chatting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prandine","date":"2017-02-18T20:53:37.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From [Ulanopo's Knowledge Base](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4086541&page=1#post43465469): \n\n>**\"Freedom of Speech!!!!!\"**\n\n>Doesn't apply. No really. If we're talking about American law, the First Amendment only applies to the government making laws that prohibit speech and, even then, freedom of speech isn't absolute. For example, you can't incite a riot, plan to kill the president or yell fire in a crowded theater.\n\n>Also, there's nothing in the First Amendment that protects you from the consequences of your speech. People are fired all the time for making derogatory comments about their employer. My workplace, for example, has a social media policy that says that I can be terminated for badmouthing the company. They don't ask for passwords and access as some companies have been known to do, but it wouldn't be all that difficult to find me on the internet, knowing my real name, phone number and address.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ada Wong","date":"2017-02-21T07:33:26.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You know whats awful having to /mute all as soon as a game starts...\n\nHave 2-3 players on your same team flat out trolling person who is playing X Role refusing to fill role, and a jungler intentionally throwing off lane phase meh...\n\nAlso the only way you would actually close down Riot Games as a company and create massive problems with parents letting their kids play League and such would be to have hundreds of thousands of active users make accounts solely for the purpose to get banned and play Multi Player games and start just cursing everyone being toxic in very adult ways until the account gets banned and repeat over and all over all day long Riot would just play whack-a-mole and they generally don't care about money because they make enough money LOL...\n\n**As for Sportsmanlike** It's a flat out joke unless you are doing pre-made teams Good Luck doesn't matter what MOBA it is everyone does their own thing every game on League, DOTA 2, Over Watch has recently became this way you will get many many losses Unless doing pre-made all around.","replies":[]}]}
