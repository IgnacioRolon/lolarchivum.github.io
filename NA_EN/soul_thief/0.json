I don't flame in game, at least after the honor update, yet I still remain at level 3. My friends always joke about reporting me after every game, for nothing, just to troll me. If they are, would that effect it, even if for no reason? I've gotten 4 honors in one game multiple times, but still can't get a higher level. Any ideas why?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-08T23:40:44.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that would increase the rate of leveling up would be getting honors, otherwise it's just time.  Unless you got a penalty as a result, getting reported is not going to make a difference- if it had you would have dropped to Honor 0.  Also, tell your friends to stop troll reporting because it will cause their reports to lose weight in the future.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Soul Thief","date":"2017-09-10T02:48:02.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info, and I'll tell them :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mustyie","date":"2018-03-07T00:01:50.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem, i was honor level 5 last season but i'm stuck at level 2, idk why :-;\nNow my friend is level 3 even though i play more matches than him and get more honors than him, i still stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\nˢᵒʳʳʸ ᶠᵒʳ ᵐʸ ᵇᵃᵈ ᵉᴺᵍᴸᵃᴺᵈ.","replies":[]}]}
