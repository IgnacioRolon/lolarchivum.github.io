It takes me about 2 days to level up, and when I do level up, I&#039;ve gotten about 1000 blue essence shards per champion capsule. Or I would have if I didn&#039;t use some BE to buy Syndra at about a third of her actual cost.\r\n\r\nSo far, I&#039;m actually pretty happy with how things went. My experience doesn&#039;t speak for everyone, and maybe I just got lucky. But, the system is new, and numbers can still be tweaked, but overall, I think it is pretty good.","replies":[]}
