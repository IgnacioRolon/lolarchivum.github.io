My boss told me she&#039;d cry if I cut my hair, so I&#039;m excited to see that.\r\n\r\nIt was kind of a random decision. I wasn&#039;t really thinking of cutting my hair any time soon, then today at work I was just thinking &quot;Hmmm I should donate my hair&quot; and just went and did it after work. Nobody knows yet, and I&#039;m going out with my family tomorrow night, so I&#039;m excited to see their reactions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here are some pictures so you can see:\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter it was cut off next to a ruler:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1wvoNG5.jpg\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4XfJlSt.jpg\r\n\r\nAll tied up in ponytails:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AMeOYA2.jpg\r\n\r\nTrying to be attractive with short hair:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PEHyrwF.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for listening to my story GD! I know I&#039;m not a very good story teller!","replies":[]}
