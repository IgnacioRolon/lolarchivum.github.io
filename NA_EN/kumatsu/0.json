I'm a sensible enough person to understand the correct actions for these situations. You're not wrong in any of what you said; however, that implies that I care for the person behind the computer.\n\n2. I care little for this game, so getting a ban doesn't affect me what-so-ever, it'll just give me a better reason to play another account from bronze to diamond or relatively close or just quit league entirely and focus on the other games I enjoy more-so.\n\n3. I just want to play without other people having a share of their thoughts in the cauldron of good v. bad that is this game. I don't care if someone's bad at the game, good at the game, smurfing, or intentionally feeding-- I care that the person is playing. Ergo, I don't care about their thoughts or motives until it just bothers the shit out of me.\n\n4. I've played well over 10,000 games since season 1 by now, and that's just a low estimate. I understand how the mute functions work, and if I had it my way, I would've pressed the mute button at least 90,000 times, not including mute ping/emotes being recently added. That's too much to ask for and I hope you can reason with me on that logic.\n\n5. I should have the ability to choose to communicate with my team, be it in text, ping, or emote and I should have the ability to hear all such actions. Riot has shown that they believe in this by allowing us mutes, so why not have a feature that disables/enables ALL communication?\n5.a. A certain reply from a Rioter would likely go along the scheme of \"We encourage conversation as it's a fundamental process of a battle-arena style game such as this.\"\n5.b. To which I reply, then this isn't my type of game. I've played it since it's beginning, and somewhat before that with DOTA Allstars. I know how people can behave, how people react, what advantages and disavantages communication may have in this game-- and I've weighed it all for a very long time. I don't want to communicate or interact with people on my team or the enemy, I just want to play and use my mechanics without having the mental fitness that is League of Legends.\n\n6. Implying I'll 'learn from my behaviors during the ban' will first assume that I want to change, or that I see a change will benefit me. No one person changes themselves without seeing a benefit of it (Alcoholics Anonymous to get a better life away from addiction; Rehab to separate fully from a drug; breaking up from a relationship to see if you can get someone better suited for you).\n6.a. I will not 'learn from my behaviors during the ban' because I:\n- I see other games as a better alternative.\n- Will not mind other peoples sensitive or insensitive remarks.\n- Will not bow to insensitivity (as many players have full-well shown).\n- Am generally fed-up with the community as a whole and would rather just play the game than interact.\n- Will not 'work' on providing a better experience to other players when that same respect is never given in return.\nI understand how hypocritical that last statement is, but I'm just one person. I cannot change everyone's demeanor, nor should I or anyone else. The state of the game has gotten more toxic over the years, and I may not be helping the cause. \n\nI'd help the cause solely by not including myself in it at all, whether it be by removing the ability to have any communications/pings/emotes or being banned. Either way I'm completely fine with and accepting of it.\n\nI just wish I didn't have to click 22 buttons to mute text, pings, and emotes each game. I did it for some-time and it got better, but over time that got tedious.\n\nWhenever I got my chat-restrictions, I would immediately use up every allotted message, just to remove one variable from my returned behavior in the game.\n\nI'm not ignorant to the reports on my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Hotarµ","date":"2018-12-29T00:55:21.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">1 - however, that implies that I care for the person behind the computer.\n\n That's sad. Just because they're behind a screen doesn't mean they aren't a person. \n\n>2 - I care little for this game, so getting a ban doesn't affect me what-so-ever, it'll just give me a better reason to play another account from bronze to diamond or relatively close or just quit league entirely and focus on the other games I enjoy more-so.\n\n Okay.\n\n>3 - I just want to play without other people having a share of their thoughts in the cauldron of good v. bad that is this game.\n\n You don't have to listen to people, you don't even have to see their messages.

That's too much to ask for and I hope you can reason with me on that logic.\n\n I would be more understanding if it were actually an outlandish thing to do. As far as I know, the '/mute all' command has been around since the beginning of the game (or at the very least since the beginning of season 4) and takes a few seconds at most to type. Even if you didn't want to do all of that, none of your actions are justifiable because you can ignore your teammates entirely and never get punished.\n\n>5 - I should have the ability to choose to communicate with my team, be it in text, ping, or emote and I should have the ability to hear all such actions. \n\n> ...so why not have a feature that disables/enables ALL communication? \n\n> I just want to play and use my mechanics without having the mental fitness that is League of Legends.\n\n You _do_ have the ability to communicate or disregard your teammates entirely, and you do have a solution to disable communication. The reason it wasn't officially added is because most people just don't need that option. Self control and/or moving the chat box off the screen is enough for the majority of players. \n\n> 6 - Implying I'll 'learn from my behaviors during the ban' will first assume that I want to change, or that I see a change will benefit me.\n\n If you don't want to change, that's on you. Keep acting the way you act now and it'll just net you a permaban. _That's_ the change that will benefit you, being a less toxic player who doesn't contribute to the very problem you're complaining about right now.\n\n>Will not mind other peoples sensitive or insensitive remarks.\n>Will not bow to insensitivity (as many players have full-well shown).\n\n These two statements are contradictory. If you truly don't care about what other people have to say, you wouldn't have gotten to the point you're at now of being on a 2 week ban. \n\nYou aren't _bowing_ to anything. Nobody will think any less of you as a person for muting someone or trying to make an effort to stay positive. What you see as 'bowing' **in actuality** is just being a mature person who doesn't let a jerk on a video game get to them. \n\nEven now, I don't think any less of you for struggling with this issue. Tons of players are overly aggressive and toxic to the point that it can deter you from what you've once enjoyed entirely. \n\nJust keep your head up. \n\n\n> Am generally fed-up with the community as a whole and would rather just play the game than interact.\n\n Okay, you can do that. I'm not trying to (and can't) force you to change if you don't want to. Muting your teammates will limit your communication and possibly make your gameplay results suffer, but if it's the only way you can cope with toxicity, then feel free to do so. \n\n\n> Will not 'work' on providing a better experience to other players when that same respect is never given in return.\n\n This attitude directly contributes to the problem you're facing right now. People are toxic to you, so you're toxic to them. That perpetuates the cycle of negativity _and_ puts your account at risk. \n\n Being the bigger person shows that you can not only handle yourself, but that you're making an effort to better the League community. Will it change overnight? No, but if everyone maintains the same mindset that you have right now we'll never get anywhere.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2019-01-03T00:41:04.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a script you can run, the instructions can be found on a forum post (just Google lol disable enter key).\n\nHowever, all that does is physically stop you from being able to type in game.
