Almost every game I play there is someone on the other team level 30 and ranked while my whole team is level 8-20&#039;s and naturally, they go godlike legendary and 1 shot everyone in a 20 minute stomp. They&#039;re always playing their mains and tryharding too. So fun! And dont you dare get frustrated or upset by this bullshit or you&#039;ll get banned by their awesome behavioral system! I got pissed at a level 30 diamond Talon and Level 30 Plat Udyr who was on the other team, raping my entire team of pre-30&#039;s, BM&#039;ing, dancing and calling us noobs in chat. I told them off basically after causing our Poppy to quit and got reported by him and his duo buddy.
