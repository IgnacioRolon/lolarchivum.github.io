I occasionally arrange pieces for this site with Finale PrintMusic, a gift from my mom that I&#039;m very grateful for.  I was wondering a few things: A) As far as legality issues are concerned, how acceptable is it for me to arrange some of the awesome League of Legends soundtrack?  B) Regardless of legality, how COMFORTABLE is Riot with the idea of their music being arranged?  C) Can I get an internship with riot&#039;s music people?  Sounds like they all have a slammin&#039; time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ed the Conqueror","date":"2016-01-24T06:39:55.150+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Emcee Mikey!\n\nI'm going to try to answer your questions the best I can.\n\n**TL;DR - go for it!**\n\n_A) As far as legality issues are concerned, how acceptable is it for me to arrange some of the awesome League of Legends soundtrack? _\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty certain you're in the clear. If you are going to release the recording of those arrangements (= profit from them, uploading a video to YT probably doesn't count), then I assume you'd need a mechanical license (that's what you typically need to release a cover).\n_\nB) Regardless of legality, how COMFORTABLE is Riot with the idea of their music being arranged?_\n\nSuper comfortable! Go for it! We feel truly elated when our players put time and effort into performing/arranging/covering our stuff.\n_\nC) Can I get an internship with riot's music people? Sounds like they all have a slammin' time._\n\nAs far as I know, we are not planning on having an intern in the near future.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nThanks for playing!\n\nEd the Conqueror","replies":[{"poster":"Emcee Mikey","date":"2016-01-27T07:18:49.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, that's awesome!
