Since you're both playing on the same computer, it narrows the problem down a little. We can confirm that you're on the same network with the same computer hardware. However, the background applications you're running may differ--you might be running more stuff or different applications in the background that are eating up your system resources. On top of that, it's possible that your in-game settings could be different and demand more from your system while playing the game.\n\nIt might be a good idea to see what's different between you and your friend's experience outside the game and then once you're in-game (I recommend a Custom Game). It might be because the usage of different VOIPs, you guys might be using different music streaming services or programs. Lastly, check your in-game settings to see if anything is different when you two play (might be less likely if you use the same Windows user account).\n\nIf you're still stumped after doing all of that, I recommend contacting us through the [Support Site](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and my colleagues will be happy to look into this issue further.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2015-10-06T01:49:05.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apologies for messaging you here but can we get some insight on the high pings, ping spikes and packet loss that has been happening since 5.18?\n\nY'all recently moved us to Chicago servers for a more stable and reliable connection to the game and so far it hasn't been happening.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ultra Animal","date":"2015-10-06T04:53:29.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=allmynamesgotsto,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=L61mw9ye,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-05T19:23:06.620+0000)\n>\n> why is it that my friend plays league with 36 fps every game, but when i play (on the same computer) im always stuck between 3 and 17 fps? anyone wanna clarify why this happens?\n\nWhat do you play on? FPS would rely on PC hardware, i'd go to \"**canurunit.com**\" and check if you meet requirements. That or your monitor may have problems\n\nDo you have trouble with other pc games with relatively the same requirements for league?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Budupops","date":"2015-10-06T03:11:11.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it got so bad for me it completely disconnected.","replies":[]}]}
