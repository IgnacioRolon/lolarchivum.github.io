I haven't played in a year. I tried logging in today and it says my account was banned. It said to check my email for notification. Well there was no notice. So I logged in here to see if I could find something. When I went to manage account I noticed a very strange email address associated with my account.

Anything I can do?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-04T21:48:03.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to worry yet!
