But the keyword here is \"team\", as in, overall they are good. We still have that one kid who just doesn't understand what the hell is going on. And that person is usually **playing support**.\r\n\r\nNow maybe it's because I play a crap ton of ADC, and so I constantly see firsthand just how bad they really are, and I don't notice all the mistakes mid, jungle and top are making as well. But let me just tell you what I experience in probably 70% of my games when I play ADC in Silver 4:\r\n\r\n* **They barely ward.** I know saying that is controversial because \"it's everyone's job to ward\" but I don't think it's too much to ask. You handle the vision so I can focus on beating their ADC in CS. If I have to constantly back and buy wards myself because the entire bot lane is in darkness because you decided to rush a Deathcap instead of Sightstone, then I'm falling behind.\r\n* **They have horrible reaction time.** I've been playing a lot of Vayne. It should be common sense that when the enemy is standing near a wall, your Vayne is about to go into attack mode, but no. When I Condemn someone into a wall, my support is standing way behind me doing nothing and by the time they realize the enemy is stunned it's too late for them to follow up. On the topic of standing behind me:\r\n* **They have horrible positioning.** They almost never stand in the bush. They are rarely in range to follow up when you're playing an aggressive ADC like Lucian. They never body block or stand on top of you to make it hard for the enemies to right click/land skill shots on you. And when fights break out, their immediate response is to run, like, always. If the enemy initiates, it never occurs to my support to attempt to fight back and turn things around. They just go into complete panic mode and make a run for our turret, leaving me to die and it's insanely frustrating.\r\n* **For some reason, my support always picks one of the worst supports in the game.** I'm being completely honest here: I can't recall a time where I had a Morgana support when I was the ADC. I don't know why or how but I NEVER get to play with a Morgana, who I pretty much consider to be the best support right now based on my experience. Like, if Morgana is picked, she is always on the enemy team and then the endless Dark Bindings and Black Shields... please. Meanwhile, my support instalocks Taric, and it's true what they say about him: he's truly outrageous. The best part is when you get a Taric that doesn't even bother to heal you - those Tarics are the most fun to play with... sigh. Even if I do get a more decent support like Blitz, my Blitz usually misses 1 out of every 6 or 7 hooks, so that doesn't help much either.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't even main support. A lot of the people I see making these mistakes type \"support pref\" in the chat. How do you prefer support when you make these types of mistakes? You don't ward, you don't peel, you don't even know which supports in the game are the most optimal, but you prefer to play that role? Come on guys. My favorite roles are jungle and ADC, but jungling is a headache because everyone expects you to win their lane for them, and ADC is a headache because if your support plays the way I just described your chances of winning bottom are pretty much gone unless the enemies do something really stupid and start going on tilt/arguing. \r\n\r\nI always wondered why people would main such a low impact lane like top, and now I see why. Because when you're top, you don't have to put up with a garbage support for the first 15 minutes of the game, and no one blames you when thinks go wrong. I finally figured it out. I should just start playing top, that'd be the end of all my problems.","replies":[]}
