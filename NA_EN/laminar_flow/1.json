The animation uses the stretch effect on his hat to make it fall with him. This stretching effect is normally not visible on other animations in the game (1-2 frames), however, this stretching lasts around 3-4 frames. Note: this is not an issue in his other skins because his hat becomes detached from his head.\r\n\r\nYou can view the individual frames here or watch the video: [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/C78i3)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. Play Gnar\r\n2. Throw Q\r\n3. Watch as his adorable hat becomes silly puddy\r\n\r\n I understand this might be a bit knit-picky but it is causing me not to enjoy this absolutely adorable skin as much.\r\nI hope something can be done to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-13T04:32:17.684+0000","up_votes":22,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Laminar Flow,\n\nThanks for the report!
