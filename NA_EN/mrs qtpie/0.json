The mod told me that it should be posted in the rant section; not the gameplay section. Why not? Couldn't it fit into both? If you go to the rant section, people can't thumbs up or thumbs down your posts. Does Riot not want rants about gameplay to receive shows of support or something? XD\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/3ErqAdtq/d/mlsvZ3Gy\n\nThis was the post in question if anyone cares ^\n\nModeratior to me: \"As the Gameplay sub-board is for content pertaining to gameplay topics, such as items, champions, gamemodes, and general gameplay balance, we found that your post did not meet these guidelines. While we did have to remove your original post, we encourage you to re-post your content in a more appropriate sub-board; in this case, we recommend the Rant sub-board.\"","replies":[]}
