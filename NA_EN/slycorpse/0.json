I'm angry. 6 days ago someone hacked my account and wasted all my RP-boohoo. that's not what has me upset. what has me absolutely FURIOUS is that just TODAY i got a response from rito about the ticket i put in 6 days ago, and what that response actually was. so, in my ticket, i explained what happened, and ended it with declaring that im going to now change my password to prevent any more damage. Today i get a response (clearly cut and paste) that is instructions on how to recover my account. now, i don't remember stating that my account needed retrieving. since my declaration of intending a password change, i havnt added any more info to indicate an escalation of needs or problems. my request was to return my RP and erase any other damage done to my account during a VERY specific time frame- NOT to help me recover it. So, i went ahead and responded to rito about the fact that i didnt need help recovering my account and how they should probably read the narrative of tickets. Then i tried to log in and play...as is my chosen form of making the world go away, only to find that NOW....6 days later...my account is frozen. NOTE, there was NO explanation in their response that they were freezing the account or taking any other action for that matter. There was nothing in the response addressing my complaint or request in ANY way other than - give us loads of ridiculous information that no sane person would ever bother recording to recover your account. my question...HOW, IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM, IS THIS CONSIDERED SUPPORT?!?!?!?!?!?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-09-23T16:59:12.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it looks like the specialist was requesting information to verify ownership of the account.  Even though you requested reparations, verifying that you are the owner of the account and thwarting unauthorized users are the first step towards that.  There are moments when an unauthorized party tries to take over an account, even at the same time that the actual owner is trying to regain access.  Your account had suspicious activity, and it looks to have been locked to secure it and prevent further damages.  The specialist will continue assisting you, but you will need to follow up with the requests.  I've reached out to your specialist personally, and he'll be happy to help and clarify any questions you have in your ticket!","replies":[{"poster":"Shinx","date":"2016-09-23T18:27:23.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Porocles would you mind looking into my thread Q_Q you seem to be of more help than the last admin that helped me.
