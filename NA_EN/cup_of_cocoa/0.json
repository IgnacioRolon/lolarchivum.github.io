Since focusing the camera on a champion creates an outline (blue or red depending on which team they are on) around them, I was wondering, is there a way to remove that outline without removing the focus?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-29T04:50:35.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly there's not a way for you to disable that outline when you have a champion selected.
