Something that has bugged me though is that Locket is taken on non tanks, like sorraka.  It makes me cringe a bit that the item is so effective with shield boosting that champs will weaken their kit to take it.\n\nI like the idea of applying damage reduction because it doesn’t connect to shield boosting. Perhaps just use that without the shield?

Rather than just a pure shield, it's now a shield with less value but more value vs AoE.\n\nI think it's a good change. Locket is extremely powerful at the moment, and rather than nerfing it to a state where it feels bad, they instead nerfed its generalist applications and buffed its niche, which is protecting your whole team (which, naturally, AoE affects your whole team the most).\n\nWhile you may not like that the item is changing, overall changing items from generalist application to more niche'd use diversifies items more and adds more meaningful choice to their purchases.\n\nI'm sure you're probably concerned for what this means for mages. Don't worry too much about it. Because since the power is shifting to AoE mitigation that means that single target damage (Assassins, Marksmen, anyone else with single target stuff) will more reliably be able to execute their targets even through the Locket shield, which I believe is the goal of this change.\n\nWhile yes even Assassins have AoE abilities, the majority of their damage is going to come from single target spells, which will deplete the shield faster and make their AoE abilities still deal near full damage most of the time.\n\n50% may be overstepping it a bit on the niche side though, a simple 20%-30% would suffice.","replies":[{"poster":"Champion Skin","date":"2018-03-21T21:29:17.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:91}} Q + R AoE\n{{champion:238}} Q + E AoE\n{{champion:105}} E + R AoE\n{{champion:131}} Q + W AoE\n\nAssassins certainly do have a decent amount of AoE damage and Zed is especially likely to get screwed as his only source of single target damage are his Auto attacks and his ult (delayed) meaning that he will likely have to try and get through the shield with AoE damage\n\n> 50% may be overstepping it a bit on the niche side though, a simple 20%-30% would suffice.\n\nWell lets look at the numbers\n\n> shield value lowered from[38 (+22 per level)] to [30 (+10 per level)]\n> bonus health lowered from [2% ~ 36%] to [10% ~ 20%]\n\nCurrently it is [38 (+22 per level)]  + [2% ~ 36%] bonus health \nWith the change it would be [30 (+10 per level)]  + [10% ~ 20%] bonus health and if only taking AoE damage it would be [60 (+20 per level)]  + [20% ~ 40%] bonus health (the Damage reduction only lasts while the shield holds so it basically only increased the damage the shield can take from AoE damage)\n\nSo in other words when ONLY against AoE damage the shield takes about as much damage\nCurrent [38 (+22 per level)]  + [36%] bonus health VS New [60 (+20 per level)]  + [40%] bonus health\n\nSo the new locket only gains 4 bonus shield every 100 bonus health against AoE damage in return for being much weaker against single target damage","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2018-03-21T07:09:47.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"i used it once, in the middle of my team, I HAD NO IDEA WHO IT AFFECTED, HOW MUCH IT DID, OR WHEN IT ENDED,","replies":[{"poster":"flibitydoo","date":"2018-03-21T16:53:06.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"what's really stupid about {{item:3107}} and {{item:3190}} is that at no point during the game, can you buy this item (or look at it in the shop) and _actually see the **value** of healing or shielding_ you are going to get.
