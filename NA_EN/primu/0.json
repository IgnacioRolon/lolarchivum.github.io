Sometimes it seemed to be due to placing wards or when a champion would use an ability but other times, nothing would be happening on my current view and I would still get frame drops. I lose trades and miss abilities due to these random frame drops. My GPU drivers are updated. \r\n\r\nI tried re-downloading league to see if the re-installation would fix the problem. The first time the client was open and I played games, I would get no frame drops. However, all games after I closed and reopened the client, I would get random frame drops. \r\n\r\nI attempted this \"fix\" twice over a 1 week period and I faced similar results. I would receive 0 frame drops throughout the games where I just opened the client after re-installation. I would receive random frame drops for every game in every subsequent client after the first client.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-17T23:56:42.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems that your game files is rendering the match properly, which would cause you to have fps issues like this.
