Im really sorry this is very long-winded but please bear with me.\r\n\r\n\"Well you could get a worse champion\" -\r\n\r\nIf you lost the champion you rolled it would make sense but starting with {{champion:32}} , into {{champion:77}}  into {{champion:60}} .  Still leaves you with {{champion:32}}  as your strongest pick.  There is only an advantage to rerolls.  There is literally no disadvtange so this arguement I keep hearing being brought up is absolutely bogus.  What if the order were to be {{champion:77}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:32}} ?  You would need the pass to get your \"good\" champion\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's another example, lets say you get {{champion:105}} .  What is stopping you from trading fizz to your friend or hitting roll and insta clicking fizz back in the pool and rolling a total of 2 champions if you will ALWAYS have 2 extra rolls? \r\n\r\nIf your 3 (extremely unlikely but for the sake of arguement) rolls are {{champion:105}} {{champion:86}}  {{champion:238}} Everyone on your team takes advantage of you spending money.\r\n\r\nIf one team gets to choose from 10 random champs\r\nAnd one team gets to choose from 15 random champs\r\n\r\nI wonder who wins\r\n\r\nI rest my case.\r\n\r\nClosing statement:  Look at how they took URF with bans and hard bans, where yeah, a lot of the same 30ish champs were played but most people knew exactly what they were getting into every game and turned it into ARURF where the game is won in champ select because we got {{champion:60}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:48}}.  NOBODY WANTS TO PLAY THESE  they are ENTIRELY OUTCLASSED by and not fun against {{champion:99}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:161}}{{champion:238}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:24}}{{champion:110}} .\r\n AND THEN THEY TURN TO P2W on the whats supposed to be a crazy, fun, stressfree, lighthearted gamemode because they know deep deep down that going 1/13 as {{champion:77}}  wasnt your decision and you're not really having a whole lotta fun.

You can use the same arguments for and against it. It's a better chance of success that may not always pan out. Would it have been more understandable with a lower value, like +1% crit chance? Those +1% crit chance runes occasionally won lanes.\n\nArguing that it's a small competitive advantage - which you are doing when you repeat \"it's only 0.6%\" - is substantively different from arguing that it's not a competitive advantage.\n\nIt's not okay because it provides a competitive advantage in a PvP game, even a small advantage.\n\nPeople aren't dumb for wanting an advantage. They're kind of unethical for buying it, but not nearly as Riot is being for offering it.\n\nThe maximum number of rerolls is two, but someone with an event pass isn't going to have zero rerolls for a match. That's the whole purpose behind this pass: _more rerolls_. That's what it does. And, once more, you're arguing that it's a _small_ competitive advantage to get more chances than other players do at turning a terrible URF champ into a great one, or even merely a better one.\n\nRiot is testing the waters. If people buy this thing (and they are) and most of the playerbase says things like \"it's not a competitive advantage because it's either zero or one extra rerolls which is just a chance at a better champ,\" do you really think they're not going to push it? P2W is a _gold mine_ that no company could ignore if it ever became a viable revenue strategy. As long as it's working, Riot will expand it. They're under enormous pressure to turn their shrinking business back into a growing one. Maybe the next time we see a pass like this, it'll increase the reroll cap to 3 or something. Baby steps.\n\nThe thing about the \"definition\" of P2W is that each person has a different \"line in the sand\" where they think it's no longer okay. Some people don't see any \"pay to win\" until paying guarantees winning and not paying guarantees losing. Others (such as myself) see even the slightest impingement of cash on gameplay as the introduction of P2W. For example, when WoW introduced its first non-service (e.g. name change) microtransaction, the Celestial Steed, I saw that as P2W. Someone who bought that mount no longer had to spend gold on any level of ground or flying mounts for any character on the account ever again, saving thousands that they could spend instead on gems, flasks, and so on. For most people, it's somewhere in the middle. Buying another roll of the dice for an OP champ (or just a stronger one) in a PvP mode of a PvP game is way over that middle line, but for now we're seeing desperate rationalizations as people move the goalposts to excuse this.\n\nIt provides a competitive advantage in a PvP game for cash, which is P2W, and it's disgusting that we've come to this, especially after LoL has been so resistant to it for so long.","replies":[{"poster":"Bears Dont Care","date":"2019-01-31T19:24:41.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KFCeytron,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BnOMXey0,comment-id=00040000000000010000000200000000,timestamp=2019-01-31T08:34:10.247+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s not a strawman at all.

P2W is a _gold mine_ that no company could ignore if it ever became a viable revenue strategy. As long as it&#x27;s working, Riot will expand it. They&#x27;re under enormous pressure to turn their shrinking business back into a growing one. Maybe the next time we see a pass like this, it&#x27;ll increase the reroll cap to 3 or something.

ARURF pass is a chance at an advantage in a game, just like crit chance is a chance at an advantage in a game, which is an advantage. A player without that pass doesn't have as many chances to roll a strong champ. It is objectively stronger to buy the pass.\n\nI see you're of the \"it's not P2W unless paying guarantees a win and not paying guarantees a loss\" mindset, which is probably why we're disagreeing. Since this is a competitive PvP game rather than an NPC stomp, the only way to make guarantees like that is to grant victory to whoever pays _more_. However, even a small advantage in a PvP game ruins the competition, and it becomes \"whoever spent (more) money is more likely to win,\" which is why other people have a problem with this.\n\nThe \"change\" the pass grants you in your chances of getting the champion you want is an _increase_, making it a competitive advantage, however slight. Do you know the difference between \"zero\" and \"not zero\"? It's very important.\n\nYes it does. The \"extra chance at getting what you want\" is a chance for stronger champions, which have a huge impact in a mode like URF. Some champs are mediocre in URF, others are terrible, others are fantastic. An extra roll of the dice to possibly change your Karthus to a Vel'Koz is an advantage that non-payers won't have (note, an _extra_ roll of the dice, which is what the pass provides).\n\nCalling people dumb for thinking this provides an advantage when it does is an ad hominem, and, since I've clearly been saying that it provides an advantage, it's specifically an insult to to me.\n\n\"I am just as likely to get Evelynn as I was before the re-rolls because of how statistically insignificant the advantage would be\" LOLOLOL. The chance is small, therefore it is zero! Are you for real? Calling people dumb and then confusing numbers that are zero with numbers that aren't zero?\n\nRiot will increase the advantages you can get from paying money if it's profitable. If they gain more income from selling these things than they do from people leaving due to P2W, there's no sound business reason not to. Some people will pay a _lot_ of money for competitive advantages, so if the backlash is pretty limited and shouted down by insistence that it's not P2W, it'll be worth it, and Riot should do it, because they're a business.\n\nIf you think that P2W only applies on guaranteed wins and losses, you'll basically never think anything is P2W. There could be armor in a cash shop granting +1000 all stats, and that doesn't guarantee a win (that person could troll, AFK, etc.), so it wouldn't be P2W by your definition. However, it's a competitive advantage (an enormous one), and anyone who values the integrity of a PvP game would have a problem with that.\n\nTelling me that the statement that being able to buy advantages in a game means P2W \"is objectively wrong to state and is wrong\" is just redundant babbling with no substance (after you call anyone who disagrees with you \"dumb\").\n\nCalling the purchase of competitive advantages in a PvP game \"P2W\" isn't \"utterly ridiculous.\" You just don't have any argument other than logical fallacies.

Though I grinded this game so long I never bought a champ with rp and think only bought 2 out of 18 runepages with RP because of a sale.  I already had a number of them.\n\nBut I don't think we should dismiss these things as not p2w.  Even if its a dumb casual gamemode.  It's reprehensible to pay money for OBVIOUS advantages.  This reroll thing isnt even a \"If you look at it like this\"  No.  Its a straight up advantage.

I do think that games should be accessible and competitive from the get-go.  Though I understand there's a lot of work put into an iteration of said expansion and was released much later.

But I actually do kind of disagree with it but idk the solution I guess.  There's got to be a more creative and inclusive way to handle it.  But that's an outsiders opinion and I dont know their finances or demographics or stats or anything.  I cant hold a concrete opinion.
