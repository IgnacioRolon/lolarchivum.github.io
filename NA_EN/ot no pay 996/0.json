My ping was at a steady 63ms and it felt like I was playing at around 180ms due to some unknown packet drops. Does the new client affect gameplay?\n\nEDIT: This is happening on both clients so it's not a client problem, seems like some movement commands aren't registering, can anyone tell me a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-17T05:53:05.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss can be caused by a handful of factors, however, the most common causes are issues either on your local network or along your network routing.
