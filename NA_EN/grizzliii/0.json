And I finished the update and had 20 minute waits. These are a pain and I would ask if you can somehow let me off the hook. After all I didn't do anything wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-30T00:01:50.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though the leave was not intentional, leaving still causes a negative experience for other players.  Leaverbuster will be placed on an account after multiple leaves and not just 1, so resolving whatever is causing the crash is important.  Let me know if this is still and issue and with more details.  I'll be happy to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Grizzliii","date":"2016-11-30T14:48:55.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely understand, Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
