The part that connects the projectile to Viktor's staff is a visual effect. Generally when you have an ability that deals damage along the path that it's traveling, rather than damaging a big area all at once, it's a missile.","replies":[{"poster":"haywire android","date":"2015-06-25T19:13:04.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some clarity would be appreciated regarding Yasou's blocking ability of lasers etc. a lot of things are really confusing and seems to make no sense.\n\nRegarding Viktor's E it's the only laser in the game that is blocked by the Wind wall. Visually it's a laser, dealing damage at its end point and having a beam in between its attacker and target, just like Vel'koz aa for example.\n\nRumble's entire ult disappear if Yasou Wind wall, while Ziggs ult works, so multiple bombs raining from the sky is blocked by a vertical wall while one bomb isn't.\n\nBoth of these are due to how ground target travel is coded as you described above, but in my opinion it adds more confusion and frustration than actual game interaction. Exclusions in coding where added to champions such as Ziggs and Vel'koz mentioned above, why not other laser users and \"from above\" attacks?","replies":[{"poster":"vLemon","date":"2015-06-25T20:35:21.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tldr is that height doesn't matter when it comes to missiles getting destroyed by Yasuo's wall (or Braum's sheild, the two abilities are using common tech).

Viktor's laser and Rumbles ultimate in my opinion (and it seems others) fails this, they give you a visual expectation of how they should interact that fails to deliver.\n\nIf it's possible it would be great if the feedback provided in this thread could be forwarded to the relevant design team to consider.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thunderkeg","date":"2015-06-25T20:46:02.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=vLemon,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=ElFpz8VU,comment-id=00000001000000000001,timestamp=2015-06-25T20:35:21.500+0000)\n>\n> The tldr is that height doesn't matter when it comes to missiles getting destroyed by Yasuo's wall (or Braum's sheild, the two abilities are using common tech).
