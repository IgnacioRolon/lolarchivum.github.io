Rammus is too tanky to deal with unless Master Yi gets early kills, which is unlikely because good Rammus players will beat him in 2v2 fights and gank a lot.\n\nShaco - There is nothing Master Yi can do against an invisible champion. Not to mention things like the boxes and clone really makes fights difficult for Yi. Shaco will usually invade and counterjungle Master Yi, and once he gets ahead he can just burst Master Yi when he's not expecting it.\n\nUdyr - Undodgeable stun, active counterjungler and invader.\n\nKha'Zix - Lots of burst damage and invisibility.\n\nJax - Counterstrike.\n\nElise - Has a strong stun, a much stronger early game, and rappel makes her hard to kill.\n\nWarwick - Tons of CC, also really drain-tanky while doing a lot of damage. \n\nEvelynn - Stealth, hard CC, and burst damage.\n\nPantheon - Reliable stun, tons of damage early game, and will usually snowball the game against Yi.\n\nGraves - Tons of burst damage, he can kite Master Yi without Highlander, and his smokescreen is actually really good against Yi.\n\nTaric - Can't get resets if the support won't die and his whole team is invincible for a few seconds.\n\nAlistar - Tanky, with tons of hard CC.\n\nAhri - It's almost impossible for Master Yi to kill this champion. She's way more mobile than him when they both ult, and without ults, she just charms and kites.\n\nZilean - Revive makes it really hard to get the first reset.\n\nHeimerdinger - It's really dangerous to engage on Heimerdinger.\n\nKayle - Instant invincibility ult is really hard to deal with, and she's a huge damage threat in her own right.\n\nTL;DR Going tanky is almost never the best way to deal with Master Yi.

Some champions use some runes better than others which limits the power that rune can have. For example kleptomancy is strong on Ezreal, but it's weak on almost every other champion.

He's melee and he can't be tanking damage for very long.\n\n8) He really can't lifesteal that much because a lot of his damage is actually coming from on-hit effects, which do not apply lifestal.\n\nYour teamcomp could've very easily dealt with Master Yi. You have tons of CC and damage, and you had like 2 and a half tanks. Fun fact - Singed can counter Master Yi by using his glue, because Alpha Strike can't be used when you're grounded.","replies":[{"poster":"GripaAviara","date":"2018-08-27T22:17:30.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Master Yi has a 44% winrate against Rammus. \n\nYeah, in high elo where all team participates and people dont usually feed him so the game is over before he spikes","replies":[{"poster":"Carnicore","date":"2018-08-28T00:38:53.177+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, [even in Silver this matchup heavily favors Rammus.](https://u.gg/lol/champions/masteryi/build/?role=jungle&rank=silver&opp=rammus) Rammus himself is a pretty great low champion just like Yi is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sharpest glasses","date":"2018-08-27T23:22:50.482+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">This champion is completely toxic to the game and needs major nerfs.\n\ncome on, you play {{champion:33}} \n\nYeah, he need a rework (same for rammus), but the biggest issue is {{item:3715}}\n\nYou had a great team to controle him. i really think you (whole team) f*cked up, more than him being broken","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vztah","date":"2018-08-27T23:10:43.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"feeders op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fourth Shot IV","date":"2018-08-28T11:48:50.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"master yi is a much worse case of a stat check than aatrox ever was , I really hope that riot finds a way to fix this cancerous stat check champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bjørnetjenesten","date":"2018-08-28T10:41:07.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone knows his damage is pretty much cancer level, especially combined with conqueror + {{item:3124}} + {{item:3508}}. \n- Insane 1v1 potential\n- Insane AOE dmg at the same time\n- 30% is true dmg\n- Insane tower take downs\n- Impossible to itemize vs since his ulti and 3 sources of true dmg counters {{item:3110}}, {{item:3143}}, {{item:3075}} \n\nSure you can use all your CC to chain him down and kill him, but now you have wasted all the CC meant for the other carries. \n\nLategame he gets {{item:3026}}, {{item:3139}} and {{item:3053}} and now you need to send 3-4 man to stop him and use all your CC and sums to kill him.
