At one point later in the evening we decided to play some League.  We had 5 people.  We queued up.  We got the fight found. All accepted.  As soon as loading screen tries to load up, my computer bug splatted.  It continued to bug splat the rest of the night trying to queue up.  The next day I took my computer home, and at my house load up and figure Ill continue trying to troubleshoot the problem.. and run into 2 things.  1) I have been set to leaverbuster for apparently not being able to load into ARAMs at my cousins house, and two, I have no problem loading into the games after sitting through 20 minute queues so no need to troubleshoot.  \r\nIs there some problem with 5  accounts loading at 1 local IP that causes the continual bug splat?\r\nIs there some way to not incur leaverbuster when actual problems are occurring to the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-08-16T17:59:36.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugsplats are *generally* caused by hardware or driver issues, but it sounds like in your instance, it may have been something else, such as your connection to the servers. It's possible whatever local network configurations were on your PC simply didn't play well with your cousin's network at their house. \n\nThe [Leaverbuster system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) is unable to distinguish the reason as to why you disconnect or are unable to connect to a match, therefore it cannot treat different instances separately when the disconnections happen. Additionally, regardless of the reason for the disconnection, it still creates a poor experience for everyone else in the match, which is a key reason why the system treats all disconnections equally. For this reason, penalties cannot be modified or removed for any reason, but I'm happy to hear you worked through the queue and aren't having problems anymore.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
