That is the idea of a competitive game, that Riot has for league of legends.\r\nI know that you have a business to run and make money, but frustrating the players is a shameful thing to do. If someone gets a high win rate, just match him with better teammates and better opponents. There is no need to &quot;punish&quot; him. \r\nE.G. Don&#039;t tell me that the above doesn&#039;t happen.
