Anyway, I think I have attained a very clear grasp of the game at this point to be able to determine what is truly balanced and what isn&#039;t.  Out of my entire experience playing lol only the current akali and pre-reworked s6 ww are in my definition completely and utterly broken.\r\n\r\nSo why is akali this broken?  Simple, it&#039;s her shroud.  That w is by all means completely busted.  While in that shroud she cannot be targeted at all and is completely stealthy for 5-7 seconds, even to turrets.  This can almost be compared to being invulnerable (I know she isn&#039;t, but she is invulnerable to more than half of the damage dealt to her essentially because she cannot be targeted ).\r\n\r\nThere are a few other champions in the game that have VERY similar abilities from purely a mathematical point of view, however those abilities are all ultimates and not on an 11 second cd maxed out.  First, lets look at Kayle&#039;s ultimate.  When cast on herself she is completely invulnerable to all damage for  2-3 seconds.  If Kayle&#039;s ultimate were to be doubled in timelength, mathematically to balance out the increase in time you need to make kayle partially vulnerable to some damage.  Sound familiar?  Yep, that&#039;s essentially what akali&#039;s shroud does.\r\n\r\nHow about alistar?  His ultimate reduces all incoming physical and magic damage by (55%-75%) for the next 7 seconds.  Sound familiar?  How about Bard&#039;s, Taric&#039;s, Dr. Mundo&#039;s, Kayn&#039;s, kindred&#039;s, rek&#039;sai, and finally Tryndamere&#039;s ultimate?  ALL of these ultimates fall in the same exact category as akali&#039;s shroud.  They are an ability that highly reduces damage over a period of time.  So the question is, why does a champion have an ability that is essentially an ultimate ability when compared to other similar abilities in the game as their w which is only on a 11sec cd maxed out and BEFORE and CD reduction? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even going to mention the other benefits the shroud gives because frankly what I discussed above is enough.  She needs to be nerfed.  She&#039;s already essentially perma banned so why not just change her?  She&#039;s also not fun to play against at all.  It&#039;s not fun only being able to hit a champ when she want&#039;s you to, it&#039;s just frustrating and has nothing to do with countering due to her w cd and duration.  \r\n\r\ni honestly do not understand how riot is leaving her like this, she&#039;s so obviously broken.  Yet again, I&#039;ve never seen more champs that are ban worthy at one time in a single meta/season.","replies":[{"poster":"ØrnnToGetTrolleÐ","date":"2019-01-05T22:29:09.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Troll post.
