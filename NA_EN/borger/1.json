I forget if there's a health threshold, but no matter how low they are you can't attack them ( and therefore try to go for the deny ) unless they have specific debuffs on them - usually, extremely long or powerful DoTs.\n\nPlus anyone can deny themselves to neutrals. You won't give anyone the kill if you die to a jungle camp, even if they damaged you literally half a second ago.\n\nAlso worth noting is that a hero, Lich, has a spell that's flat-out creep denial while giving the experience to his team. You pretty much pick him if you ever want to give a specific lead a signficant exp advantage, since you're flat-out removing one creep of experience for your opponent and splitting it between you and the laner.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smithney","date":"2016-05-12T22:37:55.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you can only deny allies by specific abilities (think Oracle), but I could be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Faceroll Tactics","date":"2016-05-13T14:05:13.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I remember, Oracle never had a deny ability, but no one in my MMR ever played him.\n\nA way to deny allies is say Kunkkha ultimate, where it has a mini deaths dance effect on anyone hit, the damage taken the few seconds after gives the kill credit to Kunkkha if it is fatal","replies":[{"poster":"Smithney","date":"2016-05-13T21:46:39.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info.
