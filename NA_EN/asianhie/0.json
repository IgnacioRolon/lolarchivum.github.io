Like {{champion:223}} or {{champion:35}} . Now it&#039;s just speculation I&#039;m most likely wrong considering the twists and turns Riot is starting to take with their new lore style. But wouldn&#039;t it make sense? How else would he have the power to kill **FOUR CHAMPIONS** {{champion:254}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:238}} . Also look at how far apart each of them are. Vi is in Piltover, Garen is in Demacia, and Sona and Zed are in Ionia (I&#039;m assuming Zed is anyway). I don&#039;t know the extent to how fast a demon can travel in Runeterra but if you look at the official map for Valoran ( http://img.wikia.nocookie.net/intmap_tile_set_738/thumb/20140728092924!phpwBA8KT.jpg/680x382x5-20140728092924!phpwBA8KT.jpg ) all those places are pretty far away from each other. Now form is another question. Demons in Runeterra don&#039;t seem to have a distinct appearance, I.E. {{champion:223}} is a fish, {{champion:35}} is a clown. So there&#039;s no limitation to what demons could look like. I do hope Jhin is at least some kind of other worldly being and not human. Or has some kind of special power &quot;blessed&quot; upon him like {{champion:63}} or {{champion:420}} . Only when Jhin is released will we know for sure. Whatever he is, I hope some kind of closure is made in their stories {{champion:254}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:238}} . Not to forget the massive gap in the lore now that they&#039;re dead but that&#039;s for a different discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"WAAARGHbobo","date":"2016-01-24T03:44:54.038+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is he a demon?

The only thing hinting he could be one is his title, which is, like his lore, outdated.\n\nSecond:\nJust like Shaco's lore, the map is outdated too. That's presumably not how post-retconned Valoran looks like.\n\nThird:\nJhin didn't kill any of these champions (yet). Not only would it be the dumbest idea ever to just kill four characters to hype a new one, it's also pretty sure that all the teasers were just product of Jhin's twisted mind. I played him on the PBE and it's most likely that all the \"art\" in his \"work\" is only present in his eyes, like he would have the (Team Fortress') Pyro's vision. I can assure you that both in kit and in character he doesn't have any special powers. He uses a handgun which he can extend to a rifle.","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-07-12T13:04:43.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought a Red said that Jhin actually does turn his dead victims into trees like in the teaser.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpecterVonBaren","date":"2016-01-24T20:10:12.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would you go about explaining his E passive though?","replies":[{"poster":"Skelenth","date":"2016-01-24T20:35:12.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco's or Jhin's?\nShaco's E passive blinds minions.\nJhin's E passive just spawns an exploding trap.

He is described as the \"golden Demon\" in his lore. \nThe reason why I had this question was his Name. It sounds exactly like \"Dschinn\", which is a special Type of \"higher\" Demon in some Stories, I had the \"Bartimaeus Trilogy\" in mind. If you are interested in reading, try it out :) It tells some interesting \"demon lores\" wihch come all true in the League character Jhin. But the creepy thing about his League lore is the fact that he shows some characteristics of a summoner (e.g. nobody knows his birthname, he loves to show off his skills and do \"performances\" and some other small details). \nAlthough I never dared to play this Champ, I love him and its always a pleasure to support the demon of League. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Meep Man","date":"2016-07-12T13:03:05.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin isn't a demon. In his lore it specifically says that he is in fact just a normal man going under the name \"Golden Demon\".\n\nAlso, I like how the OP is all like \"Only a demon could possibly kill four champions and roam around Runeterra so quickly.\" Jhin has an extremely powerful gun and a gun can kill people. All he needs is fast transportation, like a portal, and an extremely powerful gun to kill these champions. Zed, Garen, Vi, and Sona are just regular people with special powers. Jhin is no different. With the right amount of stealth, smarts, and strategy, someone could kill all these champions with just a gun.","replies":[]}]}]}
