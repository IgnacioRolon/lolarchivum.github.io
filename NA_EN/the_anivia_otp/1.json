Falling far behind an enemy team comp that can stick to the target (and Diana has no method to disengage effectively) results in Diana just dying anytime she gets spotted.\n\nI've seen plenty of games where a jungler gets absolutely destroyed because the enemy team essentially takes over their side of the jungle for the entire game. If the teammates in lanes are not in a position to help because they are behind as well, what can you do as a jungler at that point?\n\nOnce again, playing poorly or having a bad game, no matter how bad, is not against the rules as long as there no malicious intent.

But if the reason is because you dont got mana, I'm gonna give you some solutions from a 9 year veteran at the game. \n\n1. Runic echoes gives you mana every time you proc it on monsters. Move around and kite when taking camps to charge it faster. It gives mana back based on how much your missing, and as long as you aren't using ult and the knockback to clear, you should be golden.\n\n2. For the early game, grab that scuttle, it gives a lot of mana when you kill that bugger, make sure you ward and are safe while doing it. Give it up and back if the enemy jungler shows up, you aren't much of a champion until you hit 6.\n\n3. Honey fruit if you can find it, it's also based around missing mana, so if your low and it's up, grab it.\n\n4. Hunters talisman gives mana regen based on missing mana in the jungle. It does a pretty good job on most spammable and ap champs (hec, kayn, eve, morg), and it'll help you clear faster. \n\nIf your worried about camps being too strong, take a few backs to build your items up, even if you're only able to clear one or two camps. It sucks to fall behind, but as a jungler, it sucks even more because you're playing catchup for the rest of the game. In that case, get more bulky (armor helps clear camps because it's all physical damage). Worst thing you can do is try to make plays when you're in this state, it's better to react to them.\n\nGood luck in your next game","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SuicidePlank","date":"2019-05-27T00:49:01.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Anivia OTP,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=wPgiBEUE,comment-id=00020001000000020000,timestamp=2019-05-27T00:23:00.185+0000)\n>\n> what's wrong with bloodrazor ?\n> because actually your accusations are based on \"Hey your score is shitty\"\n> I reply \"well i had a very bad game\"\n\nWhen did I wrote anything like that?\n\n> \"but on top of that your items are wrong\"\n> well sorry for trying to ... play the game but i'm not sure that is called inting\n\nThe Items aren't good, period.\nWhen did I wrote anything like that? \n\n> \"and bloodrazor , item that scale with attack speed, on an auto attack based champion , what kind of troll is that.\"\n\nDiana isn't AA based, Yi is, almost any ADC is.\nDiana is an AP Assassin/Diver, your only strenght is oneshotting people.\nHow does a Champion do that if its abilites only scale with AP you might ask?

I have nothing more to add on that.\n\n> BUT WHAT EVER YOU SAY REMEMBER IT IS ILLEGAL AND IF THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT RIOT HAS TO BAN THEM\n\nIs it illegal to say \"kys\" in an online game? Why have a never seen ANYBODY arrested for it? O.o\n\n> i did nothing illegal, against the rules, i just did the best i could , i even tried to help them\nThey did something illegal, forbidden by riot\n\nFinally you dropped the camoflague of the victim defenders. Inting is also forbidden by Riot, yet I don't see you complaining you are not banned. If you want to stick to the rules so much, you should be banned as well.\n\n> , i can prove it was not \n\nDo it!\n\n> they assumed i was inting (thing they should not do), started insulting me, and death wish started\nwhether you like it or not , it can happen to everyone, and people behaving like this toward these people\nshould always get punished, no matter what you think\n\nWell, I could write the opposite and add \"no matter what you think\" ;) \n\n> again I can prove i wasn't intentionally feeding, if you are pissed that you had some people like that, that's on you , because you are going to be in my place one day, and you will understand.\n\nAs I said, do it!\n\nTLDR: You gave studies about IRL bullying what I could not care less about in this scenario. Something about cyber bullying which is still a different stuff than what happened here. TBH I do not care that much if they are banned or not (I think for chat related issues chat bans should be given, but that's another question), but you clearly should.","replies":[{"poster":"The Anivia OTP","date":"2019-05-27T17:33:42.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ph03n1xb1rd","date":"2019-05-27T21:15:18.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"> First of all :\nBy the late 1980s, thirty of the fifty states had no laws against suicide or suicide attempts but every state had laws declaring it to be a felony to aid, advise or encourage another person to die by suicide.[139]\n\nAnd there was never a case someone was arrested for something in an ONLINE GAME.

When you are getting closer to the extremums the theories tend to be more and more sure. For example if somebody has a 1/25/1 stat at the end of a 15 min game, would you look at all the deaths  one by one? Yes, actually you could, but it is pointless....\n\n> there is a possibility , therefore i should not be banned.\n\n\"There is a possibility\", yes there is. There is also a possibility that they did not write death wishes it was just caused by noise in the Wifi signal. (Small possibility, but there is. Just like you not inting.) \n\n> 1- you shouldn't wish people death NO MATTER THE CONTEXT (try to argue about this one)\n\nHow the fck could I argue with your opinion? \n\n> 2- Teammates can not expect from me to be good, because that is not described in the rules, i can expect YOU to not insult me in game because that' sin both the LAW and LoL's Terms of USE (Try to also argue about this one)\n\nIt is also in the ToS that you should try to win. Your teammates expected you to try to win. Also we turned back to the ToS again, which in fact I do not like. And as I already mentioned according to the ToS you should be also banned.\n\n> 3- I then proceeded to prove you that THEY DESERVED to be banned given what has been said, and that bullying is not a RARE event, suicide is highly linked to bullying and therefore thinking that a \"kys\" is benine is a grave mistake\n\nThe only thing you proved, that those messages were on your screen. If you want to find an error in every \"proof\" yours fail here. I do not say it's likely, but it's possible they did not write the message. Just as I do not think you were not inting, but it can happen.\n\n> 4- I proceeded to provide sufficient information to give a doubt about the situation , if you don't want to believe me , that's on you, however, riot can NOT stop the player access to their online service without any proof that the contract has been broken.\n\nQuote from ToS: \"(c) doing so would be in the best interests of our community, the Riot Services, or the rights of a third party. \" They can ban your whenever they feel like so without any explanation.\n\n> 5- if they cannot prove it , i will therefore not be banned, even if i was really inting, you are not in the game and have based your judgment off a score, which to be honest shows your lack of game knowledge\nbut more over you will probably report players that didn't deserve it, no one will be banned and you won't understand why.\n\nYes, you will not get banned, i'm sure of it, since their troll detection system is trash. I think you lack game knowledge if you think 16 deaths in 22 minutes is fine :) \n\n\nWhat you EXPECT:\n\n> 1 - That you accept that you ARE NOT IN POSITION of judging whether or not i deserve to be banned\n\nIf you mean it by me not being able to ban you, then you are right. If you mean that I should not be allowed to think, that you should be banned, then it's just BS. I'm allowed to think whatever I want.\n\n> 2- That you admit that in almost no context (for instance if the player is your friend and it's a private joke between you two) asking someone to kill himself is acceptable\n\nIt's clearly not cool, but when the given player intentionally ruins my game, I could not care less.\n\n> 3- That coming to the lol NA BOARDS , imposing a standard that is clearly biased, individual and toxic to the GAME ITSELF is not a very smart behaviour\n\nIDK why you pointed out the NA part, since you are here as well :) \"Biased\" soo nice word, sadly does not mean anything without a base. So do you want EVERYBODY to leave the Boards who are not in exact agreement with a base, since then everyone else is biased. Oh sorry sir for having an individual opinion, my bad... Toxic to the game? O.o I want inters to be banned. Inters are toxic to the game, more than flamers.\n\n> 4- That a standard that you have but is not written in any law or internationally signed document is not a standard that you can USE AS AN ARGUMENT\n\nThere is no signed document about the standards of inting. So nobody should be banned, since nobody can use anything as an argument?
