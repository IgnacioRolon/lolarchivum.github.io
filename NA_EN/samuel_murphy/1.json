They want money, so they keep the game the same.\r\n\r\nRiot DOES make changes because spectators like it. And they want money.\r\n\r\nI would also argue that change is a skill test for players. There was a time when Markmen ADC's were not viable. Some Pro Botlaners suffered and even took hiatus. While others with a more flexible champion pool thrived. \r\n\r\nIf not, tell me your arguments, I think its a really cool topic and would love to see other peoples thoughts! \r\nIf you think it needs to be labeled as \"Esport\" what makes you draw that distinction?","replies":[]}
