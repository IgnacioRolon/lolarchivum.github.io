I don't think the punishment was wrong(10 games chat restriction) but It's just when I got moderated that annoys me very much.\nLike, if I got moderated atleast 2 months before the season ended, could've had time to make it but 3 weeks?

A chat restriction is like 95% automated.\n\nAnd I have an e-mail somewhere from Riot, when asking them about a chat restriction where I asked the players to report someone inting down mid, where I was explicitly told the only reason I received a restriction was because \"asking other players to report someone creates a negative game environment\".\n\nFact is that Riot doesn't go through reports one by one and determine punishments.
