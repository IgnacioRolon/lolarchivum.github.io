But I don&#039;t believe 100% of the video game companies are failures yet all I see are comments like this. \nHalo fans crying, gears fans crying, fortnite fans crying, starcraft fans crying, league fans crying. All saying the same generic crap. \n\nWe shouldn&#039;t confuse boredom and Nastalgia with a game or companies failure. Two completely different things.\n","replies":[]}
