However I want to make the webm into a gif so I can share it with my friends. When I right click the file and hover over \"Open with\", windows explorer and the little popup dialogue just freeze. I can still move my mouse and interact with other screens but the dialogue stays on top of everything and doesn't go away. If I try to restart explorer.exe via task manager it closes but doesn't restart like it normally does. So any time this happens I have to restart my entire computer. I'm running Windows 10 and haven't ever had this issue before, any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-08-31T00:45:06.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm it sounds like something is going a little wonky with your pc if those menus are freezing and sticking around when they shouldn't.
