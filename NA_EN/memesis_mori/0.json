It's come down to turning off chat every single game... but where did this mindset even come from.\r\n\r\nit seems every 2nd or 3rd game is trolled in my current rank. (silver 1 with bronze shit mmr, my other account \"dat tito\" is gold and has the same problems... Im just wondering if RITO has anything to say about these players. )\r\nI've been playing garen and cant seem to carry these teams even with a good matchup.\r\n\r\ncheers.","replies":[{"poster":"JustA kleo","date":"2019-11-30T23:46:25.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yesterday had a game where i was winning jungle, top was winning and mid was winning... but our adc was i think 1/8 at the 7 min mark and i asked her to stop fighting and just farm because every lane is winning\nshe said and i quote\n\"fuck you you dont help i keep fighting until you lose\".\n\nwhich is what we eventually did :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sirsir","date":"2019-11-30T22:29:45.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaving lane and afk are two very different things. \n\nIf I keep getting 100-0 dove consistently im leaving lane. It's the smart thing to do. You can't play or build safe enough these days when everyone snowballs like a riven on adderall. My lane opponent can either take the tower for free, or he can take tower for free and kills as well. At this point it's up to you how far he goes cuz I clearly can't stop him. I realize this isn't usually what you're faced with, but sometimes....\n\nAFK is AFK and shouldn't be tolerated.
