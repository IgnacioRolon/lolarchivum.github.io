Whenever I duo with someone and they quit a que for me I'll still be in there, it will take me about 1 minute of clicking to get out of a que. If I get into champion select, there is a very high chance that I can't pick a champion/change anything. In order for me to get into a game if I somehow got passed all of that, I'll have to forcibly close my game and reopen it to rejoin the game.  I've already tried to use the league repair that's in the settings and it still wont work.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-24T00:09:15.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you're having a network problem here that's causing you to lose sync and get left behind.  A repair won't necessarily fix this if it's related to your connection.
