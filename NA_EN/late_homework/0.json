My normal fps in game ranges from 200-250 but randomly my fps will drop down to between 0 and 10 for a good 4 or 5 seconds at a time. My league client is 100% up to date and everything on my laptop is 100% up to date. I have even tried uninstalling league and re downloading it but I still have this issue. I read on a similar discussion that disabling sound will fix this issue but it did not. My laptop is an Acer Aspire V Nitro - Black Edition if that helps. If anyone has a solution I be very appreciative, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-19T23:56:11.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations on your laptop!
