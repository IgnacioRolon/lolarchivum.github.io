While I think that this is pretty cool, I think it woul be even more awesome if you guys could revisit alternative builds on older champs aswell.\r\n\r\nI mean take TF for example. He has a decent on-hit on his E aswell as a small attack speed buff and the stun on his W is something any ADC would kill for. But it&#039;s still not enough to really make it viable on that role because the scaling with auto attack items is just way lower than on other ADCs. And since his Q is considered useless on the AD TF build anyway, why not give it a bonus AD ratio to give it a purpose and maybe even make the build viable? Since it&#039;s bonus AD and not base AD it wouldn&#039;t affect his AP counterpart all too much, except for maybe enabling a Gunblade build or making Baron a little stronger on him. And if the latter of which becomes a problem you could easily just make the Baron AP/AD buff adaptive.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example. You could bring back oldschool Siv HD style AP Xin back, allow Leona to trigger her own passive to maybe enable a jungle or toplane build, making Blitzcranks AD and AP builds more viable and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nI know that there is the danger of the off-build becoming so OP that it absolutely destroys the champion, I&#039;ve heard horror stories about Tank Ekko and AD Bruiser Fizz, but careful testing on the PBE could easily prevent that. Even if these changes aren&#039;t really necessary for the game, it would still make the game more diverse and basically create whole new champions with only a few additions.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaioko","date":"2018-02-26T16:56:52.040+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To make ADC TF viable you would need to take away his point and click stun. No other ADC has point and click hard CC given on an non ultimate ability that doesn't require some type of special interaction (like Vayne's condemn). There's a damn good reason why they don't. Having a 2 second stun on a point and click for an ADC would be beyond broken especially on such a low CD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rhody","date":"2018-02-26T17:03:58.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of older champions werent balanced to be hybrid, they just happened to have both AP/AD scaling because Riot wanted champs to not have a singular build...
