We 4K users don't need full scale support.  Keep your textures the way they are, keep your shaders the way they are, keep everything the way it is if you want\n\nJUST GIVE US THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE MOUSE!\n\nYou can even justify it not being strictly for 4K users and say that people with lower resolutions than 1920 can now DECREASE the size of their mouse if they think it's too big. Your cursor color is already super easy to lose on the screen.   We need more customization of the thing as it is the most crucial part of the game.\n\nUpdate\nhttps://imgur.com/xY8OKqa\n\nSwitched my primary monitor over to my 1080p monitor to try a game on, and this is what my shop looks like.  I can barely see my items, and I can't see my gold at all.  Selling anything is a pain.  Just glad I didn't buy anything I didn't need.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-02-02T01:32:48.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League doesn't fully support 4k quite yet, so, unfortunately, we won't have a direct fix for this.

Your best bet for getting a larger, more obvious mouse cursor is gonna be to downgrade your resolution to 1080p until League fully supports 4k.\n\nI would like to point out that downgrading the resolution does not work. If you set league on 4k and play borderless, League will open in a tiny 1080 window frame that does not fill the whole screen. Borderless is very important because I want to Alt Tab and do stuff on my other monitor while not forcing the game to minimize. So basically, you have to set to full screen at 1080 which then you cannot Alt Tab without minimizing the game. Also, even if I do this, there are lots of bugs where windows don't resize correctly. It's honestly flat out unplayable, and I have tried that in multiple systems. \n\nThe real fix is to discard the beautiful 4k monitor and make the 1080 panel your default main screen. I play league every day and I had to resort to this least favorite option. This is why the player base of 4k monitors will remain very small. We need warm love and I don't foresee this coming in the far future. \n\nI am not sure if you have a 4k monitor and from your response I anticipate you don't. I would simply advice to say League is not supported yet rather than saying downgrade the resolution. \n\nOn a side note, I might change my name from \"Support Bot Lane\" to \"Support 4k Please\"
