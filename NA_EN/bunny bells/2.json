If that gets changed the cooldown alert ping gets changed, and in my experience didn't work.  I had changed my quick alert ping to 'G', so I would just hold G drag and release and that gave me the ping.  This made the cd ping not work.  By restoring that to the default value my cooldown ping began working again.  I simply put 'G' as my secondary \"Quick Alert Ping\" and now my pings work with holding and releasing 'G' and alt+clicking for cd ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bunny Bells","date":"2016-09-09T22:58:12.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8BrvbQAi,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-08-29T20:45:26.797+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m not able to assist in modifying your hotkeys with any special configurations outside of what&#x27;s available in-game, but I can *definitely* help you reset your hotkeys if you want them to go back to default.

Maybe try the reset and see if the default settings work. It's possible some of your custom mappings of keys are problematic.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny Bells","date":"2016-09-12T20:44:12.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=8BrvbQAi,comment-id=00030001000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-12T16:48:50.657+0000)\n>\n> Interesting.

This also had a mapping with Alt+click\n\nAFTER the reset I mapped \"T\" to MIA ping. This time I changed nothing with Alt+click.\n\nAfter the reset the ping was working just fine, for a few games....\nThen it just stopped working.  My Alt+click isn't the CD ping, nor is it the attack move, but \"T\" remained as the MIA ping (Post reset.)\n\nI will reset again, but this would be much easier if I had a way to map it in the options menu.  Personally I don't like that ping being on Alt+click.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-13T15:28:46.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotcha.
