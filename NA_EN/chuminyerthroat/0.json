Im sick of it changing from my favorite skins and me not noticing. Especially since it removes the chroma whenever I actually notice?

There isn't currently a way to deny a skin boost, but I can understand how it might be annoying if you already had the skin you wanted selected. For now, you'll just have to make sure the skin you want to use is picked before the timer ends, and watch just in case someone skin boosts.","replies":[]}]}
