This can happen sometimes due to certain settings or even just weird ISP routing.

I changed my window setting to =1 instead of =0. It is still happening....\n\nWhat should I do about my low priority queue? and the losses to my rank? I am bronze so the losses aren't huge, but the low priority queue is a huge deal.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-05T03:59:33.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm that's some high-level techno-magic you worked there if editing a file on your own pc did something to our servers on a completely different pc! That change you made to your window setting only affects whether your League runs in windowed or full-screen mode, so I'm hesitant to say that would help your connection with our servers. \n\nGetting hit with a low-priority queue definitely sucks, but you won't get hit with one after only one left match. It looks like you were trying over and over to get into a match, but you kept getting hit with the same connection error. We can't do much about LPQ's in this kind of situation, but I *can* suggest that in the future you try to test any changes in a custom/practice match to avoid any more penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"Devon1364","date":"2017-05-05T04:56:25.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Posted by riot:\n_Network Operations â€“ Yesterday at 12:22 PM\nWe are aware of players experiencing crashing during game start. While we are working on a permanent fix please use the following workaround. Locate the game.cfg file in \\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config, open the file and edit WindowMode=0 to WindowMode=1, and then save the game.cfg file._\n\nNow what you said seems very logical, and makes a ton of sense. So thank you. I am not sure how i thought changing code on my pc would actually impact your severs, I thought it would allow me to connect more easily by fixing a problem on my pc.\n\nI can connect to the practice server. I'll go through everything you suggested. \n\nI really appreciate all your help.","replies":[{"poster":"DaFluffyPotato","date":"2017-05-05T14:29:09.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe this was relating to the DirectX problem where you had to delete your Config file.
