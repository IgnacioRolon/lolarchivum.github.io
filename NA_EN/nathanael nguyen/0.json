When in game randomly my mouse stop reacting meaning that for example I will use an ability and then click but nothing happens, I sometimes have to click a lot or press esc and then it will work, some other times my keyboard doesn't respond. It's kinda like when you have 2 windows opened and then the mouse and keyboard are set onto one window but not the other so you have to set it to the other in order to be able to do something. I have 2 screens but even when I'm not using the other screen the same thing happens. Whenever I play I have discord running in the background too! If anyone knows how to solve this I'd be so grateful, makes me sometimes miss a lot of kills or even get myself killed :/","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-07T05:55:51.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen if you don't have discord running in the background? It could be trying to give you notifications and temporarily taking over the active process.","replies":[]}]}
