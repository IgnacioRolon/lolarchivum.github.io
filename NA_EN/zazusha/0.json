That's not really asking too much (maybe for a free skin, but I'd gladly pay for it); it'll be just like any other skin.  Having a different model wouldn't be too bad to do either, a lot of recent skins (StarGuardian Lux, Guardian of the Sands Rammus, the new  card one for Ez, the dinosaur ones) have entirely different models or at the very least different models for the heads.  Seems like their new go-to thing, actually.  Though, again, I would be happy with the current model, just skinned with traditional armor/colors and the old VO.   That wouldn't take too much effort.  Just as much as any 750 skin or maybe a 975 skin.  Same goes for GP.\n\nAlso, to me, the core of the traditional skins would be the traditional voiceover.  I miss the goofiness the characters used to have.  I'm not disliking the reworks at all (like, I agree with everything Delioth said for the most part) but it would be nice to be able to go back to the old silliness of the original character every so often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-07-08T18:47:03.051+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":6,"body":"Thanks for posting this! :]","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-07-09T06:45:09.081+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"Let me write this thank you and tell nothing about the thing in question.

Some people want them, other care not. To me, they're a neat thing to have. Example is how I find myself always swapping between Traditional Trundle and his new base. They're like a legendary skin, minus the different animations (I can't stand T.Sejuani's joke as the VO does not work with her new animations, whereas T.Trundle can get away with it as can T.Karma). I can understand why you guys stopped, as well as the fact that to make a traditional skin you must retain the old flavour and personality vs the new and improved feel.\n\nWhere was I going with this? Oh yes, point is I'm fine with the discontinuation of traditional skins. However I would like to suggest this: What about making traditional-legendary quality skins? Reimagine the old into something more sleek and fitting while giving them new and different VO and animations that pay homage to the original. An example would be Sion. Say you make a T.Sion skin that's legendary, you guys write whole new lines and a VO that sound like the old one (expanded beyond his 10 lines with a new voice actor that can hopefully get the feel of old Sion). This is merely a suggestion and if you like it, maybe try to bounce the idea off some co-workers. I used Sion as an example because he's the one people have probably complained about (I personally would like T.Sejuani to be a nomination for this as I stated my complaint before). Just an idea!\n\nPersonally, I find the new GP close enough to his previous originals(s?) that he wouldn't need a traditional skin.

With holes, wear and tear, a real big awesome belt that goes around it. That new coat is exactly what it is. a new not pirate coat with the fancy black and gold ornaments that has seen no action. Finally has a personal preference the old white shirt that actually cover his chest like a shirt should be doing looks just better.

Still he looks a lot more serious and intimidating than the current Gangplank on live. So a traditional one would be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeus Jukem","date":"2015-07-08T19:32:03.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also can't believe they changed his E ):","replies":[{"poster":"Shloonz","date":"2015-07-09T04:22:37.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's really a sad one.\nNow he will be another \"set up, wait, blow up\" champ which the enemies can easily avoid. \n\nThis will have an impact on his mobility. It will not only take away his movement buff, but also replace it with an ability which will make him sit around in a certain spot... and therefore further reduce his mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"TheFirstGokun","date":"2015-07-09T10:06:42.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive gives him in-and-out mobility for quick skirmishing, and his e is far from a slow setup ability. Look up videos of him on PBE, he's crazy fun and the barrel minigame is incredibly intense. It's like new Sion, you use the barrels to push your opponent under their turret and bully them out of their farm. Very matchup dependent (he destroys most melee champs early), but loads of fun and interesting gameplay for both sides of the rift.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
