This is not the first time I encountered something like this in post-game lobby, and even after reporting people it does not get resolved.  Unfortunately I did not get a screenshot because I was honestly just overcome with irritation and frustration. _(Picture attached of after game score screen)._\n\nI get that some people get toxic and talk trash which is whatever; I get over it and move on. This post-game chat got to me though. Let me set this up:\n\nPre-game I do my typical thing, look into each of the enemies. Some high-tier silvers with a platinum 5 ADC? Damn. Got the game difficult set up for me. Well I am having fun, having a good night, and decide &quot;I haven&#039;t played Xayah in a bit, why not?&quot; (For reference, I&#039;m a Gold 4 bot lane main). Myself, my support thresh, mid-lane talon, top lane tryndamere and jungle nunu against a bot lane ezreal and Alistar with a top-lane garen, mid-lane kassadin and jungle hecarim. Playing with friends, having a great time, taking trades, a typical game. I am **DESTROYING** as Xayah, 9/0/8 by 20min, going legendary twice and ending the game at 15/3/15. Just doing my thing, trying to have fun. About 33min in there is a massive team fight under the tower. I decide to start pushing the minion wave, I mean, we need them to keep going right? Sure, they have two open inhibitors, but death timers are long. I have my support me with me while my jungle decides to suddenly run up and try to take the inhibitor. The enemy jungle comes out of nowhere, outplays Thresh flay by using his ult, and kills me. I simply tell the Nunu &quot;Hey, you cost us the game by going for the inhibitor&quot;, and I mean yeah, I&#039;m a bit upset, but I would have gotten over it. \n\nPost-game lobby though I get verbally destroyed by not only our jungle but 3 out of 5 members of the enemy team. Nunu instantly starting off with how mad I apparently am. Between the enem, ADC deciding to tell me _&quot; Xayah. You suck.&quot;_ Ok, whatever, my CS was pretty bad, fair enough. I don&#039;t play Xayah a ton. Alistar chimes in instantly and starts saying random things such _&quot;Hey Thicc, do you dress up as a dog and go woof woof?&quot;_ Kassadin deciding to pipe in with &quot;You seriously suck, you can&#039;t even orbwalk&quot; Which I say &quot;Yes, I did.&quot; To only receive, in response, _&quot;AHAHAHAHA! N***** NO YOU DID NOT!&quot;_ and proceeded to continuously get told how bad I was and how my poor team fighting choices were why we lost. The only two that did not say anything on the enemy team were the garen and hecarim. \n\nI ended up just reporting, but something tells me nothing will be done (unfortunately). I have seen things like this to other players and it is despicable how this keeps going on. I had a friend that stopped playing because they encountered this type of behavior in a post-game lobby and decided that this game was not worth playing in any sense. Riot, please, deal with this type of behavior more often, and with something more than a slap on the wrist.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJust an average gamer.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2018-12-23T08:57:48.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will be banned.\nas a very toxic, boi, I've said many similar things and gotten away.\nbut know this, report flags do stack.\nif a player fucks around 1 too many games.\nhe will find himself banned.","replies":[{"poster":"fatherdarius","date":"2018-12-23T18:36:36.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPVOTED.\n\n\nThe report system is like speeding tickets.\n\nA \"REAL LIFE\" example.\n\nYou have points on your driver license.\n\nYou get a few speeding tickets, nothing happens (other than you have to pay your tickets). When you get that 4th of 5th speeding ticket you get a letter from your DMV that says \"You're dangerously close to going over your point limit\". But you brush it off, because you feel you aren't doing anything wrong. And then you go three months without a citation and you think \"Yeah, I'm good.\" Then you get one more ticket, and now you're OVER your point limit so they make you see a judge and they put you on a ticket probation. You go three more months and get a really ticky-tack ticket for something stupid like window tint. So they revoke your license.\n\n\"WTF yeah i got a ticket 3 months ago but i've been driving fine ever since then, except for this SJW police officer who cited me for my window tint. I see so many other drivers with window tint darker than mine and THEY get tickets. SO UNFAIR. DMV change your punishment system WTF OMG.\"\n\nALSO, you can get your license 'revoked' (i.e. permabanned) no matter how good of a driver you've been your whole life. You're 46 and been driving 30 years. You have a clean driving record. You're honor 5! :D. Then, after a night of celebration, you drunkenly drive while fleeing and evading arrest and you crash into a pedestrian, killing them.\n\nPERMABAN.\n\n\"OMG REVOKED LICENSE AND PRISON TIME SO UNFAIR, I've had a perfect driving record for 30 yrs WTF criminal justice system and DMV unfair.\"\n\n---\n\n'Almost' Every complaint thread on the PB boards, this is what I hear in my head.\n\n{{sticker:fiora-cool}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Farkinob","date":"2018-12-23T08:49:11.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riot, please, deal with this type of behavior more often, and with something more than a slap on the wrist.\n\nRiot bans people all the time for trolling in chat.
