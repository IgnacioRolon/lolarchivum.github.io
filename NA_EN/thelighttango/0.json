Just to help rule out this possibility, what resolution is you game at?  What happens if you change it or make it lower?  Final question, or you on a 4K or exceeding 1080p?  This info will help me figure out what's going on.  Sorry for the trouble you've gone through in-game, and I look forward to hearing back!","replies":[]},{"poster":"OneInchPete","date":"2017-05-03T16:04:29.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem following the latest update.
