Every time i get into loading screen i am the last one to connect and it takes forever, this did not happen at all before i quit playing. I also bounce around the map with 47 ping which is strange to me. The game overall just feels glitchy every time i play. My computer specs are AMD A8-5600K APU with Radeon HD Graphics. What settings for league would be the best for me? Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-15T17:42:47.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't sound like a graphics issue, but more of an unstable connection that's struggling to reach the game server.  Even though your ping seems okay, you can still be running into blocks or other issues connecting to the game server.  I recommend going over each step of the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up.  Test it in a custom game though to be worry-free of any penalties.  \n\nIf the issue persists, hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so we can take a look with your directly.","replies":[]}]}
