The way your game is built, it is VERY HARD to mod. I mean fuck, even the fucking SOUND FILES are packaged into some obscure format that requires really expensive sound software to modify.\n\nAnd even if you know how to modify the sound or the skins... If you don't do it properly your game client will \"repair\" the mod and get rid of it.\n\nIf it was easier, people wouldn't need to rely on 3rd party tools. JUST SAYING.","replies":[]}]}]}
