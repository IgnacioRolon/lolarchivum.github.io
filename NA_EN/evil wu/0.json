As a rule of thumb more players are on edge trying to get Gold or whatever rank they feel they deserve. It also makes it prime time for elo trolls who don't want you to advance. Its prime time for players to check and see you're in promos, then camp you.\n\nIf thats not bad enough, its the end of runes and masteries. That means for anyone who ever thought of an off meta build now's the time to try it. \n\nHit that perma mute and pray during your matchmaking. Spam those meta champs and focus cs/objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"62227164DEL1","date":"2017-10-28T19:56:27.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Darkmatter123123","date":"2017-10-28T21:07:34.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nah bronze is really easy to get out of. just split push all day and they wont will be too busy not knowing what they are doing to stop it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Peritheus","date":"2017-10-29T09:23:23.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your best bet is to duo, 2 people that got eachothers back is better than having a bunch of wildcard misfits that can be unreliable,afk,feed,troll,tilt,tax,lag,noob but wants to be carried,repeat the same mistakes insanity like, that is if you can get past the rampaging  chaos of end seasons with smurfs destroying those solo q low players as they keep flooding the losses while on the edge.","replies":[]}]}
