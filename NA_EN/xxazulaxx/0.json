I main riven i know the hardships, a super split second shield means u had better time it absolutely well. a Q that does 10(+30ish) dmg lvl 1 is laughable since u will b using it to gap close. so to all those saying that for her to be able to fast combo is too massive a buff must not b riven mains. good for u if u can auto-q-move theb righg click back onto target. i cant tell u how many autos i have canceled trying the \"fast combo\" and when u dont try fast combo then u better disregard any sort of Burst it takes forever. no other champ in the game suffers from such an awful mechanic. most champs may have a skill that resets auto attack . kool. and so dods riven except if u keep ur mouse on the target and q auto q auto ur in for a lengthy time frame to use your rotations of skills. \r\n\r\nthank you riot i hope u dont listen to the other riven mains who believe that this mechanic is all their is to this champ. i mean i cant think of any other champion being thought of as such a buggy mechanic. i tell u the trith u will cancel so many autos or clicka minion trying to fast combo that this will indeed make her far more viable. thanks again","replies":[{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-01-18T11:36:06.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is not a buff.
