I can't press 'y' and lock the camera onto my character. I cannot open the shop, scroll through settings, or click on the map unless I spam left click for like 5 seconds. Casting spells is similar, I can press Q, W, E, or R but only after doing so 5-10 times. This strategy doesn't work for the camera lock. Please help, this bug is causing me to basically be AFK for entire games and quitting leaves me with a strike.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-06T04:04:28.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you mention it feels like you're afk and that you have to spam those buttons, it almost sounds like this might actually be packet loss to me. Let's run a quick test for any possible packet loss by grabbing the network logs from that match and letting this [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) scan them. Grab a screenshot and post it back here so I can take a look!","replies":[]}]}
