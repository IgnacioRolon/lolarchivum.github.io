Look at people like Kha&#039;zix and Rengar when they newly came out from the Assassin Rework and they built just a Black Cleaver, their jungle item and the rest are bruiser/defensive items where no one can duel them and they could still have the damage of an assassin. \n\nLook at newly released Courage of the Colossus, where any CC could give you the shield the size of a Mandingo&#039;s #@$*\n\nLook at Season 6, the time stuff like the dreaded Tank Ekko, Tank Fizz, Frozen Force Yasuo and people like the newly reworked Vladimir and Malzahar where they just built HP + AP items and could still anything in sight w/o them being in danger because of their sustain, large health pool and/or safety measures in their kit existed. \n\nLook at buffed Cinderhulk in Season 5, the biggest offender of any tank item. \n\nLook at the time when Sated Devourer was a thing where someone like Yi, Jax or any AA-based jungler built that &amp; Ruined King and the rest of their items are defensive items and once they hit 30 stacks, they were just stupidly hard to deal with, and for &quot;good&quot; reason. \n\nLook at the juggernauts, the supposed &quot;solution&quot; for the champions like Garen, Darius, Morde and Skarner and all Riot did was put in a bunch of random shit and power budget, making them just off-the-bat BS (Darius however, is the only one I can respect because they made his windows of power much more obvious and actually made his laning phase beatable for any melee champion, if played right or the Darius player makes a mistake. Pre-rework Darius was just stupid and provided him too many safety features tbh.)\n\nNow with the upcoming tank rework, I can safely say, Riot loves allowing people to have 300+ resistances, +3K HP and still have the DPS of a carry because of their high base DMG. Fun and interactive gameplay, amirite?\n\nTo whoever reads this...\n\nYes, you may now downvote this post to hell if this post ever offended or seemed inaccurate to you.\n\nSincerely, OP.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-04-28T02:05:32.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget vlad after the mage update.","replies":[{"poster":"RainXBlade","date":"2017-04-28T02:07:49.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I mentioned Vlad, I was referring to his MYMU version.","replies":[]}]}]}
