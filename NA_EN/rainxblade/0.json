People hate the champion, and that just bled over to the players of that champion.\n\nThe champion has an overloaded kit, he can do a lot of things that others cannot, and there is this perception that the champion is powerful. Thus people expect the champion to perform well. Teammates of Yasuo players expect them to play well and be OP, meanwhile any new Yasuo players expect to do well because they think he's OP too.\n\nWhat people don't think about is that his kit also has a higher skill floor than they expect. On top of that, his kit is probably very fun to execute (wouldn't know, I think I only ever played him once), and feels very skillful to do well with. so Yasuo players who do well often get a big head about it and taunt / spam mastery.\n\nWhen things go south, everyone's expectations go down the toilet and they become upset that things are not going as they planned. Oftentimes when expectations are violated, toxicity ensues. The new Yasuo player is upset they are not actually OP, and the team hates them for doing badly when they were expected to do well. Everyone thinks, 'wtf this isn't how its supposed to work,' and begin looking for reasons to blame.\n\nThis also applies to the enemy team, if they see a Yasuo on the opposing team they expect him to be OP and prepare themselves for a frustrating game. So if things go well for the Yasuo they just think, meh it's to be expected, he's OP. Stupid champ is overloaded and should be nerfed. And if it goes poorly for the Yasuo, they feel vindicated taking out their frustration with the kit by stomping him and tilting him and his team in all chat.\n\nIt's a self-feeding hatred that the community has built up over time. People always notice when something negative happens, and rarely notice when it goes well instead. Over many many games of only noticing the negative experiences surrounding the champion and his playerbase, everyone has built up a huge confirmation bias against him.\n\nThe resulting expectation is that, 'if the enemy team has Yasuo he's going to be OP, and if we have him he's going to be a toxic scrublord and a feeder.'","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2017-04-16T21:22:41.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with having a higher skill floor, is that the skill floor isn't something which is hard to obtain on any champion. It's just a small amount of practice to reach the skill floor of any champion, if any at all. It's purely based on understanding the mechanics of the champion which, until we start drawing runes on the screen 2 ryze reworks from now, will always be rather simple. So some champions, or players, will require hands on experience to reach the skill floor and others can just be read and contemplated to reach that point.\n\nThe skill ceiling is defined by having a very nuanced and detailed understanding of the champion's kit, which allows you to make far higher risk plays and micromanage the champion in situations which seem to be impossible to have won. \n\nThe problem is that if you give a champion such a high skill floor, that it's bordering on other champion's skill ceiling, then that implies that having a understanding of the champions mechanics is equivalent in output to having a reasonable amount of experience and intuitive feeling for a champion's exact capabilities.\n\nYet if they made that the only requirement of a yasuo player, then there would be no difference between a good and great yasuo player, so any champion's skill ceiling inherently must be significantly higher than their skill floor (excluding anything that riotRepertoir get his hands on), yet if their skill floor is set so relatively high, then they will have significantly more potential than the average champion. \n\nNow skill floor and ceiling aren't equivalent or directly correlated to champion power, but riot doesn't want to make their game feel unsatisfying. They actively try to make the higher skill plays more powerful (again bar riotRepertoir) than the lower skill demanding plays. So it wouldn't be a perfect correlation, but it'd probably be a pretty good line of best fit between the skill range and power of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HalcyonDweller","date":"2017-04-16T21:01:17.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made a post analyzing Yasuo to better address the question than I could in this comment.

Windwall in particular is a spell that is incredibly disruptive and efficient, whilst taking very little effort to use it (compare it to Fiora's parry, that you at least have to sort of time it).\n\nRiven is similarly overloaded with lots of mobility, 2 dashes, a shield (that scales with AD ffs), a stun, and a lot of damage potential. She's gated by being mechanically intensive in that you have to animation cancel properly to actually get her to do work. That makes her player base focus too hard on micro mechanics and overlook macro/strategy/common sense, and the result is the stereotypical high skill/tiny brain Riven player that stomps lane but then chases the support spamming mastery while the enemy team is doing baron. \n\nVayne is less overloaded but has a scaling %maxhealth true damage that can't be itemized against. Once she gets her items she can potentially 1v5.\n\nAll of that creates a great deal of animosity towards the champions from the get go, and a playerbase of entitled people that think carrying the game is their natural right and get extremely frustrated/tilted/toxic when they do poorly. And since they are playing such strong champions, whenever things go south it can only be the team's fault that they're not doing well.

In all my time ive meet a friendly vayne,  thats literally it just one.\nYasuo and Riven are yet to e found, and yea theres lots of toxic people out there who main other cancer champs but id say this 3 make about 70% of them alone{{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:67}}","replies":[]}]}
