You then get so wound up and expect there to be a punishment you search him up only to find him playing games and getting off with a 10 game chat restriction.\n\nYou addressed the issue right here, please take it up with your peers for the better of the community and make it so they get a JUST punishment. Not a random computer programmed one. (IMO intent feeding, paired with anything else should be immediate 25 game chat or 14 day)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ITS MOIST OK","date":"2016-03-29T23:29:47.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is the kind of answer I was looking for.

I worded this very poorly, because I was shocked. I more of thought that there was a lesser punishment, and before I played, I thought that the punishment was not allowing me to talk in chat at all.

You can get so much more done with a calm and well thought out tone. Doesn't it feel better to communicate like a civilized human being? Now your issue with people feeding and whatnot may have to do with what your current ELO is, say for example, if you were bronze, you would be matched up against bronze tier players. If you truly feel as if you don't belong in a match with people with of \"Inferior\" skill, then play a ton of ranked, and even if people still feed there, eventually, you will get the Silver, gold, etc, whatever you deserve, and get paired with people who are more appropriate. Now on the off chance that you cannot leave bronze tier, despite the instances where you aren't in a queue with feeders, then it may very well be your skill rating. A tip that may help, in to use the new Dynamic queue to pair up with some friends who are at least half decent, and maybe you can find a better experience there. In the meantime, why don't you go over ways to not constantly verbally assault people in game for their lack of cognitive ability? Perhaps by then your ban will be over. Take head, after your 14 day ban, the next one is PERMANENT. So at least try, not asking to be an angel, but just to try, and be nicer to people, maybe instead of yelling at them to \"STOP FEEDING,\" tell them what they are doing wrong, and how they could do it better. You'll find that League can still be fun in such instances.\n\n-Facerolls","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingBushwack","date":"2016-03-29T02:25:04.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just reading that hurt my feelings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kei143","date":"2016-03-29T01:11:40.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LC Trifter,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=bu2IAFxE,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-29T00:22:52.312+0000)\n>\n> is that really bad enough to get my first chat restriction for 10 games?
