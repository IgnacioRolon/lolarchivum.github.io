Well hope that you'll find a solution soon, but the hard reset of the router seems to be a temporal solution for this issue. We had some issue again after processing the hard reset, but we did it once again and the game worked. I would like to share with you also the following: We were using 2 PC's that were connected to the internet of Bulsatcom. After the hard reset it worked basically fine (there were only a few lags from time to time, but it was okay). We tried to connect to the Internet of my partner's phone and it worked at 100% with no issue. As you said the issue is from the Internet, not from LOL, but there is something wrong between the connection of both. Hope that the provided information will help you to solve the issue! Have a nice shift!","replies":[]}]}]}
