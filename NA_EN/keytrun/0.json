I downloaded a localizer app that didn't work, and saw guides about changing parameters within files of the air folder. I don't know if its because of the newer client, but I don't see any files whatsoever in my air folder! I just moved to China and would like to play on the servers. I have the qq account all set up ready to go and can get into the game tutorial, but unfortunately I can't read anything. If anyone has an idea I would greatly appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-21T19:13:50.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Each region has its own set of [languages ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751594-Changing-Game-Language)that it supports.

I got the air client working in english by changing a few files' lines from CN to ENGLISH but after doing that I can't actually get into the game itself. If there's any kind of work around I would really appreciate the help!","replies":[]}]}]}
