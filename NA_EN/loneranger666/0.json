It looks like you're posting on the NA account, was your main account always on NA? If it is indeed an NA account--as The 23rd Gamer mentioned--reach out to my colleagues through the Support Site so we can take a further look into it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-05-19T04:07:09.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to see you posting here - hope to see more (although I know you're probably busy, sometimes a Riot explanation is better than anything players could asplain :P)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The23rdGamer","date":"2019-05-17T17:56:36.910+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would first try waiting for a bit and then logging into your account again to see if your stuff is still gone or not.\n\nIf it is still gone, I'd contact [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let them know about your situation, since they are really the only ones that can modify your account any.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"nukie310","date":"2019-05-19T14:26:15.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:115}}","replies":[]}]}
