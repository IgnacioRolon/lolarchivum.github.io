Too many toxic players out there, and you run into them during champ selection, not only just inside the game. Or you wind up in another game with the same person you just reported the prior game for being toxic, trolling, etc.\r\n\r\nWould like to leave without any repercussions, mainly for the case of that. Yes I know it could be abused. But you could put a daily or weekly cap on how many times you could leave at champ selection.","replies":[{"poster":"Flyer Beast","date":"2015-11-22T21:26:32.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"NO, someone doesn't get the role they want they leave, and you will never get into a match. Idk why you thought this was a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Halthur","date":"2015-11-22T21:38:17.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I said there could be a daily or weekly cap. Say you can only dodge 3 games per week period.\nThat way people can't really abuse the function. And if you are so worried about it affecting ranked play. Say after you hit Gold rank, you can't use it, or limit it to Normal PvP.\n\nI mean if you get a person that is already toxic/trolling in champ selection. You really want to deal with a whole game with them, with an almost guaranteed loss. Or nip it in the bud, and hope the next guys are better.","replies":[{"poster":"Flyer Beast","date":"2015-11-22T21:39:32.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kind of true but there are so many people playing that even if it is limited somehow, it would still take too long.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GetMariahCarried","date":"2015-11-22T21:48:29.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All we need are more extensive mute choices. Mute in champ select. Mute in postgame. Mute pings. If you STILL think, \"I don't want to play with a bunch of jerks, whether I can hear them or not\", well, you're playing with a bunch of random people you don't know all the time as it is. You don't know what kind of people most of them are! If you can live with that, you can live with a bunch of players who's communication levels have been limited to that of a bot.\n\nDon't offer a solution like \"free dodges\" that will more often be used by the toxic people you have a problem with than the people on your side.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Archon X","date":"2015-11-22T21:05:02.673+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"no\n\nall red side has to do is not ban whoever is op and hope first pick blue doesn't grab them, and if they do, dodge for free\n\nno thanks","replies":[]}]}
