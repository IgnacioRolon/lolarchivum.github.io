It just goes to show why the game feels the way it does. On another note league is in a crumbling state, worst it&#039;s ever been since I&#039;ve started playing in season 4. I would like to see all of the champions that I spent time to grind and play in a useful state instead of just being there and if you pick them you get horribly demolished by meta and tanks. I also have noticed **many** other people on the board complaining and talking about the current game state. From what I&#039;ve seen from other MOBAs, they have a much better game state and all of their heroes are enjoyable and do not get ruined by meta-slave heroes, gods, or champions. Although these are different games entirely, it goes to show how I would much rather playing a game where everything is viable and fun rather than struggle to make my favorite champions fun and enjoyable. I would also like to see some serious changes in the mastery and runes department because they currently are **absolutely ** outdated and **do not** feel that they make and impact. They only feel like it&#039;s ruining the game state even more. They are **much** too stagnant and are **very** inflexible. I can&#039;t go into a game without choosing either an AD page or an AP page that haven&#039;t changed very much since season 5. The game needs some balancing in terms of champions and Riot should just do without the runes or masteries as they have only proven to strengthen meta and make the game very uninteresting and boring. If you have made it this far this means you have heard my opinion on the current game state and hopefully you agree whether you completely enjoy league and are currently furiously typing to tell me that I should get over my opinion and play the game, or you are a player who has felt the same thing and are currently wandering among a vast world of competitive gaming trying to figure out if it&#039;s worth still trying to climb to silver,gold,plat, diamond, masters, challenger, or the top of the leader board in league. If you are a Rioter reading this I hope you take this board post into consideration and bring it up and hastily fix the many problems that people are currently having with the game. I do not want to leave the money and time I have invested into this game and I&#039;m pretty sure others feel the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\nYouTuber&#039;s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CurliJrMFY5oX2FA9nsDA\r\n(The video wasn&#039;t mine, all respect goes to the video poster because he inspired me to create this board post.)\r\n\r\nBoard references: \r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Tm3LWPlF-a-statement-to-riot-games\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Nauyv7pT-sacrificing-game-quality-for-queue-time-is-not-okay\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/5p6y2x5c-lol-no-longer-feels-strategic\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Eu7nbuRR-remember-when-we-had-a-mastery-tree-that-allowed-us-to-make-decisions\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/pucWinQE-currently-in-a-game-where-a-duo-announced-their-inting-in-chat\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/tgEp7aKX-does-anyone-else-feel-the-same-way\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Tm3LWPlF-a-statement-to-riot-games","replies":[{"poster":"cinomenapplebae","date":"2017-01-17T21:59:50.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has a minimal amount of views since this guy is not very popular; He makes education videos rather than entertainment which is what games and league are all about.
