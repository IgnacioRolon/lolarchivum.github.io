It's possible that your MMR can drop enough to place you from Silver to Bronze.  Matchmaking will continue to place and move you around depending on your best fit.

I lost many matches while at 0 LP in G5, and was never demoted.\n\nI can't see any info about that in the FAQ, no difference between division demotion versus tiers demotion is mentioned at all. The rumors say that you need to have an MMR equivalent to Silver5 to get demoted from Gold5 into Silver, can you confirm it? (And potentially add it to the FAQ?)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heisenberg Salah","date":"2016-09-15T22:39:10.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY this seem to be more convincing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SCRIPT TESTER","date":"2016-09-15T22:17:01.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no but it takes more losses","replies":[{"poster":"Heisenberg Salah","date":"2016-09-15T22:18:00.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how much do u guess?","replies":[]}]}]}
