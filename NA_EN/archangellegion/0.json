I had an idea and wanted to know what others think about it.\r\nWhat if the banner of comand {{item:3060}}  realy did allow you to comand a group of minions like for example Yorick{{champion:83}}  can do with his Mist walkers. What if the banner of comand could allow you to recruit your lane minions slightly buffing them and making them follow you and obey your orders like go to a certain position or attack a certain champion. For example riot could make so that you can recruit up to 10 minions and they will help you wherever you go. I personally think that this would be fun to play with unlike the current version of this item. Drop a like on my post if you like this idea so that maybe riot notices it.","replies":[]}
