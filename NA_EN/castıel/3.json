Does it need to be an S for a chest? I also know i can get a party mate who gets an S gives me a chest if i havent gotten one yet with that champion. Im just wondering if it has to be an S or is this a bug. I also found i got a chest with master yi with an s- and i dont remember being in a party when i got a chest with him. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T04:57:21.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you link me the match or screenshot the match from your match history in-client so I can take a look? Any S-, S or S+ should grant a chest *once* during the season as long as you had a chest available when it happened, so if you didn't have one available to earn (look at your profile, top right corner) then you wouldn't have earned one for the S- grade. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[{"poster":"Castıel","date":"2016-11-02T05:07:57.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure this is the game http://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2309553021/231262372?tab=overview I also had 2 chests available and i beleived i got one from yasuo or alistar.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-02T21:20:24.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After checking your account, it looks like you didn't receive a chest because you didn't have one available at the time.
