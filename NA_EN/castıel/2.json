But now i have no access to this. Was this removed? Or i just cant find the setting? thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-09T05:19:08.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're looking for *Quick Cast with* ***indicators***.

Knowing the range is a really good way to judge whether you should use that ability and the rest is all up your judgment on when to pop the button again to detonate it.","replies":[{"poster":"what you deserve","date":"2016-11-10T21:48:13.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pressing the button again doesn't pop the ability. It'll make the ability detonate when it lands where you pointed, but you can't detonate in midair. At least, this is the case with Lux E. I haven't specifically tried the rest.\n\nEDIT: Anivia and Aurelion Sol working as intended. Seems like just Lux with this problem, and obviously that's still enough that I can't use it since she's my highest mastery champ. Probably something to do with the fact that her E isn't considered a line skillshot? I don't know. Still, literally unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-10T22:13:54.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just checked to confirm with my game team that you aren't supposed to be able to detonate Lux's E midair.

Maybe you still feel a difference for very fast-paced combo champs, but in most cases, you just don't press your buttons with the same timings, but you actually fire your spells just as fast.\n\nThe main problem is that there is a huge habit and muscle memory factor. I'm used to pressing my buttons early and get ready to release them, so when I try to play with no indicators, I'm just firing my spells in the air too early.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zerenza","date":"2016-11-09T22:18:26.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it doesn't, you can double tap your abilities to fire at the same speed but basically most pro player's use it because they've gotten used to it and it feels the same+increases accuracy on certain abilities. \n\nI for example cannot use Orianna Q with quick cast with indicator.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
