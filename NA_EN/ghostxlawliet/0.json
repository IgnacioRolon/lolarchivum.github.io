My Gmail and league account had the same password, I didn't think to check my league account until when I tried to play and it told that I was logged in on another computer, this took place on the 19th. I've haven't played on nobody computer so I knew someone had my account at that point. I changed the password and email on my league account and everything was fine after doing so but I work a lot so can't play so much. I didn't even play a game after recovering my account I just left the client open. Until today I got a email stating that my account was banned. I created a support ticket and explained it in the ticket and even sent a screenshot of the email from Google that someone had my password to show my Gmail associated with my league account was compromised.\r\n\r\nIs there anything else I should do? I even stated that my match history is champions I don't even play seeing as I only play adc/sup.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T21:40:08.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can help with this!
