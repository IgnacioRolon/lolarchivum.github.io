Why is this possible?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought if I blocked and reported them I would never have to face them again, but why was I forced to play with them again?\r\n\r\nIt was a duo and 1 of them was especially toxic in the game where I blocked (and reported) him, and now I meet them again, not even 24 hours later, him again beeing the king of saltyness and toxicdity!\r\nWhy would I want to have them on my team again? I blocked them for a reason!\r\nEther you have a flaw in the system, which was overlocked, or I would suggest you should look into this \"feature\" a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-11-02T18:33:07.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking doesn't consider blocked players.  While it 's a great way to prevent potential harassment from a player, using it to block players from joining the same game could be incredibly abusive.  There's likely chance that folks might use it negatively or to avoid players who had a bad game.  In addition to blocking, make sure to use the reporting tool so we can review cases of negative gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Desert","date":"2017-11-02T19:31:30.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im honestly not so sure about the incredibly abusiv part, of course it can be \"abused\" to rule out \"bad\" players judged only by 1 game, but normaly people show there true colors in these matches. And I dont have fun playing with them again, nor do they have fun to play with me (assumingly). So it can happen that someone gets blocked because of their performance, I personally only block them if they are toxic, not because they played badly.\n\nSo while I agree that there are cases of \"abuse\" possible, but to me the benefits outwage this by alot.\nAnd yes I will still report them too. Speaking it doesnt feel that impactfull to report them, I know they will evtl. get punished but it doesnt **feel** impactfull :/\n\nSo did you ever had a disscussion about blocking influencing matchmaking? Or maybe I could roll the ball a bit and you guys might look into it?\nAgain, to me it feels pretty onesided in terms of benefits vs risks, and only in rare cases at dia+  could possible influence the \"pool\" of guys you can play with, the rest should be fine if you block a couple duzent of guys.\n(maybe this block could be a temporary 1 month block too, if you are concerned about the pool)\nJust thossing some ideas out at this point :P\n\nAnyway thx for your fast reply, you guys at player sup do an awesome job!\nDealing with the frontend on this is surely not an easy task :P","replies":[]}]}]}
