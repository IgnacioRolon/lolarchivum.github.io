Which for most people that use projectiles means melting, and instant death from whoever they're aiming at.\n\nAlso the wall is actually wider than it appears so people standing inside of it are safe from any and all projectiles.\n\n\nYeah Yasuo can do whatever the fuck he wants but the wind wall is getting it's hate for a reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynikus","date":"2017-01-09T00:48:45.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You're telling ALL of them, to Reposition because one champion used a basic ability that nullifies ALL of the damage and effect their projectiles did for 4 seconds.\n\nyes, that's exactly what I'm saying.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Limmie","date":"2017-01-09T04:07:30.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't hate Yasuo as much as I hate 95% of people that play him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EnjoytheSilence9","date":"2017-01-09T02:00:13.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think  you grasped the concept I was going for.
