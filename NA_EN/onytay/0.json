Do me a favor and troubleshoot your network settings like port forwarding and DNS options really quick following the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and test it in a custom game first. \n\nOn the note of those LPQ's, those will only decrease by playing matchmade games. The only way to get those removed is by queueing up and staying through matches till the end. I'd definitely suggest working with us to troubleshoot that network first to make sure this doesn't happen more often though!","replies":[{"poster":"felyobig9","date":"2017-11-17T02:24:45.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I know you're from riot so i can tell you there's not only this guys who's having a problem , they're a lot of people who can't play because of a black or white screen opening after the champ select , like we cannot even go out of the window , we literally have to close ur computer everytime and we can't play a single game right now and it's not only me :/ if you can do something with the people who keeps lol working it would be really appreciate :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wildbill101","date":"2017-11-17T01:42:03.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having  the same problem. I can login to LOL fine. Get into champ select fine. As soon as everyone is locked in and the start counter hits 0 the game crashes.  I get a BEX error. I try over and over to rejoin the game before it starts and it fails.  Once the team FF league loads as if I never disconnected.  I see my team talking trash and begging for me to be reported.  I looked up the error code I was getting and tried some fixes.  The only problem is in order to test if the fix worked is to log into a game.  If my fix didn't work (still haven't fixed) then my que time goes up. Now any time I want to see if my fix worked (uninstall, reinstall, changing files inside folder, updating drivers, Hexteck fix, running in comp mode.......) I have to wait 20 min to find out if the fix worked and like I said if it didn't I receive further punishment from RIOT. I JUST WANT TO PLAY!!!!!!!!","replies":[]}]}
