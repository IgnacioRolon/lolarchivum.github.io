But whenever I try to play a ranked team game I join the team, queue up, get into champ select and after a few moments everything starts going wrong. I usually make it through the ban phase okay, but as soon as people start selecting champions I stop receiving accurate information from the client. It'll show the wrong champs selected, fail to properly swap focus to the players currently picking, no show champions having been selected at all. On the off chance that it finally manages to display that it's my turn to pick, if I attempt to pick a champion it gives me an infinite Retrieving Data: Loading message that doesn't go away.\r\n\r\nWhen the client inevitably dodges me, it shows the other players leaving game, but leaves me stuck staring at the rage-inducing bug I'm trying to deal with. And I can't properly test this bug or try to work around it because Leaverbuster is totally screwing me and my team and preventing me from starting games.\r\n\r\nI've run hextech repair tool and followed suggestions for fixing DNS problems, but I'm still getting issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Fury Golem","date":"2016-08-29T02:46:01.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not use either of those programs, or any other third-party programs that interact with LoL in any way I'm aware of.  \n\nI did, however, go through the full list of recommended fixes of connection issues; .net fix, DNS flush, client repair, hextech repair tool, disabled extraneous services through windows, etc.  And that seemed to solve my problem.  Don't know which of those fixed it, but apparently broad-spectrum antibiotics was the way to go.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T17:05:33.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue sounds to me like your connection is losing sync in champion select and causing you to leave your group; though, it's weird it only happens in a team game.  There could be other factors causing this as well though, like third party programs that poorly interact for league.  Some players have had similar issues while using apps like play.tv or overwolf, so I recommend removing them if that's the case for you.  I also suggest using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to help get this fixed up.  Let me know if you still have any issues afterwards!","replies":[]}]}
