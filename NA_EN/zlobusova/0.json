When I play the game works as normal but in a random second of the game the whole computer freezes and I can't do anything with the computer ( alt+tab, ctrl+alt+delete, alt+f4 ) I have to restart the whole computer and then it doesn't freeze until the end of the game. But when I then start another game it freezes again. At the start the freezing was accompanied by a buzzing sound from the speakers but then I disabled one sound device and it still freezes but without the sound. The GPU software tells me the drivers are up to date and DirectX12 is installed. Any help ?","replies":[{"poster":"SlapShotMan19","date":"2016-09-27T22:59:10.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having a similar issue.

Specifically, the [Xbox Game Bar](http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8637-game-bar-turn-off-windows-10-a.html) is enabled and causing issues with the game.  Your best bet would be to disable it for the fix.  That should the issue!","replies":[]}]}
