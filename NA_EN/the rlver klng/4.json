Thank you Riot. Did you at all actually research Dante while making the skin? I wouldn't be surprised, because there are some pretty clever allusions there, and I can tell his taunts towards specific champions will be thematically appropriate to the nine rings.\n\nGatekeeper Galio was one of the first skins I ever purchased, but I always felt let down because it never lived up to its 1820 pricetag. Now I am beyond ecstatic I own the skin.

In comparison to Galio feeling fresh, Gatekeeper doesn't feel legendary in comparison. Too many shared animations(taunt, dance, etc) for a Legendary in 2017.. but the same thing happened with other old legendaries reworked, Firefighter Tristana comes to mind. It's A REALLY GOOD skin, but not something I'd pay 1820 these days for and since I don't own it and there's bargain Galio skins that feel pretty awesome too coming out.. I dunno.. I have this problem with a lot of VGUs.. the 520s seem crazy bargain and the more expensive ones seem like kind of a rip, only because the standard bar of all the skins of the champion is brought up so much. Sorry for the mini-rant, It's really good and the work on it is amazing. I just wish all skins were able to come down price-tiers over time.
