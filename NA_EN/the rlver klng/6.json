Looking back at the last few marksmen released, we discovered something that’s been null from our roster for a long time: a super high-risk, high-reward marksman, in the vein of well… Vayne.\n\nPlease don't. Vayne's an archaic ball of stats champion with little to no interactivity. Her counterplay boils down to essentially 'CC lock her until she dies' which is the worst and most frustrating feeling in the world. She's safe, mobile, self-sufficient, and hits like a fucking truck. When she's bad she gets bullied into uselessness. When she's good she's the single most unfun and infuriating champ in the game to face.\n\nSelf-sufficient 'hunter' style ADCs have always been balancing nightmares - Lucian, Twitch, Quinn, Vayne, etc. Getting a Void ADC is nice (even though a support would have been better to complete the team comp), getting a Void ADC based off of Vayne's 'feast or famine past twenty minutes I win now' design is not. Vayne is terrible, terrible design that has been kept alive for years because Riot doesn't want to confront her large, loud, and entitled playerbase. Please do not design ADCs based off of her, her kit, her playstyle, or whatever her fantasy is supposed to be. \n\nBesides, the entire marksmen class is low risk, maximum reward at all times anyway. I don't see how this new ADC is gonna break that rule with this god-awful meta we've had for the last two seasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Late For Tea","date":"2018-01-31T21:43:04.959+0000","up_votes":92,"down_votes":2,"body":"High risk high reward champions are always a nightmare to balance, because once you learn the champion well (e.g. one-tricks) the risk is significantly lower, and you're left with a broken champion that feels cheap and unfun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"THE RlVER KlNG","date":"2018-01-31T21:49:07.783+0000","up_votes":64,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{champion:268}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:157}} have all had this problem in the past or currently.
