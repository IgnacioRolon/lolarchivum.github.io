I don&#039;t play either of those champions but I was thinking about that today and how it is the only actually gameplay altering Easter egg, and while arguments could be made against it, I just feel it&#039;s been an awesome part of League for as long as those two champions have coexisted and I hope it will be kept through the Assasin roster update.","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-09-01T21:15:42.958+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll be keeping the Rengar/Kha'Zix quest after the assassin update.

Because for Rengar what he gets is something he can accomplish regardless if Kha is in a game or not if he gets enough kills but for Kha its very beneficial for him since he can get all his skills evolved.   Personally I feel like he should be able to evolve all his skills regardless of if there is a rengar in his game or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sad Tyrant","date":"2016-09-02T02:07:10.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":11,"body":"If Rengar or Kha'zix is not in the game, can we have a purchasable (at level 16) called Rengar meat and Kha'zix Head","replies":[{"poster":"Wind Whistler","date":"2016-09-03T00:36:36.793+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sad Tyrant,realm=OCE,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=EpmEftsM,comment-id=0001000000000002,timestamp=2016-09-02T02:07:10.491+0000)\n>\n> If Rengar or Kha&#x27;zix is not in the game, can we have a purchasable (at level 16) called Rengar meat and Kha&#x27;zix Head\n\nRengar's meat...
