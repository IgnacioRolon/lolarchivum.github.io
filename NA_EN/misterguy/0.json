We spent 95% of our time figuring out who he is and should be in game. And the other 5%... well, that was spent listening to industrial metal music. No time left for anything else.\n\nMaybe unofficial art will crop up at some point, though? \n\nUntil then, maybe you could check out some of the early Urgot concepts, if you haven't already. Victor, aka 3rdColossus, did a lot of explorations of who Urgot could be, some more on the \"before\" side (focusing on the human/man), some frighteningly not. The Tick ftw!\n\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/kdWNK","replies":[{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2017-10-09T18:24:52.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Interlocutioner, just wanted to say GL on creating an awesome narrative for my boy {{champion:50}}, i think you nailed Urgot so hoping the same for everyone's favorite birb","replies":[{"poster":"Interlocutioner","date":"2017-10-10T20:56:20.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks Spideraxe!
