Most recruitment threads are for just a team, only a select few are for a community or simply any group larger than 7 players/coaches.\r\nWe pride ourselves as being the right blend of everything a dedicated player needs. \r\nWhile we do not put players on our roster if they have no desire to play scrims, we are always willing to support any player dedicated to their own growth.\r\nSimply said, if you are dedicated to league, we will find a spot for you or make a spot for you if it is in our power. We also talk to each of our members, staff and player to ensure that there are no issues socially, as well as that they feel like they are improving. When they feel as if they have not been, we figure out why. \r\nAs a growing organization Desperado Esports is proud and dedicated to giving our best to everyone. And we expect the same from our members; Passion for the dream that is League of Legends and Competition to be the best you can be.\r\n\r\nTo Apply:\r\nPlease click the linka bove and fill out our application form \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ETOLWgvPmiQ5r9ElmxVWyQcl-PmY502TlJ1nBqcZwnU","replies":[{"poster":"Exxtrauser","date":"2017-07-15T21:51:29.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i contacted someone today and they blocked me","replies":[]},{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2017-03-18T02:44:54.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" \"esports\"\n\n \"docs.google\"\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]}
