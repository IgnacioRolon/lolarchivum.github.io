You want to ban this champ, but wait, your 5th pick player has chosen the champ because \"i want to play them\" (but in reality they're just trolling you and using that as their excuse so they don't get caught doing it).\n\nYes, this is an extreme, but pick/ban champs happen all the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Imperial Pandaa","date":"2017-12-30T22:58:14.956+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, if I want to ban a high contest pick I should be able to ban a high contest pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Bandle","date":"2017-12-30T23:04:00.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would remove quite a bit of agency from the ban phase, which is why 5-ban was given in the first place.
