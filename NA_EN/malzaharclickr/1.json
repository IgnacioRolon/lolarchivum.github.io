Anyways , me and another kid in a match were saying to each other how they should give you BE ( even a little ) after a match, now ive been playing for long hours of the day , around 8-10 and everyday since pre-season and I'm only level 37 and I get really bad stuff when I hit a new level like for example ill get \"Annie\" that's 90 BE , if it takes a long time to level up and I'm only getting stuff for 90-270 BE its really not worth it . And its usually 2-5 champs il get in a champion capsule . Please give us even if its only like 30 BE after a game cause it really adds up , it will take forever to buy the champs I want.
