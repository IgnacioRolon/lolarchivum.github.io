Then it made me \"dodge\" the que and now I gotta wait a set amount of time , if this happens again il just be wasting my limited time to play cause of leaver busters or whatever , for something that's not even my fault, low spec enabled too, thanks riot. Call this toxicity but I have a freedom of speech , its honestly a joke as to when I have to wait for something I didn't even do .","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-19T21:40:30.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You weren't specifically dodging no, but it sounds like your network didn't have a strong enough connection to send that champion selection through quick enough. Basically, you did lock-in but that click lagged so long that the timer ended before it was registered. \n\nAn ethernet connection might be able to help with that if you're running wifi right now, but I'd also change your DNS to googles (8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4) as well as updating your port forwarding settings to see if you can get a smoother link with the game servers. If you aren't sure how to make those adjustments check out those steps in the [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for a walkthrough.","replies":[{"poster":"MalzaharClickR","date":"2017-11-20T10:15:27.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry , was rather in the heat of the moment making this comment , it was just annoying to get penalized for something that wasn't my fault , and my room and a little bit too far from my front room , idk how long they can go.","replies":[]}]}]}
