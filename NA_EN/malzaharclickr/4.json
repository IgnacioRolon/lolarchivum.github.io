It does also factor in your previous ranking a bit though as well.","replies":[{"poster":"MalzaharClickR","date":"2017-09-22T01:56:55.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just say if I have a positive rank score like say 6-4 will I get gold / silver . or will that mostlikely be bronze rip","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-09-22T02:41:29.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really say for sure.

I use an app called LoL Sumo that calculates my gameplay wards , team kill participation, towers , kills , death etc and all that jazz it says I play at the level of a plat/gold so I hopefully get that.","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanGhidora","date":"2017-09-26T20:31:12.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had that app for a little while and it overestimates values way too much. A lot of this game is changing your playstyle to meet the demands of the game state. While it is a good guide for what you should practice on (if given the opportunity), I've had accounts which told me I was Challenger on yet if I'm in Bronze 5 on that account, I can't take it seriously.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GentlemanGhidora","date":"2017-09-26T20:25:11.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have difficulty believing this. With how many people complained about dropping entire tiers on the new season for their renewed placements, I have (again) difficulty believing a new account is hard to guess to their initial placing.\n\nAlso, while I am unsure one way or the other on this, as far as I have ever been led to acknowledge over the years is that initial games of a placement have more \"weight\" than ones later on, meaning losses early on swing your placement downwards more easily.\n\nExample of what I've read over the years which remains relatively consistent but if there is actual confirmation of if this is an urban myth, I would welcome it:\n\nPlayer A goes 4 losses, then a win, a loss, then 4 more wins.\n\nPlayer B goes 3 wins, a loss, 3 wins, then 3 more losses.\n\nPlayer C goes 3 losses, 3 wins, 1 losses, then 4 more wins.\n\nFrom what I understand, and again feel free to clarify this so I know what information is incorrect, the following happens:\n\nPlayer A is ranked lowest being they have 5 wins, but is MUCH lower rank than Players B and C because of heavier losses in the first half of their placements. Player C is ranked above A but not enough to \"feel good\" about winning 2 more games overall due to a similar initial loss streak early on. Player B is probably a tier higher than Players A and C but is still really low in division and possibly in danger of dropping to next tier down.\n\nFor relatively simple viewing, let's give a rough estimate as:\n\nPlayer A is Bronze 4, Player B is Silver 5, Player C is Bronze 2.\n\nAgain, I have to work through a lot of information here but does this sound roughly what one might expect?\n\nAlso, since there's a reasonable amount of debate/disbelief in this, what kind of damage does dodging have on placements?\n\nI ask this final question because my client went a bit weird and wouldn't register that I had, indeed, locked in my pick. A dodge that wasn't even my fault is more tilting than the games I've already had trying to adapt to cheesy situations against players already way higher than I should be facing against in my placements.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
