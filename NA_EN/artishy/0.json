All you have to do is select the second monitor as your primary in your Windows settings, and league will launch on your bigger screen.

The primary monitor has the notification bar - which I want to be visible while on my other monitor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hello I am Bird","date":"2016-09-17T18:07:58.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, this is what I do as well and it only screws up like 1 out of every 25 times and Im pretty sure its just my computer that's screwing it up","replies":[{"poster":"Artishy","date":"2016-09-17T18:56:31.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hello I am Bird,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=1zh1hTQs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-17T18:07:58.183+0000)\n>\n> Yep, this is what I do as well and it only screws up like 1 out of every 25 times and Im pretty sure its just my computer that&#x27;s screwing it up\n\nAlright, Thanks for the feedback guys!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
