I called my ISP and they said that the 'outside' line/wire is great, which means it's either something on the inside or something on the server that i'm connecting to. I have a wired Ethernet connection to my PC and have an 18 Mb/s connection speed. So what happens is I can't really see certain animations or updates when the interruption happens, but i can feel that i'm still a little bit connected. So for example I can't see someone auto, but i can see the health bar going down for the person they're attacking, also they're movement is a bit eh.\r\n\r\nIf it's not the connection between me and the game server, then if someone can help diagnose what might be wrong on the 'inside' of my house.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-03-01T23:45:34.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The symptoms you've described are pretty commonly attributed to *Packet Loss*.
