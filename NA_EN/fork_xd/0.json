You have the audacity to ban me based on language while presenting evidence consisting of a game where somebody not only admitted to intentional feeding but also containing much intended as well as uncalled for instigation and counter toxicity. You ignorantly use a system that pulls text from a match on a personal level singling out an individual involved in an argument. Not only is this biased ( I figure it is automated as well) but it is illogical beyond comprehension. Not only have I dedicated hundreds of hours and dollars in your game but I have also brought many friends to the playing field. Yet still you continue to ban such players due to a faulty &quot;modern&quot; idea that my individual rights to express my opinion end where somebody else&#039;s feelings begin. Not only is this absolutely illogical and unconstitutional at base, but it is also a cancerous way of thinking that should not be spread by your administration. You have taken the time to implement a mute button as well as chat filter. While you explain that these are last resorts, this explanation is both mundane and ignorant. Which is the simpler option; continuing to chat mute and ban a player, or let the community use the tools at their disposal (which you implemented under the logic that they would be used; a logic that is undermined when you render them useless). You are coddling a community of players that take advantage of your failed system to push a population with different morals and standards out of your game. I find this not only disgusting but completely unprofessional when considering the scale of your game. I would also like to point out that your community moderators are neither emotionally intelligent enough nor able an any way to speak for a community of people as they have tried to do in previous tickets I have submitted. If your staff is unable to take the perspective of more than one social group then I feel that they do not have the mental capacity to handle such matters as banning an account worth such money ( Nor do I think anybody in your company as a whole has any idea what should be done to promote healthy social growth within a community of such scale).","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-10-11T03:19:28.101+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which is correct? To coddle those who feel they deserve the right to harass and abuse people, or to coddle those who feel they deserve the right to relax free from harassment and abuse? I would argue it's entirely dependent on your personal opinion -- but, since the the punishment system's rules are based on what the community selects, it's actually not coddling at all. Instead, it's the community dictating rules for itself rather than Riot dictating what the community wants. If people all stopped reporting hate speech tomorrow, all hate speech would be allowed, because you are never punished for things that you are not reported for. The fact that you are currently in the minority is unfortunate for you, and I appreciate your perspective, but it doesn't mean the system needs to adapt to fit your personal (and equally subjective) viewpoint.\n\nFurther, a privately run organization is free to set their rules as they see fit. This is why if you abuse people at a Starbucks, or at a movie theater, the management can and will ask you to leave -- and they are not in violation of your individual rights when they do so, as you have a right to your speech and your opinions, but you do NOT have an inherent right to broadcast those on THEIR platform.","replies":[{"poster":"Fork xD","date":"2017-10-11T05:34:16.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Neither is right which was the point of the post.  The idea is to let the community use the implemented features instead of pushing one view over the other.  Also, to \"harass\" is to instigate or bother without cause.  This isn't the case in many circumstances but is overlooked based on the preference of some players not to take the time to report.   Furthermore if you actually believe that the \"community selects code of conduct\" then you are naive.  \n\nWhen it comes to hate speech, you may also want to be careful.  \"Hate speech is, outside the law, speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender, ethnic origin, religion, race, disability, or sexual orientation.\"-google definition.  There is a defined line between hate speech and banter and the league community is usually ignorant enough to use terms (such as yourself) without actually realizing the nature of them.  \n\nYour point on me being a minority is hypocritical in the sense that you bring up your own viewpoint (which is that the sensitive players are the majority which is not backed by statistics nor facts) which is also a fault when it comes to riots logic. \n\nLastly, I never said I had a right to express my opinions openly on their platform, but rather I suggested that an actual \"fair\" use of the system should be used. \n\nSo before you come at me with subjective/bias views in favor of riot for the sake of saving face, please take the time to add some logic.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2017-10-11T11:45:35.352+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fork xD,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=hg6mTfm0,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2017-10-11T05:34:16.455+0000)Neither is right which was the point of the post.

Until I'm provided with better statistics or proof of them lying, I will believe the facts that I'm presented with that seem reasonable given how the system works. If you have hard facts to contest this, by all means share them. Otherwise, I would extend your same statement about logic and facts back at you, because a claim that it is naive to trust the only statistics available is highly subjective at best.\n\nRegardless, it seems apparent that we will simply disagree.

I once overheard a colleague go over to another colleagues lab and begin to yell at him because he had logged in to a computer for one of the instruments at his desk and had forgotten to log out.  The tantrum was overheard through the whole building, and the colleague who was being yelled at began to yell back.\n\nAnd do you want to know what happened? Nothing...\n\nHe left the building because the IT guy was gone and he couldn't get into his computer which lost him valuable time for his projects.  This was also unfortunate, because time IS money.\n\nThe person who was getting yelled at began to justify himself and the one who was doing the yelling ran off in a tantrum and got nothing accomplished. However, had he been more respectful and had asked gently for corroboration instead of demanding it, i'm sure the other colleague could have asked one of his students to go unlock the computer for him.  If he had been more gentle, it would have saved him a bunch of time and effort to remove the lock on his computer and it would have saved him the embarrassment. \n\nRight now, you remind me of the guy who was throwing a tantrum.  Though \"educated\" you are still \"ignorant\" of the effects of your own behavior.\n\nRegardless of how you feel about your own misbehavior, I'm sorry to say that you entirely deserve whatever disciplinary action was taken against you.

You are still arrested for assault but the defense of provocation is only going to lessen the overall punishment. What you say or do is completely held against you and it doesn't matter what the context is in the majority of cases. \n\nAlso really important to note unless you used a big trigger word like kys, you had to be a dick A LOT to actually get banned. You are just an asshole blaming the system for something you did because you can't admit to saying, yeah, I was a piece of shit there and deserve that.\n\nThis system works perfectly fine because it holds the player to account of what they say or do. Regardless of the context because if you are toxic, you are apart of the problem, almost no matter what the case is. Now there could be good reasons why but because of a inting player? No. You play the game, mute him and then get people to report him. That is how you solve the problem. Not by sinking to his level and giving him 100% what he wants.\n\nNot posting your chat logs is just you trying to bait for support.","replies":[{"poster":"sanshaoye","date":"2017-10-11T22:52:40.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"assault is a crime, insulting people except where you can prove \"hate speech\" is not. totally flawed example, at least get your logic right please","replies":[{"poster":"Fork xD","date":"2017-10-12T00:06:26.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Verbal assault is not a crime.
