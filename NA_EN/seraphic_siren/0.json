But I want to bring that out that lulu  is actually missing her running very fast animation.\r\nI remember there was a bug during her star guardian skin released period. Her running animation was bugged and then Riot claimed to fixed it. However, it wasn't completely fixed.\r\n\r\nBefore the skin was released, lulu used to have her running very fast animation ( which is now her homeguard animation only) when she was above MS 400. It is like the running animation of Nami's \"swim walk\" naturally when she is fast enough just with boots (not with other buff/ homeguard). Lulu is supposed to run with a different animation, instead of now, using the \"staff pointing to the front\" animation even has an above 400 MS. I think maybe the process of adding new star guardian lulu running animation kind of mess of the program, but I really would like to see her going back to her cute running animation back. There was no point to change it at all, you can remain that animation for her \"above 400 MS animation\" and \"homeguard animation\" at the same time.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/4Raw2bJQLzQ?t=10m3s\r\n\r\nThis is just a random video I find on Youtube. After aphromoo bought mobi boots, lulu had a different animation of running. She had that animation when she was 400 MS up or homeguard. But now, we only see that when lulu is in homeguard buff.\r\n\r\nI have been waiting long enough and seem like no one is talking about this. So I would like to remind this issue to all the players. Please be aware of this mistake that has been mistakenly made by the team. I sincerely hope there will be a change soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Wav3Break","date":"2017-05-10T17:41:56.352+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this!

Cause OP posted in the wrong section (report a bug's a ghost town anyway so i don't blame him/her). Meanwhile Jayce has multiple missing weapon animations for more than two years and all i got was \"we're not looking to fix it\" with no context at all from riot exegeniar.","replies":[]}]}]}
