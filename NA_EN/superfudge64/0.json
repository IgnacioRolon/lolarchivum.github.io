He has tried both but that doesn't seem to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI don't want him to get banned over something he has absolutely no control over. he got me back into lol, and the game is making a lota progress, and it would suck if I didn't have anyone to play it with.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-10T04:01:07.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weeeeell we definitely want to keep your bud in the game with you, and jungling can be preeeeetty hard without any abilities. It sounds to me like their keybindings might be a little corrupted somehow and not saving to the servers correctly. Let's try doing a hard reset on those files to make sure he can use all of his abilities.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n- Delete the file  named **game.cfg** and **persistedsettings.json**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[]}]}
