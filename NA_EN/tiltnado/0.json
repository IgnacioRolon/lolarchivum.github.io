I've tried multiple times with multiple amounts and it never goes anywhere. It lets me sign into paypal and \"complete\" the transaction but then jumps me back to the third step. No money has left my account as of yet and its been 3 days. Any help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-22T17:05:21.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It almost sounds like there is a hiccup at Paypal's processing step that's failing to complete the transaction.
