The talon player will see &quot;Invulnerable!&quot; appear, see the blood graphic, and hear the collision sound. **The collision detection only occurs when Talon&#039;s W returns to him.** I&#039;m curious to know why this is the case, as it might help with locating the cause of the bug.\r\n\r\nPicture proof:\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bA28P6j.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nAs seen in the picture above, the dark spheres are bleeding from Talon&#039;s W. \r\n\r\nWhile this interaction is a specific, isolated case, it has a 100% reproduction rate and can actually affect the decision making of a player. Talon&#039;s W produces audio feedback to the player when it collides with an enemy. If Talon uses his W on brush with no vision, and it connects with a dark sphere, the Talon player (if unaware of the bug) could assume there&#039;s an enemy champion in that brush because of the collision audio feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote - I only tested this interaction using SSW Talon and Classic Syndra on howling abyss. I don&#039;t think the bug is map/skin exclusive, but on the off chance that it is, here is how to actually reproduce it consistently.\r\n\r\n100% Reproduction steps:\r\n\r\n1. SSW Talon and Classic Syndra should be on opposite teams of Howling Abyss.\r\n2. Have Syndra drop a dark sphere (for full effect, have her drop multiple spheres inside a brush)\r\n3. Have Talon use his W on the dark spheres. When the blades return, they will produce audio and visual feedback that they have collided with an enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"M eye Abe","date":"2015-11-17T22:23:46.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey jannamechanics,\n\nNice to see that you're still passionate about the bugs in our game.  This is a well written ticket with a lot of context and I'll include it in our internal documentation. I remember speaking to you about bugs at the sushi restaurant. Recalling that discussion, I'll be straight and say that this bug's priority is lower than average since it needs talon and syndra on opposing teams and a ball to be in fog where talon rakes to feel some pain as the talon. We'll document it accordingly with all of your context. Thanks for the report mate x.^","replies":[{"poster":"Mârty","date":"2015-11-17T22:42:44.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a fun sushi experience!\n\nI figured this bug wouldn't be urgent enough to fix next patch. They're both fairly unpopular champions right now, and the actual issue requires a perfect storm to affect a game, so it's totally understandable. I'm glad that it's documented though, thanks a ton!","replies":[]}]}]}
