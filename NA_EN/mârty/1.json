The bug is not present when you do not have the insight mastery and only have your summoner spells reduced by your boots, as proven below.\r\n\r\nThe first picture shows the normal, no-mastery summoner spell cooldown. The picture after shows the summoner spell cooldown even after I have levelled up once with the boots.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TiJ9shw.jpg \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Hwsk96r.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\n1. Get Insight mastery (reduces summoner spell cooldowns by 15%) (flash 300seconds -&gt; 255 seconds)\r\n2. Buy Ionian boots of lucidity (reduces summoner spell cooldowns by 10%) (flash 255 seconds -&gt; 225 seconds)\r\n3. Level up once - your summoner spell cooldowns will go up by 10%. (flash 225 seconds -&gt; 255 seconds)\r\n4. If you sell your boots, your summoner spell cooldowns will go up again to a weird, not-possibly number (255 seconds -&gt; 285 seconds)","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Time Wizard","date":"2015-11-17T03:08:54.347+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, thanks for the super well-written report!

Thankfully it didn't take too long to get an easy reproduction, and after that I just toyed with anything that interacts with summoner spell cooldowns (mastery + selling the boots) and see the results. That kind of information could be helpful for the devs when looking for the cause, so I included as much as I could find.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-11-17T02:51:37.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to speak off topic, but how's Janna in the preseason, compared to before?","replies":[{"poster":"M창rty","date":"2015-11-17T03:07:04.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=sYkTHFtd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-17T02:51:37.431+0000)\n>\n> Sorry to speak off topic, but how's Janna in the preseason, compared to before?\n\nTraditional supports in general are less of a burden when picked into tank/pick supports now. With the new frost queens claim, new trinket options, and cheaper pink wards, traditional supports are better equipped to fight in the vision war. She was in an okay spot before, she's in a good spot now, but I'd still like to find out how much her passive skews her power, and if it's worth nerfing it to give her cool effects somewhere else on her kit. \n\nAP items being more expensives sucks a little for players like me who enjoy stacking AP on her (death cap costing 3800 fml). Overall though, definitely a buff.","replies":[]}]}]}
