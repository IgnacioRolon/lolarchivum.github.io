The item is already broken. Ranged just exposes it more. If an item is broken on a ranged champion, it's still OP on melee champions, people just tend to say that the melee champion is playing well, etc... I'm sorry, but the ranged champion is playing well too. \n\nThis Edge of Night madness for example. A 10 sec spellshield on that short of a cooldown? That's broken. It has NOTHING to do with ranged champions. Melee champions make better use of it than ranged champions do.\n\nLet me repeat that: Melee champions make better use of it than ranged champions do.\n\nEVERY item that has ever been nerfed because the boards has circle-jerked about ranged champions avoiding it, melee champions have made BETTER USE OF.\n\nTo explain for this example since no one ever seems to understand it:\nMelee champions WERE ALREADY BALANCED before Edge of Night became a thing / got buffs. There's NO DENYING that. They win games still, they get picked still. So, what is more beneficial? A spell shield on a champion who is in point blank range to do what they're designed to do, or on a champion who is at a distance they can dodge from?\n\nIt's completely OBVIOUS that the melee champion benefits more from the item. The ranged champion could have dodged your skillshot anyways and outplayed you. The spellshield just makes it safer for them. The melee champion would not have dodged the spell, and the shield made the counterplay to them (using some form of CC to be able to kite them) non-existant. \n\nSame goes for every other item that has been \"nerfed\" because of \"ranged abuse\".\nSteraks was better on melees, of course it scales with your health which melees have more of and build more of. It also scales with base stats which melees get more of. \n\nIt's not the fault of ranged champions. Ranged champions only start building items designed for melees because the item design is over the top OP. There's nothing else to it. Melee-oriented itemization is so many miles better than ranged itemization that ranged champions start buying items designed for melees. The items are themselves broken. It has nothing to do with the ranged champions.","replies":[{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-02-12T15:34:41.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Entirely 100% wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2017-02-12T15:43:55.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MissingKayo,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=AigsuViY,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2017-02-12T15:34:41.866+0000)\n>\n> Entirely 100% wrong.\n\nMakes logical arguments to his point.\n\nCounter-argument: you're wrong.\n\nPretty much the only way you can ever know for sure you're right, is when the only thing someone else can say in response is that you're wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"MissingKayo","date":"2017-02-12T15:49:27.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Range is a huge benefit that can't be bought outside of RFC.\nRanged can kite easily.\nMelees have to get into close distance to actually proc whatever damage they buy, hence, more risk.\nRanged champions have a history of abusing items, especially ones not meant for them.\n\nEdge of Night is overloaded in general.\n\nIncorrect again entirely. Ranged have always abused those items better. Those items also got nerfed solely because of the ranged.\n\nEdge of Night comparison is also wrong again because range gives range benefit while keeping spellshield which means less likely to break it.\n\nSterak was good on melees. But ranged were good on it to. They weren't supposed to be. So it got gutted.\n\nWrong. Ezreal abused just about every Sheen item ever. Marksmen and ranged all abused Sterak's. They almost all abuse Lethality now.\n\nWhen Lethality was lower, it was garbage on the assassins it was meant for. But ranged still abused it better because they could proc it from range. When it's high like now, Assassins are broken, but ranged are even more broken again because of range benefit and a stat they're not supposed to have.\n\nShoo shoo.
