Game froze for me, attempted to reconnect, never did. I restarted the client, and got stuck in a login queue...while still in a game. Then when it was my turn, got an error about no server response. Got back in game just to see our team lose a 4v3 since two others got booted too. Now the game is over, but can't start a new one. Got an error saying I'm still attached to an active game. Server status says the servers are up, however a previous message says ranked is disabled for maintenance. As for as I can tell, they never fully took everything offline, they're likely just tinkering with it while people are still playing. I wouldn't worry too much. It's goofy as hell, but doubt you'll get punished for it.\n\nedit: It's been about 10 min, but game finally let me log in (after booting me again). So far it's letting me queue, issue on the server end must be resolved.
