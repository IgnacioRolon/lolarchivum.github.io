I've gone from 35 ping to 60 ping and sometimes 100 randomly.  The only thing the latency fix has done is made everyone else playing lag.  Really hard to land a Q when it has a half second cast time.","replies":[{"poster":"Wood Elo God","date":"2017-05-07T20:32:09.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/YVFZA\n\nI've done tracerts and other things because I used to lag heavily and had to file with the FCC in order to get my ISP to pay attention to me and for over 8 months now after they resolved it I haven't ever had anything but 39 ping.  Since update I've had 41-91 ping and sometimes a massive spike.  When I send out tracert to other IP's there isn't a stutter or a packet loss on its way.  It seems to be related to the update and that's about all I could figure out on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-07T01:43:46.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh glob I can only imagine the frustration of Morgana's Q having a cast time O_O.....\n\nLet's see if we can iron out some of those ping spikes a bit. First I want to test something to see just what kind of lag we're dealing with. If you could grab your most recent game logs then goto our [**log reader**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743) and pop them in there for it to analyze. Once it's done, take screenshot and post it here using something like Gyazo or Imgur.","replies":[]}]}
