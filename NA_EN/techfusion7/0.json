This was a long time ago and it still hasn't showed up even though the demacia one has. If any rioter could help me I would be insanely grateful cause zaun is my favorite faction and the icon looked really nice :c","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-05-24T17:11:50.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Zaun icon was distributed a while back, but it's interesting you haven't received yours yet.  We gave a deadline on the icon's site to reach out to support if you haven't received the icon, so I can't guarantee that we could provide it now.  I can't make any guarantees, but hit us up in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to see if there's anything we can do.  If you have a screenshot showing the redemption with your account name, that could help too.  See you there!","replies":[{"poster":"Techfusion7","date":"2017-05-24T18:15:07.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I'm sorry I didn't know.
