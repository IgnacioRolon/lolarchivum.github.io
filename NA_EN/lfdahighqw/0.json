The only time I take notice of anything like that is people who are constantly like \"reported\", \"report this, report that\".\n\nThat said, the system clearly considers all of it negative. If all you ever did wrong was say report X afk one time in a small amount of your games its probably not going to be enough on its own to get you punished but it will be counting against you in w/e small way.\n\nNot particularly relevant, but it drives me nuts when people talk like something being a fact excludes it from being what ever negative thing it also is. Usually its like \"its not harassment, its just stating facts\", or in this case \"its not a threat its a fact\". Something being true or a fact does not mean that it is not a threat. If someone said \"if you don't give me your money I will shoot you\". Assuming they meant it that is both a fact and a threat. You could also consider it a warning.\n\nTLDR: You should never be mentioning reporting anyone in game for any reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AJStarhiker","date":"2015-12-07T05:28:55.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also unnecessary because the system only cares if there are *any* reports from a game, not how many.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RlCARDO MlLOS","date":"2015-12-04T02:09:42.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relax accept the punishment.
