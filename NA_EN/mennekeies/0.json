I upgraded all drivers appropriately and I reinstalled LoL.\n\nIssues: \n-loading into the game takes longer than before;\n-while in-game, I experience massive FPS drops. From 120 to 0, lasting 2 to 3 seconds. These framedrops occur when I move stuff around in my inventory, when I press  to look at the champions in-game, when I access the store, when I access the menu, when I unlock my in-game camera and go through the map, when I change my camera position through the minimap, when a big ability happens. \n-when tabbing out of the game, my entire monitor turns black except for the taskbar in the bottom. When I  to get into task manager, the monitor works and allows me to choose between task manager, logging off, rebooting etc. but when I select task manager, it goes back to black, with the task manager shown in the taskbar. When tabbing around, nothing works. When clicking the X to close LoL, it doesn't work. When going back into the game, the entire monitor goes black.\n\nAll settings are on low. It doesn't change a thing, since the game runs normally on 120fps until I do one of the things that causes the drop. I also tried capping it on different fps, which doesn't make a difference either. In its current state, the game is 100% unplayable. I hope you can help me.\n\n\nAlso, some error lines out of the R3D log in case it helps.\n000000.632|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"Global/Champions/champions.bin\" because it's not in the manifest.\n000000.633|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"Global/Loadouts/SummonerBadges.bin\" because it's not in the manifest.\n\n000001.082|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.138/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\" because it's not in the manifest.\n000001.082|  ERROR| Missing file on r3dGFile open :C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.138/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\n000001.082|  ERROR| Riot::RADS::IO::OpenFile: RADS cannot open file \"\\Bin\\Data\\C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.138/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\" because it's not in the manifest.\n000001.082|  ERROR| Missing file on r3dGFile open :\\Bin\\Data\\C:/Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.138/deploy/Data/Menu/IMEConfig.xml\n\n000012.165|  ERROR| Cant load particle system AnnieBasicAttack_mis.troy\n000012.165|  ERROR| Failed to preload particle system \"AnnieBasicAttack_mis.troy\"\n000012.166|  ERROR| Cant load particle system AnnieBasicAttack_mis.troy\n000012.166|  ERROR| Failed to preload particle system \"AnnieBasicAttack_mis.troy\"\n**(there was no Annie in-game)**\n\n000012.773|  ERROR| Data Error on expression: always\n Data Error message: Missing effect texture \n\n000012.773|  ERROR| Data Error on expression: always\n Data Error message: Missing effect texture \n\n000013.254|  ERROR| Can not open file  *********\n000013.254|  ERROR| Failed to load TempChar_Square.dds\n000013.254|   WARN| r3dTexture EX: TempChar_Square.dds - not found.
