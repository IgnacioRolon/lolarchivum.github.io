The law may identify a protected group by certain characteristics.[3][4][5] In some countries, hate speech is not a legal term.[6] And additionally in some countries, including the United States, hate speech is constitutionally protected.[7][8][9]\n\nIn some countries, a victim of hate speech may seek redress under civil law, criminal law, or both. A website that contains hate speech (online hate speech) may be called a hate site. Many of these sites contain Internet forums and news briefs that emphasize a particular viewpoint.\n\n\" SEXUAL ORIENTATION, OR GENDER IDENTITY.\"\n\nLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL?\n\nStay in school.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuvn Ti","date":"2018-06-09T05:15:41.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"i said \"im not tryna win\" ironically i JUST said that\n\nand again you're wrong.
