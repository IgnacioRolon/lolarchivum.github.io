The fact that I got autobanned for a single game is just utterly ridiculous, especially considering that no tribunal looked at it, and the ban went off literally minutes after the game. This punishment system is ludicrous and unfair as it doesn&#039;t take into account any other factors that were happening in the game, nor anything else that anyone said.

When they complain about you harassing them you just laugh it off like they're in the wrong even though you're the one who started harassing them in the first place.\n\nAdvice: \n\n* Don't call for reports ever. It solves nothing, makes it more likely that the other person will continue with their actions anyway and opens up valid reports against you as well.\n* There's never an excuse to resort to verbal abuse, ever. If someone is performing poorly, kindly offer some friendly tips or advice as to how they can improve their gameplay. Being a jerk and then laughing about it when you're called out on it only makes you look like a selfish and uncaring jerk.\n* Having a bad game does not equal feeding. We all have bad games every now and then, even you, but does that mean that we're feeding? No. As long as someone is actively trying to win the game then it's not feeding just because they're having a bad game.\n\nMy verdict:  Punish.\n\nP.S. All permabans are reviewed by Riot directly, and they go through the entire account history before deciding if the account in question deserves a permaban or not. Also, you aren't banned for a single game unless it's extreme enough to warrant an escalation (i.e. verbal abuse, racist comments, etc.).\n\nReform Cards never show all games that you're reported in (there's no need), but you have to be valid reported in a ton of your games to warrant a case, and you have had to ignore 35 games worth of chat restrictions+a 2 week ban to get a permaban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Proxknight","date":"2016-04-23T09:03:28.463+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly that's a whole lot of passive aggressive chat.

And you don't get banned for just literally one game unless you were unbeleivable toxic.\n\nI'm also guessing you have had the previous punishments before correct? They are as follows:\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Destromoth","date":"2016-04-23T04:22:01.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"The warnings/punishments I had received happened months ago... from which point my behavior had improved quite substantially as can be seen by me not immediately getting banned as soon as I got off the ban.

It all makes sense now, why people who afk/feed/troll  never get banned, but \"toxic\" people do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Destromoth","date":"2016-04-23T02:14:53.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"A sense of personality in a multiplayer game doesn't add to the game? Why not just play a single player game if all you want is your teammates to ping when they're coming, and nothing else. Regardless a permanent chat restriction is probably a way better fix than a permanent account ban. The banning of the account only serves to make you start over and invest more time/money into the game.","replies":[]}]}
