By and large, it's a method for those of the community to show disagreement while not requiring that they commit that disagreement strictly to words - which could, as it were, fail them. And there are a whole host of reasons why someone could disagree with a post. Perhaps it's working off of a faulty premise, perhaps the OP isn't making an effort to understand anything and adamantly insists that they were punished wrongfully, maybe the ideas or subjects being communicated in the post are just plain _bad_.\n\nPersonally, I don't care either which way for downvotes. They're just disagreement points, and I don't think the PB board would change drastically for lack of them.\n\n> You are probably and most likely they same overly sensitive snowflakes that are gleefully rubbing their (ahem) 'hands' together at the misery of others.\n> The same others that you reported enough out of 'offense' while getting off on them being punished.\n\nThere's an adage that I've heard here and there; \"Assuming makes an ass out of (yo)u and me\". If the very beginning of your post starts off with a direct, underhanded insult and the assumption of bias to reinforce that insult, you're only just setting up a self-fulfilling prophecy for the sake of drama.\n\nAll those openings serve to do is insult a group of people based on their actions, _simultaneously inviting those actions_, and then take that opportunity to use those actions to reaffirm your opening insult. I'm still going to treat this as a discussion, but for future reference - and I'm gonna say this bluntly - don't pull that shit, 'kay?\n\n> I'm tired of seeing all the negative votes.\n\nLikewise, there are probably a few people who are tired of seeing a lot of the same things. Half-baked ideas like the removal of chat, voluntary chat restrictions, extra opportunities after the permaban, etc., posts complaining about obviously merited punishments and pointless arguments about \"deserving flame\" or \"he started it\", etc.\n\nPerhaps it's just cynicism, but we all have to deal with seeing stuff we don't like or are tired of seeing. Perhaps your fare for such could be remedied, though - I know there was some talks amongst the Moderation team regarding removing Downvoting in _Player Behavior_ like they did for _Gameplay+_, though I've yet to have heard or seen anything of it.\n\n> ANYONE for the most part that posts on THIS BOARD, CAME HERE BECAUSE THEY CARED enough....to at least question their punishment, which to me screams willingness to change.\n>\n> ALL I SEE outside of some legitimate comments are down-votes.\n>\n> Do you people actually want to encourage and help your community, or just dominate it from your perspective and shut out any dissent?\n\nAgain; just as people who come here to discuss matters of Player Behavior have such reasons, people who downvote have their own reasons for doing so. I don't particularly understand why you're investing so much in one fact over the other.\n\nI've seen ample behavioral cases on the PB boards, and a fair majority of the cases, to my memory, actually lack a willingness to change on the part of the OP/punished player. It's not _uncommon_, per se, that people will want to actually change, but it's not the general majority, either.\n\nWe do want to encourage the community to flourish, but that becomes difficult when the people we're trying to help decide to _make_ it difficult. As it stands, understanding is a two-way street, and while we try our hardest to empathise and understand the punished player's situation, all of that effort goes out the window when they're not willing to give an inch themselves.\n\n> MODS how about a lot more puSh for CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM?\n\nThey've been working at it, and in fact have been making pretty great strides in accomplishing some of their goals.\n\nIIRC, the first public notice of changes being discussed by the Moderation team for the Player Behavior boards was [four months ago, by Ulanopo](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/X2n1scHx-negativity-in-pb), and then we had another similar such discussion around [a month ago](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/m4geAK5V-updated-player-behavior-guidelines), which ultimately led to the updated [Player Behavior Board Guidelines](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/OjEUxbwH-player-behavior-rules-update).\n\nI've seen a fair amount of improvements to discussion quality since that first update, and, while of course it's not been perfect, it's still miles better than it used to be.\n\n> Because frankly, after reading the first page of threads in this topic, all I see is a lot of hate from the community, and really zero effort on assist/reform and actual discussion.\n\nIf you see people being spiteful and/or unhelpful, report them, and the Moderation team will look into it and act accordingly.\n\n> CLOSE THIS HEADER, or do a better job Mods.\n> \n> This forum is nothing more than a punching bag for people already DOWN. It's sick, and pointless.\n\nI mean, you're stating a lot of open distaste with the current state of _Player Behavior_, but what you should consider doing is proposing solutions that address the problem. \"Do a better job\" isn't helpful, especially on top of the fact that the only issue you directly address is downvoting.\n\nSo, what exactly is/are the problem(s), and how is it that you propose it get dealt with?","replies":[{"poster":"VoraciousX","date":"2019-04-16T06:00:33.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Umbral Regent,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=KolAvhxd,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-04-15T02:20:21.290+0000)\n>\n> I find it strange that you're putting a lot of emphasis on understanding the reasoning that people come here to discuss their punishments (which is fair, of course; a fair few people can be confused or need understanding of their punishment, and others still may need advice or guidance), but while you address the depth of the people coming to discuss their punishments, you only take a short glance at the downvotes and look no further.\n> \n> Have you considered _why_ a fair number of threads get downvoted?

For example, if I were to say the world was a giant orange, and backed up my claim(I know it's a ridiculous thought, but I'm just bringing something off the top of my head), but millions of people disagreed with me, it should be up to them to disprove me, not the other way around.\n\nIt's like with other things in the world, if you say someone did something horrible, it's up to you to back up that claim, not for them to disprove it.
