Sometimes I can reconnect, other times I can't and every time I can't my teammates tell me they couldn't remake. It seems to get better if I \"warm up\" league by playing a normal or two, but the issues persists. I've checked everything, no viruses, league isn't eating up all my cpu/ram, internet connection is fine. Any help you can give would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-08T20:34:50.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you getting any error messages or a bugsplat when this crash happens?  The black screens almost sound like a connection issue, but I need more info on what you mean exactly.  As a heads up, even if your internet is fine you can still have problems specifically connecting to the game server.  Let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Wonko The Sane","date":"2016-10-08T21:05:38.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No error messages or bugsplat on the first try, it just goes back to the client with the default \"the game has crashed. reconnect\" message. Occasionally on later tries a small window called \"Network warning\" will pop up with  \"you have disconnected. Please check your internet connection and try again.\" Thanks for your help.\n\nEDIT: After updating/repairing my graphics drivers it seems to have solved itself. It hasn't crashed again as of yet, but I'll let you know if that changes. Thanks for your help!","replies":[]}]}]}
