The game was going pretty poorly; we were losing, and this Galio kept getting saltier and saltier, until we were both killed, he dced, and everyone (and I mean everyone in the game as far as I'm aware) lost connection and crashed. I thought it was just an isolated issue but my wifi was fine and even the league client itself had connection, but I couldn't reconnect to the game. By the time I did, we were in end-screen, and the entire enemy team revealed they had been kicked out as well. The Galio was who we all saw disconnect before all crashing simultaneously, so we reasoned (plus his salty comments and the timing of the crash) that he disconnected all of us. I'm reporting this AGAIN because A. I really want him to be banned permanently and B. The disconnect is still going on for me, and I can't play any games. I can get into loading screen just fine but I get disconnected entirely in loading screen itself. I don't want to receive punishment for the game I dc'd from but I do want to, y'know, actually play the game again. What should I do? \n(Any advice lads?)","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2019-03-28T02:17:59.353+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're accusing a player of disconnecting everyone based on\n\n1. He DC'd first\n2. He raged.\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. How?\n2. No. Seriously. HOW?\n3. Are you SURE it's not a server thing?\n4. NO SERIOUSLY! HOW?!\n5. Now you want him perma'd even though you don't have concrete evidence and are only using arguments held together by strings and lots or prayers?","replies":[]},{"poster":"PavLoo","date":"2019-03-28T09:58:48.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"woah there, remove the player's name.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krissi2197","date":"2019-03-28T03:23:34.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a massive issue earlier that caused the ranked queues to be disabled that caused a really huge DC spike for a lot of players.\n\nIt wasnt the Galios fault.

This is not the place to accuse or report players of wrongdoing. \n\n You filed the support ticket, wait for their response. Riot will look into the game but I seriously doubt one player had the power to disconnect everyone at will like that. \n\n Even then, you said he disconnected aswell which means it's probably not him hitting you offline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"burnthefuzz","date":"2019-03-28T10:49:05.799+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, thanks for the quick responses I guess. I'm still having the issue even with the servers fixed, as well as the fact that I was playing ARURF well into the queue issue happening. I probably did jump to conclusions; I've had disconnect issues before but none so specifically timed. If all else fails I'll reinstall the client. Thanks I guess?\n(Edit: Removed Player's Name)","replies":[]}]}
