This strategy's comp would be based around a tanky bruiser top, an APC mid, tanky and sustainable boot, and two hard cc junglers starting opposite sides of the jungle. There are also other ways the junglers could be put together: one support champ with exhaust and one regular jungler with smite roaming together all the time, both junglers  with smite roaming independently, and maybe but not likely an ADC with a jungler roaming together. This is just an idea that I want to know what you guys, the community, thinks. \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[]}
