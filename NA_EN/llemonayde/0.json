And yes we could check our in game ping by playing at the practice tool but if you have friends waiting for you then you don't have time to check your ping. \r\n\r\nIn **_PH_**, _**SEA**_,  this happens a lot. since not all of us can afford to have our own internet so we play at computer shops instead, sometimes the connection is not evenly allocated and a person is downloading/uploading, if we could see our ping right before we start our game then maybe we could decide if we are still going to play or maybe later.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate a feedback. Thanks! I've posted it here since i still am not level 6 to be able to post a discussion at \"Concepts &amp; Creations\".\r\n\r\nshwing... {{summoner:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-07-06T22:00:34.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I don't think that's too bad of an idea! It'd be a nice way of knowing whether or not you should attempt that next ranked match, but there are also a few ways you can check your ping to our servers specifically outside of the client. You can always try running something like [WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/winmtr-v0-92-now-available/) to do a trace route to our NA servers at 104.160.131.1 to double check your ping and if you've got any packet loss going on!","replies":[{"poster":"lLemonayde","date":"2017-07-11T03:19:20.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! I personally don't play league from PH to NA since that will surely give us a high ping. But this idea is not only for those who plays from cross servers (PH/NA etc..), this may help us specially if we are playing from our own servers. (PH-PH / NA-NA) since sometimes our internet connection is unstable. This may prevent us from having  bad games. {{summoner:6}} {{champion:63}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeyItzSteve","date":"2017-07-04T23:53:18.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have something like Discord, you can just make a Discord server in **US-Central**, and connect to a voice channel, the ping in US-Central is almost identical to Riot Servers.","replies":[]}]}
