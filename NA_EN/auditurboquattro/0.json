There are times that I can play 5 matches in a row with  a good FPS - no matter if it is very low or very high, I get over 100-150 FPS. And then it just randomly happens that no matter what match I play it just drops to 30 and doesn't move. Neither higher, nor less. And No matter what I do - it doesn't change, until it randomly fixes by itself. Then, sometimes, while having a good FPS number it occasionally drops to 2-5 FPS for 2-5 seconds every 30-60 seconds, which is ridiculous. \r\n\r\nWhat I did?\r\n\r\nGame DVR - off.\r\nDrivers - up to date every single time.\r\nAll potentially unwanted programs are off.\r\nWindows Best performance/Best quality - tried both, same problem with both.\r\nNo heating problem - fans.\r\nLaptop power settings - with and without High Performance mode - same thing.\r\nMy GPU uses all League of Legends .exe files, it doesn't open through integrated graphics.\r\nIn-game graphics - I can change whatever I want - IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. It's either bad quality or good quality - fps stays the same (well obviously there is a small difference between very low and very high, but it doesn't make any difference for my eyes).\r\nLaptop is pretty new - dust is not a problem.\r\n\r\nI also read, that GPU itself might a problem, that some wire is blocking something (?), but don't want to open up my laptop yet.\r\n\r\nSo, Please - give me any suggestions.. I have no idea what to do, because this randomness is just killing me.\r\n\r\nThank You in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"AudiTurboQuattro","date":"2016-12-04T11:39:27.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so I might have found a problem, but need advises on finding a solution. FPS drops causes whether my charger is plugged in or not - if it is plugged in, everything is how it is supposed to be, if it's not - well, You can guess..

The previous update was bugged and was known to cut fps in halves for people with the pascal architecture . \n\ninstall the newest geforce driver now and see if that was the problem. I am assuming that is my problem. link below talks about how fps was cut in half for some users with last update. After reading more into it, im not sure if the latest update includes fixes for the problems of the last patch.\n\nhttps://www.techpowerup.com/227881/users-report-multiple-issues-with-geforce-375-86-whql-drivers","replies":[{"poster":"AudiTurboQuattro","date":"2016-11-30T05:57:06.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even after updating the driver I had the same problem yesterday. It's 376.09 at the moment. But yet - it happened again. Was playing with my buddy and bam - 30fps lock again (???). Tried repairing lol client files - didn't help. But what helped to restore it to normal fps was Restoring default settings under NVIDIA Control Panel and setting it up like it had to be - LoL working with NVIDIA GPU, not the integrated one. So yeah, I could play couple matches in the evening again, but yet again - I am 100% sure that maybe not today, but tomorrow or even day after tomorrow the same will occur. It's pretty hard to fix it, when it doesn't happen all the time.","replies":[]}]}]}
