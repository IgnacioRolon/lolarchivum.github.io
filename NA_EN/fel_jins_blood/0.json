It used to prevent me from getting in games but now it is preventing League from even starting up. I have no idea what causes this but I am kind of tired of dealing with it. But seeing as how a lot of my friends use Curse in Overwatch I want to keep it. Is there anyone who can help with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-21T20:34:32.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This only happens when Curse is running? If so, Curse could be trying to draw an overlay on the patcher, which could prevent it from launching. Unfortunately, we cannot resolve issues with third-party programs, but you can tweak your settings in Curse or uninstall it and wait for Curse to update it.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-09-18T05:49:11.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you receive any error messages?","replies":[{"poster":"Fel Jins Blood","date":"2016-09-18T20:03:13.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No all it does is flash the League logo as if it's starting up and then disappears.
