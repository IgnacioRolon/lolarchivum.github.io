She has a heal!\n\nShe also commonly builds a Death's dance for MORE sustain.\n\nNasus: Passive: 10-20% Life steal (commonly builds Spirit Visage to make this 26% life steal, sometimes even builds a Bloodthirster to push near 50% life steal. \n\nOften builds Warmog's.\n\nYou can throw around semantics about life steal not being \"healing\" but the game mechanics treat it otherwise.\n\nGaren: Passive: Garen passively regenerates 「 0.2 / 0.8% maximum health every half-second 」. This regeneration is interrupted for 9 / 4 seconds if he takes non-minion damage or if he is hit by an enemy ability.\nRegeneration increased to 「 0.4 / 1.6% maximum health every half-second 」 while below 25 / 50% of his maximum health.\nAt level 11, damage from non-epic monsters will no longer stop Perseverance.\n\nIn other words, Garen has a near permanent mini warmog's as a passive. This is why he's so hard to kill..... he heals 3.2% hp a second when below 25% HP and escaping battle. \n\nAgain, you can argue about semantics of healing vs Life Regeneration, but he DOES have self recovery.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nDamage? Omfg.... a Lethality or Crit Garen can erase a team in 2-3 seconds. If he goes tank, he erases teams in 15-20 seconds. At the same time, the team can 1v5 him and not kill him, because he effectively has between 60-97% Tenacity, which prevents him from being cc'd.'\n\nIllaoi can mete out 6k damage a second with her ult, and if she manages to get 1-2 dead early in the ult, she can 1v5 their entire team. Illaoi's only real weakness is when someone stuns her right when she casts her Ult, so she can't immediately slam 5-6 tentacles. Late game with a Sterak's this disadvantage grossly disappears, and if you go Resolve, you can have 60-80% Tenacity on her, resulting in an unstoppable ult. Her E on an AD/Hybrid build can literally deal 76% of a target's Max HP just by hitting the spirit, and if a tentacle hits after the E, the tentacle can do the rest. Saying Illaoi does no damage is just crazy.\n\nNasus: Nasus usually does the most champion damage on ANY team, OR he just has free farm to take the other team's base. 95% Slow, .5 Sec coolsdown main damage skill which resets auto attacks.... builds trinity... That's not a damage dealer? I've seen a Nasus 1v5 a team due to his life steal + a laner free farming him to 400+ stacks. He can almost 1 shot turrets and champions alike.

And you are wrong even about your revision. His passive does not work in battle. His passive does nothing to help him survive a fight, except to create more situations where he goes into a fight with more health.\n\nI would say I was wrong about Illaoi, I thought that was regen and not heals. But considering your basic lack of knowledge of these champs, I am not sure you are a credible source either, but I admit I might be wrong on that one.\n\nNasus, I already conceded has lifesteal. Why you are attempting to prove me wrong by reiterating my correct statement I do not comprehend.\n\nEveryone can build lifesteal or spellvamp. That has nothing to do with you claiming all these champs had heals and lifesteal built into their kits. \n\nWhat is Garen's slow you are referring to by the way?\n\nTenacity does not prevent cc. Crit garen and lethality Garen wouldn't survive diving into an enemy team 2-3 seconds. The speed boost from his q breaks after the first cc, even soft cc. An enemy team having only 1 cc is ridiculous concept in this game. Garen's E, even when buffed with lethality or crit, does not do that much damage as you claim. A full build, maxed out E at level 16 will hit 8 times if you manage to find a target with no flash or dash or cc to move out of it. If he builds full pen you are looking around 1200 damage pre-mitigation. That won't 100-0 even a squishy adc even if they don't have the sense to turn around and easily kill him with lifesteal healing them back up. You can add some damage in with q and ult, and probably kill the squishy if they actually have no cc, no dash, no flash, are stupid enough not to attack him back. But even that solo kill takes 3 times as much time as what you are suggesting he can wipe an entire team with. He has no in-combat heal or lifesteal. If he took death's dance, he could get 50-60 health back on that solo target from his E, which is AOE so 1/3 of 15 lifesteal. The adc could do more than that in one hit if they sold all their equipment. Maybe 300 if he hits a team of 5 with all 8 stacks of his E, which is still less than a similar level fully built adc could do in 1 single hit. His E doesn't even hit all stacks in 2-3 seconds \"OMFG\" LOL. You just don't seem to know this champ at all.\n\nNasus does not have the highest DPS in game. I never said he didn't do damage, you are making a strawman argument to back up your ridiculous claims. You claim that you saw someone stack up his q for free, and he is somehow playing against a team with no range and no escape and no cc. I can see under that ridiculous circumstance he gets to put up the highest damage on the team. But most teams aren't made of complete noobs, picking melee squishies with no escape and no sense to build a bramble. Nasus is a solo pusher, able to take down a lane if left alone 1v1 later on, or draw more than 1 champ to deal with him, letting other lanes complete objectives. He does that. What he doesn't do, is be one of the top 3 DPS champs in game, which was your claim.\n\nYou just keep commenting on these 3 champs you know nothing about, and sink further into a hole trying to justify absurd claims. They aren't hypercarries, and they aren't tanks. They are juggs, meant to be hard to escape from and survive if they actually manage to get engaged. They don't have hard CC, mobility creep, new runes, damage creep, prevalence of grevious wounds, have all served to largely negate that role.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tortunga","date":"2017-11-19T19:18:57.835+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think the new keystone should mainly be for the old Fervor juggernaut users.

A lot more of bruisers/fighters damage seems to come from their AA's then their abilities (Or their enhanced AA's), and so AS isn't a bad stat for them.\n\nThat's why i suggested a new fervor for juggernauts; Not because they were the main users, but because most of them that used it cannot really make good use of the new press the Attack and the rest of the precision tree.\n\nAnd my suggestion wouldn't be exclusive for just juggernauts; Anyone that gets a decent amount of health could get some great value out of it, which includes champions like Renekton, Gnarr and Camille (three champions that build a decent amount of health, and all three have under 50% winrate as well).\n\nYou could just make it the old Fervor and put it in the precision tree giving flat AD per stack, but then you got to balance it for every AA user as well. Making it scale of health and putting it in the Resolve tree just makes more sense to me, as an aggressive keystone for the more tanky carries (including some bruisers/fighters, just not all of them).\n\nBut it was just a suggestion, and the core point i wanted to make is that a new juggernaut keystone (which Riot is thinking about) should provide flat AD for the old fervor juggernauts that used it.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KnightsKemplar","date":"2017-11-19T18:49:31.048+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea.
