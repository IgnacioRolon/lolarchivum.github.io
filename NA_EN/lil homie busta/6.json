This keystone, if i&#039;m not wrong, was created to fresh out the rune system by giving an additional and unique option to the precision tree that would fulfill the gap left by [Fevor of Battle](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7vuXEK5rm_Y/WKN13W-VDGI/AAAAAAAAd3M/rPyOjc1spmw7btwcxXycoL1RwUSWWgrqgCLcB/s640/fervor.jpg) to some Fighters/Bruisers and step up as an &quot;anti-tank&quot; keystone option. Is important to note that despite being created to give fighters/bruisers a proper keystone, it was not aimed only to them, as no keystone should be class specific. \n\nWith that in mind, i would like to talk about this keystone. I&#039;ve tested it in the PBE a couple of times, and i think i have some solid points to discuss about this keystone (which probably will not involve number issues or points, just mechanics stuff); so let&#039;s start by the positive ones:\n\n>-  _**Positive aspects of Conqueror (so far):**_\n - ------ Managed to fulfill very well the lack of a proper keystone that fighters/bruisers had been suffering since the preseason start WITHOUT being exclusive for them. It&#039;s definitively sub-par or secondary-optimal on other classes like assassins, tanks or marksman(ADC), but still can be useful and a viable option on those depending on both team comps.\n - ------ The &quot;true damage conversion&quot; part of the keystone made it very unique, as it&#039;s the only one to have this anti-armor/mr mechanic from all others keystones. I believe that the most important aspect of a keystone should be it&#039;s uniqueness, and Conqueror nails it pretty well, with just some minor issues that i will bring back later in this thread.\n - ------ **True damage conversion works as a natural counterbalance for the AD granted by the keystone, in the sense that avoids abuse through life steal by using the bonus AD, which makes it not super good on crit and life steal champs.**\n - ------ Has a clear disadvantage &amp; advantage: Slow but stronger.\n\n----------------------------\n\n Now, some humble criticism:\n\n>-  _**Negative aspects of Conqueror (so far):**_\n - ------ It&#039;s activation mechanic similar to [_Lethal Tempo_](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Lethal_Tempo) and identically to [_Grasp of The Undying_](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Grasp_of_the_Undying_(Rune)), which hurts it&#039;s uniqueness quite a lot.\n - ------ Conqueror current &quot;[X]s in combat&quot; activation mechanic is inconsistent for it&#039;s current effect **and will dictate playstyle due to how strong the buff is**. The keystone is easily proc'able in lane -- since it's proc mechanic comes from a very good laning keystone -- but said mechanic is very bad at teamfights or situations where you have no option but to fight without preparation. This creates a inconsistency where it&#039;s hard to balance for lane and fights; not only that, the effect of Conqueror is not a laning-phase-oriented effect, but a power up effect that is useful in extended fights. It simply doesn&#039;t work very well and will bring a lot of headache for both players and the live gameplay team.\n - ------ &quot;Idle Time&quot;. Four seconds without not benefits is a great downside of this keystone, even greater than it&#039;s benefits. Then again, _Lethal Tempo_ it&#039;s somewhat impractical with 1.5 s delay, which is acceptable (kinda). But 4 seconds without keystone is something wrong. Even if you can activate it by attacking minions or monsters, it still not only inconsistent in some emergency situations, but it also unnecessary frustrating in said situations. We live in a context where champions like Garen or Renekton can die very fast in a fair amount of situations, and 4 seconds is a huge barrier for those players who are aware of said context.\n - ------ ~~not gonna lie, the name and icon are actually funny instead of interesting xD~~ This probably will be fixed by the art team before going live.\n\n-------------------------\n\nWhat could help/solve some of those issues pointed above:\n\n - Exchange the &quot;Grasp&quot; mechanic for a timed-ramp mechanic: Every 1 second in combat, you gain 25% of the total bonus AD provided by the keystone (that depends on your level), stacking up to 3 times. After 4 seconds, striking a enemy champion with one of your abilities or basic attacks will grant the rest of the bonus AD (25%) and the 20% true damage conversion. This would help making this keystone more unique and solve the &quot;Idle Time&quot; issue, since you at least would have something in between those 4 seconds.\n\n - Make it only active while fighting champions; change from &quot;combat&quot; to &quot;combat with enemy champions&quot;. This would sinergize with the suggestion above, since you would be able to partially use the keystone even on emergency fights, which would cover additional &quot;idle time&quot; situations caused by removing the &quot;hit a minion&quot; strategy (generally while laning), as well make the activation requirement more consistent.\n\n- Some ideas for the keystone&#039;s name: _Peak of Performace_, _Edge of Perfection_, _Rampage_, _Soaring Focus_, _Sharp Mind_.\n\nedited for clarity.\nResumed suggestion ([ x - y ] is the level scaling, x being value at level 1 and y at level 18) :\n>_&quot;Every second in combat with enemy champions grants grants you [ 2 - 15 ] AD for 2 seconds up to 3 times for a total of [ 6 - 45 ] AD. When stacking 3 times, the buff's duration is increased to 4 seconds. Hitting an enemy with an ability or basic attack while having 3 stacks enhances the buff, granting you additional AD totaling in [ 8 - 60 ] AD and converting 20% of your damage to champions to true damage.&quot;_\n\n>Melee only: Damaging enemy champions refreshes the duration of this buff.\n\nEdit1: Yeah, talking a little about numbers, the AD from levels 1~5 is currently too high in the PBE, probably will be nerfed. Also, maybe the true damage% needs to be tuned down a little bit or scale with level too, i dunno. It definitively looks scary when you fall against a trynda with conqueror.\n\nSo, what do you think about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-02-27T04:53:22.079+0000","up_votes":30,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is very reasonable and well written feedback!

They help hit home on the fantasy that a keystone is supposed to help define your playstyle that game in a way that the others don't. That's what I expect out of a keystone, and I feel **Summon Aery**, **Grasp of the Undying**, **Unsealed Spellbook**, and so forth don't capture that quite as well.\n\nFor lesser runes I like the more creative titles. Favorites there include the following:\n\n* Cheap Shot\n* Sudden Impact\n* The Ultimate Hat\n* Manaflow Band\n* Nullifying Orb\n* Demolish\n* Scorch\n* Magical Footwear\n* Hextech Flashtraption\n* Perfect Timing\n* Biscuit Delivery\n\nI love these because they're flavorful (in most cases) and I can IMMEDIATELY remember which is which from the name alone. Most of them are using decidedly ungeneric names, and you'll also notice that most of these to NOT have similar effects to anything else.\n\nMy least favorite are those that don't give a strong indication of what they do -- coincidentally there are usually the ones where I find the graphics insufficient to let me differentiate the effects at a glance as well. In general these are the ones that, while I may use, I tend to only remember when looking at the row.\n\nThese include:\n\n* Presence of Mind\n* Legend: Bloodline\n* Last Stand / Cut Down\n* Taste of Blood\n* Ingenious Hunter / Ravenous Hunter / Relentless Hunter\n* Font of Life\n* Overgrowth\n* Revitalize\n* Unflinching\n\nNote that many of these are more generic names OR have a lot of similar thematics. I can tell how Scorch is different from Manaflow Band almost by name along -- what's the difference between Overgrowth, Revitalize, Font of Life, and Second Wind?\n\n-----------------------------\n\nDigging deeper into some potential issues with some quick, off-the-cuff thoughts.\n\n**Coup de Grace | Cut Down | Last Stand**\n\n* I feel Coup de Grace is good, as that means \"Finishing Blow.\"\n* I'd consider switching Cut Down to \"Giant Killer\", which syncs up with Lord Dominik's \"Giant Slayer\" and helps cement it's roll in the game.\n* Last Stand could work in that case, but I'd consider something like \"Do-or-Die,\" as Last Stand seems more defensive than offensive to me.\n\n**Font of Life | Second Wind | Overgrowth | Revitalize**\n\n* Font of Life becomes \"Invigorating Command,\" to emphasize that it doesn't help you.\n* Second Wind changes to \"Rapid Recovery,\" to help show that it lets you heal quickly after injury every time.\n* Overgrowth becomes \"Battle Scars\" to show that you grow more durable from battle.\n* Revitalize becomes \"Font of Life\" (yes, I think it's more appropriate here) to drive home that all survival effects are magnified on you and from you, since you're such a source of healing energy.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-03-01T19:15:12.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for writing all of this up! :D","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-01T19:19:30.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sparkle,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=uHXiioEA,comment-id=00040002000000030000,timestamp=2018-03-01T19:15:12.628+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for writing all of this up! :D\n\nAny time!

Thanks for this post, this is very well thought out and argued! You have very good design instincts, but we have one unfair advantage over you: we've actually been able to test out some of the things you suggest ;)\n\nSo your suggested activation paradigm where the keystone gradually ramps up in combat was the very first iteration of this rune that Stashu tried out. The problem with it was that it felt too inevitable; it didn't meet our standards for minimum gameplay as and against for a keystone. It was very much like Fervor of Battle in that way: essentially it's just a bunch of stats with no real way for the enemy to do anything about it.\n\nMy next iteration was having the keystone ramp up gradually while you were near an enemy champion. This had a couple of cool implications, such as allowing some ranged champions to opt in without making it broken OP for ADCs. Urgot was foremost on my mind here. He has a very bruiser-esque combat pattern and would really have loved this keystone, I think. At the time, the output was still adaptive (we default to adaptive when there isn't a good reason to make it either AD or AP only), so I had some hope for Ryze and Cassio as well.\n\nSidebar: why are we even making this thing? It's not like bruisers have no keystones. Most of them have a keystone that they post very good win rates with, and that players pick in large numbers. The problem is those keystones achieve these winrates by shoring up weaknesses in a champion's kit, rather than doubling down on a champion's strength. If Fiora runs Kleptomancy or Open Spellbook in lane, she does this to sustain herself through the lane and make sure she's not pushed out of CSing and put behind. This is functional and powerful, but I strongly suspect it's not what Fiora players want (and I'm almost certain Phase Rush isn't what Darius players want, and Kleptomancy isn't what Illaoi players want). It's good to have the option to shore up weaknesses to a degree, but it shouldn't be your strongest option, and it surely shouldn't be your only option. Weaknesses on a kit exist for a reason: they tell a story for the enemy team about how to handle this character. If you take that away, you make the game less interesting for either side. I suspect that DPS mages like Ryze and Cassio suffer from a similar rune shortage. They run Open Spellbook to survive the lane (Ryze) or Phase Rush to hunt down squishies in 1v1s/skirmishes or to dodge incoming damage in a teamfight (Cassio), but they don't have a good option if they just want to double down on their damage. This rune could have been an option. We have something else in flight that might do it for them.\n\n(end of sidebar)\n\nThe problem with the range-based version was that it was very visually noisy (lots of circles) and very kit-bound (you either have or don't have the tools to stick on someone). Also the mindshare was just a little too high for a keystone. It did give the enemy something to do (i.e. wait until the full effect turns on, then create distance until it falls off), but it forced the enemy to play around the keystone more than around the champion.\n\nWe settled on the Grasp paradigm as something that has proven gameplay, and we think there's a pattern here that deserves abstraction into more effects; just like Phase Rush and Electrocute are both \"land 3 hits to get X\", I think it's very useful for the system to have two effects that say \"stay in combat for 4s and attack an enemy champion for X\". Uniqueness is not an absolute value. Sometimes being similar to another element of the system makes the decision space for the entire system richer.\n\nYou're also absolutely right in your assessment that this rune is going to be trivial to activate in lane, especially when you're ahead and when you can just afford to stand in the minion wave and always have it primed, and that it's much, much harder to make good use of it in a teamfight, where it's unlikely that you can actively prime it before the fact and where most of the important stuff usually happens in the first 2-3 seconds--either you or the enemy is likely to be dead or otherwise out of the fight.\n\nHowever, we've decided that this is a good thing. We want to embrace this. Runes generally should exhibit most of their strength in the early game and then fade into the background later (some exceptions--like Dark Harvest--notwithstanding). It's also a pretty snowbally rune, which again, we like. This is meant to be a rune that doubles down on the strengths of bruisers without shoring up any of their weaknesses. Winning more when ahead is a very bruisery output, being better at split-pushing than at teamfighting is as well. There is a cost: you're constantly pushing if you're always in the minion wave, attacking to keep your Conqueror primed. \n\nFinally, as one release valve output we've also decided that the first damage that puts you in combat puts you in combat for 4 seconds, so your fallback is when you're being poked you can decide to jump in 4s later with Conqueror fully primed.

(which is denied with some simple cc). _By the way, the gameplay on comet is quite bad since the user has little control of it, it all depends on how well the enemy plays, effectively it decreases the reliability of the rune_\nSome others are mainly cooldown gated, which could be considered as counter play, since you can counter-attack in the meantime: Electrocute, Predator, Aftershock, Guardian, Comet and phase rush. This cooldown can be well player around, both by opponents and users. But this playing around is only available beforehand and if your opponent gets to choose when an encounter occurs this counter play is completely negated.\nAnother method is by walking away when a keystone triggers: Predator, dark harvest (20 seconds is long!), Lethal Tempo (1.5s is short) and PtA (3 attacks is little)\nIf we ignore all those we are still left with some keystones: Grasp, Fleet Footwork, Aery, Klepto, Spellbook and Glacial Augment. (decreasing order of enemy influence)\nSo clearly, not all keystones meet these standards. And moreover, the proposed solution still fits in with the walk away \"counterplay\". \nBy saying the enemy has not enough ways to counteract this proposal, you reject the method of walking away, which increases the list...\nAdditionally if you felt there was really not enough counter play why not cooldown gate it?\n\nFinally the \"continuously hit minions\" is a bit lame.

A number of keystones we made do not live up to those standards. Comet is definitely one of them (but Aftershock absolutely isn't; the get out of the circle / keep them in the circle play is sufficiently different for both sides and players demonstrably make decisions around this). Comet if anything indexes TOO high on the playing against: it has the mindshare (how much of your time you need to spend thinking about it) of a champion spell in terms of \"dodge the circle\". That's too much for a keystone! I wouldn't be surprised if we replaced or reworked comet. The fact that we sometimes failed in the past doesn't make it okay to go forward and fail some more, though. We convinced ourselves at the time that comet would have play as, and we were wrong; we'll fix that. That doesn't mean we can say \"well comet is live and it doesn't do the thing we want it to do, so now we can go and make more things that don't do the thing we want them to do\".

Even if the activation paradigm is the same, the trade patterns that the 2 keystones support are absolutely not the same. And as a consequence, direct comparisons of the two keystones are really hard, so the fact they have the same activation paradigm has really little value here.\n\nBut let me bounce the question back to you. Why do you think it's \"very useful for the system to have two effects that say etc.\"? What's the added value of having a common activation paradigm?\n\n> It makes the story of \"how does a Grasp user fight a Conqueror user\" way clearer and more interesting: the Grasp user wants to proc Grasp and DISENGAGE, the Conqueror user wants to proc Conqueror and STICK. Clear success criteria, different optimal cases mean that these two runes will be able to coexist without one pushing the other out.\n\nThe comparison in a direct match-up is a very small subset of all the cases where the Keystones will be used. You'll have plenty of match-ups of Grasp vs something else, plenty of match-ups of Conqueror vs something else, and a relatively small minority of Grasp versus Conqueror. So, yeah, I agree with you, THIS story is clearer and more interesting, but this story is not all that important overall.\n\nAnother point, but on this one it's more speculation, I'm not entirely sure: I guess in a Conqueror versus Grasp Keystone, it's more likely that the Conqueror's user has the upper hand during laning phase. If my hypothesis holds true, then that means the Grasp user simply doesn't want to trade at all. They won't \"proc then DISENGAGE\", because they can't afford to. They'll just stand back and not proc Grasp at all. And I believe the hypothesis does hold true, because you're more likely to take offensive Keystone if you have a favorable match-up. If you have a hard match-up, you're more likely to take defensive Runes and stand back, waiting for team-fights.\n\nEDIT: Re-reading your post, I realize that's maybe not what you meant. You meant that the two Keystones have clearly distinct optimal users, right? That's what you meant with \"these two runes will be able to coexist without one pushing the other out.\"\nWell, yeah, I can agree with that, but then, if you don't intend the two Runes for the same users at all, what's the point of having a common activation paradigm?

It basically means that most Grasp users will get an additional free proc at the beginning of a team-fight compared to before. Maybe that's negligible overall, I really don't know, you have much more data than me to answer that question.

The problem with it was that it felt too inevitable; it didn&#x27;t meet our standards for minimum gameplay as and against for a keystone. It was very much like Fervor of Battle in that way: essentially it&#x27;s just a bunch of stats with no real way for the enemy to do anything about it.\n> \n> My next iteration was having the keystone ramp up gradually while you were near an enemy champion. This had a couple of cool implications, such as allowing some ranged champions to opt in without making it broken OP for ADCs. Urgot was foremost on my mind here. He has a very bruiser-esque combat pattern and would really have loved this keystone, I think. At the time, the output was still adaptive (we default to adaptive when there isn&#x27;t a good reason to make it either AD or AP only), so I had some hope for Ryze and Cassio as well.\n> \n> Sidebar: why are we even making this thing? It&#x27;s not like bruisers have no keystones. Most of them have a keystone that they post very good win rates with, and that players pick in large numbers. The problem is those keystones achieve these winrates by shoring up weaknesses in a champion&#x27;s kit, rather than doubling down on a champion&#x27;s strength. If Fiora runs Kleptomancy or Open Spellbook in lane, she does this to sustain herself through the lane and make sure she&#x27;s not pushed out of CSing and put behind. This is functional and powerful, but I strongly suspect it&#x27;s not what Fiora players want (and I&#x27;m almost certain Phase Rush isn&#x27;t what Darius players want, and Kleptomancy isn&#x27;t what Illaoi players want). It&#x27;s good to have the option to shore up weaknesses to a degree, but it shouldn&#x27;t be your strongest option, and it surely shouldn&#x27;t be your only option. Weaknesses on a kit exist for a reason: they tell a story for the enemy team about how to handle this character. If you take that away, you make the game less interesting for either side. I suspect that DPS mages like Ryze and Cassio suffer from a similar rune shortage. They run Open Spellbook to survive the lane (Ryze) or Phase Rush to hunt down squishies in 1v1s/skirmishes or to dodge incoming damage in a teamfight (Cassio), but they don&#x27;t have a good option if they just want to double down on their damage. This rune could have been an option. We have something else in flight that might do it for them.\n> \n> (end of sidebar)\n> \n> The problem with the range-based version was that it was very visually noisy (lots of circles) and very kit-bound (you either have or don&#x27;t have the tools to stick on someone). Also the mindshare was just a little too high for a keystone. It did give the enemy something to do (i.e. wait until the full effect turns on, then create distance until it falls off), but it forced the enemy to play around the keystone more than around the champion.\n> \n> We settled on the Grasp paradigm as something that has proven gameplay, and we think there&#x27;s a pattern here that deserves abstraction into more effects; just like Phase Rush and Electrocute are both &quot;land 3 hits to get X&quot;, I think it&#x27;s very useful for the system to have two effects that say &quot;stay in combat for 4s and attack an enemy champion for X&quot;. Uniqueness is not an absolute value. Sometimes being similar to another element of the system makes the decision space for the entire system richer.\n> \n> You&#x27;re also absolutely right in your assessment that this rune is going to be trivial to activate in lane, especially when you&#x27;re ahead and when you can just afford to stand in the minion wave and always have it primed, and that it&#x27;s much, much harder to make good use of it in a teamfight, where it&#x27;s unlikely that you can actively prime it before the fact and where most of the important stuff usually happens in the first 2-3 seconds--either you or the enemy is likely to be dead or otherwise out of the fight.\n> \n> However, we&#x27;ve decided that this is a good thing. We want to embrace this. Runes generally should exhibit most of their strength in the early game and then fade into the background later (some exceptions--like Dark Harvest--notwithstanding). It&#x27;s also a pretty snowbally rune, which again, we like. This is meant to be a rune that doubles down on the strengths of bruisers without shoring up any of their weaknesses. Winning more when ahead is a very bruisery output, being better at split-pushing than at teamfighting is as well. There is a cost: you&#x27;re constantly pushing if you&#x27;re always in the minion wave, attacking to keep your Conqueror primed. \n> \n> Finally, as one release valve output we&#x27;ve also decided that the first damage that puts you in combat puts you in combat for 4 seconds, so your fallback is when you&#x27;re being poked you can decide to jump in 4s later with Conqueror fully primed.

Will they nerf  the true damage ratio for ranged champs?  Probably  (though I hope not), but this will make for interesting teamfight  if they last long enough.

Does this mean I have to have a 4.1 second trade with my opponent before this turns on? Because that won't help the croc at all...\n2. Does this mean that after I hit a minion, in 4.1 seconds this turns on (e.g. like Camille's 2nd Q cast after 2sec, or like Jax's passive stacking it on minions)?\n\nWhat is the cooldown, text doesn't say (e.g. it turns on, you don't hit enemy champion, how long before it turns back on)?\n\nOverall, I think this is a great idea. To me It means:\n\n1. No one but pure tanks will be taking grasp/aftershock (e.g. no Riven aftershock).\n2. Hell, even Camille might drop comet for this/she won't be perma-pick-ban especially in pro.\n3. Squishy ranged champs will have a much harder time dominating melees.\n4.

The rune, with its mixed burst/enhance output(Especially after recent changes), is powerful on most of those bruisers, as they can proc it quickly and they benefit from the damage amp in teamfights(Target Selection+defence). \nConqueror and PTA, while being completely different, fill a pretty damn similar spot. This leads to Conqueror just being completely unnecessary within precision(Already have PTA, why have a second version?). It feels very similar to the comet/aery case: They both do, for the most part, the same thing. Aside from Aery having an interesting niche for heals/shields, it really doesnt matter what you do with either. Conqueror/pta will fall into the same category by virtue of being in the same tree - with the added problem of AS being a really wonky early game stat(Most want straight AD for lane, jungle usually wants ad/as mix - even for most high AS scalers). Currently, thanks to split+buff, I am \"forced\" to take the unwanted AS stat, due to how good PTA is on most of these bruisers(Which, incidentally, feels like lockiing me into domination or sorc secondary, locks me out of inspiration secondary completely). \n\nIf a decision doesnt matter, it is no decision anymore. Conqueror pushes even more bruisers into Precision, despite AS being a bad stat on them - and due to the split, it is impossible to take inspiration secondary and makes it hard to take resolve secondary(Especially for lane dominant chams like Kled or Renekton). \nThe rune itself seems like a really good idea. But the precision tree needs to either let Conqueror or PTA go. \n\n\nOn a sidenote: What exactly do you think about the AS stat on precision in general? Very few champs want AS early, they want AD. Even on-hit ADCs tend to like early AD more. The split actually feels like benefitting those on-hit champs more than the ones who really dont want early AS(Draven, Lucian), as the bit of AS is at least useful for those on-hit champs. \nAside from that, AS is most effective within the jungle for clearspeed. But even the likes of Master Yi like the split more(More burst in ganks is valuable). \nAs I see it atm, the best stat on Precision would be simple AD, no AS at all. Give it AS based keystones and masteries, but not the stat itself. Id wager it would even be more powerful(much more!) by simply shifting the stat to AD(Overall, it feels like Precision has many high-impact minor runes with a lot of gold value within them). Stuff like Triumph is too good on frontlines in teamfights(Especially bruisers). Free LS and Tenacity is worth its weight in gold. A high damage increase option for every type of champ in the last tree(Often times performing evenly to some keystones like Aery or Electrocute). Any thoughts on this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Familiar Faces","date":"2018-03-03T12:30:20.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to suggest an overhaul of this concept via your consideration of four ideas. Before that, I 100% support the in active champion combat charge time and i may forget to mentin but each of these 4 ideas actually consider this a pre-requisite.\n\n.\n1) Instead of flat AD, make it amplify **Base AD**. \n\n_50% Base AD comes to around 60 AD_ on stronger melees.., so make it scale as the game goes on from **20%** Base AD to **40%** Base AD (not 50% so that you can account for how broken it'll be on sheen users). \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n2) Lower the true damage conversion from 20% to **10%**. \n\n..._And make that part of the skill temporary and but recurrent (like lethal tempo)_ until you've tested it appropriately on Akali, Rammus and Mundo at least. Also clarify what Kayle using her E qualifies as (whether ranged or melee since you didn't specify melee attacks refresh buff but \"Melee **Only**\" which may refer to melee champs only)\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n3) Consider moving this skill to **Resolve tree** and making it appropriate stat wise. \n\nGasp of the Undying is a bit lack luster for bruisers but it does aim to provide a 'reward' for being in combat. What added damage should look like in this tree ought to be related to the health or resists built. My idea is convert the amount of Bonus HP relative to the base HP to a percentage and make that percentage grant equivalent to Bonus Base AD (capped differently for melee and ranged champions of course). So if your melee champion has a Base HP at lvl 18 of 2000 and you have 3000 total HP then you have 50% of your base HP in Bonus HP. After 4 seconds in champion combat, grant the champion 50% base AD (assuming the maximum cap isn't below 50% for melees).\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n4) Move skill to resolve tree and _increase the threat of a champion based on total AND %missing HP._\n\nPerhaps this is the concept that ought to replace Grasp of the Undying. But regardless, a champion should do occasional max hp based damage based on their max hp and this damage should be magnified by how low they are. If used to replace Grasp of the undying then say the typical 4% max hp dmg proc after four seconds with half of that vamped as healing. If that champion is missing %50 of their hp then the 4% max hp is magnified by 50% (of missing hp) to make 6% max hp of damage proc half of which is vamped.\nAlternatively if used on conquerer it can provide either stats and/or true damage conversion amplified by how low a champion is. Like for instance if conquerer gave flat AD or AP based on hp built and these base stats got amplified by how low the champion is. \nOr if conquerer gave a base percentage of true damage conversion after a small while in champion combat and this amplified based on how low that champion is.\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn summary as it stands I think the skill is a tad OP and has no interesting themes except melee preference. Bonus flat AD, converting some damage to true damage is quite offensively generic. \nAt the core of a bruiser is the idea to balance tankiness with offensiveness. This keystone manages to not thematically represent that as is. the 2nd suggestion is more a tuning issue but the 1st, 3rd and 4th more directly explore building like a bruiser.\n\nP.S.\nI you want a quick tweak on grasp of the undying.., consider giving grasp bonus healing (and shielding?) from all sources like spirit visage but instead of flat, make it like Olaf's W and scale based on missing HP. Grasp of the Undying paints a picture of a beast that refuses to keel over. So thematically should be used to emphasize champions who cling to life while being at the edge of death (taking damage, high sustain like the juggernauts)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LucifronSun","date":"2018-03-03T06:29:50.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If popular opinion counts for anything on this, I'd like to add my vote to the \"Please don't make it like grasp of the undying because that activation is garbage and I hate it\" pile.
