Technically barrier doesn't just block ignite. You can't compare barrier vs ignite simply on the basis of how many ticks it blocks. Barrier can still block a ton of damage, so even if it only blocks a little of ignite, it blocks a flat amount of other damage as well in a given timeframe, and so its net effect is unimpeded. Barrier is still a fine choice against ignite because it will potentially block enough damage to prevent a death.","replies":[{"poster":"Tegash","date":"2018-10-04T23:36:16.427+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I totally agree with that assessment, which is why I listed Barrier as Ignite's _only counter._","replies":[{"poster":"ValyrianBlade","date":"2018-10-05T15:29:05.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tegash,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=piuaFE6k,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2018-10-04T23:36:16.427+0000)\n>\n> Oh, I totally agree with that assessment, which is why I listed Barrier as Ignite&#x27;s _only counter._\n\nAnd barrier has a shorter cooldown than ignite...\n\nIgnite is making a play. That should be encouraged. Barrier gets a shorter cooldown and is denying a play. \n\nIf ignite is op, barrier is too. Just because barrier only lasts long enough to cover 2 ticks doesn't mean it isn't able to block the abilities and auto attacks that came in as well. If you thought you didn't need barrier and were mistaken, that's sort of your own fault for using it after all their burst went down...\n\nI've been denied by barrier way too many times (by decent players actually blocking my burst, not just my ignite) to agree with this thread.

Assassin's are super strong even without ignite to be honest. They have no problem at all deleting Squishies, I'm detecting a little bias. They have so much from lethality, burst keystone's, burst items, etc. They can practically oneshot half of the juggernaut class when even in level and items at least until late mid to late game. If assassin's are too weak just because ignite gets nerfed by like 30-60 damage, then they have other problems that need to be addressed as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slogg","date":"2018-10-04T20:55:10.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
