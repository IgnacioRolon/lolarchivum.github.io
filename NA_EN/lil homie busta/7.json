But i not gonna discuss about them, since most of the time discussions about it leads to nowhere. Riot explains some of the Yasuo's biggest problems in the \"Ask Riot\" blog up there ^^^.\n\nI've been playing with this champion for a few years by now and he's by far the most fun champion that I've played, from all champions in this game. The feeling of dashing and attacking at the same time, the sound of his E and his ult, his lore... I could keep fan girl-ing this champ all day but i gonna save you, reader, from this.\n\nI wish i could go back and keep playing with him, but much as i enjoy it, i can't ignore the toxic/frustrating-to-play-against champ that he is. I've been waiting for riot say something about his rework while engineering ideas and suggestions for it. I think i manage to archive a good suggestion that avoids changing too much his kit, thus preserving his design core. Please, put a little of time to read and understand this suggestion, as well discuss about it =D. \n\n**Biggest changes in bold text !**\n*The numbers are tentative! focus more on their idea over their actual quantity!* \n\n-------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------  {{champion:157}}  - Yasuo, the Unforgiven  -----------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------\n\n> https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/80/Way_of_the_Wanderer.png\n> **[Passive - Way of the Wanderer]**  \n>  ---------------------------------------------------\n> \n>  - Intent: Yasuo gains double the critical strike chance from all sources but when he critically strikes, **his basic attacks and \"Steel Tempest\" deal 75% damage while \"Last Breath\" deal 55% damage**.\n>  \n>  - Resolve: Yasuo generates a Flow stack for every [ **74** (lv1~6) / **65** (lv7~12) / **57** (lv13~18) ] units he travels by any means. At [ 100 stacks ] and upon taking champion or monster damage, Yasuo consumes all Flow to shield himself for **15% of his maximum health** for up to **3** seconds. **The amount of Flow stacks generated is doubled if Yasuo dealt damage to an enemy champion in the last 2 seconds. The shield has an internal cooldown of 4 seconds that starts when it ends or is destroyed**.\n\n.\n.\n\n> https://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e5/Steel_Tempest.png\n>  **[Q - Steel Tempest]**\n>  -------------------------------------------------------\n> - TARGET RANGE: 475 / 900 \n> - CIRCULAR SLASH RADIUS: 375 \n> - STATIC COOLDOWN: [ **5 - 2** ] s (based on bonus attack speed*¹: each 1% bonus attack speed decreases 0.5381% of the cooldown / the cooldown is decreased by 1% for each 1.8583% bonus attack speed / this is capped at 60% cooldown reduction at 111.5% bonus attack speed) \n> - **FIRST AND SECOND CAST PHYSICAL DAMAGE: [ 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 ] (+ 100 % AD )**\n> - **THIRD CAST PHYSICAL DAMAGE: [ 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 ] (+ 106 / 112 / 118 / 124 / 130 % AD )**\n>  \n>  \n> FIRST CAST - STEEL TEMPEST: After 0.54 - 0.18 (based on bonus attack speed*¹) seconds-delay, Yasuo thrusts his sword, dealing physical damage to all enemies in the target direction and granting \"Gathering Storm\" upon dealing damage.\n>  \n> \n>  \"Steel Tempest\" can critically strike for 75% damage and apply on-hit effects **to the first target hit**. Casting \"Steel Tempest\" after \"Sweeping Blade\" makes Yasuo perform a circular slash **after 0.27 - 0.09 (based on bonus attack speed*¹) seconds-delay**, affecting enemies around him instead. **\"Steel Tempest\" can only critically strike one enemy per cast. When the circular slash critically strikes, its critical strike prioritizes champions with lowest current health, followed by the nearest champion and finally the nearest non-champion target**.\n>  \n> \n>  SECOND CAST - STEEL WIND RISING: For the next **7** seconds, Yasuo can gain another \"Gathering Storm\" stack by hitting an enemy with \"Steel Tempest\", empowering it for the same duration.\n>  \n> \n>  THIRD CAST - GATHERING STORM: Yasuo consumes all stacks to unleash a whirlwind that travels an increased distance in the target direction, dealing physical damage and knocking airborne all enemies hit for 1 second. Empowered “Steel Tempest's” circular slash does not gain increased range.\n\n.\n.\n\n> https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/61/Wind_Wall.png\n> **[W - Wind Wall]**\n>  -------------------------------------------------------\n> - TARGET RANGE: 400 \n> - COOLDOWN: [ 16 / 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 ] s\n> - WALL WIDTH: **350** \n> - **BARRIER WIDTH: 250** \n> - **BARRIER RANGED DAMAGE REDUCTION: [ 18 / 21 / 24 / 27 / 30 ] %** \n> - **THRESHOLD DISTANCE: 475**\n> - **ENEMY BASIC ATTACK THRESHOLD DISTANCE: 300**\n>  \n> \n>  ACTIVE: Yasuo creates a gust of wind that travels in the target direction over 0.15 seconds to form a wall in front of him.

Enemy basic attacks have a different threshold distance**. \n> \n> \n> **Yasuo can only gain a \"Gathering Storm\" stack once per \"Wind Wall\" cast and if the following requirements are fulfilled: the current amount of \"Gathering Storm\" stacks is less than 2; “Steel Tempest’s” third cast was not used in the last ([“Steel Tempest’s” current cooldown] x 2) seconds**. \n> \n> \n> **The \"Wind Wall\" creates a wind stream when it forms, that lasts for 3 seconds.

Yasuo cannot dash to the same target more than once every few seconds. **When casting “Sweeping Blade”, a delay between its charges use is applied and the recharge time of the charges  is increased to its initial value. “Sweeping Blade” requires at least one charge to be cast**.\n>  \n> \n> Each \"Sweeping Blade\" cast increases the next dash's base damage by 25% for 5 seconds (up to 50%) **and generates a bonus movement speed buff to Yasuo that can be stack up to 3 times.

Some buffs may have more impact than other nerfs and vice versa!*\n> *\"\"Buffs\"\"* : \n>       - Dealing damage to a enemy champion makes his Flow a.k.a passive shield charges ~55% faster for 2 seconds, increasing the risk-reward and avoiding the \"walking in circles\" gameplay.\n>       - His shield lasts 3 seconds instead of 1.\n>       - 3rd Q (tornado) damage increased by 27~29% (compared to the 1st and 2nd, to define further the window of power of his Q).\n>       - Q stack window or duration would be increased from 6 to 7 in order to accommodate the new cooldown better.\n>       - Wind wall cooldown decreased by 61.5~66,7%.\n>       - If at least one enemy champion projectile is blocked by the wind wall, Yasuo gains a barrier that decreases considerably ranged damage he takes through the it (like Braum's E). The barrier last 4 seconds and binds to Yasuo's facing direction, meaning that it turns when Yasuo turns. Additionally, Yasuo gains a \"Gathering Storm\" stack for his Q as well by blocking with the wall, which can sums with another stack if he hits his Q, making his tornado availability more large when he has his wind wall up. \n>       - He gains a bonus MS buff every time that he uses his E. This buff stacks up to 3 times (up to 3x the initial bonus MS buff; just like the E base damage increase).\n>       - The wind wall leaves a wind flux where Yasuo can use his E to dash through it, giving him a escape/re-positioning tool, as well making his E less dependent in the targets around him.\n>       - Ult can crit for increased damage, and his 20% armor penetration (not bonus) is applied as debuff on the enemies that he ults, while his crit strikes refresh the debuff (remember that he can only crit strike one target per time now), making him very good for ad comps.\n>       - All his base stats except range and health regen got increased by 4~5~6% approximately.\n\n.\n\n> *\"\"Nerfs\"\"*:\n>      - His critical basic attacks would deal 75% damage instead of 90% (~16,6% less damage) and his shield would charge slower while he \"walks on circles\".\n>      - Q would only be able to crit one target, meaning that people can use minions to block part of the damage (ps: this would give some more counter play to his enemies, and Yasuo would still be able to use his E+Q to crit on champions, since it would prioritizes champions over minions; part of this AoE power that removed would be transferred to his ult)\n>      - His Q would have a higher cooldown (not much higher), since still a AoE knock up with damage every few seconds that can crit.\n>      - The E+Q would have a small delay (Q delay/2) just as his normal Q, since his E+Q is far more efficiency than normal Q in almost every situation because of its point click target-ability. This would make his solo engage a little less binary/cheap in some situations.\n>      - The Wind wall duration would be decreased by 2.90 seconds (0.85s left) and the gust of wind duration would be decreased by 0.10 (0.15 left).\n>      - The gust of wind would not be able to block projectiles more, thus, Yasuo would not be able to block projectiles by throwing the wind wall in the opposite direction from the projectile that he wants to block (yep, you can do this currently).\n>      - The E would have charges 3 charges. Yasuo could only use his E up to 3 times in a certain recharge time period (13~9s).\n>      - Ult's cd would be considerably increased (from 90/65/30 to 90/80/70) from ranks 2 to 3.\n>      - Ult's big 50% bonus armor penetration buff would be changed to a 20% total armor pen, which is less efficiency against tanks (melees) and useful against squishes (which most of the time are the ranged champions, since most of ranged champions tends to build less armor). Not only that, this armor penetration effect would be converted to a debuff, meaning Yasuo wouldn't have it against all possible champ targets unless he manage to ult 5 people.\n>      - Base ranged decreased from 175 to 125.\n\n**Is good to remind again that the numbers are TENTATIVE! Try to focus on the mechanics, such as wind flux and crit ult, rather than the actual numbers !**\n\nThanks for the attention, i appreciate every constructive critic that you guys may have for this suggestion! I really wish riot to be successful on his rework, this is why i decide to contribute a little.","replies":[{"poster":"IronwallJackson","date":"2017-08-09T01:42:22.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Clarification:**\n\nI ended my last post by suggesting you don't understand Yasuo's design. That isn't necessarily a huge slight, but I should still expand on what I meant.\n\nYasuo's crit passive and ult ArPen both serve approximately the same function; damage steroid and build efficiency. Allow me to explain further.\n\nThe crit passive, as it stands, serves as Yasuo's primary damage steroid (one of the things all skirmishers get), the incentive to build crit instead of bruiser/off-tank, a gate on his late-game power, as well as a freed item slot so that he doesn't have to build a third crit item.\n\nThe bonus ArPen serves as his secondary steroid, and it is very good at its job. It lets Yasuo bypass the need for a Last Whisper item so he can kill tanks efficiently while also freeing up a second item slot. He's supposed to be good at killing everything. That's a built-in feature of his class, and unlike some other examples, like Yi and Tryn, he doesn't accomplish this through sheer, overwhelming damage.\n\nNow, why do two of his skills free an item slot each? It's so he can build some extra health and resistances. For all of his built-in safety nets, he's still easy enough to pop, and going full AD isn't a legitimate option like it is on a normal ADC. He couldn't reach optimal damage and also have the survivability requisite of an otherwise squishy melee if he can't buy extra defenses.\n\nBecause he's a melee champ meant to reliably face ranged threats, you either make him beefy enough to shrug off harass (not good), or you give him situationally powerful defensive tools. The latter is more easily balanced because in exchange, you can make him much squishier, and that, in turn, lets you make him more mobile and damage-oriented as well.\n\nEvery \"melee carry,\" \"light fighter,\" or whatever term you like for autoattack-oriented melee champs have a similar suite of tools as Yasuo, though none are exactly like his. Jax has counterattack, Fiora has Riposte. Yi has true damage, bonus AD, and attack speed steroids, Tryndamere has AD and ACTUAL free crit. Xin has his dash, and so does every other skirmisher. Due to the nature of League's ranged/melee divide, they all need these tools to function. \n\nYasuo's kit is so synergistic with itself that one big change throws everything out of whack. You made several big changes and the end result is bad. Really bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-08-09T02:38:36.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completly understand the amr pen concept. Suming up:\n\nMelee Carries or Skimishers(riot's name) are champions that have 4 main aspects:\n\n- A Windowed absolute defense tool\n- A high sustained damage\n- A way to deal considerable sustained damage to all enemies, including tanks\n- A low cd mobility\n\nThe problem is that the whole concept of melee carry should'nt exist. This is one of riot's old mistakes (such as flash) that no one notice.\n\nIs all based on the \"Marksman whitout range\" dillema. If you pick a marksman such as caitlyn and remove her range and try to create a new champion based on this, what would you give to this new champ in order to compensate the range removal? Damage? Cc? Mobility? The answer is there's no answer. Its a inconsistency. By removing the marksman's range, you make it broken, and there's nothing that fix it, just like if you remove an arm or leg, nothing will ever trully compensate it (sadly). Riot try to answer this dillema with Tryndamere, Fiora, Yasuo: giving that list to them. But that's doesn't solve the source of the problem, it just helps somewhat.\n\nWhat i wanted to suggest is actually a whole skimisher roaster update, but i think you're right. Transforming Yasuo into a diver isn't going to solve the problem. I guess he could still be a melee carry, but with more counter play. I will think in a good change for the ult, thanks man. ~~sorry if this was a little too philosofical. Sorry for typos too~~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The MechE","date":"2017-08-09T01:18:32.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about making it so he can only dash to heroes?","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-08-09T01:29:47.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that would make his mobility awkward when laning.

Yauso wants to engage when his shield is up, not when it's down, and the internal cooldown means the accelerated regain will almost never be relevant.\n\nHis Q is more difficult to use against enemies since one can bodyblock the crit for another and it does less damage 2/3 of the time. Also, I think this version takes even more attack speed to reach a worse CDR cap.\n\nThe damage-blocking portion of his W is awful and more difficult to use reflexively, and then his ensuing damage mitigation isn't very good since Yasuo is very squishy to begin with. Braum's wall blocks only a portion of total damage because he's a tank and is beefy enough to take it.\n\nI don't actually mind the E changes too much, in theory, but increasing a damage value on an ability whose damage is only relevant early game isn't a good when paired with an aggressively small number of charges. You might have given Yasuo two on-point-wonder abilities.\n\nFinally, his ult's damage increase is nice, but damage is only part of the reason you have for ulting. Not really. The aoe and cc are still there, but his bonus arpen isn't, and that's actually a problem. Yasuo doesn't need total armor penetration; he does enough damage to squishies already. His **bonus** arpen is there specifically so he can kill tanks faster and not the back liners. This does the opposite of that.\n\n**TLDR**: Lots of number tuning *could* fix this rework, but it's bad beyond just the numbers. If you'll pardon me for throwing shade, I don't think you quite \"get\" why Yasuo's tools work the way they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Homie busta","date":"2017-08-09T01:27:57.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your point. The suggestion may need further improvement, since it's just a suggestion.\n\nI don't agree with you in some points tho, which is good, disagreeing may generate good ideas.  Yasuo is before anything else, a fighter. He does have his assassin moments, but he doesn't have what it takes to be a assassin. Being beefy is good for him.\n\nAlso, the shield can have endless approaches and uses. You're seeing the shield just as a quick trade or engage (when you don't have ult) tool, which isn't its only usability. You can use your shield in a prolonged fight activating it twice in the fight by dashing and moving, making Yasuo more durable, which is a fighter's aspect.\n\nHis W have little to no counter play now, it needs to have a more skill based aspect, such as requesting the Yasuo to have more reflex. Is a good approach to the W, it rewards Yasuos with good timing.\n\nI don't think that this suggestion needs to be \"\"\"fixed\"\"\". It could be improved, but in others directions.
