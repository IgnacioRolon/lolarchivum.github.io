I went to see if I could order the Quest hoodie the other day and I could, it was just a matter of waiting for my next paycheck. Now, today I went to order my hoodie and it now has switched to \"In Progress\" instead of \"Complete\", making me unable to order it. Have I now lost out on my opportunity to get my hoodie?\r\n\r\n(Note: I also submitted a ticket to riot about 17 hours ago, and I realize that that may not be enough time for you guys to respond to it, but seeing as I only have a small window of time left to redeem my hoodie, I would like this resolved ASAP! Thanks ahead of time!)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-27T22:06:55.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our merch team can look into this for you!

I know 3 days isn't that long of a wait, but seeing as I only have 2 more days until I won't be able to order it, I am getting a bit antsy.. I would really hate to miss out! :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LetmetrollU","date":"2016-08-30T00:49:28.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try a different browser or clearing the browser's cache, I had a similar problem in which the status never changed from \"In Progress\" and I was able to reedem  using a different browser, I hope this could help you.","replies":[{"poster":"Crimson Cupcake","date":"2016-08-30T04:50:34.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LetmetrollU,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=JxcV9RqA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-30T00:49:28.617+0000)\n>\n> Try a different browser or clearing the browser&#x27;s cache, I had a similar problem in which the status never changed from &quot;In Progress&quot; and I was able to reedem  using a different browser, I hope this could help you.\n\nI thank you for trying to help, but neither of those ideas worked. I feel like since the other day I stuck it in the cart, and then got rid of it, perhaps it glitched out my actual account. Thanks again though! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
