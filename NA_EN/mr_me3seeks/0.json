If the rest of your team was there too, you could have done it and killed their adc and run before getting liked while the rest of your team moves in too. But in most situations their adc would kill you, or their mid would or you'd be hit by a bunch of crowd control and you'd get deleted while not being able to do anything. Also depends on how much damage you could do. If you could 2 hit their adc, I would say go for it. They wouldn't expect it and see it coming. But if it took you 4 spinning axes, you'd be dead before you could do it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amelie","date":"2016-07-12T15:58:27.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That depends whether the rest of your team was there or not, and how low hp the backline was.\n\nIf it's just you two against Vi and the ADC, going to the back does nothing.

Idealy you would take things to a normal game but if you are trying a new champ go all out to see how far you can push them.  Did you lose?  What happened that caused you to fail and keep an eye out for a way to improve.  At worst, your team will get angry and you will know how to play the champion at their weakest.  If this is how you can learn to play it will help you turn games around rather than be angry with your team for not carrying you just to surrender before the game starts getting good.","replies":[]}]}
