They decided to announce a  retcon to pretty much everything about the world of Runeterra (with an agreement to respect core champion themes), but they seem to be dragging their heels when it comes to actually writing any new lore in the retconned universe.\n\nTo be fair. they haven't even finished retconning Runeterra....but that's kinda the problem!\n\n@Riot, you guys totally mishandled this retcon. If it had to be done (Which I don't think it did) it should have at least been done in one fell swoop.\n\nBut you guys are dragging this retcon out for months and even years. Please end it, so that we can move on.\n\nPreferably you'd undo it, but I don't think you guys are willing to swallow your pride to that extent and admit the retcon was a dumb idea, assuming you guys actually realize what a bad decision it was, and the negative effect it is having on LoL lore. \n\n**If you have to do it, get it done quickly, and actually start releasing lore developments again. All we've had in the last few years are champion bio's.\n**\n\nChampion bio's don't add any development to Runeterra (for the most part), they just tell you more about its history. Runeterra doesn't actually change when we hear a bit more about its history, there isn't really any development, since there is no change.. None of the stuff that was there before is further developed, you just know more about it's history. Nothing actually changes.\n\nI would love to actually see some lore updates again, like we had with the JoJ!\n\nRioters, please tell me why **you personally** think lore is important to this game, so that we can help bridge the gap between player expectations, and developer's mindsets.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-26T20:26:06.864+0000","up_votes":42,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey, Impetual.\n\nYou asked for any and all Rioters - well, **I don't work directly on League**, but hopefully I can speak for one Rioter at least.\n\nI really believe that lore is super important to League - but I also think it's going through some awkward growing pains at the moment.  I think there's probably a universe where League *could* exist as a game removed of almost all setting and lore and story - like chess. \n\n*I absolutely do not think it should.*  \n\nLore can raise a game from being an abstract mechanical experience to a rich and involving experience that includes you in the struggles of willful entities.  It infuses everything from the color of the bricks in a building, to the style of animation of an attack, to the mechanical counters of two rival champs.  Ideally, it ties everything together, and every new champ, every graphical update, every story, short, animation or whatever all feel part of a cohesive whole.  Even better when the lore goes beyond the game (without invalidating it) and we can spread our wings and explore every corner of it.\n\nHowever, I believe that that is *damn* hard.\n\nRemember, I don't work on League directly, but I try to help when I can.  As a side project, removed from my usual role, I designed the Shurima tablet map that popped up recently - I was so, *so* humbled when some of you picked up on some of my historical influences.  I put a lot of thought into the culture that would make such an object - the creator, his patron, how the map had changed hands over the years, what world events had marked its surface and what was known of the world before its creation, during, and after.  \n\nI really enjoyed doing that, even though it was the tiniest of things (and most players didn't give it a second glance, I'm sure).  It's just history, as you said, however, but as a member of the 'any and all Rioters' group, that's all I personally can offer today.","replies":[{"poster":"rinsujo","date":"2015-02-26T21:10:04.653+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Bioluminescence, I don't think I've seen you around here before. Thanks for stopping by! (It's also possible I have seen you before and I'm just really bad with names. If that's the case, sorry! But still thanks!)\n\nI'm glad we agree on lore - I too think that a completely stand alone game unaffected by lore is something that we shouldn't be looking at. And I definitely feel like there's been some kind of pains lately. I disagree on growing, since it feels like we here in the community aren't getting much of any lore aside from new champs recently... but I'm an outsider, so I could very easily be wrong. \n\nI can also see how working that much Lore into an existing game can be hard. From this side of the glass though, we don't see that as much. We don't see the hours and time you guys (Rioters in general) put into this game, and it can be hard to bear that in mind when we get impatient. My hope is that even if it is difficult, you guys keep at it, and maybe we as the community could be happier if we altered our standards a bit - I can only speak for myself here, but I almost think I preferred the S1-S2 type lore - it wasn't as high-quality, but there was a lot more of it. Maybe it's something we could get used to if we took the higher-quality stuff less for granted.\n\nSo thank you for stopping by! And as someone who did get interested in the Shurima tablet, thanks for that! It's a wonderful addition to get interested in.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-26T21:38:27.664+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey, Rinsujo,\n\nNo - you're probably not as bad with names as you think - I've not posted much on the boards, as my indirect connection to League means I'm not the most informed on most subjects.  Thanks for the welcome!\n\nI completely understand the frustration - honestly, I'm a strong believer in the \"player shouldn't have to care\" school of thought when it comes down to internal struggles.  It shouldn't matter how difficult it was to make something - all that matters should be the end quality.  Or, in this situation, quantity too.\n\nFrom what I can see, there *is* an internal commitment to improving both - and I can see your point about there being more 'pain' than 'growing' from what you guys can see.  Do you do any programming?  The closest metaphor I think I can make is that there's some 'lore refactoring' going on.  Which usually means that no-one can see any benefit for a while (and it may in fact introduce bugs!), but behind the scenes stuff will be a lot tidier and easier to work with.\n\nAgain - you shouldn't have to care about anything like that.  I don't post here much, but I do read these boards a lot (Story & Art, and Community Creations, mostly) and I know how much frustrated pain there is here.  I'm pretty terrified that I'll get shouted down as an apologist for what's clearly an unacceptable situation.\n\nFor my side of things, in an effort to help, if I get another little side project like the Shurima tablet, I'll see if I can come here and expose the process as it happens - get some feedback and work with you guys to get the final thing.  Not sure when that'll be (and I know that promises are a weak currency round here) but I'll try.","replies":[{"poster":"The Red Warden","date":"2015-02-27T01:50:00.893+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main annoyance people have and why they are so antagonistic whenever a Rioter posts about the lore is that it almost never feels like meaningful interaction. That isn't to say it isn't meaningful, just that it doesn't feel meaningful.\n\n Take the champion info thread that is stickied to the forum currently for example. That thread has around a 1000 responses yet only 7 Riot posts and only 4 of them actually accomplished the purpose of the thread (answering questions about champions). Now all the responses might have ben great feedback for the team but because we got less than 1% of all the questions that were asked answered it doesn't *feel* meaningful.\n\nA person may make a post about the lore that has great input for the lore team and helps them figure out things/ provide ideas, but since the lore team never replied (output) the thread looks like it was ignored. It gets worse if Rioters just respond with \"can't say cause spoilers\" or anything that feels like they are holding information back.\n\nWhen people feel ignored, they become resentful and start building up false expectations about what a Riot response may accomplish. The reason Rioters get so much flak sometimes when talking about lore is that people feel like the lore team is ignoring them and that they don't care about player feedback. People want all their questions to be answered, but because of how rare Riot posts about lore have become the expectations for what they will answer are set astronomically high. When those expectations aren't met people become ticked and give the rioter flak even if the Rioter gave a response to the best of their ability.\n\nI know I went off on a bit of a tangent there but what I am trying to say is that the less feedback Riot  gives to players the more resentful they will become of Riot. If questions are answered more frequently Riot responses would see a lot less flak.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-27T02:26:20.684+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":2,"body":"No I get it - I've never *ever* blamed the people here for the anger they're feeling.  Feeling ignored or worse, taunted, is bound to piss anyone off, no matter how patient.\n\nI can try to give you a glimpse through the window of what it looks like over here, even though I'm not fully informed myself, if that will help - but like I said elsewhere, **you shouldn't have to care what the issues are** over there - all you should have to care about is the end result (which right now, pretty much sucks, imo).\n\nThere are a few writers here, but only a few of them are specifically on lore - apparently the team isn't fully staffed up yet (I had a writing workshop cancelled this week because they couldn't spare time for it) and most of their days are spent in meetings.  I don't know what the meetings are on - I don't have access to their calendars, but there are a lot of them.  That might sound like I'm going \"Wah wah - wasting time in meetings!\" but I'm pretty sure they're actually pretty critical.  No-one likes having their day full of meetings - generally meetings suck.\n\nIt can also feel that feedback goes into a black hole, never to be heard from again - but the delay between concepting or writing something, and actually seeing it in the game or on the site can be in the order of multiple months.  I've seen things discussed at an early stage, forgotten about it, and then been surprised when it turns up real 6 months later.  That's internally - to an outside eye that must seem even worse.  I know they want to try to improve that turn around, because it's kind of insane.  I don't have understanding where the timesinks are there, so I can't elaborate.\n\nFor myself - sometimes I know the answer to a lore question (occasionally) but not being one of the narrative team, I don't want to jump in and say something that might be outdated.  I try to keep up with it, but there's so much going on that as someone on another team, I can't be sure I have the latest info.  I err on the side that giving the wrong info would be worse than just keeping my mouth shut.\n\nIf I see another question that I think I know the answer to, I'll try to contact one of the narrative team and have them confirm that my understanding is correct, and try to post what I know.  Might take a while, as that sort of email isn't really urgent compared to daily deadlines, but I'll give it a go.  Please don't expect too much from just me, but I can try to do my part.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2015-02-27T02:42:52.629+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know,I would like to see a documentary of Riot's Lore team.Similar to the Frequencies documentary done for the music department.\nSeeing their work could help the fans understand or at least,see for themselves,the working environment of the lore team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slushi Simcambi","date":"2015-02-27T02:33:45.190+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you have nothing to do with this.\n\nBut we were promised a discussion a month ago now with the Lore department, and we were left in the dark.\nThe guy in the thread where this was proposed was home sick, working off the clock doing what people in his department should have been doing, and it really gave me the impression that the lore team was a disorganized clustered mess.\n\nTwo weeks later I still had hope when they made comments in a thread to come up with topics for the proposed discussion.\n\nNow it is... much much later. \nAnd nothing.\n\nIt seems pretty despicable that lore would outright abandon us like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-27T04:00:49.879+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"I understand that it's the lore team that you feel let down by - I don't want to cause some kind of 'us vs them' vibe.

It's a weird, twisted, legal reason but I'll try to explain how that one goes.\n\nSay I've come up with a game idea - it's great, it's awesome, and I know just the studio to make it!  I write it all up, complete with character designs, feature list, backstory, and plot, and I put it in an envelope and post it to a studio lead I like the work of.\n\nNow, unbeknownst to me, that studio has been working on a game in secret for the last two years - it has a very similar main character (square jawed white guy in his 30's?) and at least 4 of the features are the same.\n\nThe game comes out that fall, and much to my outrage - they have clearly stolen the best bits from my design and not given me any credit!  Now, the lawyers want to be able to point to the envelope, unopened, in court so that they can prove that no - they didn't steal my ideas and give me no credit.  If they opened it, then they can't prove that.  \n\nHeck - with all the best will in the world, it's really hard to say where inspiration comes from - they could have read it, not liked any of it, but then had a very similar idea suggested to them by the QA lead a month later and thought it might work then.\n\nNow, I don't know if that's the same reason why fan submissions for story can't be read by the narrative team - it could be - it sounds very similar.  \n\nAs for the staffing issue - I don't know how many people they want on staff, or how close they are to it.  I just know that there was going to be a writing workshop that I was kind of excited about, but I was told most of the writers couldn't dedicate the time to it - and that maybe when the department was fully staffed up, it might get a bit better.","replies":[{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2015-02-27T06:52:09.530+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna copy and paste this from something I wrote on another board.

We don't have to agree, we can be angry, but at least we have an idea of how things work for the writers.\n\nI have to ask, what's the difference between story ideas, champion, and skin concepts? Won't you encounter the same legal hurdles?\n\nAlso the summoners, many of us never saw them as overpowered. There was a power gap between the leaders and your average one. Even actual examples of overpowered actions could've been retconned or explained as very taxing. You never discussed it with us, or the direction Riot wanted to take the lore. We could've shared our opinions, give you ideas. \n\nIronically, now you're stuck in this position of releasing lore that doesn't contradict the league, making us wonder if the drama was worth it vs. contradicting the league and upsetting fans who enjoyed it, and continue to write fan fiction about it.\n\nThen there's the case of retconning character personalities to be something entirely different, and often times not for the better. Xerath doesn't love magic for its own sake. It's a tool for revenge. Trundle doesn't care about his people. He's ready to sell them out for power. Karma isn't known as the peaceful diplomat with class. She's a mildly sexualized fighter. Cassiopeia has know public connections to her family or Noxus. We don't know what'll happen with Skarner. You're taking unique characters and turning them into generic tropes.\n\nWe don't know if you're trying to surgically retcon the league (let's be honest, you guys carved it out) or you're trying to rebuild or retell the story from the ground up. Part of me wishes for the latter.\n\nWhy are the bios taking so long? Is it worth having those paragraphs on the client? Did anyone complain about its length? Do you think people will bother reading your stories on the website? Why not make a meta thread linking the stories on the forum? At least it shows how much you guys got done and we can offer criticism.\n\nWe want to care what goes on behind the doors because it's obvious your team needs help. There is a pathetic lack of communication going on, and to be blunt, I don't know why it's being tolerated for so long by the company. If it were the gameplay or skins teams things would've changed and there would've been outcry forever ago. How does Riot plan on telling the story for now on? It hasn't been consistent.

That it's now essentially a Super Smash Bros. style game where we can go \"Well what would happen if X fought Y!\" except we are given no reason to actually become invested in X or Y, because League of Legends is the only game we can play them in and the media they exist in elsewhere is scarce at best (if you're lucky like Azir or Lissandra and get an arc dedicated to you), and practically nonexistent at worst (Hecarim is a huge, scary, undead centaur; probably could've figured that out after looking at him). \n\nWe are given VOs where champions either give us a glimpse at their personality while not saying anything of consequence or interacting with anybody in any meaningful way (Braum, as much as I love his archetype), or are devoid of personality and have 10 minutes where they make vague comments about one thing (Kalista with her revengeance, Azir with his SHURIMUH)--although DotA 2 may have spoiled me here.\n\nIt's strange, because the in-game entities that were meant to directly represent the players and what could have been set up as a unique tool to allow them to interact with the universe of the game (summoners) were wiped from the story of the game, alongside the Institute and the League that this game is named after. Everything tying the players to the world of the game they were playing was chucked out in the name of \"creative freedom\" (which has yet to be exercised), character interaction has been limited to \"they're rivals!\" or \"they live in the same region!\", and the stories we *are* given are filled with the clichés that Narrative used to subvert in interesting ways--\"chosen one\"s, deus ex machina, and characters defined by cool magic things they found as far as the eye can see.\n\nThere are many ways I can describe the current state of League's narrative, but \"strange\" is the only word I have to describe how I feel after reading your post--because every point you make about why narrative is important resonates strongly with me, yet very few of those principles seem to be present in the game whose universe once inspired me.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-27T01:18:20.834+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey, ItemsGuy,\n\nSorry for making you feel strange about this - if anything, I'd recommend you err on the side of anger; I'm not connected to the narrative side of things directly, and I can't speak for what they're doing.

If you don't mind me asking, how do you (you, specifically) feel about the great retcon? The lore team wanted to entirely separate lore from gameplay via retconning the League of Legends from, well, the League of Legends. It'd be cool to hear the side of the story from someone who seems to disagree (correct me if I'm wrong) with that direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-26T22:20:48.139+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hey, Motajo,\n\nPersonally, I think the great retcon was a good enough idea that was done too early, and without the needed content to support it.  I think someone (or several someones) made a mistake on timing and we got the worst of both worlds.  We took away without giving back in return.  Honestly, it's too early for me to tell if the retcon will be a *great* thing - it all depends on what content we release.\n\nThe relationship between the game and the lore - to me (whisper it) the lore is bigger than the game.  The lore can be so much bigger and deeper and richer than a 40 minute match on the Rift - but the game absolutely comes first right now.  It's a weird struggle - I came from a studio where story was king, so this is quite a change for me.  I think the change that's happening is that, in the beginning - the game was the lore.  Then, the lore got bigger and bigger, and started to take on a life of its own - but it was still beholden to the game.  I think we might be moving to a place where the lore is the lore, and the game references parts of the lore.  I'm not sure if I'm making sense, or even if that's how the rest of Riot feels on this.\n\nI know you felt I might be someone who opposed the change - but I'm mostly in 'wait and see' mode, myself.  There probably are a few Rioters who oppose the change - and others who are really happy about it.

Looking at the lore and the game as entirely separate entities that kind of share sideways glances every once in a while, is treating them like additive forces. Sure, if you like the game, you like the game, and if you like the lore, you like the lore--but they are divorced from each other, and sometimes that rift can be jarring (and again where DotA 2 may have spoiled me--how come Lucian can lane with Thresh and not have anything to say about it? Why does Caitlyn have nothing to say to Vi?). \n\nBeing intent on keeping them separate and seeing the lore as something that was constrained by the game (and even then, every story has constraints--you can't have magic in Saving Private Ryan, and nobody from Breaking Bad can interact with anyone from Game of Thrones, or leave the boundaries of their own, small worlds), instead of being set on using the lore and game as tools to enrich each other--with whatever constraints that may come--is lowering the potential value of either. Using them as forces that multiply each other will always be the better option, unless the value of one entirely eclipses the value of the other--and even then, that's a problem all its own.\n\nEven if right now the game is an 8 and the lore is maybe a 5 on a good day (thanks, Sion), 40 will always be greater than 13.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-02-27T01:52:30.368+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"I may have said it all wrong - I didn't mean that the game and the lore were separate and only vaguely connected.

Star Wars is bigger than just the movies - there are books and games and comics and everything.  Ideally they inform each other, but at the end of the day, the movies are king.\n\nI agree that having things like VO between Thresh and Lucian (at the very least) would be an excellent addition - hell, I bet they've thought of that and want to include it if they can.  There has been (from what I can see) an increase in the number of VO lines and taunts between champions, usually there to reinforce and play off the lore of the world and the champ relationships.  There's not enough though, not yet.\n\nIn my head, I start to have problems with some of that introduction - having VO between champs is awesome, but then I start to get caught up on the weirdness of the game.  Like, Institute of War or not, in my head if we were being entirely true to our champs, Lucian would probably rather die than work alongside Thresh.  I don't know how, in game, we could authentically represent the depth of his hatred for Thresh (not to mention literally clicking on the lantern that contains the soul of his beloved wife) without getting in the way of the 5v5 PvP game.

DotA 2 and even Dawngate (R.I.P) give context to their game and their characters via comics and the like, but these comics also respect the game they are telling stories about--Dawngate with their shapers, and DotA 2 with the Battle of the Ancients. \n\nThis does get tricky, in a game where a Lucian/Thresh support lane is possible, and Kayle can help Morgana walk into (and ult) the entire enemy team with her heal/buff and ult. This is also where I think having something like Summoners and creating numerous parallels between the game universe and the universe the audience lives in. Much like how not every League game match is a part of the LCS or some other major tournament, not every IoW League match is deciding the outcome of some major conflict (the Ionia vs. Noxus rematch, for example). The average game could be the equivalent of a practice match between summoners, with magically-generated replicas of champions bound to the Fields of Justice, so Thresh/Lucian lanes could exist without causing the universe's logic to crawl into itself and explode. \n\nLikewise, the game could further distinguish the average match from the cool big ones in a way that doesn't exclude the vast majority of the playerbase (like the Ionia vs. Noxus rematch) via a separate, event-based \"Lore Queue\"--with limited rosters that allow players to contribute to the outcome of a conflict and ultimately shape (or at least interact with) the story of the game, in ways that are entirely impossible right now. Imagine if, instead of a neat but otherwise forgettable \"Three Sisters\" event to punctuate the Freljord arc (which, even though it ended with input from players via voting, was entirely inconsequential), there was a Lore Queue where a side could be picked, and your victories in that queue contributed to your team's points (with losses contributing less so, and contributions scaling to the size of each player pool)--then at the end of the event, once the scores were tallied, the victor of the conflict was announced and the story progressed accordingly.\n\nIt's a bit of a rough concept and would require more time and resources than the current static Lore Events, but it's an example of how the story and game could act as amplifying forces towards each other, due to having player involvement play a crucial role in both. No matter which way you look at it, the most important aspect of a game's story is the fact that it takes place within an interactive medium. When you play Super Mario, the princess isn't saved unless the player saves her. In The Last of Us, the story does not progress unless the player takes progressive action. In League, things just kinda happen as they happen, and if you think Lissandra is a really cool character, you can wombo combo the enemy team with your Ashe ADC and Sejuani jungler without any of them saying anything about it--and then continue to not have even the smallest effect on the world these characters allegedly came from unless you apply for a position within Narrative and are hired.\n\nI appreciate that you want the best for the game, and your willingness to interact with the community and speak your mind says enough. Don't feel like you've got to apologize, especially after going out of your way to make the people that love this game feel a little bit more at ease! : )\n\n(Also, double thanks for reading these super long posts.

You won't like my theory, but I suspect that the Freljord event was an experiment to see what could be done with the smallest amount of upset to the normal game.

Like you said, it didn't have a really meaty outcome, but the voting was a cool feature to test.\n\nMy theory is that the Freljord event probably wasn't as big a success as some people hoped, and that pushing through an bigger event than it could be a hard sell - especially (like your Lore Queue suggestion) it was so integrated into the game.  \n\nI'm sure you've seen it, over on Reddit, when a post about lore pops up, and half the replies are people asking Rioters to stop 'wasting time on story' and fix the bloody game.  Usually those comments are from frustrated gamers too - who have seen bugs that seem to last forever.

Ellie doesn't have a thousand Joels all laughing (groaning?) at her jokes at the same time.  MMOs have been trying experiments for years with big events, expansions, phasing, and the like, but most of the time you're still waiting in line behind other players, trying to hand in your 10 bear asses to the quest giver.

I see Champions allying themselves with summoners for political advantage/access to archives/because they're imprisoned and would rather fight, then having no control during the match. But then again I like dark stories. It's more fun if it hurts. I do think some champs might willingly sell themselves into service for money (Bilgewater)\n\nI get what you mean. As is often the case, sometimes you've just got to make a call and go with it. I imagine that someone could make a pretty good LoL mini-verse based on Champions being imprisoned and forced to fight. I just prefer a different vision.\n\nCertainly, some Champions are forced to fight, but I'm talking mostly about the monstrous Champions. (Or Cho'gath, who seems to be playing along; even the Summoners probably don't believe they've *really* got him under control.)\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Finnical,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oTlyWZBu,comment-id=00010001000000010000000200000000,timestamp=2015-02-27T08:49:28.529+0000)\n> \n> I assume all matches are real matches. I don't see any reason one champion couldn't be summoned by different summoners at the same time; We are talking about a magical world here, the rules of reality don't have to be the same. Another post on this board mentioned that matches could be played with spell-copies of the champs; Makes sense to me.\n\nWell, it's the spell-copies idea that I was referencing. I think I put an off-hand reference to \"imprints\" in **[The Harrowing](http://leaguefactions.net/nyroth-update-5/)**. (Actually, the other problem is that the population of Runeterra doesn't seem big enough to accommodate the existence of literally a hundred million or more Summoners. I don't lose sleep over handwaving that issue.)\n \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Finnical,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oTlyWZBu,comment-id=00010001000000010000000200000000,timestamp=2015-02-27T08:49:28.529+0000)\n>\n> As for 2?

As for why he doesn't attack him on the grounds of the Institute, well, he'd probably like to, but perhaps he realizes it just wouldn't do any good. He needs to hunt him down in neutral territory.","replies":[{"poster":"Finnical","date":"2015-02-28T04:48:33.176+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> In a match, there's really no opportunity to do anything about that.

I picture a little story where Lucian constantly stalks Thresh, but Thresh knows it and doesn't leave the grounds of the institute when Lucian is watching. Thresh laughs at Lucian's fury and impotence, hiding behind the Institute's rules. \n\nHowever, I don't think people who are killed in the halls of the Institute respawn, I'm pretty sure Lucian would just start a fight anytime he could find Thresh. Maybe the summoners would be aware of the problem and actively prevent it. Either way there's a story there as long as the Institute exists.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
