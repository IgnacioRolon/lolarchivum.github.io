I&#039;ve gained great respect for Riot due to these policies, and I&#039;m hoping that my thread will be heard, and given an appropriate response based on it&#039;s merit.\n**\n*I&#039;m going to preface this by explaining that Riot used to openly share all of this kinda info with players. Rioters used to talk to us on the forums pretty casually about game development, which was pretty awesome. That's what set them apart from other developers**\n\n1. What&#039;s going on with the people writing Champion/world lore? What&#039;s the lore creation process look like these days?\n\n2. Is Riot willing tell us which Rioters are on the lore/story creation team, and how the structure of their current development process actually works? \n\n3.

One of the things used to express that Champion beyond the in-game experience is the new character introduction. It's a short summation paragraph (who and what is this?), a longer biographical entry (how did they get to who they are now?), and some color text (show you the Champion being the Champion). The Editorial Team does QA on the quality of story, clarity of expression and grammatical accuracy of all text (VO scripts, Story Sketches, which are the narrative version of concept art, and the final characters introductions) Champion Update has a similar process. Foundations is focused on supplying internal documents and alignment on the identity and characteristics of Runeterra to inspire and empower product teams to make stuff that feels part of the whole. Foundations is also working on updating Champion texts that are not being handled by Champion Team or Champion Update.

We're adding more writers to the discipline, so you'll be seeing new names as the months roll on. One member of the discipline is working on her first Champion right now.

I've got some stuff I've gotta deal with IRL, but you can be sure that I'll be back to further discuss stuff like this with you.\n\nJaredan, thank you for actually responding.

I acknowledge that Riot really got burned in the past by making promises that it couldn't keep. Maybe that's why they don't communicate with players as openly as they used to.\n\nMy post was trying to get some answers about why Riot isn't keeping us informed on which Rioter's are working on which teams how they're currently operating their business. They used to talk to us about that kind of stuff in a pretty detailed way, and I feel like that set them apart from other companies.\n\nPerhaps you're right and they won't talk to players as much because they're trying to avoid raising expectations. But who knows for sure.\n\nIt would be nice if a Rioter could confirm or deny your theory and put this to rest, although I guess they have no reason to actually do so.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2016-03-01T17:05:19.333+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the problems with stating who is on what is that things can also change there.

I can understand that you don't want to build up our expectations too much, but at some point you need to commit to _something_ if you want to stay in touch in a meaningful way. Just as an example, RuneScape has regular \"Behind the Scenes\" updates, both monthly and weekly. What is stopping League (specifically Narrative) from doing something similar? If it's really just fear of commitment (which I personally think is unfounded, but I'm not the one working on the most popular video game in the world so w/e), then do appropriately vague updates like \"This week we talked about Demacia and Noxus and how their conflict will pan out post-retcon\" -- stuff like that doesn't set any expectations and only encourages discussion.\n\nWhen are you guys gonna do a regular newsletter kind of thing like that? Call it \"This Month in Narrative,\" and you could have points like \"Jaredan wrote down 'Demacia vs Noxus' on a post-it note the other day; WHAT COULD IT MEAN??\" That'd be so great.\n\ntl;dr Really, I just want something that changes the lorehound-Narrative dynamic to something other than dogs being thrown a bone at the whim of their master.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArlanKels","date":"2016-03-01T18:38:15.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jaredan,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=g58ysQGt,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-03-01T16:59:55.717+0000)\n>\n> That's definitely true when it comes to the individual project and its content.
