True, in an ideal world they would have worked out the background reworks for every character that wasn't getting a major kit/visual change, plus all the world details, and we would have gotten an endless stream of monthly events in Bilgewater sized fashion back to back lore updates on a lore-de-force. But......\n\nI think with the fall of the journal of justice, and backgrounds not even mentioning the League for 2 years it was pretty obvious they were always intending to remove it. It's just they hadn't come up with \"how\" to do it, or what would replace it and they opted to simply \"announce\" it and then get to the actual doing of it \"later\". I don't know if that was the lore teams original idea, or of people higher up in the company than them.\n\nIt's my hope at least, when the retcon is finally done, all champions are updated, and all that is behind us...we can actually go into long \"story arcs\" and we can get a little bit at a time on a regular basis.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Impetual","date":"2015-09-15T08:02:02.489+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Krinu,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=Y2y8GAIQ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-24T18:40:28.811+0000)\n>\n> Speaking as a writer... doing this stuff well takes *time.*\n> \n> Quite a bit of it, actually.
