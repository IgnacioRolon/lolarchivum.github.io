Ashe's voiceovers weren't altered during her update, she only received additional lines that fell more in line with her stubborn, cocky personality from the old lore. In addition, her lore in both versions was told rather than shown. While the old lore narrated her personal story arc through the Journal of Justice, the new lore narrates it through Quinn's diaries. The key difference is that the former has actual quotations from her, so it still shows more of her viewpoint than the new lore.\n\nShe also did have an origin story in the past, one which the new lore draws from. The one key difference is that Ashe is said to have earned her title as the Frost Archer through training and mastery of the bow. In the new lore, it's simply handed to her by her picking the crystal bow from a rock.\n\n{{champion:72}} There is admittedly a chance that his personality has been retained, but I wouldn't expect it (partially because his current VO still references summoners). Skarner's current lines are subdued and somber, with a threatening edge when combat comes up. In the lore, he is bluntly described as a \"merciless creature\" who kills everyone who approaches him.\n\n{{champion:101}} His intentions are actually spelled out. \"Bristling with power and resentment, Xerath plots to reforge Valoran in the fires of revolution,\" also to \"utterly destroy any who oppose him\". In addition, the Ascension Q&A had Rioters refer to him as the \"bad guy\".\n\n{{champion:15}} Sivir's original voiceover was admittedly terrible and didn't match any of her lore at all, something Riot admitted to. It was in part why her voiceover was altered. The Journal did reference some of her adventures, but she didn't receive a spotlight until very recently.\n\nThat said, your argument for her doesn't address the part where her lore description and in-game quotes don't match her behavior during the video. She is said to have huge personal issues with Noxus, yet trusts Cassiopeia enough to follow her all the way into the depths of a tomb after all her men are murdered by traps. She is described as a hardened mercenary, yet gets horrified by death. Her personality is dismissed to the point where any character could play her role with just some name replacements.\n\nSo no, my argument that the new lore lacks character depth and good delivery still stands, as does my argument that Ashe's character was completely flattened. When a character suffers from a lack of \"show not tell\", what you do is show. What you don't do is remove everything that can be shown.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ark Angel HFB","date":"2014-10-07T23:23:15.712+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"Noticed you once again dodged adressing a hard issue... here let me post it again for you...\n\nCare to tell me how the following line up with a Team that is \"Player First\" focused.\n\n\"We want to write stories with you guys.\"\n\n**\"We can't talk things over with you because then things wouldn't be surprises.\"**\n\n**\"We certainly will not poll players for their opinions.\"**\n\n\"We write for you.\"\n\n\"We really care about the players.\"\n\n**\"We have removed the players from the lore.

I know it may feel like that to you, but no one here is feeling any contempt or taking anyone for granted. I suppose it's on us to prove otherwise.\n\nRiot's known for meaningful community engagement: not just \"let's talk about how cool what we just created is!\" but serious, in-depth discussions that take place early enough that they can truly influence what comes next. The lack of this from the Narrative team is our main complaint.\n\n# Look no further: here's a clear opportunity to engage with us ahead of time.\nIf you'd like to prove otherwise, here's just a random example: **[a thread about Bandle City and its fate.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/A8hitWGw-bandle-city-lets-talk-before-narrative-retcons-everything)** We currently have no clue which faction you have your sights set on next, but hopefully Bandle City is still far enough away that there's time for some real discussion. Or pick another faction or topic and post a thread seeking real discussion, like the balance team does before a rework.\n\n# Lay off the shock reveals, at least when they involve major retcons.\nI understand the dramatic power of shock reveals, but they're just not appropriate when you're retconning major elements of a universe: by their very nature, they do not allow for prior discussion. Save the shock reveals for stories that don't tear up the foundations of the lore.\n\n\"Contempt\" may seem a strong word, but I don't think it's wholly inaccurate. The impression being given is that you're not engaging in real discussion because, at the end of the day, you've decided that nothing we say will change your mind, and thus there's no point. It really does seem that you've just decided, \"Okay, forget the community, let's do our own thing.\" Sometimes, artists have to work like that. But especially in a community-driven environment like League of Legends, I think you should *very seriously* reconsider this approach.\n\n# We've spent years building upon these foundations that you're tearing up.\nEvery time Riot overturns old lore, rewrites the setting, or remakes a character, there is a very real cost to the community. People have not only become familiar with and attached to the lore of Runeterra, but many have crafted a great deal of lore, roleplay, and other creative work on that foundation. (I suppose I'll bring up **[Factions](http://LeagueFactions.net)** again.) I don't know about \"contempt\", but you certainly show a lack of respect for the community when you decide that \"not wanting to be 'constrained' by the League of Legends\" is sufficient cause to obliterate all of this and strip the game itself of its backstory. You didn't ask us for thoughts on how the League might be reworked to resolve these \"constraints\", or ask us for any other such input: you were silent for years, ignoring our attempts to communicate on this topic, and then bam, blog post, we're retconned.\n\n# \"Computer, end program.\"\nI'd like to draw an analogy to Star Trek. There's another universe with a *lot* of community investment. When they went to make the new movies, they handwaved in a wacky \"alternate universe\" plot element. Why? Because it allowed them to formally maintain the existing canon. Was it a little awkward? Yes. But it shows that the authors behind that universe respected their community deeply enough to come up with a way to make it clear that nothing was being erased or rewritten, *even as they created what would otherwise be a total reboot.*\n\n**tl;dr: Too many shock reveals.

The second they tell you 'we're working on it' people like you and cupcaketrap and philomelle are jumping on them bitching about the things they're trying to establish as a foundation for exactly what you want.\n\nI understand not trusting them... but holy crap you guys are acting like 6 year olds who just had their favourite toy taken away and it's really sad to see such intelligent people devolving into incredibly whiny children. I know that you guys are intelligent - it's immediately evident and apparent in the way you structure your sentences and the vocabulary you use and the ideas you come up with.\n\nBut man, the way you're acting... does NOT convey that same intelligence... and I simply do not understand why you guys are completely unwilling to take a step back, think for a bit, and realize that you guys are not acting like your normal reasonable selves... and that the way you're acting is actually doing everyone - yourselves, riot, and even those of us who are not a part of this - a lot more harm than good.\n\nI get it, you're upset over the current transitionary state... but a cocoon isn't very useful to anyone, yet the caterpillar needs it to turn into a butterfly. Yes, things are going incredibly slow. We all know that, so do they and everyone is unhappy with it. I'm not going to ask you to trust them, I know very well you don't... all I'm going to ask is that you wait until they've finished laying the groundwork and can start actually ATTEMPTING to deliver their promises before you accuse them of failing to deliver...","replies":[{"poster":"DG Ashabel","date":"2014-10-08T14:06:20.397+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"> My problem, on a personal level, with responses like this is that you're not willing to give them the time, tools, or opportunity to prove themselves. The second they tell you 'we're working on it' people like you and cupcaketrap and philomelle are jumping on them bitching about the things they're trying to establish as a foundation for exactly what you want.\n\nThat would be because we've been waiting for two years already. When someone waits for two years and is rewarded with a \"We give up on lore altogether and are removing it from the game, but here is a marketing campaign where the story keeps contradicting itself and you'll now buy our new fancy champion and discounted skins, right?\", the whiplash generally burns out the remnants of their patience.\n\nI have been very patient. I accepted things like the Freljord rework despite what it turned my precious Ashe into, and I endured through the completely hollow and pointless Shadow Isles \"update\". But I can be patient for only so much time and when the narrative team keeps on blatantly ignoring what people want, I can't do it anymore. Trusting them any further would be the height of battered wife syndrome. It would be like someone shoved you off the stairs every time they had the chance, then said \"Hey, come up to the top of the stairs with me, I promise I won't shove you *this* time\".\n\nIt's completely illogical to trust them at this point. I simply cannot trust someone who dismisses everything spoken on a massive forum filled with upset people and takes their investment in a game for granted. What they do is look at me, know I've been in the game for three years and have spent hundreds of dollars on it (there are maybe 60 skins I don't own), and assume I won't leave because I'm too attached, therefore they can do whatever they want.\n\n> trying to establish as a foundation for exactly what you want.\n\nWhere exactly are they trying to do that? The vast majority of the community is crying for the return of the old lore, all discussions on the Story forums are still built around the ideas of old lore. In the meantime, the narrative team still waste time insisting that we'll love the new lore once they finally, *finally* release it. That might be establishing a foundation for them thinking they know what we want better than we do, but it's certainly not a foundation for taking our opinion into account.\n\nTheir window of opportunity for getting people attached to the new lore was during the week after they released the retcon announcement. People were upset, but still curious about what the new story could entail. They were upset about losing their immersion in the story, but hopeful and eager to play around with the new setting, assuming that the reason the lore team was silent for *over a year* was to prepare all the necessary assets for the new narrative direction.\n\nThat opportunity went down in fire when instead of a complete rundown of the altered setting, we got a two-week long Azir commercial and mumbled excuses about how \"everything is exactly the same but without the Institute\" (which said commercial already proved wrong). At this point, people would sooner set any further foundation for the reboot on fire than accept it. To call this a complete and utter PR disaster would have been a compliment.","replies":[{"poster":"Eleshakai","date":"2014-10-08T15:42:49.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Philomelle... \n\nYou quoted parts of my post, but didn't even read the entire post... this is exactly what I'm talking about.
