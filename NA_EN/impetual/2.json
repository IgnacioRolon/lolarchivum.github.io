With all major political decisions on Valoran now decided by the outcome of the contests that take place in the battle arenas, a summoner is the key force of change on the continent. As the summoner controls the champion in combat, the summoner also influences the outcome of the match through the use of summoner spells, runes, and masteries. Once a match is over, the summoner gains experience and influence points. Experience points allow the summoner to gain increased powers by unlocking additional spells and rune slots, while influence points allow the summoner to gain access to new champions and new runes for use in future fights.\n\n_(As of late 2014, Riot has stated that the concept of a Summoner (as found in the lore of the game) is to be altered, Institute of War is going to be removed and thus the in-lore League of Legends is to be \"Fully Relaunched\" again.)\"_\n\nThis tells us that the old lore doesn't matter, but the new lore will be coming soon*tm.  So far, Riot has not even hinted at what summoners are in the new League of Legends lore.\n\nRiot has yet to actually give a detailed description of what the \"**new kind**\" summoner is, as such, it makes sense to use the previous definition until RIot actually comes up with a new one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Acolyte of Steel","date":"2015-07-26T07:54:03.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Lore, I'm afraid. I can't find a resource for the originals I speak of here, so hopefully someone else will pitch in with some sauce for my retelling!\n\nTwisted Fate was still born to Gypsies, which does kinda make sense for Bilgewater. His oldest lore assumes he was born to Serpentine Gypsies, as in the newest lore, but I couldn't find that for the lore just prior to it. Graves was found in the back of a Bilgewater bar as an infant, left with nothing but his swaddling blanket and a bottle of spiked milk. The two of them didn't meet each other until they were men, both grown up as con-men and cheaters in Bilgewater's Underground, in separate circles. It was the only way to survive: Men born with nothing risk everything, or die on the streets with nothing still. For them, it paid off. They cheated, gunned, gutted, and gambled their way to the very top of Bilgewater's underground networks until finally, after probably 20-somethin' years, the two men faced each other for their fortunes. It's said that people from all across Bilgewater gathered to watch them play... \n\nThere was no telling who would win. It could really go either way. Every card dealt seemed to shift the balance of play... Then, on the last hand, both of them flipped the same winning cards. While the crowd lost their minds with shock, joy, and anger, they both kicked back in their chairs, pondering each other. They were both the best at what they did, and now they knew it for sure. It was a partnership that would last a lifetime - or, so they thought. \n\nThat was allll before various Zaunite doctors got involved and turned them on each other.
