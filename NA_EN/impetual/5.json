Why do we have to hear things from secondary sources like Riot Bioluminesence, who isn&#039;t even on the lore team?\n\nI miss the days when RIoters would talk to us directly without any bullshitting and tell us exactly what was going on with the game. I miss Season 1.\n\nEDIT: It would be nice if you could answer the question in the thread title BIoluminescence, although I don't expect you to.\n","replies":[{"poster":"EvilMerodach","date":"2015-10-04T15:48:06.678+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she mostly does it in her spare time because she enjoys it, not actually part of her job.\nThe actual narrative team has too much they are not allowed to talk about till it's out.\nSo for her, it's fun to speculate and talk with community about \"what if's\" and the like.

And discussion type threads [where a Rioter posts multiple replies to the same thread, (EG: AMA's)] should probably be condensed to 1 mark on the red tracker, with it only showing newest post on that thread (if you want to see others, use the forward/backward buttons in the thread).\n\nTL;DR- keep postin' I like your posts, and have a feeling anyone that likes League lore in general likes your posts too.

The solution is getting Narrative to be more active on the boards, not just the occasional \"we're reading your threads\" line that no one actually believes anymore.\n\nFrankly, it should be up to _them_ to get involved in the discussion.  Maybe not Shadow Isles (or whatever else they have planned for the Harrowing), but the following project(s).  And, to be completely blunt, someone higher up the food chain should light a bonfire under Narrative's collective asses and get them to step up their production schedule, since they'll never get their bios done at their current pace (4 champs per annual story arc).","replies":[]},{"poster":"333lom","date":"2015-10-04T20:50:44.540+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry Bio, I think you have the right to come join discussions here on Story and Art just like anyone else.

You misunderstand me.\n\nI DON'T WANT YOU TO BACK OFF RIOT BIOLUMINESCENCE! NOT AT ALL!\n\nI THINK YOU ARE AWESOME!\n\nI just wish the lore/narrative/foundations team did their job better than you are doing it for them, especially when it comes to community interaction.\n\nLore developments and restructuring information should come from them, and not you. Aside from Jaerdan, who posts extremely rarely, the narrative community for LoL doesn't really have anyone keeping us filled in on Lore developments on the forums.\n\nAlthough I do appreciate your efforts to cover for the shortcomings of your colleagues, it would be nice to have someone from the lore/narrative/foundations department talk to us consistently.\n\nWhile I consider you really awesome for filling in for RIoters on the lore/narrative/foundations or whatever the team is called now, they simply aren't communicating to players effectively, which I would think would be part of their job. I'm kinda tired of hearing the Riot mantra \"I'm not on the right team\" instead of getting actual definitive answers from Riot.\n\nIf you read this Bioluminescence, could you comment on why the lore/narrative/foundations departments don't interact with us on the Story & Art forums more than a single Rioter from a totally different department?

My guess is, though, that there are probably heavily conflicting ideas or management issues for the future of the lore. Perhaps they require work done by other departments to do things. Or, hell, maybe they have absolutely no idea what the hell to do.\n\nThe truth is, we have no idea, and they don't want to talk. Whatever plans they have are shrouded in more mystery than Kalista's entire existence. When they do release things, it seems they're more based on a short novel rather than a massive worldbuilding experience like we've had in the past.\n\nTruth be told, other than the nitpickiness and insulting their intelligence, I don't really have much of a counter-argument.\n\nAll we can do is wait...","replies":[{"poster":"Dextix LT","date":"2015-10-05T04:40:23.502+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didnt nitpick at their name, i did say that i dont care how we call them, but narrative apologists usually bring this up for some reason when defending the narrative for the \"job\" they do.\n\nI dont know exactly what is happening in Rito HQ, but i can deduct things. Look at how the other departments are working. While the balance team is fcking up again in many cases, they are still working. Art team are just monsters right now, they never have been better. Even Lyte is getting softer andtalking about punishments and is also coming up with a new system for punishments.\n\nNow, which team isnt doing their job, narrative.\n\nI cant see talent here, im sorry, but i cant, i can however judge their inteligenece. Look at the facts.\n\n1. The lore was destroyed 1 year ago. No replacement was ready or is ready yet.\n\n2. There is still no runettera map.\n\n3. Burning tides took 8 months to make.\n\n4. Some champ lores still dont make sense.\n\n5. 90% of the world is still missing.\n\nNarrative is an entire team. Fanfic writters write better stories more often when they are solo than this \"Team\" of \"Talented\" writers.
