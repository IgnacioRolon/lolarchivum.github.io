Props to Bang who had a near perfect game on Sivir in game 1 of the series.","replies":[{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2015-04-11T20:58:50.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't take too much from games that happen right before the playoffs. Every team is going to be holding stuff back so as to not tip off their strategies for the playoffs, just like they do in every other sport. GE and SKT are the 2 top teams in the Korean standings, and the result of the series they just played is effectively meaningless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vixanys","date":"2015-04-13T17:44:45.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCK Standing were set -pretty much- in stone 2 weeks before this. Teams don't play hard if they don't have to. Don't show strategies if they don't have to. It was just technically an exhibition match and GE got caught not caring.\n\nThe way the LCK playoffs work. GE is guaranteed to be in the Finals. (Gauntlet system Team Team 4 play Team 3. Winner plays Team 2. Winner plays GE).\n\nSo _Jin Air plays CJ. Winner plays SKT. Winner plays GE._\n\nThis style rewards a team for their play the entire split/season.\n\nBecause of this once the standings were fixed, most teams didn't care what happened.\n\nWe cannot gauge anything from the games that have happened in LCK/LPL in the last two weeks sadly, because there is no impact.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PoisonedTea","date":"2015-04-11T21:53:22.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"GE been looking week sense IEM","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeroAnarchy","date":"2015-04-11T21:12:39.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If SKT continue this trend of dominance in Korea and win the split, it will be a toss up between SKT or EDG for the best teams in the world","replies":[]}]}
