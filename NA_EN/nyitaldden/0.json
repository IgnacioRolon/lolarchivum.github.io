DO NOT LET THE GAME LAST TO THE POINT WHERE THEY REACH A PEAK OF POWER.  Tryndamere is a split-pushing champion and only relevant so far in a team fight.  Master Yi has only one strength:  his ability to take out a target.  If you punish his lack of gold, he can do little about it.

Illaoi is currently a champion of debate because she has clear moments of weakness, BUT, when she is not having one of these moments, she becomes a champion that is \"avoid at all costs until she loses her ultimate\"  which is unhealthy.  \n\n#Here's a point I think you missed in your own explanation: \"telegraphed and delayed damage.\"  Unless you are facechecking near an unwarded area, Master Yi and Tryndamere have very binary kits that are predictable because it is a core part of their engage.\n\n>You're confusing an overpowered champion with a champion who was no counterplay.\n\n#8, really?  Aatrox could ONLY be kited during that period.  He had to be killed THREE TIMES and was a monster because of it during team fights.  Tryndamere and Yi both can be crowd controlled and put out of action when killed.  Aatrox only waited it out and the fight was over, or you were run under your tower and the game was done while they busted down your base defenses UNLESS OF COURSE, YOU WERE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FIGHT AATROX, IN WHICH CASE, HALF YOUR TEAM GETS WIPED BY HIM ALONE\n\n#9 here's a fun fact.  Master Yi and Tryndamere are DUELISTS, as are fiora, jax, riven and multiple other champions.  If ANY OF THEM catch you alone, you are going to die.  DON'T DUEL THE DUELISTS!  that is their one and only strength:  taking out a single target at close range, which riven was long-criticized for because she can do  more than other duelists and has an ult that can cause a large amount of Area Damage","replies":[{"poster":"Arakadia","date":"2018-03-22T23:02:53.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"######I'm sorry I can't hear you, would you mind speaking up? \n\n######Also...\n\n> 2, Yi's Q cooldown is reduced by attacking and not from kills;\n\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/398719344449814530/426515407969452047/unknown.png","replies":[{"poster":"3TWarrior","date":"2018-03-23T22:03:24.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that happened because I used # before my list.
