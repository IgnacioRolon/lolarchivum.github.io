You can look at my match history, the scores are there-- but the wins aren't. Now before you start to freak out and scream TILT TILT TILT, or a casual \"noob\" let me just say that I am fully aware that it is my fault that I am losing. I understand that in order to rise in rank I need to carry the team. Bad teams will come, but I have to be good enough to carry them. Believe me, I get that #thanks sky. So basically all I am asking for is someone to train/mentor me. I have skype, my in game name is Catalora, and I want to improve. Plus, I'm normally not this boring and depressing (lol), the loss that made me think of doing this was not one I would like to recall. So please help a dude out. Rescue Whale will thank you.","replies":[]}
