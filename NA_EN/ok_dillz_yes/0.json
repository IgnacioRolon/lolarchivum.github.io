I had 3000 ping and had to get off as to avoid feeding the enemies but I was able to rejoin and help my team get the final push in to win, even though I rejoined as a lvl 8 against lvl 12s.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-25T22:12:47.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system will treat all leavers equally and regardless of where or why you leave.  This is because all leaves still cause others a negative experience, so it's really important to resolve whatever is causing taht high ping.  My recommendation would be to start by going through our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot your connection to our game servers.  I hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
