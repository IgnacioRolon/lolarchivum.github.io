If they are going to take a look at Zilean, they should make the champion more fun to play in general.\n\nIf Zilean can revive/speed/slow people with \"Time abilities\", rewind cooldowns, and instantly place bombs on peoples heads(??) there should be more to his abilities than click target and run. Giving allies experience is something that doesn't really fit into the game and relies heavily on your teams success in lane.\n\n**Passive: **Whenever an ally is affected by Zileans spells, all of their cooldowns are decreased by 0.5 seconds. Whenever an enemy is affected by Zileans spells, their cooldowns are frozen for 0.25 seconds.\n\n**Q: Warp Bomb: **Zilean creates a rift at a target location that implodes after 1 second. Enemies are displaced for a short duration. a/b/c/d/e damage.\n\n**W: Rewind:** Zilean places a target champion back to the location they were at 0.5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds ago. \n**WP**: Increases his passive effect by 0.1 per level.  \n\n**E: Time Warp: **Zilean blinks in the direction of the mouse cursor and gains an 150 unit aura that speeds allies or slows enemies by a/b/c/d/e %\n\n**R: Chronoshift:** Makes a target ally untargettable and stunned for 1 second, resets all of their cooldowns by 75%, and on Zileans next Time Warp within 5 seconds they are warped with him.  a/b/c cooldown.\n\nToo OP? Maybe. But it just seemed like a really fun kit to play with.","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-05-02T00:10:58.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"<the passive is nice> :v","replies":[]},{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-01-28T17:31:17.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His passive it's useless I'l make his actually \"Rewind\" like his passive and put acompletly new skill in his E, he is a Mage Time a very cool theme that can be exploid with a better kit.\n\nNew Passive: Rewind: After using a ability Zilean reduces the cooldowns of all of his other abilities by 6/ 8/ 10 seconds. COOLDOWN:  15 / 11 /  7 at levels 1 / 7 / 14\n\nAdd a little buf in his Time Warp:\n\nZilean slowing an enemy champion or increasing an ally champion's movement speed by 55%** (+ 5% AP)** for a short time.\n\nAnd add a completly new E, something that cause damage (Actually only his Q make damage)\n\n\"Zilean creates a lapse in time around his target enemy or friendly champion giving instaly a % dmg reduction.
