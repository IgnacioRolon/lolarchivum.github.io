Are you still experiencing this issue, and if so can you provide any screenshots and the url of the page you're accessing?  Also, I'm curious if you have a browser or extension issue that might be causing problems.  I recommend trying to access the page through incognito mode or [clearing your cache and cookies](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752694-Clearing-Browser-History-and-Cookies).
