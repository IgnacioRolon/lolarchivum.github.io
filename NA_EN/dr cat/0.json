I mean really its a line that's a single texture file and it's been iconic to the character for years yet they're so willing to just delete it from everyone just to satisfy one or two countries that are niche target audiences?  IMO that's just bullshit.  Karthus is something I can understand since keeping and updating two high detail models is hard, but Graves' cigar is easily something you could have between servers with no conflict.  I mean hell it's what they've been doing for Vlad for years (BBQ sauce blood lol), and they'd likely just subtly change gragas' lore to make him a juice mage if there was a country that had alcohol as a taboo.

The Original \"Fire Temple\" music sounding \"too Muslimy\" and was a secret attempt by Nintendo to enact Shria Law in USA (this was pre-9/11 and Islam was a fair target apparently).  Post legal settlement the vocals of the soundtrack were removed.\n2.
