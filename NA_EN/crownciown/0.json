Somebody hacked my account and is playing games on it but I don't want to open up a ticket so that they are aware I'm trying to fix the situation. I have all the proof I need to verify it is my account but I can't find a fast way to get support from Riot. Any help is appreciated.

You can also use a different account in order to create your ticket. \n\nIf you really want to contact Riot Support using a different method, you can email PS at **support@riotgames.com** or use Live Chat on the Riot Support site.\n\n> _***~~NA Support Live Chat Hours of Operation:~~***_\n1 PM (Pacific) – 9 PM (Pacific)\n2 PM (Mountain) – 10 PM (Mountain)\n3 PM (Central) – 11 PM (Central)\n4 PM (Eastern) – 12 AM (Eastern)","replies":[{"poster":"shakesd33","date":"2019-02-14T06:09:45.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I think their Live Chat has been down for the past few days.

Once we normalize it will be turned on again when we can appropriately answer in a reasonable time to cover it.","replies":[{"poster":"shakesd33","date":"2019-02-15T01:41:59.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate you keeping us informed through this frustrating time!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"snakesnakesniper","date":"2020-01-08T11:05:44.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i want an admin please","replies":[]},{"poster":"i have noob adc","date":"2019-11-26T12:30:53.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my last season rank dont show why ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stormy97","date":"2019-08-15T04:03:16.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why riot so wicked?!
