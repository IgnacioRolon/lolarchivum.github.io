I think the game design is fun, the champions are creative and exciting, and that it deserves the success its gotten. Riot talks alot about toxicity and creating a positive play environment and do many things, such as bans and the report system, to try and handle that. They even purposefully don't have voice chat natively for the league client but they do have all chat, which isn't all that different. Why would one team need to be able to talk to another team at any time?\r\n\r\nI suppose you could say its for informing the other team about trolls on your team and hoping they have mercy on you but that's not really what its used for. It's used for flaming, venting at the other team, straight trolling, and occasionally conversing. I just don't understand why it exists when it has no practical purpose and is often times a negative aspect of the game. \r\n\r\nOf course I'm not saying this would stop the raging after the game is over or the bad stuff being said to team mates but riot seems so intent on things like chat bans and curbing negative wording that it's weird that nobody addressed what allows some of the negativity in the first place. Of course more than likely I'm missing something obvious but I did alot of searching for why all chat is a thing or if riot talked about it and didn't find anything. Thanks for reading and sorry about the run ons and grammar, just a spur of the moment kind of post.","replies":[{"poster":"TrulyBland","date":"2015-09-22T01:13:48.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Allchat can be used to express sportsmanship like no other tool. I never really got all to upset about rage from enemies, or even about people whining about their team. But I've had some games where the allchat made the game a blast. A little bit of smacktalking (the friendly type), complimenting each others move, and of course: \"great game, well played\".\nI consider a friendly teammate almost a necessity... a friendly enemy however almost guarantees an enjoyable game. I obviously can't speak for everyone, but ever since Riot turned it off by default, allchat has been a larger source of enjoyment than of frustration.\n\nI've seen people vent in _teamchat_ about every single teammate (even though that obviously makes no sense). People rarely actually want to vent specifically to the other team, Some people simply want to vent in whichever way is available; and some of those choose allchat as a tool. Some people want to make their teammates (who they blame) feel shitty in whichever way is available; and some of those choose allchat as a tool.\nGo big or go home. If you want to remove all chatbased toxicity, you'd have to remove teamchat as well. And that is simply not a good idea in such a strategy based game, since some things simply can't be expressed in pings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"qnn4MLdDF4","date":"2015-09-22T00:45:58.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cut chat out completely. Not just /all chat, get rid of the chat feature in game 100%. It'll cut out hurt feelings and toxicity completely. Maybe then Rito can start putting money into cool things like making servers that don't DC me during champ select, kick me out of the game and cause me to lose my plat promotion series.

There's nothing chat can do that a ping wheel can't except encourage things that don't need to be said. \n\nI love DOTA's ping wheel, it has a ton of more ping-able things than league's does. But league won't give you an option to disable your chat, and now all hell is about to break loose with the \"new and improved\" system they have in place of the tribunal. League has boiled from punishing true toxicity to anything that could possibly hurt your teammates feelings at all is toxic, even if you mean it to be positive.\n\nI say disable chat all together. People will argue that shit-talking your enemies is a legit strategy though, some people try to win by making your enemies tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"Corbanik","date":"2015-09-17T02:01:54.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off thanks for responding. I really do want to get some more opinions about chat, all chat specifically. \n\nI could see the removal of chat as both something good and bad. Like you said, pings give the crucial information most players need and if riot upgraded there's it may work. Personally, I like team chat though. Of course you run into rediculous trolls but when utilised correctly its invaluable. Marking when a champions flash is down, when a camp is taken, or something more specific like telling your support you want to be passive in bot lane till six are uses that come to mind that may be hard for a ping wheel to replace. Although I don't know dota's ping system well enough to say and players could just strategize during the pre game lobby which may lead to more cohesive teams but that may be asking alot from randoms. \n\nI do really like the idea of an option to disable chat though. Maybe just all chat for some but another option for the players probably wouldn't be a bad thing. I really hope the new more automated system will help but it seems like a band aid when the problem needs stitches. \n\nAs far as verbal abuse as a strategy, riot has said its never okay and a punishable offense. That's why I'm so confused about a feature that seems tailor made for it. You can say all your \"good games\" or any lamentation in the after game lobby more easily than all chat since you would have to stop playing the game to type.","replies":[]}]}]}
