Harder than you might expect, cuz they just probably all scale the same and you might want to balance utility, mobility, damage, etc.\r\n\r\nFeel free to put ults in any combination. This might be op, who knows, but there are problems with having four 90 second cooldown abilities. I&#039;m thinking some kind of blitzcrank Q with kass ulti would be pretty nice.","replies":[{"poster":"TakaDama","date":"2018-06-13T00:53:03.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we including passives as well?
