I know the ARAM community is smaller, but I don't want to lose the random gameplay experience I came to love because it's meant to be more balanced for everyone. So here's my two-cents;\n\n* Items like mariner's revenge change _how_ certain champs will be played, allowing people to just force their way in (unless they have ghostly boots, then they just walk up) and suicide because they can still get a kills with the refresh and invulnerability. The stakes in those dive-engage situations are so much higher and more exciting when there's actually a chance for counter-play. I also think invulnerable, suicide dives are a dangerous and frustrating play-pattern to encourage.\n\n* I like that I can take skills and techniques I pick up onto SR with me without much difference. It's not a new experience, it's an offshoot with a map the forces fights. Personally, I don't want it to be a like a RGM that feels completely different. \n\n* Snowball fixed a lot of the problems melee champs had and champs that need to access the backline. Picking the right moment, knowing your limits, and working with your team is much more engaging from a player-perspective than having map-specific items that _guarantee_ you can get there and make an impact. \n\n* The reason I enjoy this mode so much is that even with a loss you can just say \"unlucky\" and move on without giving yourself too much grief. It isn't meant to be perfectly balanced. It's lovely chaos you have to adapt to. Against a teemo? Buy an oracles and position accordingly. Against a Xerath? Buy MR and get in his face. Team of 5 tanks? Play safe until 6, get a good fight, spend all that money, be an unkillable squad and roll over the other guys. There's always a way to win, and if it doesn't work out? Unlucky. Next queue. \n\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as winey or rude, just wanted to give my thoughts! \nLove, A Skeptical ARAM Main\n\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"BigSquirrell","date":"2019-04-05T22:42:50.682+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UndercoverRaptor,realm=NA,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=0Bt20UUK,comment-id=0016,timestamp=2019-04-05T16:52:08.990+0000)\n\n> * Items like mariner's revenge change _how_ certain champs will be played, allowing people to just force their way in (unless they have ghostly boots, then they just walk up) and suicide because they can still get a kills with the refresh and invulnerability.

It's far too strong of an effect, and there's really no counterplay other than the standard \"just CC them.\" It's not fun to play against, and it's a very unhealthy playstyle. Karthus and Sion passives have versions of it, but the champions are made to work with their passives by keeping Karthus from moving and removing Sion's abilities while also maintaining his ability to take damage. Mariner's Vengeance gives anyone that wants it Tryndamere's ult + Karthus's passive without the downside + fresh cooldowns on abilities on top of it being an AD item with armor. That's too many things all at once. I would rather have the current GA on ARAM than that.","replies":[{"poster":"good shooter","date":"2019-04-06T08:19:37.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, M'V has no counterplay.

BUT that is totally the wrong way to balance, and even made me doubt the person who did the balancing even play ARAM much?\nI'm a huge ARAM player (if you just check my match history, >95% of games are ARAM) and also reached diamond in solo rank in season 5 (not in record cause I couldn't play the game for a long time during that summer and my rank decayed before the season end)\nI'm sure I have enough game knowledge and skill and experience in ARAM to say that some of the balance changes are just bad. One example is teemo, 12% reduced damage is just ridiculous, teemo only has so much damage in each game mainly because of the shrooms. And that's also because people just don't buy oracles to clear it out, or step on it while trying to clear it, or some people walking in front of the person that has the oracle and just stepping on shrooms before it can be cleared. TBH teemo already feels not too powerful to play before these ARAM-only balancing, now it's just a pain to get teemo because teemo is so useless especially if the enemy can clear the shrooms properly. It is simply not justifiable to reduce teemo damage only because of numbers but not think about why the numbers are high.\n\nAnother thing is I don't think it is fair to nerf so much damage form the poke champions, it just doesn't make sense. When a poke champion do equal amount of total damage as other champions at the end of the game (and sometimes even less than others), it only means this poke champion is absolutely useless because it is not even better at the things it is supposed to be better at. Literally you only accumulated a nice looking total damage with useless pokes throughout the game. (useless cause it deals mediocre damage, and is largely recovered by natural life regen or healing abilities, but when a huge teamfight broke out, you can't deal enough damage)\n\nAnother thing that make the least sense is reduce damage taken for supposedly squishy champions?? If you actually think about how resistance work in the game, a flat 10% received damage reduction is nuts because the correlation between resistance and damage reduction is not linear. Also when a champion is already one of the most squishy champions in the game (sona), please do not make them more squishy by increasing their damage taken you can decrease her damage/healing/shield fine, but don't make her take more damage too. The way to do this that make sense, is only increase/decrease damage dealt for squishy champions and increase/decrease damage taken for tank champions, but definitely not things like increase/decrease damage taken for squishy champion or increase/decrease damage dealt for tank champions.\n\nThere are too many more ARAM balancing that are just wrong and only based blindly on numbers. Whoever that is doing the ARAM balancing PLEASE make sure you play tons of ARAM too, otherwise don't balance ARAM please because you are not doing it right. I am very disappointed to see the balancing because it is too obviously based purely on the apparent numbers at the end of the games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bewitching Senna","date":"2019-04-05T10:36:03.113+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":4,"body":"I don't like balance changes at all.

I was even ok with the major change to arams by adding the mark dash summoner spell, but these across the board stat changes simply based on win rate are the worst addition to LoL in its entire history. A lot of my friends simply do not like to play regular games and only play howling abyss and several of them have stopped playing league entirely since these changes went through. Some champions are harder to play and some are easier, there are usually rewards for being able to land a particularly tricky skill shot in the fact that those abilities do more damage or whatnot. Some characters have easier to play kits which in some ways are less impactful but maybe have a strong ult or strong supportive skills or whatever. Not every character is meant to be easy so of course certain players will have different win rates. Sure, every once in awhile its really annoying to have an enemy master yi steamroll your unlucky comp because of a lack of cc determined at champ select but that is literally the purpose of an ALL RANDOM game mode. Have you guys even tried playing some of the characters? Who is going to enjoy playing sona while being one of the squishiest characters in the game and taking ADDITIONAL damage while dealing significantly less damage.

If you build ludens + void + rabadons your poke is out of the sky now compared to any other champ. Even Xerath can't poke this good which is insane imho. The +15% damage was not needed I think, but too many people are still building her AD even when having enough AD champs.\n\nAs avid aram player I dislike the specific nerfs as it makes me need to relearn SR or other way around as champs suddenly take more damage. Also it's just not important to me, as people still seem to be choosing the same champs from before and I can't be bothered to keep checking this list. For NB this was fine, for ARAM it's meh. I think the presence of mind change sucks btw, as some mana-hungry champs (anivia, ...) have problems keeping up in mana which is an unfair disadvantage. Would love to see the passive of 10% or 20% or w/e on an item like old morello.\n\nI however like the ban changes for 1 simple reason: the game already wasn't all random anymore for a long time. If you want it really all random make it without rerolls and just play whatever champ you get. I'd prefer that over anything, but as it probably isn't possible because people will too often dodge --> keep the bans!\n\nAlso please look at the tahm kench bug as it's bothering me so much.
