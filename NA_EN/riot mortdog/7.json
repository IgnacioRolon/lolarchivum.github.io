You can't build cloud, steel, crystal, or electric completely without lux, she is integral to 4 different origins. Inferno, glacial, and light can be chased with spatula items, but still are helped so much by lux, It seems like its going to be mostly a race to high levels and to hope you get your version of lux to complete your comp. Comparatively noble requires kayle to be completed and she competes with 7 other 5 cost units for the chance to appear in your shop or she has a chance of appearing on carousel, meanwhile lux competes with her 9 other versions to appear and from what i understand doesn't appear on carousel and is less likely to appear at lower levels. Maybe you intend for those origins to be at their weakest without lux but i just want some clarification on why this design choice was made because it feels hypocritical to what was discussed in the learning from season 1 tft article. \n\nThanks for working on tft so much!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gag me Daddie","date":"2019-10-23T14:08:55.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if this is the correct place to leave feedback, but please change Yasuo ultimate to have him continue attacking the target he ults.
