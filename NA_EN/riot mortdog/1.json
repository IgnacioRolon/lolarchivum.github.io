No one likes to be forced to team up. Even the 4 people that get randomly assigned to your team in Co-op games are, often, undesirable, so now you ask us to actively look for them? Adding insult to injury, you ask us to add a loss to our profile, willingly? Seriously, who came up with this mission idea? What other (likely better) ideas were ignored to choose this one instead?\n\nFortunately, the ''reward'' is just an icon, so I'll skip this, and it wouldn't surprise me if others do it too.
