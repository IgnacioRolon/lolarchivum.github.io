How does a good 5 augment plus tiembuild combo look like? Do i combine it with rowdy and the other 2 q augments? or with rowdy and the 2 passive augments?\n\nLike Harsh gives based on Ap BASE AD. So do i go normal Lichbane or Trintiy Force Combined with Full Ap build? Like i went trinity, seraph, rabbadons and ardents (idk, for cdr, ap and as), triple q augments with harsh and drop and still were around 250k dmg. Like even on my Full tank -0 ad/ap items jinx with triple w augments, plan a and z i did around 500k dmg.\ni would suspect even with a stronger ap item as ardent and lichbane instead of trinity plus the passive augments the damage would not rise much higher, definetly not get doubled. Let alone this probably is worth nothing in onslaught. This was like crewmember difficulty.\n\nAnd for interesting gameplay it also not works quite much, in my opinion. The multiple ways you can play ziggs, malphite and jinx are pretty interesting and only the least stuff works not in onslaught like ap yasuo. But for this it is still extrem funny to play it on like captain. T be fair Sona will always kinda be a spambot with her ults so just an ad build seems not to work,a t least how ic an see it witht he augments we have. The Ultaugments, diffrent e and w augments are sur interestign adn q and passive augments can work for ap, but yea...harsh/drop idk really.
