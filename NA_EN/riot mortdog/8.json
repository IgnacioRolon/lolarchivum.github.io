She’ll be warping in as a Legendary 5 cost unit and opening quite a few new build possibilities since she is a Void Assassin Ranger! A triple hitter to enable more unique builds. She can be the carry in an end game Ranger &amp; Brawler build, or a safer Assassin while you chase the 9 Assassin dream. Lots of possibilities.\r\n\r\nKai’Sa’s base AD is lower, but she comes equipped with the highest base attack speed in the game. Perfect for stacking a Guinsoo’s or procing that Stattik Shiv as quick as possible in the end game. Her ultimate also allows her to jump around the map quickly and avoid dangerous situations. No longer are rangers locked into the corner!\r\n\r\nKai’Sa comes with an additional change to the Void trait. We’re happy with the true damage as a counter to strong defense, but it’s a little too easy to get it going in the early game with 3 low cost units. Because of this we’re shifting Void to work like Imperial.\r\n\r\n(2): One of your Void units does true damage\r\n(4): All of your Void units do true damage\r\n\r\nThis should allow void to not quite be so dominate early, but still be a viable option to scale into late game.\r\n\r\nLook forward to Kai’Sa coming in patch 9.19, and give her a try on PBE today!\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0PLKaTT","replies":[{"poster":"Sewer Side","date":"2019-09-11T22:20:21.693+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, she already dashes to the furthest enemies because of the Assassin trait and her ult then dashes to the furtherest, meaning she’ll go back to the frontline?","replies":[{"poster":"MaRiOnA","date":"2019-09-11T23:10:12.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sewer Side,realm=OCE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=yE0xdABh,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2019-09-11T22:20:21.693+0000)\n>\n> Wait, she already dashes to the furthest enemies because of the Assassin trait and her ult then dashes to the furtherest, meaning she’ll go back to the frontline?\n\nvery good point.. i wonder how it's gonna work 🤔🤔🤔","replies":[{"poster":"Pie Otter","date":"2019-09-12T18:06:50.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MaRiOnA,realm=EUNE,application-id=A7LBtoKc,discussion-id=yE0xdABh,comment-id=000b0000,timestamp=2019-09-11T23:10:12.008+0000)\n>\n> very good point.. i wonder how it's gonna work 🤔🤔🤔\n\nliterally the same as pyke but with no stun following the path.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tortferngatr","date":"2019-09-13T17:58:23.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having tried her, if she's in range to hit someone at the beginning of the fight she won't jump (similar to other Assassins, but more relevant in her case because *range*.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BPSquid","date":"2019-09-12T15:00:12.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily!
