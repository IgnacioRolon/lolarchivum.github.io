Now i have a restriction and my 4 honor levels+3 check points are gone and it isn&#039;t deserved. she literally called me an autist and flamed all game while somehow successfully inting at a rapid rate. the rest of my team had to mute her, all because she wouldn&#039;t stop typing at the speed of light because i was playing an off-meta build that ive seen work countless times (i could from match history but that would be pretentious to put here) The Orianna got away scot free as apparent by this =/ I want this reverted if possible because the Orianna deserved this way more than me and if I&#039;m being honest I said much worse a year or two ago since I was a much more... aggressive person.. back then. and i feel that this is such a trivial thing to be spending resources and time on restricting. with all due respect this is ridiculous.\n&quot;Game 1\nIn-Game\nxenauzeous: =/\nxenauzeous: whatever\nxenauzeous: could you be any more annoying\nxenauzeous: theyre not good, just camping\nxenauzeous: rammus\nxenauzeous: my man\nxenauzeous: dont gank top wit hout my ult\nxenauzeous: otherwise he wins everytime\nxenauzeous: i wish\nxenauzeous: fuck\nxenauzeous: no its winnable\nxenauzeous: cc lock him\nxenauzeous: im perfect for it\nxenauzeous: perfect read\nxenauzeous: yi top\nxenauzeous: boy free to play aggressive\nxenauzeous: no fucking way\nxenauzeous: be careful of him\nxenauzeous: yeah\nxenauzeous: orianna wtf are you doing\nxenauzeous: they can colapse on you\nxenauzeous: we JUST saw yi there\nxenauzeous: oh my god\nxenauzeous: of course youll be the first to say that\nxenauzeous: orianna you havent helped much even after multiple pings my dude\nxenauzeous: dont start this bs\nxenauzeous: i ran in to help but i got left for dead\nxenauzeous: stfu ori\nxenauzeous: takes one to know one\nxenauzeous: oris first kill gj\nxenauzeous: dont get collapsed on\nxenauzeous: ive been camped the entire game asshat\nxenauzeous: whatever\nxenauzeous: keep living in your reality over there, muted\nxenauzeous: anyone know what ori is doing afk mid?\nxenauzeous: called me autistic and then left i guess...\nxenauzeous: protect turr\nxenauzeous: yeah\nxenauzeous: no im not\nxenauzeous: inting sion builds tank\nxenauzeous: because everyone dies before i can get there\nxenauzeous: maybe live longer instead of criticizing me\nxenauzeous: ok\nxenauzeous: woah wayyy late\nxenauzeous: breaking news: ori playing with no brains and then calls me autistic, goes afk for 10 mins and then says i went afk\nxenauzeous: care guys\nxenauzeous: just\nxenauzeous: noqw\nxenauzeous: now\nxenauzeous: could you speak english?\nxenauzeous: only if youd let me\nxenauzeous: ty rammus\nxenauzeous: thank god im not the only person\nxenauzeous: you called me autistic??\nxenauzeous: do you have multiple personalities?\nxenauzeous: no\nxenauzeous: i didnt\nxenauzeous: this ori is aids and rammus can verify\nxenauzeous: believe what you want, after all i started feeding earlier, but at least i tried to help midlane and jung to help and i quit feeding teemo\nxenauzeous: ori hasnt done anything but whine, call me toxic, autistic, and stupid\nxenauzeous: i dont need to try, you make yourself look stupid without my input\nxenauzeous: back the fuck up\nxenauzeous: stop dying man\nxenauzeous: im trying to help\nxenauzeous: sorry for trying to help\nxenauzeous: all my other attempts still let you feed\nxenauzeous: all mia\nxenauzeous: care\nxenauzeous: im just going to ignore you ori\nxenauzeous: you kind of dont know how to live outside the base longer than 3 minutes\nxenauzeous: yeah report ori and me\nxenauzeous: were toxic\nxenauzeous: of course\nxenauzeous: make up something to put in the box\nxenauzeous: i definitely didnt try to win at all\nxenauzeous: because why would i want to win\nxenauzeous: well im sorry little lady i didnt build inting sion like you wanted\nxenauzeous: gg wp\nxenauzeous: report orianna\nPost-Game\nxenauzeous: keep talking ori\nxenauzeous: yeah\nxenauzeous: im sure 1 shotting the feeding ori was fun to watch\nxenauzeous: too bad she didnt last long enough for me to see\n\nby the end I was talking in all chat to tell the enemy team that she making stuff up\nThank you for your time and have a good day\nP.S.

This system is overtuned and does not understand the context of arguing and instead people like the orianna get away to do the same repetitive behavior and stay toxic while other who speak their mind but don't get toxic are issued restrictions and honor removed to stay at level 0. What a joke. I'd rather the honor lock stay there forever to remind me to not ~~TELL PEOPLE THEY'RE TOXIC AND TELL THE ENEMY TEAM THAT THEYRE CALLING ME AUTISTIC~~ _get toxic_ than it be removed to stay at level 0 forever with no progress made. There's literally no difference. Where has the great company Riot gone and why am i getting restrictions for an oriannas inting???","replies":[{"poster":"Xidphel","date":"2018-12-12T23:28:36.571+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have never recieved any restrictions\n\nThat's... why you received a chat restriction.

You cant let people play you like that. Riot doesnt differentiate flame types. So like, if its retaliatory flame, you still get the same punishment as if you flamed someone who did nothing to you. So just START with the mute next time when they say something dumb. Dont wait until you've already been arguing with them mid game and then mute. And certainly dont start sarcastically narrating their plays to everyone. At least you didnt have to learn the real hard way, since it was only a chat restrict.
