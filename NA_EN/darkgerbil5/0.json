Its mainly used with adc's to keep yourself from miss-clicking....meaning if you accidentally click the ground in a fight then your character wont automatically run to that spot, they will attack the closest thing to them within their auto attack range. Basically it helps you to stay at your max auto attack range in fights, instead of misclicking on the ground (with your normal right click) and accidentally running into the enemy team. dunno if that gives you a little clarification or not, but i tried lol","replies":[{"poster":"darkgerbil5","date":"2015-06-21T18:06:51.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does help a lot.
