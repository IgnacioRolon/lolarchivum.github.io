Is this going to end up being like kickstarter where they write estimated time October 2016 but you don't get until a year after?

Shipping is currently aimed for early November, with shipping confirmation to be  sent.  An email detailing this was sent as well, but you can also reach out to us in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to confirm what I've said here.
