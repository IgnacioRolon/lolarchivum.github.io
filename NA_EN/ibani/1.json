Its like going to be 2 months delayed. Im pretty upset at riot games for being unable to deliver a product within the time frame. I understand the hurricane caused delays but i cannot imagine it having lasted 2 months.","replies":[{"poster":"BlinkBlank","date":"2016-11-29T05:45:06.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Games Merch\nNovember 17 at 12:45pm Â· \nPROJECT HOODIE SHIPPING UPDATE:\nWe wanted to apologize to everyone for the delay on shipping the PROJECT: Hoodie out to you and give you a detailed update.
