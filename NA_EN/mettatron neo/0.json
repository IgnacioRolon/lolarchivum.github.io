What game are you playing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sammystorm","date":"2015-01-27T06:51:34.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The definition of dps is damage per second. If you can deal a huge amount of damage in a short amount of time you are bursty. If you deal a much smaller amount of damage but have it up continually for a much longer period of time is a dps type mage. Now, dps by it self is very unreliable. So what riot has done is mix a combination of two elements. 1) Having dps happened very quickly and 2) having dps be paired with strong cc. The major difference between a dps oriented mage and a burst oriented mage is that the burst mage can generally kill you a little faster but has a much lower presence once their spells are on cd. A dps mage tends to be able to burst you very quickly but have more of a presence then a dps mage will skills our ion cd.\n\nLet take a look at everyone you just mentioned.\n\nAzir: Has a very fast burst rotation in q and auto. He also has 1 unreliable form of hard cc (e) and 1 form of reliable cc (r). he also has a reliable soft cc (q). So azir has a high dps for a time frame of 1 second and has 3 forms of cc. What makes him more dps oriented is his presence with soldiers after his primary burst is down. However he is still very bursty.\n\nKarthus: He is an exception because he only has soft cc (w) However his passive gives him a free 7 seconds of dps in which he can also cast the largest single spell nuke in the game uninterrupted. Now karthus has a huge presence when q w and r on cd but he is scary because of his r and his q and how hard they nuke.\n\nLulu: Has 1 hard cc (r) and 1 soft cc (q). However the reason lulu is picked up is not because of dps but rather how huge of a impact her utility is. (honestly not sure why she is o the list she has pretty low dps that is unreliable.)\n\nLux: Not exactly sure why she is on the list. She has massive burst. Her passive acts like a lichbane proc which is bought on champs like tf to add burst. She has low cd's which makes her have a lower period of time of uselessness then other burst mids but she still is definitely all burst.\n\nNid: Even if you build her ad she has massive burst and does not like to stay in fights for extended periods of time. I am not sure why she made your list. She is a poke mage. IE she excels at sieges or any situation where she can whiddle you down then go in for the kill when she is for sure going to win. Much like jayce. Poke mages also have huge burst other wise the poke is kinda useless.\n\nRyze: He is dps esque because of his passive but really he is still a burst mage but has a very short time period where you can abuse him (However it does exist even if it is very slight). However because of his passive he does better then most mages at longer engages (not really that impressive considering how bad most mages are at long engages).\n\nZiggs: Another champ I am confused why he is on your list. He is front loaded with massive damage. His passive was intended to be a siege mechanic but he plays more like a burst mage and his passive is used like a lichbane proc.\n\nKarma: is more used for her utility and she doesn't particularly have strong dps. She does have short cooldowns though.\n\nMorg: Morg lives or dies by how good she is at landing q's. The rest of her kit is too unreliable that if she can't land her q she does very little but if she does land q she does quite a bit. Howeverher pool isn't really a reliable source of damage and thus I classify her as a burst mage.\n\nKayle definately had a string dps presence. More so then most mids. However most of her usefulness was tied up in 2 things. Her ult and how powerful that is and her nuke and slow on her q. She also has 1 form of soft cc (q).\n\n\nNow lets make a comparison. We are going to compare \"dps\" mages to a class that is dedicated to dps; marksman.\n\nNow if you look at a marksman they do have burst usually however they become more valuable the longer they are using their main form of damage; their auto. The value (and threat) of marksman increasing the more (longer) they auto things. A \"dps\" mage starts at a higher value then a marksman when their spells are off cool down however they dropped to a very miniscule level when their spells are on cool down. All mages have a very up and down pattern in their power levels. As soon as their main form of damage is used (spells) it goes on cool down and they become basically a non factor until their cooldowns refresh. So overall all mages have less potential dps then even the weakest of marksman. However a few champions can get close (ryze). I still don't consider them dps when all of their play patterns revolve about killing someone in the first possible spell rotation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wînter Fox","date":"2015-01-26T23:02:17.450+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I the only one who finds it hilarious that half of these champions are ADCs?\n\n{{champion:104}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:15}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImHerVoice","date":"2015-01-26T19:32:54.800+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm jarvan I'm dunking.\n","replies":[{"poster":"lDontLiftIcarry","date":"2015-02-04T05:53:28.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"templartrace","date":"2015-01-26T08:27:49.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is {{champion:15}} surprised or disgusted?\nAnd I love the {{champion:92}} description.","replies":[]},{"poster":"missinggrave","date":"2015-01-27T04:49:55.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry but I didn't read Grave's comment as, \"Mah burst damage\" at first.\n\nI read it as\n\n\"MAH BOY DAMAGE\"\n\nI was confused to say the least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The DrBonjigollo","date":"2015-01-27T01:30:23.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favorite was Sivir's lol.","replies":[]}]}
