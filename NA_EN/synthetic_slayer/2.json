Riot ripped out a huge part of his kit. I dont understand what Riot thought was bad about the original ult. It provided so much more utility and usefulness.\r\n\r\nWith the old ult I could e into a champion trying to take a tower, clear the minions with my e, w and ult, knock them up multiple times and keep them under the tower with the added tower aggro to secure a kill. I could also use the ult as an escape to get out of a bad situation, and a very reliable way to proc my courage of the colossus. The ult was great to dive into a team fight, and re-position squishies with my e, ult combo. Thats exactly what Riot tried to make the new ult, it does exactly what Zac's old ult did, but with less reliability.\r\n\r\nWhat we are left with is a new ult, which aims to do exactly as the old ult did, but does it worse. The new ult also has no other creative ways to be used like the old ult did. The new ult is extremely one dimensional; its very obviously what you are supposed to do with it, and there's no other viable ways to use it.\r\n\r\nI also find it hilarious that Riot reduced the knock-up time on his e while simultaneously adding an ult that requires that knock-up time to be used as set up. No one is going to stand on you when you flatten into a puddle of goo to trap them and bring them back into your team. Zac is complete garbage now.\r\n\r\nPlease for the love of LoL revert back to the old ult. You have successfully ruined my favourite champion, and my main for solo que. I was rocking a 65% win rate in diamond with over 200 games on Zac. Now I wouldn't even play him in ranked. Or normal's, because he's not fun anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Calabok","date":"2017-05-06T18:37:30.514+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":29,"body":"no","replies":[{"poster":"Synthetic Slayer","date":"2017-05-06T18:59:17.540+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":6,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Calabok,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GAzZavTY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-06T18:37:30.514+0000)\n>\n> no\n\nThe Silver 5 has spoken!","replies":[{"poster":"Jinzo Torrance","date":"2017-05-06T22:15:18.345+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did.. did you just reply to Calabok?","replies":[{"poster":"Mhihnj","date":"2017-05-07T13:20:26.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why?

Although I do think new Zac has some problems.\n   New Zac I have to kinda agree was off the mark. His new Q I think is a good ability but maybe if you attack the same person you hit first you could pull them to you? His ult is a decent concept but It's just really hard to give reliability to without breaking the game.\n   I mean even if the ult works 50% of the time on it's own then half the time your carrying their ADC to what is basically an instant death. Honestly what they maybe should do is let you have multiple ult casts but only the first should be able to carry people and the rest could just knock people aside slightly. \n   Here's an idea for what you can do in the meantime, I haven't really played Zac before but maybe you could fit a Righteous Glory into the build and time it so that the slow pops as you use ult. 75% slow should be enough to slow them down before they run away or at least grant you a flash.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Trestani","date":"2017-05-06T22:05:04.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have lvl 7 150k on zac and he is my third most played champ, so i think i have some grounds to say that his new ult is just bad, his old ult was much better in every conceivable way.","replies":[{"poster":"Funkin Dunkin","date":"2017-05-06T22:17:27.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100k lvl 7 Zac here and I no longer play him :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nGio","date":"2017-05-07T09:10:05.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Shuyin178,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=GAzZavTY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-06T20:33:27.738+0000)\n>\n> Now I know you&#x27;re just on the Zac hate hype train\n> You could only knock up people once with Zac&#x27;s ult, otherwise it would have been purely broken\n> \n> As for the new ult, it&#x27;s not as terrible as all of you 1st time Zac players think it is. \n> It&#x27;s more combo-focused now, that&#x27;s it.\n> You E in later for your team to be there, then you use to for the charged Ult to kidnap a carry into your team.

We aren't talking about just nerfs to his kit, like E knockup time cut in half, and a new ult that relies more on the enemy team making a mistake than you being able to properly execute it. His damage was destroyed as well. If that wasn't bad enough, even his sustain took a hit with his passive vs the new ult, and the Sunfire nerf hit didn't help either.\n\nGoing from top 6 to bottom 10 overnight isn't because he's new and we're all bad. He fell faster than the overnight nerfs to Diana and Olaf back in the day, and those are pretty legendary. The 'rework' was both poorly designed and poorly implemented, and any 60%+ Zac main who isn't trolling will tell you that this was a substantial nerf to a champion who just didn't need it.","replies":[{"poster":"Arsenic Sulfur","date":"2017-05-07T20:49:01.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then wait for the buffs.
