I think Scarra's video previewing the mid-season changes wraps up a lot of the community's reaction to the Zac rework. Unfortunately Riot will most likely not revert the rework since they put so much time into it that they would consider it a huge loss to lose all the work they put into him. It's a shame that they can be so stubborn with these class reworks when they don't go as well as hoped. As a Rengar player myself who can't stand playing him after his rework, I truly feel terrible for Zac mains who definitely got the short end of the stick when it came to this mid-season's reworks and will be stuck with what they got for a long time to come.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J Eevo","date":"2017-05-11T12:45:47.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"His ult might be garbage but I've seen a lot of people agree with me on liking the new Q mechanically, even if it's really weak numerically at the moment. He might be weak but there's no reason to revert the Q change withot seeing if it might be good in the future with the incoming buffs.\n\nThe consesus on the ult is that it's too situational to be good however, so that might be up for a revert if anything.","replies":[{"poster":"flyingbaklava","date":"2017-05-11T16:00:37.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, the consensus on r/thesecretweapon is fix the Q, revert the ultimate.
