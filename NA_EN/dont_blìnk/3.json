I always ban her when I'm mid. \n\nHer damage is stupid yes, but what I find the worst is how little room you have to do things. Like.. you can't gank her. You can't escape from a gank because her initiation range is bonkers, and she can CC you for her jungler. You can't just let her push you into tower because she will just roam bot. You can't push because those ganks are stupid. Like unless you are one of those uninteractive mids who just waveclear in a second and then leave (Viktor etc.) it is just hell facing her. \n\nIt's not even that she will outright kill you alone (though she can do that of course) it's just that her combo in lane provides so little counterplay. She can just poke and do a HUGE amount of damage then back off, and its back up in a few seconds. You can't really sustain through the damage that long and her mana pool will outlive your health (especially since her Ult is free) and even if it takes a few combos to lower your HP enough to all-in you or threaten the all-in, there's little you can do to prevent it. Not to mention Q-W procs thunderlords.\n\nShe is completely anti-fun.

Her damage does look higher because it's reliable, but it's also just really fucking high. So let's go:\n\nLeBlanc full lvl 3 combo: 275 (+ 240% AP)\nTaliyah: 400 (+ 240% AP) [I think... her E is kinda confusing. Obviously a literally perfect Taliyah trade is a pipedream though]\nAnivia: 230 (+ 180% AP)\nAhri: 204 (+ 184% AP) [Slightly higher than it looks cos part of it is true damage]\n\nNot gonna include Zyra, Fizz or Ekko because too much of their damage is variable (how many auto-attacks?) or %HP-based. I'll do some others instead.\n\nSyndra: 200 (+ 195% AP)\nKatarina: 155 (+ 115% AP) (+ 60% Bonus AD)\nVel'Koz: 274 (+ 180% AP) [Partly true damage obvs]\n\n______________\n\nSo LeBlanc is pretty up there in terms of damage with basic spells, you're really looking at highly impractical damage like Taliyah getting a completely perfect combo and stuff like Zyra managing to hit you with a dozen plant autos before you catch up. Zed with a perfect shadow combo perhaps but I didn't want to do him because I'd have to take his passive into account.\n\nAs I said, I have no problem with LeBlanc and think she's fine. It's OK for her to do comparatively high damage.
