There was no longer a contextual problem to solve, and the use case just became a flat yes/no question. Will the orb hit them? If yes, recall it. Without the mechanical complexity, Ekko has to plan how he'll use his Timewinder Q, and reposition himself so that both damage rounds land against his target. It's smarter. \n\nStraight from Riot's Ekko development commentary. It's like that on purpose.

Now I mentioned his Q moves way too slowly upon hitting a champion and instead should be a reliable speed and distance all the way through, because it is way to easy to dodge the return damage as a ranged or melee champion by walked to the side. \n\nMy FAVORITE situation is Ekko vs Ahri/Lux/Zoe where you have to wait for them to use their CC (which if they're good they wont) to go in and combo them. Otherwise you E to them, then Q, and then they CC you and either A give you full damage of their combo or B walk away. This is so frustrating, because as an assassin he has no other way to proc his passive reliably unless our enemies make a mistake. it is downright unfair against certain champions.\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}{{item:3070}} {{champion:245}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dont Blìnk","date":"2018-08-08T21:53:08.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeftyRaydy,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=cy9UTWnb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-08-08T21:44:32.108+0000)\n>\n> You know as an Ekko main I can tell you the ability to recast the Q would make it have no counter play easily adding 2 stacks to melee champs and then E in and run away with free damage combo.

I think one of the reasons that Ekkos Q is like this is because he has a very good AOE stun, but it is so hard to set up its ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
