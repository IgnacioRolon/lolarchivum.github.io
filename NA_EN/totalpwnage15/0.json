Mainly we play Smash 4, Overwatch and of course League. So far during meetings club members have been able to play Overwatch and I believe also Smite on the school network without a ton of lag issues and disconnects. League is another story. On the same network and switch as the people using Overwatch on other computers, League is entirely unplayable and disconnects constantly. We have determined that the network bandwidth available is not an issue, and neither are the PC's, as the game runs smoothly. However, I believe our school may be blocking some of League's needed outgoing network ports even though the game was supposedly approved by the school. What network ports does the League client and game each separately use? Client and chat work fine, but the games do not. In addition, I believe since our school has many computers yet uses the same external IP when connecting to Riot's servers this may also be causing an issue in network performance. Any ideas on why the game performance is bad on a school network? Anyone have more experience than I do on how generally school networks are set up by the network administrator?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-22T01:05:00.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of sounds like your schools network might have certain ports blocked which would cause those issues. Have your school's IT admin check to make sure these ports are open for League's servers...\n\nPorts needed for servers:\n5000 - 5500 UDP (League of Legends Game Client)\n8393 - 8400 TCP (Patcher and Maestro)\n2099 TCP (PVP.Net)\n5223 TCP (PVP.Net)\n5222 TCP (PVP.Net)\n80 TCP (HTTP Connections)\n443 TCP (HTTPS Connections)\n8088 UDP and TCP (Spectator Mode)\n\nIf that doesn't help, you might need to have that admin reach out via a school e-mail to get whitelisted.","replies":[{"poster":"totalpwnage15","date":"2017-12-22T23:14:18.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I will check with the school IT admin and club leader on which port exceptions we need to make.
