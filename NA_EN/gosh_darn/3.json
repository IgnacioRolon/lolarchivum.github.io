Does she grab a shovel and remove the earth from beneath them? Or throw them into the air to put a trap under you? This also doesn&#039;t make sense for gameplay. Her traps are meant to be a zoning tool. Chaining it with other forms of CC gives her a crazy amount of hard CC that really doesn&#039;t fit in with her power budget.\n\nIf Caitlyn places a trap directly below a champion, they should have a brief period of immunity starting **after** the initial delay where traps don&#039;t work for 1.1 seconds. Additionally, her traps should not be able to stick around for 90 seconds under enemy turrets, she really shouldn&#039;t even be able to place them under an enemy turret at all. Make these changes and there goes 90% of the toxicity. She&#039;d be healthy and balanced and still have a good winrate, but now she wouldn&#039;t be oppressing the fuck out of enemies, trapping them under their own turret which is meant to be safe, and she wouldn&#039;t be using her trap as a ranged root that only targets champions.\n\nA lot of people are missing the point. Caitlyn's traps are meant to be traps, zoning tools, not a ranged root. The arming phase is meant to be fair counterplay, and it is, except when the chain CC happens and her trap just becomes a ranged root. It not making sense was really just a secondary observation. The issue is using it as a projectile root and taking over the enemy turret with 5 traps.
