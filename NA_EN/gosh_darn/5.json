Using Meditate mid combat is super risky.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-14T16:46:54.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you are using it for the attack reset","replies":[{"poster":"Skias","date":"2017-01-14T17:15:13.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=macromite,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=pbeAnJQk,comment-id=0000000400000000,timestamp=2017-01-14T16:46:54.873+0000)\n>\n> Unless you are using it for the attack reset\n\nAt the risk of being CCed and crushed by not moving.

These changes don't affect that either then. I don't generally blow it for an auto reset when I've got a shit ton of attack speed. I usually use it to block a big nuke.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2017-01-16T17:16:26.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"again, the auto reset just gives extra damage reach.\n\nI had a good game recently-ish where I exploited it and killed an enemy that otherwise had killed me, even through my healing and damage reduction.\n\nI mean think of it this way, if you use the autoreset at 2 attacks per second that pretty much pushes you up to 3 attacks in a second, which shortens the cd of your main dodging skill.\nIf it gives you that extra stack of double strike as well, it can increase your reach even farther, which could make a less close fight close with you as the winner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ItsOrval","date":"2017-01-14T12:46:09.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I had a game where we were ahead 43 vs 26 kills.
