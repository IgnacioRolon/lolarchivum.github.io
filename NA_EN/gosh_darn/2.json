This issue has the single biggest impact on gameplay of anything in the history of league of legends. It has nothing to do with player behavior because there are no people playing, it&#039;s scripts. \n\nI lost after trying to stop the fed as fuck Heimerdinger from pushing into nexus and massacring everyone in his path. I've had to deal with this at least 5 times. It's next to impossible to carry 4 feeding bots unless you're an adc.\n\nI'd say in 99% of my games there's at least 1 bot, in 80% of my games there's 2 bots. If you were a new player or had new players on your team, you'd lose these games. The IP boost I paid for is worthless because I lose half my games since there's clearly more bots than players.\n\nI'd expect this issue in some sort of low budget MMO 10 years ago maybe, but why the hell is such a successful company allowing this to happen? Even very outdated games have bot detection that would never let the botting issue become this bad. Again, I'm just amazed that anyone spends their money on this game when PvE games aren't even playable anymore.
