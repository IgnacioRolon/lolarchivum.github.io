When you crash are you getting any errors, and when specifically is it crashing out?  Do you have third party programs like play.tv running?  Are you able to go through the legacy client without any issues?  \n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\"\n\nTest it in a custom match and let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Kush420Inhaler","date":"2017-01-08T03:31:34.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it crashes randomly, no error codes. it can crash 2 minutes in or 20 or more. i don't know what play.tv is, i just use itunes, i like to listen to music. when i re-login, i can only access the right side of the client, my friends list or send a message. i'm locked out of everything else. the left side, the main part. it just says game in progress. can't look at my profile, can't go to the store. i have to wait until the game ends and then it runs smoothly. there has been a few times where it would crash and i was able to rejoin the game (again, no error codes). throughout all these crashes, there has been only one bug splat. that's about it. \n\ni like to play ranked but i  love aram. i stopped playing it due to the fact that it crashes in that map the most. i played a match using the legacy client, while playing the poro king game mode. ran smoothly. no crashes . i will play other game modes tomorrow and see what happens, while using the legacy client. \n\nthanks for the response.","replies":[]}]}]}
