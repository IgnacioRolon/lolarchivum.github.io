A big weakness of hers is that she has limited ways of dealing with spells that outrange her E, something that's pretty common for mages/other typical midlaners; she has to either bait it out first or bite the bullet and take damage, which isn't always an option depending on who she's fighting. Her nearsight debuff makes it hard for ANYONE to hit her. In conjunction with her E neither ranged carries or melees can hit her or target her with spells, and mages suffer from the same, along with their skillshots becoming a guessing game. That's what, imo, is what really made her that much stronger. Even with her old blind, Jax could still leap and stun her, Irelia could still bladesurge and stun etc. etc. Of course, people are also not used to nearsight since only Graves and Nocturne have anything like it, and in both those cases the skills work very differently, and on much longer cooldowns.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jbels","date":"2015-11-27T13:04:35.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Madotsuki,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=kVJx53fv,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-27T12:52:03.720+0000)\n>\n> I really can't agree at all.
