An important matter needs to be discussed.","subforum":"Roleplaying","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, \nas a certain man once said, let&#039;s get down to business.\n\nif I made this thread today, it is mostly about how terrible this forum is going. Not only the number of roleplayers is diminishing at an alarming rate.\nThe veterans, for a reason or another, are also leaving. \nThe problem is not exactly there but also where in fact, not enough new players join us.\n\n---\n\n>**WHY?**\n>+ This is the first point I would suggest we work on. I have my ideas but there is no point in pointing fingers and calling off on past mistakes. If I made this thread now it&#039;s to resolve problems, not make more.\n\n>**WHAT?**\n>+ As in, what resources do we have to work this out? What can we do as a community to improve the overall experience for everyone?\n\n>+ It is also important to remember, WHAT are the key elements of a good roleplay forum?\n\n>**HOW?**\n>+ Last but not the least, how will we work on this? This should be the last step. We should first work much harder on the first two questions. The how should come out by itself right after. It&#039;s important to understand a problem before trying to solve it. Right now, I have seen many debates and a lot of misunderstanding because we were trying to find drastic solutions to little problems. \n\n\n---\n\nNow, before the forum goes to complete trash, we need to do something. As a community. Roleplay is much more fun when there is a lot of implication. I am fairly sure that we have about 15 active people right now on the forum (this is without saying that most might be two accounts)\n\nWhat I am looking for is a growing solution. One that would be invested in this forum. One that will make people interested to do roleplay here. One that will bring new people and also, keep the ones we have.\n\nAnd please, dear please... Do not rant. We heard it times and times. We do not need rant. We need SOLUTIONS. One problem at a time and we will make it better around here. I had my own roleplay forums for years, I know the drill. Right now, we are just going to watch it crash if we don&#039;t do anything. And we all know, it would be only easier for riot to simply delete the &quot;ROLEPLAY&quot; thread and be done with it.\n\nWith hope that we can work this out!\n\n\n\n---\n\n::Update 1::\n\n-  BE POSITIVE\nI would like to add this specification here. I didn't think of it but I can see how this thread could go without it.\nI welcome everyone to have their input. Please, do so in a positive manner. Let's try to seek solutions before turning down other propositions. For every negative comment, you will need to add two positive additions such as suggestions or approving other suggestions that has already be made. \n\nWe are trying to do the necessary changes here to make the roleplay community more welcoming and more enjoyable for everyone.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n---\n\n::Update 2::\n\nWe now have a Discord channel for the community. I will work on it at a regular pace to add everything needed. It will be a good way for everyone to jump in action quickly and be in touch with anyone if needed. It's easier access than skype and free (Unlike TS). \n\nAs it goes, I will make different channels for every need.\n\nEveryone are free to join at: https://discord.gg/012t6wxIphNoYU1fa\n\nCheers!\n\n\n\n---\nhttps://%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Fiora_3.jpg\n","replies":[]}
