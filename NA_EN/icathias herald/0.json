Like it becomes more likely than a coin toss it won't be something that will fill your roster and you'll need 3 to get value out of them.\n\nThe shitty thing is that you still roll them even if you own every champ, and it's a 1/3 chance between that or a skin/ward skin shard.  So its easy af to just get tons of shards building up if you play regularly that you can't really use, I have like 5k blue essence so far just sitting there and I usually just craft one into essence if I have 3 shards and I just buy the 3rd to make a champ or just use IP.","replies":[{"poster":"big boi edri","date":"2017-07-13T15:18:39.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I misunderstood, I was referencing re rolling 3 champ shards into a permanent champ.
