There are tons of ways that your account info could have been compromised to the internet. It's just better to be safe than sorry and remove stuff that you're not sure of.","replies":[{"poster":"Evolution Mutt","date":"2019-10-25T23:35:43.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"thank you x.x sorry this entire situation is fucked and its stressin me out","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2019-10-25T23:42:56.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Evolution Mutt,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gVmbIwkg,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-25T23:35:43.029+0000)\n>\n> thank you x.x sorry this entire situation is fucked and its stressin me out\n\nIt's no problem, getting your account hacked is stressful (I remember when I lost my WoW account briefly that way).\n\nWhile you wait on your ticket I would recommend you download various virus/malware checking tools if you don't already have them. Spybot S&amp;D and Malwarebytes are my recommendations. They both have free versions that are decent enough.\n\nIf you use the same password for anything else, change them once you made sure your computer is clean.\n\nGiven that it's nearly the weekend you might be waiting longer than normal on your ticket. So don't sit there on the edge of your seat for hours on end stressing yourself out. Check back in the morning and play some other games in the meantime.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"50CaliberHecate","date":"2019-10-25T22:48:56.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Submit a support ticket, they may consider a unbanning.

IMO, you starting to use overwolf and your account getting broken into seems too big of a coincidence. Might want to change your passwords for any other account you have on your computer.
