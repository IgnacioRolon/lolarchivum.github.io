Resolution issue?","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So recently windows 10 released an update (the anniversary update) that has thrown me into quit a strange situation. After the update I started having resolution issues with league of legends. I used to play at 1768x992 (I believe... Its something like that and the only resolution like it) in full screen mode. After installing the update for win10 I had tried playing a game a league of legends and sure enough theres issues. My 'full screened window' was now a small box within the middle of the screen. It still worked like fullscreen does. It bound the mouse within the mini screen and had no edges. The resolution was set to '1024x668' or whatever the minimum resolution is. After rescaling it to my standard 1768x992 my issue went from being a little change in options to something much larger.\r\n\r\nAt this point when at 1768x992 my cursor location was askew. Where I click, the game clicks roughly a quarter of my screen to the right. When going through the options menu to try and adjust resolutions I would have to click way off to the left to actually hit a button. Not only this but for some reason my username and level are roughly the same distance off to the left of my healthbar where they should be affixed to. I have tried several things to resolve this issue such as changing resolutions (i've tried every option to no avail.) I have made sure my graphic card was up to date (Geforce GTX 560) it had an update that seemed unrelated to the windows update but I had ran the update anyway. After this had no positive effect I had also reverted back to the previous update of windows (where everything was working fine) but it didn't seen to fix anything still. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has any clue what to do to resolve this I would be so appreciative. Atm I have been struggling to play at a smaller resolution in a windowed version but it sucks to play with a large chunk of my background still on the screen.","replies":[{"poster":"I Eat Children","date":"2016-08-26T02:23:24.590+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually just fixed it. It has to do with the Xbox game bar. You have to open up the app, go to the settings, turn the DVR settings off for your PC. everything will run fine then.","replies":[{"poster":"Sofa Apples","date":"2016-09-28T04:15:25.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked for me after playing for about a month with a miniature screen.
