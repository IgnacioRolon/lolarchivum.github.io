Fur around her neck is so dominant at look in my opinion. \nI suggest two options to improve it:\n1) get rid of it completely or\n2) make it significantly smaller to reduce dominant look","replies":[{"poster":"stuey138","date":"2018-03-23T04:19:48.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree. Like sure, I can deal with a little bit less of that fucking amazing armour (I still hate that she's losing it, the skin and the splash art personally had some of the nice colours I've seen in a while in league), but that fur makes her look like an aristocratic snob in some posh fur coat.  Irelia is a bruiser who has gone through a war and now she looks like a lady trying to get into the winter fashion show. Please for the sake of all of the people who love the old skin, reduce the fur and try to make her look as badass as her character should be.
