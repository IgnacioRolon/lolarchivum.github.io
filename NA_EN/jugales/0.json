Now that may sound simple, but keep in mind there are probably thousands of lines of code to look through just to find a single line. And if that single line happens to have been removed, they would have to replace the line with a new one.\n\nCoding is not a simple thing. If you really think it is, then you have quite a bit to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"fred loue","date":"2015-11-27T12:27:37.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you know that oranges where classified as apples because apple was a generic term for foreign fruit excluding berries? \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_%28symbolism%29\n\nSo when someone said you \"can't(or shouldn't) compare apples to oranges\" it meant you can't compare something general say \"Champion\" to something specific that is also the general term such as \"Rengar\" because while Mr. Gar is a champion there isn't a good way to compare him to \"champion\" other then he is one.\n\nYou could of coarse compare champions to minions or Rengar to Kha'zix.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kaltenashes","date":"2015-11-26T23:16:19.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure if this is a bug and you're aware of it, but last game we killed {{champion:42}}  with his machine gun activated (is it E ?), and the sound remained around his dead body until he was revived, me and team mates were able to listen to it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jugales","date":"2015-11-26T17:42:01.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RiotRepertoir,realm=NA,application-id=LqLKtMpN,discussion-id=cypOn68Z,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-26T17:29:24.115+0000)\n>\n> I'll fix that.
