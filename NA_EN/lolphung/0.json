Honestly shouldn't have said anything, and should have muted the players tilting me. But anyways, season ends November, and I hear that you don't receive rewards if you get banned 3 months prior to season end. It's only June, and I have received a ban. Will I still receive rewards?

It looks like the hard cutoff for being eligible for rewards is 8/22/2017. If you have a ban lasting 7 days or more on or after that date, you will not be eligible. Players banned specifically for boosting are not eligible if they were punished during this season. \n\nYou can also read through the bullets yourself over on the [**2017 Ranked Rewards Eligibility FAQ**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068).","replies":[{"poster":"Shrink8","date":"2017-08-30T14:44:47.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i got 14 day ban and it lasts untill 7th september, which means i wont get rewards ?
