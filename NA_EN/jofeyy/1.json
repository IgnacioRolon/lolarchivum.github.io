It was like... not to be mean to those who play mid lane, but that shit was the most relaxing thing I've played in months. It was 1v1 all game, and sometimes I'd be ganked and I'd only have to move a few steps away and be fine. In the bot lane it's 4 people at 5 minutes and after a gank the jungler will stay to siege. \n\nHell, I was the one going bot for free kills. Felt so good.
