These are my complains:\r\n\r\nFirst, the chronologic order of those games, are first game one, then game 3, then game 2. Its not even in order.\r\n\r\nTwo: In 2 of 3 games I got 2 honors from non premades people, showing therefore that SOMEBODY  (2 per match) thinkd as I did.\r\n\r\nThree: I played 2 games after the bann chat and only counted as one (then again, fk this penalty system)\r\n\r\nFour: I cant contact support and thats why I shared this here.\r\n\r\nFive: The game is like this, I said something real back there: \r\n\r\n&quot;OutlyDoodlyPlayd: reported for what? im just pointing out facts\r\nOutlyDoodlyPlayd: i didnt hurt no one feelings\r\nOutlyDoodlyPlayd: and never pun intended.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen premades want to jerk off, they report just because. So, if this penalty system knows when are or arent playing with premade players, why this system doesnt take that to consideration? I mean, 4 idiots want to fukk you off so they 4 report you. \r\nI only type when I can, and lets be honest, if I cant chat, no one should. Why? cause, or you guys recognize that banning chats its not only useless, beside it has a negative repercution in-game. \r\n\r\nAnd last but no less important: In the game 1, I said next: \r\n&quot;OutlyDoodlyPlayd: hey jhin give your son some sleep&quot;\r\n\r\ncause morgana claimed to be premade (and son) of jhin)... anyway, morgana said something of him/she being sleepy, and i made that reply to that... Jhin then said something like &quot;She aint goin to bed till I get a sucked&quot;...\r\n\r\nThat is explicit sexual content. Do they get banned? No. Why? cause this penalty system is sht, and benefit premades only. \r\n\r\nBye.","replies":[{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2018-06-24T04:46:21.293+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No reports in a given game matter after the first one.

I dont critize people unless they do something to me first. And I dont care if you think its \"vengeance\", but I dont take bshit from no one. Many people take different ways to annoy you, and I know this because I played several mobas in several serves across time. Im not a child and I do understand when people try to being a jerk. And I am the kind of people that rather lose the match instead of helping winning when 3/5 of your team are as*holes (cause always 1 remains silence)... No, cause even if I win im gonna be reported anyway.  and they dont diserve winning.\nI got reported (and banned) than ks to people that reffered to me as:\nbronze garbage\nsilver garbage\nretarded\nAnd i dont take it personal cause they dont know me but I dont take bshit from strangers. \nI got reported for those kind of people. Just for you to know what kind of people are you defending. If you defend an idiot, I only can think you are an idiot as well. \nBut obviously, its MY chat here cause those who called me such ways, are not in a chat ban.
