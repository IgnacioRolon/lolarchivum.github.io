We’ll continue to work on updates to better improve information for new players and help them while they take their first steps onto the Rift. There is a ton of information to cover and update on the New Player Guide, and we are focused on making incremental changes to the content so we can get it out to you as soon as possible.\n \nWe noticed that the [New Player Guide](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide#/?_k=hmmlb4)  needed a little love in order to better help our new players learn the ropes of League. Over the past couple months our team has been working to improve a small section of the new player guide, primarily focusing first on what a new player would need to know in order to comfortably step into League of Legends for the very first time.\n \nHow do you feel about the direction of the new player guide? Is there something you feel is out of place or missing? Is there anything you wish you had access to or knew about when you first started your League of Legends adventure? Leave your comments and questions below, we’d love to chat with you. \n\nWe’ll be in here throughout the day taking feedback and answering any questions you may have about the new player guide","replies":[{"poster":"Raj Te Lag Comp","date":"2016-08-16T21:57:04.733+0000","up_votes":45,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love to see items added as well!

That goes for items, abilities, masteries, and more. Just as how the words are color coded ingame they could be color coded outside of the game in the ui. hovering over it would display a definition and clicking it would maybe give examples of it tips and a video link showng it In action. As a new player starting out a long time ago I had trouble when I was trying out modekaiser because I had no clue I was spending hp for abilities. Manaless champs throw off new players. Champions with different types of damages like true physical and magical throw off new players. Percentages throw off new players and expert players alike. Snares stuns siphons channels and the rest of those movement modifiers throw off new players. Give them a place to do their homework that's reliable and updated regularly. And for heavens sake make a note about which champions use mana, fury, nothing, etc. And what kind of damage each ability does and what it requires you to buy. There's nothing more cringe worthy than AP garen. Maybe even a little asterisk that notifies you when the champion has been nerfed or buffed and when clicked leads to patch notes.","replies":[{"poster":"woodvsmurph","date":"2016-08-17T21:57:41.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a league dictionary for terms would be great. Ex: roa = rod of ages, mr = magic resist, etc. When you get into pvp games and are trying to help newer/struggling teammates you don't have time to type the full name for everything in chat all the time. Having a list of even the most common terms would be nice. You could even chunk it into categories for new players so they can focus on ones that are more applicable to their role on the team. Ex: bot, jungle, mid, sup, top. Under bot you could find things like: i.e. = infinity edge, crit = critical strike, ga = guardian angel, gank = when an enemy laner comes to your lane to try to help their bot lane kill you (this is generally done by the jungler). Explanations like that could definitely help for pvp with new players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon1xx","date":"2016-08-16T22:21:57.827+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think the whole thornmail thing in tutorial is a bad idea.

Be sure they KNOW it is OK to build other items or build their items in a different order depending on how the game is going. \nEx: I see too many carry junglers on champs like {{champion:11}} or {{champion:5}} in ranked or regular pvp who think they NEED to build their 3 damage attack speed items first and ONLY THEN can they consider building a defensive item. They should know before losing a bunch of games by doing this that if the enemy carry/carries is/are snowballing to build a more defensive 2nd and 3rd item before going back to building offensive items. Can't tell you how many games have been perfectly winnable if the jungler didn't go 3 straight offensive items like that only to get 1 shot before they could deal or soak any real damage.

But sadly it got too hard in later seasons to carry as a support because of consistently poor adc's who refuse to trade any damage with the enemy bot or who go agro for no reason when behind and feed more. When you get that on a regular basis and everyone on the team blames you as the support, it isn't fun to play that role any more. When you crush 2v3 bot (despite enemy jungle camping you) only to lose because your mid, top, and/or jungle couldn't stop tilting and feeding the rest of the map in the first 15 min; it isn't fun. So I ditched the support carry role for a different one where I stood a better chance of impacting the team as a whole -- at least for awhile that was the case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lofi n chillhop","date":"2016-08-17T12:17:37.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"something that would be huge for the new player guide. is if you integrated guide posts with a achievements system.\nboth things as simple and basic as achievements on your profile that mark if you've got so much cs by 10/20/30 minutes, for winning games from behind, by getting kill streaks, assist streaks. And this ties into the player guide - by these achievements all have links to the guide, where there is a \"quick section\" that tells about why this achievement is good, I guess two sentences, and how a person can work to improve it, I guess a paragraph.  and then one future update to this would be an statitical graph regarding the topic. and then another feature to implement would be that high elo players, especially streamers and LCS players, would be encouraged (maybe their own achievements that are hidden if not high elo) where they can post comments of 2 sentences to 16 sentences on the topic that can be found in the guide. \n\n\noh - so I don't know what the guide currently looks like, so what I imagine when I think of the guide, is something with a table of contents with links, that over time becomes more better at helping as RIOT and high-elo players edit their respective content and add new information. on topics from CS to game timers to kills, assists, and deaths to item building to summoner spells to champion abilities (which might need to be less permanent of an area since champions get buffs and nerfs, actually I guess this is true of other things too hehe. not a problem difficult to solve but one to keep in mind) to counterplay strategies and matchup information and similar game knowledge. \n\nthere would even be a prime potential for a guide section on decision making - but this is more challenging to structure and discuss than the meaning of number-based things like items and csing and gold earning and impact of various game timers/timing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nami in Bush","date":"2016-08-20T06:56:50.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rhojin,realm=NA,application-id=cIfEodbz,discussion-id=1tzNfrj9,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-16T21:50:04.473+0000)\n>\n> http://i.imgur.com/GsPP5aK.jpg\n> \n> Hey Everyone,\n>                                                                                     \n> The New Player Guide has begun to go through some rather interesting changes and this is just a taste of things to come! We&amp;rsquo;ll continue to work on updates to better improve information for new players and help them while they take their first steps onto the Rift. There is a ton of information to cover and update on the New Player Guide, and we are focused on making incremental changes to the content so we can get it out to you as soon as possible.\n>  \n> We noticed that the [New Player Guide](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/new-player-guide#/?_k=hmmlb4)  needed a little love in order to better help our new players learn the ropes of League. Over the past couple months our team has been working to improve a small section of the new player guide, primarily focusing first on what a new player would need to know in order to comfortably step into League of Legends for the very first time.\n>  \n> How do you feel about the direction of the new player guide? Is there something you feel is out of place or missing? Is there anything you wish you had access to or knew about when you first started your League of Legends adventure? Leave your comments and questions below, we&amp;rsquo;d love to chat with you. \n> \n> We&amp;rsquo;ll be in here throughout the day taking feedback and answering any questions you may have about the new player guide\n\nThe game continues to grow every day, and with it allot of new players who are subject to harassment by the toxic playerbase of smurfs/currently-banned-players.\n\nWhat if Riot made a community volunteering position to opt into helping new players and an entire queue for new players? Opting in would allow you to play New Player Queue (NPQ) Bot games with levels 1-20.\n\n------------------\n\n In the &quot;Bots&quot; tab, &quot;Into Bots&quot; should be replaced with &quot;New Player Queue&quot;. Each team would have 1 community volunteer, if any, or completely filled with new players when nobody level 30 is available. Level 30 players would be able to join in as a Volunteer. Volunteers get 2 games of receiving normal IP a day, then it becomes a 75% reduction.\n\nAfter the game, all players below lvl 1-20 will be prompted with (over the whole screen as if promoting)\n&gt;Was your Volunteer helpful? If he was, grant him/her honor him here -&gt;\n&gt;If your Volunteer was mean or rude, report him/her here -&gt;\n&gt;If your Volunteer was not helpful, nor rude, click &quot;Okay&quot;.\n&gt;[  ] Do not show this message again\n\n\nVolunteers who receive a high volume of honor in this queue may be eligible for rewards (Keys, Crates, Champ/Skin Shards, Ribbons, etc.)\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nHere&#039;s how it would work\n\n* For NPQ, Reduced XP and IP (no win-of-the-day either)for EVERYBODY since it is just a learning tool, otherwise they can play Easy Bots for normal IP/XP up until level 10. New Player Queue would have a 25% decrease in XP/IP until level 10 (If they are here that means they are new, which means they need a little bit more time here to learn), where it would be reduced by 50%, then at lvl 15 would be reduced by 75%, and at lvl 20 would be reduced by 100%. \n\n* Easy Bots would receive full until value lvl 10, where they receive 25% reduction, then at lvl 15 would be 50%, then at 20 would be 75%.\n\n*  After that , Intermediate Bots will be required until level 25 to receive full XP/IP. Lvl 25-30 would be Normals unless you want to still want to play with Intermediate Bots for reduced XP/IP. 25% IP/XP reduction at lvl 25 and 50% reduction at lvl 30.\n\nYou have the option of playing Normals starting at lvl 3, and Beginner bots at lvl 1-30 for players that have played the game before. Intermediate bots available at lvl 10.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirHeavyScrotum","date":"2016-08-20T05:04:05.898+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanted to say that I think it's awesome that you guys have updated the new player guide after hearing the community suggestions on the matter, and you've been a real trooper and professional about this forum.  Riot is really good about being transparent, listening to the community, and handling themselves professionally on the forums and in game.  Now, for the relevant stuff.\n\nI know this isn't your team's job but I had some concerns about the starting champion pool.  If you think they're valid concerns that you haven't heard before you could pass it on to the right people!\n\n1) There are no true tanks.  The most useful thing a new player can do is play a tank, but there are no real tanks on the beginner pages.\n\n2) There are no supports either.  Can't be giving new players the excuse of \"i cant play sup cuz i dont know any sups\" for free, can we?\n\nI noticed that there were 10 slots on the new champ page (not that that can't change if the right person wanted to, but it's a nice even number), and with 6 roles needed to be covered then on role is gonna be short, but currently there are three fighters, three marksmen, and three mages but no tanks or supports. I feel like some compromises could be made to cover a wide variety of roles, and this would in the big picture reduce tension over who plays what role (since new players would know more roles) and create healthier team compositions in extremely low mmr games.\n\nI think that as far as things that could be cut to make room for other champs, Garen and Shyvanna fulfill a pretty similar role (super tanky/high damage/low utility) but Shyvanna is a jungler primarily and since new players can't jungle without smite there seems to be a pretty obvious choice of which to keep.  In the Mage category, as others have said Ryze is way too hard for new players and kinda fulfills the same role as Lux except with shorter range.  And lastly in the Marksmen category Jinx and Ashe both cover the immobile but with high team fight role while Varus is unique for his long range poke, so I would keep either Jinx or Ashe but not both.\n\nAs far as replacements go, that's kinda up to the team but I would recommend either Poppy or Tahm Kench for the tank position, as neither of them are hard to understand and both have pretty fun kits. Probably Sona & Blitzcrank (noobs love them some Blitzcrank) for the support roles as they have pretty simple kits but vastly different playstyles.","replies":[]}]}
