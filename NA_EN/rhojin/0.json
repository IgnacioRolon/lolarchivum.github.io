Over the past seven months the Player Support Player Behavior team and Risk team have been working together on vast improvements to our detection methods to ensure even more of a strain is put on Boosters and those they are boosting.\n\n Now after months of hard work and dedication we are able to aggressively go after players who have participated in MMR Boosting. Over the following weeks we will be rolling out MMR Boosting punishments to over 70,000 players who have had their accounts boosted in the 2015 season.  These 70,000 are not the only ones who will receive MMR Boosting punishments this season; starting today we will be rolling out normal ban waves punishing anyone who has had their account boosted this season.  \n\nFor those who are new to League of Legends and for anyone who needs a little refresher, a MMR Boosting punishment is not something to disregard. Anyone punished will face the following punishment :\n\n- A two week suspension \n- Removal of all previous Season Rewards (Victorious Skins, Borders, Icons, Ward Skins)\n- Ineligibility to receive the 2015 Season Rewards\n- A second offense will result in the permanent suspension of the account\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding MMR Boosting or the punishments please share them in the comments, I and members of the Risk team will be here to answer them. Please remember the Boards rules on naming and shaming, if you feel a player is involved in MMR Boosting in any way please do not post your report here. You can send a report in through a [support ticket](http://support.riotgames.com) and we will begin investigation.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo Cyrus","date":"2015-07-15T20:10:38.552+0000","up_votes":77,"down_votes":4,"body":"Can we buy cans of carbonated boostee tears from you?

However, human beings are bad at changing several things at once- you might see a sudden spike in 1-2 fields as they focus on that, but it will probably lose some momentum over a couple days/games. Overall, there will probably be a slight shift in the tendency, but it is relatively unlikely that more than a couple of them will spike at the same time, and even more unlikely that they will stay at that level. If a person reads up on warding, they might increase their wards/game by 35% for a few games, but that number will probably go down to ~15% after several games/days. That would be a typical case (some people may instead have a steady growth up to 35% as they think about it more in games, or some may spike and stay there if they're good self-motivators and remember to ward more in games- but these are all good cases.) \n\nExample of probably good behavior: Summoner 'ImInnocent': Plays top in 70% of games, 80% of which are Shen. 90% of his Shen games he rushes a Luden's Echo. He boasts a 55% win rate with Shen, with an average 4/2/15 KDA and assists on 2 dragons and 7 towers per game. He wards badly, however, and only averages 6 wards a game with 1 champion spotted/ward.\nNew patch comes out, and he begins playing only 70% of top lane games as Shen, and changes his build to start Rylai's Crystal Scepter in 85% of games, while all his other stats change only negligibly. No red flags, as only a couple things shifted and there was a clear event that changed it- Luden's Echo lost some AP, so Shen shifts to better utilize AP+HP. As far as playing fewer Shen games, Shen may have changed in ban rate due to the patch or ImInnocent may have begun to favor a different toplaner a little more. Small, reasoned changes.\n\n\nExample of red-flag behavior: Summoner 'ImBeingBoosted': plays support 67% of games, and wins 52% of these games. The 33% where he plays another role only sits at a 42% win rate, however. He averages 25 wards/game, but each ward only sees an average of 1.2 champions, indicating either bad timing or placement of wards. In addition, he averages 2 kills, 6 deaths, and 12 assists per game, and only averages assists on 1 dragon and 3 towers per game.\n\nOver the course of the next week and 20 ranked games, ImBeingBoosted starts playing support in only 15%(3) of games, winning only one of them for a 33% win ratio on support. Over those three games in his typical role, he however averages 1 kill, 3 deaths, and 15 assists, assisting in 3 dragons average and 6 towers per game. He places 35 wards/game and each ward on average sees 2.6 champions. These three games alone are a huge set of red flags- yes, playing his regular role, but placing 40% more wards and increasing effectiveness by over 100%, and doubling/tripling his tower/dragon assistance. In addition, he did even better in the role, but lost games more, indicating that he couldn't finish the game off.\nIn the remaining 17 games, he plays different roles but averages a 76% win-rate, and continues his 40% extra wards ratio, 100% extra ward effectiveness, and has average KDA of 9/3/4. He also keeps an average of 3 dragon assists and 6 tower assists/game. More red flags- consistent and sudden ward effectiveness/amount spike, big leap in objective focus, consistently, significantly better performance on unfamiliar roles that he was previously pretty sub-par on.\n\nGranted, this would be one of the most clear-cut cases out there, but this can't be all of the variables they look at, nor does it take into consideration habitual tendencies- if there's that big of a skill gap, there are probably differences in their general habits as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saintshing","date":"2015-07-15T21:37:43.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do this 70000 players include other regions or just NA only? \nThis website(http://www.lolsummoners.com/stats/na) said there are 1,744,863 ranked players on NA.
