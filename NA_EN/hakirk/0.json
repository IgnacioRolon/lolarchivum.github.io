This did nothing to fix the problem so I attempted to uninstall and reinstall league. \r\n\r\nGoing into the uninstall programs section of control panel, there were 2 league of legends options. I managed to uninstall one, but attempting to uninstall the other gave the message \"The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable. Click OK to try again, or enter alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'LoL.EUNE.msi' in the box below\".\r\n\r\n\r\n I have deleted all LoL files from C: and roaming and wasn't able to find any more folders.\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to install a new version of LoL I get the message \"The older version of League of Legends cannot be removed. Contact your technical support group.\"\r\n\r\nLike most people, I do not have a technical support group, this is an incredibly poor error message.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-14T23:06:00.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The patcher not opening is usually due to a permission issue with Windows preventing access to game files.
