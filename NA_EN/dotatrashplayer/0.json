I've been playing ranked and I frequently get a bug where when the game starts It doesn't launch the game up but instead brings me back to the client where it says to reconnect. Restarting the client does not fix the problem and as a result I've lost 3 games of LP like this where the game is remade. I'm now considered a leaver and have to play 5 games with a wait time. I feel like this is unfair because this is completely the clients fault, an update that I didn't even want.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-13T17:38:14.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like your network is having trouble getting through to the game server, so it's timing you out and returning you to the client.  Even though it's not intentional, [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) will treat everyone equally regardless of intent as it still causes others a negative experience.  My suggestion in this case would be to go over the steps in the [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to troubleshoot whatever is causing your network to get blocked.
