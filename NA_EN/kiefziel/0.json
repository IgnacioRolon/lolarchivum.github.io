However, on several occasions playing against a Quinn as Renekton, her Q has blinded me and stopped my W (an AA-based stun) from working;  even when I&#039;m directly next to her in the reduced vision radius, I&#039;ll still get the &quot;missed&quot; text that you would from old Quinn. This is a very significant bug for Renekton players considering how essential the stun is to his kit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBozozo","date":"2015-12-21T01:49:59.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've reported this as well. Its a problem with augmented auto attacks. It also fucks up fiora very hard as she can't e or proc vitals. They need to see this because it is huge.","replies":[]}]}
