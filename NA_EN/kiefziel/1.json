However, after doing so there is no immediate change to show what we have done, only the absence of the icon when hovered.  Having some visual feedback, like a change of color or a mark near their name, would help greatly when wanting to friend/report multiple people in the same match, so as not to make multiple attempts on the same person.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiwis and Limes","date":"2016-07-22T02:20:23.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe highlight their name in orange or something to show that you already reported them and highlight their name in blue if you friended them, or something.\nI would say red for reported but that's already being used for anyone who is afk during the game.","replies":[]}]}
