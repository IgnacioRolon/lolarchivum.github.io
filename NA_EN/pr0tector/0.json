It makes even more sense that you've lost your connection when you mentioned not being able to change masteries since that data needs to be pulled from the servers. Check out our [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide for some ways you can flush your DNS and adjust your port forwarding and let me know how that works.","replies":[{"poster":"LadyBug97","date":"2017-08-23T10:31:39.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice copy and paste, how about you guys admit that it isnt a connection issue and that its to do with the patch. Protector just said that his internet is perfect and yet you say its a connection issue. Do you guys actually pay attention to the help and support comments because it really doesnt seem like it. I've seen this exact same reply on atleast 5 different discussions, even when the internet connection of the first commenter is perfect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cookie D Ace","date":"2017-09-26T07:58:40.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI had the same issue, with the \"Trying to reconnect\" after logging in. I found out that the tool \"Leatrix Latency Fix\" was the problem. It usualy tweak your Registry for a slighly better and stable Ping, while it changes the way Packets were send from your Network. Anyway, after I removed the tool, League is running normal again.\n\nHopefully this can help some more of you guys.{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jokky HU","date":"2017-10-12T13:05:51.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi where did you find the tool \"Leatrix Latency Fix\" on mac? i can't find it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EpicJoJo314","date":"2017-09-22T20:28:39.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this.
