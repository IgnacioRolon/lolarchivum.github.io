That is my duo queue partener and we are joking around.\r\nThe context of this game is my J4 got auto filled. In pre game he said he wasn't the best jungler and was auto filled. During the game Jax was flaming my J4 all game and I had enough of it. I felt like defending J4 since he said he wasn't the best jungler and Jax continued to flame. I guess if you have previously been given a 2-Week ban it doesn't matter the situation. They just look for trigger words, so that they can permanently ban your account. This makes me scared to ever defend anybody in league of legends because I feel like the system will just ban me. I think this isn't right and that I should be given another chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Geniuses","date":"2019-08-22T07:02:30.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The First game when I started going at it with Pantheon. He was constantly making solo plays and dying and pinging everybody on our team. He continued to flame, and when the game was literally about to end I started saying the you should go to normals and not feed in ranked. The game was already over so the report for negative and giving up should not be a real thing. The game was over they were hitting out nexus. I don't understand the system sometimes. I understand that every system is not perfect, but if a player is spam pinging and pretty much giving up and making solo plays. While the game is over we still bicker and I get punished?","replies":[{"poster":"rujitra","date":"2019-08-22T12:37:49.219+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does not matter who started it.

If they wanted to do that they could just skip the 14-day suspension and permaban you right away.\n\n> They just look for trigger words, so that they can permanently ban your account.\n\nThe system looks for certain words whether you've had a 14-day suspension or not. That punishment doesn't make you immune to the rules. Thus, if you break the rules again after a 14-day suspension, you can get another punishment, which is a permaban. The system was actually incredibly lenient with you, given that it allowed you at least three games of this level of toxicity: you threaten violence against others (I don't care if they're your duo and neither does the system; this kind of talk isn't acceptable in chat), you threaten self-harm (again, unacceptable in chat), you insult random teammates with \"no brain\" etc., you give up at the drop of a hat, and you harass people by threatening to report them.\n\n> This makes me scared to ever defend anybody in league of legends because I feel like the system will just ban me. I think this isn't right and that I should be given another chance.\n\nIt is not physically possible to \"defend\" someone from toxic chat. They have to do that themselves, and it's done by muting. It's very easy. That said, you won't have to deal with that situation in the future, because permanent bans are permanent and you will never get this account back because you have had _many_ chances and don't deserve another opportunity to ruin more matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Telephone Booth","date":"2019-08-22T23:48:51.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Super annoying type of player chat-wise.
