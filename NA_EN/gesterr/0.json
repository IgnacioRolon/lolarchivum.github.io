He picks Nunu, and I think nothing of it as his snowball spam is indeed annoyingly strong.  He doesn&#039;t take Exhaust, or Ignite, but Smite, should&#039;ve been a clue I guess.\r\n\r\nIn game he doesn&#039;t go botlane, but straight to my buff, and consumes it from me because he&#039;s Nunu and I&#039;m Zac and can&#039;t do anything about it.  He then does this to EVERY, SINGLE, CAMP for the rest of the game leaving me lucky to get a small raptor or small wolf all game. Literally does nothing but counterjungle his own team and we lose the game and me my promos.  And that&#039;s not even the worst part.\r\n\r\nAfter the game, I check his match history.  With the new match history I can see the past 10 or so games he has played Nunu and losing every single game, but oddly they all have another jungler in the game as well, who&#039;s cs usually ranges anywhere between 10-30 cs even in longer games!  This is not an isolated incident and the fact that he&#039;s been on this rampage so long is disgusting.  How many more games must be absolutely tarnished by this obscene troll?  How much LP must he consume with his Q?  Why is your system so broken that it can&#039;t catch this guy who clearly must be attracting bans left and right?

The old tribunal only gave us a few games and assuming Nunu didn't speak then the few games in his match history makes him look like a jungler on a bad losing streak - I actually don't remember if the tribunal showed you other players builds. If it didn't then the right call would probably be to let Nunu off.\n\nOn another note, I voted in the tribunal every so often when it was up. I don't remember ever seeing a case like this Nunu's, a case of intentional feeding or anything similar - just verbal abuse reports.

Far from it.\n\nBut cases like this don't prove the system is *broken* (as per OP); it proves the system is *imperfect*.\nSimilarly, the OP's implication that the Tribunal would have caught this is also false. The Tribunal was also an *imperfect* system with it's own share of problems.\nThere's no guarantee that Nunu would be caught by either system. Riot has responded to posts like this before though. People occasionally slip through the cracks. When they find them, they try to adjust the system to accommodate. But if this Nunu has truly found a loophole in the system, then nothing will happen until he generates enough reports to prompt human review. The same would have been true with the tribunal - he may have slipped through the cracks until found and manually entered into the tribunal or punished directly by Riot.\n\nSo for the time being, all people can do is report him and move on.

The pattern is really damn easy to see and quantify, both statistically and via human analysis of the game's score and people's comments in game. This is why I document my experiences with trolls and uncooperative players in game chat. So I can report the motherfucker and be rid of him forever. Of course, if you get several, then you can't report anyone until they leave lobby, because you're outnumbered, and, if you do, suddenly, you're banned because 2 to 3 trolls or idiots on your team decided \"i don't wike dis guy. *wimper* punish him, teacher! waaaa!\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BigLe2e","date":"2016-02-23T18:27:59.121+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=qetzel,realm=EUW,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=VMLWvPom,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-23T03:56:31.365+0000)\n>\n> The system isn't broken, it is just incomplete.\n\nStopped reading here.

Never mind that those 2 tower kills gave my team over 4x as much gold as the enemy got for killing me 7 times after I was already 0/6 while I slowly whittled the towers down. Never mind that the rest of my team also got completely shit on and the only reason they got any kills at all is because the enemy team sent multiple people to chase me around top lane all game after I was already worth almost no gold. Yeah, I went 0/13/0 that game. I also made more progress towards winning than anyone else on my team did.
