I saw the message that it confirms me I will receive about 11000 blue essence due to the new changes(not sure about the exact number though). But I still only have 4000 blue essence, which is about the amount I had before preseason. Also I do not receive any refunds from my RP rune pages, which is supposed to be an epic skin. Just wondering is there any delay for these refunds and rewards? How long will it be? I really want to buy something in the store{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Desonance","date":"2017-11-08T14:46:39.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good morning!\n\nYou should have some new missions detailing how you earn these. You'll have to play one match-made game within the next 2 months with the new runes in order to earn your blue essence from the rune pages. After that check your loot page to find your blue essence!\n\nVery Respectfully,\nDesonance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-11-08T23:48:37.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll need to play a match first to complete the new missions that will start the conversion process!
