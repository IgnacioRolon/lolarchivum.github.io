The concept is the same, one player picks a \"hyper carry\" champion who clears the jungle and one lane, the other a support while the remaining player(s) tend(s) to their lane(s). \n\nThough it's a bit different in 3v3 due to difference in map, jungle camps and lanes, the \"cheese\" is about the same. And the same reasons RIOT stated for wanting to change it in 5v5 have been present in 3v3 as well. You feed one champion up beyond comprehension who proceeds to try and solo carry the game. Against people running the classic Top-Jungle-Bot composition, you have high odds of winning because you've got 1 person who pops off and is under constant protection from the support, and proceed to steamroll the game most of the time.\n\nLuckily, there's a lot more \"viable\" picks for such strategies in 3v3, so both teams *tend* to have a hyper carry and support, making it somewhat more fair, but still redundant.\n\nIt makes bot lane a joke too, since you're under a lot less pressure from the enemy jungler. Unless you play really bad, you most likely won't get ganked by the duo, especially with a little bit of communication; whereas in \"regular\" 3v3 games, you have to play carefully not to get ganked by the jungler, especially those who have a way of getting through/over walls (Zac, Rek'Sai, Kayn come to mind). And it feels like most of the time you lose, their hyper comp was simply better, while if you win, your hyper comp steamrolled theirs.\n\nTo summarize, the meta's been stale and present in 3v3 for a long time without any changes whatsoever, while in 5v5 it's been directly changed almost straightaway, and is being kept an eye on. There's plenty of reasons as to why people don't play 3v3, but stale meta and almost no attention from RIOT have to be one of the main reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Marshbouy","date":"2018-06-28T15:02:52.414+0000","up_votes":19,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot has made it pretty clear that they give 0 fucks about 3v3.

I had a extreme 3v3 hype not so long ago, mostly as Mundo Jungle. \n\nI was honestly surprised Yi - Taric, Karthus - Nunu and that stuff didnt come to 5v5 earlier as this exact strategy was used, or more standart even, in 3v3 for such a long time. \nMy worst Game involving such a Case was a Kalista \"Jungle\" with a Taric Top, going Support and Lulu Bot, also Support. It was ridicouless how overfed she was midgame, not even funny. I even counterjungled her as much as possible forcing 1v1, playing mundo, but in 3v3 its so easy to collapse on invaders that this almost always ended in either me dying or Both of us dying.\n\nI also feel that 3v3 gets like no attention at all. ARAM gets a lot more, dont get me wrong, i like that Riot openly cared and tried to make ARAM better, but 3v3 Players of course feel even greater left in the Dust than before, since that also openly admited Riot cares more about ARAM than 3v3.\n\nI still enjoy a 3v3 here and there, but the Gamemode feels so left to rot, its like playing that dusted Board Game in your Aunts Basement whilst you stay over.","replies":[{"poster":"AwesomeGuyDj","date":"2018-06-28T19:35:51.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its kind of sad considering 3v3 is riots own game mode where as ARAM (correct me if im wrong) stemmed from the original player made idea, before howling abyss was a thing, hence All random all MIDDLE.","replies":[{"poster":"Semaj3xt4h","date":"2018-06-28T22:10:54.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"be glad they don't touch 3v3 everytime they touch aram they've screwed it up ( aram only here )...

The last time Riot has made changes to the 3v3 map was season 5.11, and those were some good changes, but its been over 3 years since any changes to 3v3 so yeah Riot really doesnt care.\nI enjoy playing 3's with friends, but yeah you are right, the meta on 3's has been the same for so long its just boring now. There is always a hypercarry then atleast 1 support. Fighter junglers suck because they cant hypercarry, tank junglers arent that great unless you are supporting a hypercarry in a lane. \nIm not exactly sure what changes would be needed to get rid of the hypercarry only meta in 3v3's, but i wouldnt ever hope for changes to 3's come since its already been 3 year. I wouldnt be surprised if Riot got rid of the 3v3 map just because Riot doesnt do anything with it, and what players who do play 3's sometimes are getting bored of the exact same thing after 3 seasons","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxXGwanXxX","date":"2018-06-29T18:03:57.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare we create a new strategy eh !\n\nIt's not like there was a role called \"roam\" in the good old days, why couldn'T it come back if it works ?
