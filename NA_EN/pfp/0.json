If you can't get to that option, or it doesn't seem to help at all, try the other steps found in this [**crash guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) for some other general troubleshooting. If nothing seems to be helping so far, please reach out to our techs in a [**ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so they can look through your game logs to see what's happening when you crash.","replies":[{"poster":"pfp","date":"2017-11-16T04:01:40.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the help.
