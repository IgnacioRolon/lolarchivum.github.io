Got fed early to the point that i can one-shot their carry, until four of them bought oracle extract which can reveal invisibility when near them. After that i cannot do anything for the rest of the game, every time i go in with my q i&#039;ll get deleted.  An item costs 300g made a 3 items shaco completely useless and irrelevant from the game. The same situation has happened couple times to me while playing akali, shaco, and kha, and to be honest it is really frustrating. The whole point of the new invisibility mechanism is that while you are invisible, you are unseen and untargetable until you break out of your invisibility by attacking or using skills. In summoner&#039;s rift invisibility can only be fully revealed when near turrets, so why in ARAM it can be revealed by a 300g item? If you have experienced similar situation, please comment on this post so riot can see and balance it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellpyre","date":"2017-09-17T04:40:07.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only outlines champions, they don't become targetable by point-and-click abilities. It's primarily meant to deal with traps on a map with no alternative avenue of approach, but it provides the same function as an activated Oracle's Lens would. You still can get the same thing in a fight on Summoner's Rift as on ARAM. The only difference is that you're going to be fighting much more in a game of ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"1SecForever","date":"2017-09-18T02:16:01.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to wiki:\nInvisible units can only be **revealed by enemy turrets or True Sight** and will briefly shimmer whenever they take damage (e.g. if hit by a skill shot). A unit cannot shimmer more frequently than once per second, and shimmering doesn't make a unit targetable nor remove the stealth effect.\nEffects that grant unit-vision (but not True Sight true sight) will still debuff invisible enemies, including visible over-head indicators, but will not grant unit-vision or targetability.\n\nOracle Extract grants true sight","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2017-09-17T05:06:10.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love to play Teemo in ARAM (don't judge me), because I have to be creative with my shroom placement.
