I've been being placed up against platinum player, golds, silvers. The problem with that is, im only lvl 27 right now, i do play with my lvl 30 friends sometimes, but when i play solo, i still get placed against a whole team that is silver or higher, and i will sometimes get a person who is bronze, and even rarely a person who is not lvl 30, and that will just be 1 person. Riot please fix your match making system.","replies":[{"poster":"KCT Kiwi","date":"2017-10-03T02:20:46.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, I don't like it when you feed in my games either but I enjoy playing with anyone really. It promotes me to play seriously even in normals. Or maybe my normal mmr is complete dirt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-02T03:58:03.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take it you've been playing normals (since you aren't lvl 30 yet). Normal tries to balance out both teams by looking at the overall MMR instead of focusing on your rank very much. If you're being matched with Plats in Normal, their MMR might be a lot closer to yours than you would think.","replies":[{"poster":"0rangejuiced","date":"2017-10-02T05:21:56.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick question, if that was true why do you guys continue to refuse to allow people under lvl 30 NOT queue ranked matches?","replies":[{"poster":"SadKill","date":"2017-10-02T16:10:10.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With how runes and masteries are, it makes for a more level playing field, they do make a decent amount of difference. Now come pre-season that's going to change, but they are making it easier to get to lvl 30, so it's not going to take that long. It already doesn't take too long to get to lvl 30 as it is.\n\nGenerally people with accounts under level 30 are new to the game and need to learn champions and what not. There's a lot to learn in the game, there are gamers who pick up on everything very fast because they've already played lots of games that give them skills that suit League. i.e. Other MOBAs and RTS games.\n\nYet even when you're playing normals the game is constantly trying to figure out where your skill level is and the hope is that by the time you're level 30 and ready to play ranked the system has gotten a grasp at where to place you because you've put it a lot of games for it to do so.\nIf you allowed level 1 or even level 15 (and I daresay even up to level 20 or so) accounts to play ranked  the system wouldn't have enough data to know where to place you and you're going to end up with a whole lot more people in higher elo or lower elo when they don't belong there as they're going to either crush or get crushed. A much more broken system than what we have now.\n\nSo I don't see any reason to question why a level 27 is being put into games against silver+ gold+ players as long as they're keeping up with them and not being stomped. Also playing with higher level friends skew the rooms as well.\n\ntl;dr as long as he's having competitive games, not stomps all the time, matchmaking is doing what it's intended to do. Level 30 or not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
