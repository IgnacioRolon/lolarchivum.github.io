It's really important to take this moment to troubleshoot whatever is causing this and stick to custom games for now.  The [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) system is going to treat the leave equally regardless of intent because it still causes others a poor experience.
