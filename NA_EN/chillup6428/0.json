We'll take a look at the initial reception and do our best to get a localized experience out to other regions in the future if we think there is a market for it.

Starting with one language allows us to streamline the process and reduce the risk that we'll mess something up in the meantime.  But we're committed to getting MvM out to as many regions as we can.
