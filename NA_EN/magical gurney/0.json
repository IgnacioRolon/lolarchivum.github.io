Whoever you are, please know that you saved my life. As someone who has been battling anxiety and depression for the longest time, I have always been drawn to the solitude that video games can offer. I&#039;ve always loved League of Legends, but the community can be a taaaaad toxic at times. I&#039;m not going to lie and say I&#039;ve never contributed to the vitriol myself, but around two years ago, it (along with a ton of personal life stuff) escalated to the point where I found it challenging to function within a 5 v 5 game environment. I resorted to spamming Coop v Ai games where I was given some artificial control over whether or not I could enjoy games. I just couldn&#039;t get up the confidence to play a real 5 v 5, and my main account slowly accrued upwards of 1600 Coop v Ai games. As I continued to battle severe depression, it felt like this game was the constant I could always rely on. I loved it. And I felt it was time try something new, so I started a smurf account through which I could gradually hone my mechanics, build confidence.\n\nI&#039;ve always been a support player. There&#039;s something about helping prop up a teammate and outskilling an opponent with the least amount of gold possible that excites me. I&#039;m drawn to peeling/skirmishing champions like Alistar, Nunu, Brand, and Gragas that dominate the zone control game by delicately balancing a thread between baits/initiates. Playing them in normal solo queue over the last couple weeks eventually led me to Janna, a champion that not only shines, but can turn the tide of the game through that skillset. It just felt right playing her, and I know it may seem silly or sappy or weird, but I just wanted to reach out and say thank you to the people who helped design her, however minute their contribution might have been. If it hadn&#039;t been for you, I don&#039;t think I&#039;d ever have been able to say, &quot;I played a game with 9 strangers today, and I wasn&#039;t scared.&quot;\n\nThanks.{{champion:40}} \n[Proof 1](http://i.imgur.com/rLgvusr.png)\n[Proof 2](http://imgur.com/JhTtmUy)\n\nUPDATE: Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and comment. I just went through all you guys had to say and can't emphasize enough how much every little ounce of compassion means. I got a reply for the support ticket I submitted saying, unfortunately, that they won't be able to directly pass on my message to the design team, but a friend of mine has reached out to Brackhar on twitter.","replies":[{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2015-10-14T15:19:38.544+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":214,"body":"this is really pathetic","replies":[{"poster":"BigSkinny805","date":"2015-10-14T15:51:10.673+0000","up_votes":109,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Cowgirl Ed","date":"2015-10-14T16:24:26.681+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":125,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RomperStomper805,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEoch72Y,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-10-14T15:51:10.673+0000)\n>\n> Hey fuck you buddy.

I myself perhaps have it and I prefer it to be left ambiguous. Because I am sick and tired of people labeling other with the same thing used to label the sick. I have Down Syndrome or if I am paraplegic then then label me as such because it is a handicap, something tragic that is stopping people from having a normal life but not necessarily a happy life.  Really people are misunderstanding those people in nearly as bad as someone with cerebral palsy, Christy Brown was an Irish legend and was a sarcastic dick to people that misunderstood him. And I feel the same way.\n\nHere is a funny example of when a comic called Mike Aronin with Cerebral palsy going \"retard\" told by his Friend Christopher Titus.\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/oqiGWd0-0Os?t=2m42s","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lazypeon100","date":"2015-10-14T20:28:44.671+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KussMcFly,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=QEoch72Y,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-14T16:52:19.800+0000)\n>\n> except that i have a family and i actually know what depression is, and is nothing to be joked about.\n\nYou really don't act like it. \n\nI'm going to share a story that happened to me on league since it is relevant to the thread. Several months ago, I was playing a ranked game. We had a xin zhao who, admittedly, was less than stellar. The other three people on my team kept raging at him and trash talking him the whole damned game, and he never said a word back to these strangers. Normally when my team argues, I try to ignore it or difuse the situation so we can focus more on the game. In this case, I stood up or him since it was still clear that he was trying, and he wasn't even arguing with them.\n\nAfter all this, we STILL manage to win the game with these people raging at him. In the game lobby, I honored him, reported the other 3 and moved on. Not more than 30 seconds go by and I see he gifted me head hunter caitlyn ( i was cait that game ) and he sent me a friend request. I talked to him to and found out he worked seven days a week, took meds for depression, and only had time for the one game in which he felt like shit cause he was doing bad. He said he was surprised ANYONE cared enough to stick up for him and treat him like a person, that I made him feel a little better.\n\nEdit for phone typos galore.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason the other","date":"2015-10-15T00:55:08.479+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its stuff like this that restores my faith to the human world","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-10-15T02:02:50.287+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too man.

That is difficult to do. I know from experience, so good job. It takes a lot of strength and bravery to do that. When you come along some idiot like kussmcfly, just ignore them in chat, and then keep playing exactly how you play. The point of this game is to have fun, so you having fun with janna after going through severe depression, warms my heart, because it shows me that when people find the right things, they change. And they usually change for the better. So great job. Keep it up, and don't let jerks like this other guy get you down. It doesn't matter what others think about you. If you think that you are good the way you are then you are good. Don't let others affect your life. :D good job","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZT Xperimentor","date":"2015-10-18T19:50:25.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully a hug will get them to notice :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tengene","date":"2015-10-15T11:57:31.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really moved by you're story OP, depression is though to deal with and im glad you've found something to help you with it!\nIt's also very strong of you to come out with something like this, it had to be difficult but im glad you did!\nLet's hope the Rioter has seen this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crys3s","date":"2015-10-15T02:19:34.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only my WIFE knew that videogames can often be life-saving in this sort of fashion.

I disagree about support - Janna's easily one of the most legendarily safe supports and from a gameplay perspective isn't... healthy.  There's some oddities about her that stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nOne of the strongest shields in the game giving a flat 50 bonus AD, one of the strongest slows in the game while having one of (if not the best) movement speed in the game, the longest range skillshot in the game without qualifying as a global that also has one of the longest possible knockup durations (an unreduceable 1.5 seconds at max, though granted it's hard to both charge it that much and hit that charge), as well as a mass-area displacement with a hefty heal in that same area.\n\nAll tuned to function optimally without scaling so she actually can feel free to build bulky and still be useful, and each component adds into her being safe to the point that Mejai's Soulstealer is a recommended item by default.\n\nYou can usually tell something's off if the item that scales most off of not dying is a \"must buy\" in the eyes of the designers.","replies":[{"poster":"Simplicate","date":"2015-10-14T18:33:39.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Manipulation of her teams and the enemy team's speed is her niche though.
