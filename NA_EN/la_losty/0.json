I can imagine that the teir 3 icon is only for the top teams and players, perhabs only for the people who earns the jackets, but where is the line between teir 2 and teir 1? If anyone could tell me it would be greatly appreciated, both in soloQ but also in 3v3 and 5v5, thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T03:57:26.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Challenger Icon has two different sets: One set for players in challenger but *not* in the top ladder. The second set is for players that *are* in the top ladder **and** in challenger. Each set consists of 3 icons, one for solo rating, one for 2s and 3s, then one for full teams of 5 rating.\n\nSurrender at 20 has a pretty good article detailing the icons and what they look like that you can find [here.](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/10/1018-pbe-update.html) Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-10-19T10:41:15.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a little confused, you say there are two different sets of icons, but according to surrender@20 there are 3 sets, 9 icons in total. From my understanding the different icons are from the different gamemodes, ranked soloq/duoq/dynamicq in the lower ratings, 3v3 and 5v5. The emblem you got in the normal ranked mode has nothing to do with the rewards do they? Sorry if i misunderstood something.\n\nThanks for your reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-19T21:02:08.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I'm not on the teams that design these rewards, and we don't have an official post or announcement up about this, I was purely speculating based off what previous seasons have shipped and some of the information on that Surrender at 20 post. \n\nI suggest waiting until we have concrete information out in an official post up on the [News Page](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/).","replies":[{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-10-19T22:05:37.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, thanks for the help :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-10-18T23:16:59.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump :)","replies":[{"poster":"LA Losty","date":"2016-10-19T01:18:01.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope someone has an answer for me? :3","replies":[]}]}]}
