Happy Birthday to your toddler.\n\nHow is today League's birthday?? http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions Wouldn't their birthday be the first date of released champs?? February 21st, which would be 8 months ago now. How would its birthday be 8 months after it was created","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2014-10-27T23:19:45.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't there have to've been champs during Alpha and Beta?\n\n\"Birthdays\" for games tend to be based on the full release, which would certainly have been after any testing phase.

If you include the Beta/Alpha, then that would be 2008, and 6 years ago. So idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Jubbinaut","date":"2014-10-27T23:58:53.573+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The actual release date for League, according to their wiki, was [October 27th, 2009](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends). So 5 years ago today.\n\nSome champions would have been designed before the release date, because there would have to be champions during the testing phases - which occur *before* release. Specifically, from April 10th to October 26th of 2009 for the beta.\n\nBut, as I stated before, \"birthdays\" for games tend to be based on the final release date.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RowGo","date":"2014-10-27T22:25:17.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!!!
