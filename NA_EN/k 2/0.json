(yay not just me!)\n\nOccasionally (and seemingly randomly) the game will suddenly crash and pull up the bugsplat window and the reconnect client window. I have had this occur on both patches 4.16 and 4.17. I think it has only occurred on Summoners Rift. Doesn't seem to be correlated with a specific champion. *Seems* to happen only in ranked queue (my memory may be distorted). Doesn't happen every game. Doesn't surface in custom or teambuilder tests. **Can occur** multiple times per game.\n\nSteps to replicate:\n\n1. be on mac client. OSX 10.9.4 play on summoners rift. \n2. play game for a few minutes. game crashes.\n3. do not send bugsplat report to apple. reconnect. \n4. play game again. game may crash again.\n5. cry. reconnect. apologize to team. finish game.\n\nI looked at my most recent occurrence and noted that since I DCed twice, the r3d logs for that game are split into three logs. the first two logs end in the same errors. These errors don't occur in two randomly selected r3d logs from other games. I will post all three logs.\n\n\nDid the mac bug section get merged with windows? Thanks for the help as always Brentmeister and Team.\n\nREGARDING ADDING ATTACHMENTS\nthe attachment function seems to break when i drag more than one log at a time. i tried on firefox and chrome. you may want to change it to explicitly say drag one file at a time or fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"K 2","date":"2014-11-05T23:39:17.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumping. playing ranked on 4.19 patch. teammates and i used a bunch of abilities, game stuttered and then totally crashed. sent the bugsplat. mac client 10.9.4.\n\nalso had a ranked game earlier where champ select finished, got a black screen, after a while showed the firewall message that usually means the servers being funny. waited, tried to reconnect, force quit. try to log in server busy. try to log in again, now suddenly no reconnect option. never got lp deduction. its as if the game never happened.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MuadDib57","date":"2014-10-05T16:47:53.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OSX version 10.9.4, LOL client version 4.17.14_09_22_18_55\n\nThe whole crash/freeze/bugsplat thing is still happening. I noticed it beginning with Shurima and it has persisted since then. Doesn't happen every game, but probably half or more. Never happens on my home Windows 7 PC, but happens often on my Mac.\n\nUPDATE: Bugsplat will no longer allow me to send a report on this. Bugsplat pops up but is frozen and unresponsive. Also, I tried repairing damaged files and rechecked the P2P feature (For Funsies) but the crash still happens.
