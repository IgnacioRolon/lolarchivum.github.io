Unfortunately, we found in testing that this made it really hard to tell all of those states apart. \n\nWe want to give each rune the appropriate amount of gameplay visibility and even though having Aery float around all the time is satisfying (because I love herrrrr) it's actually not great for clarity - if she's around all the time in ready/active/cooldown it actually makes it harder to tell which state she's actually in for everyone who needs to play around that info. Adding to the problem, she also has more states than similar keystones like Comet.\n\nThus, we made the call to have her be present for her most important states that need play for them (active/coming home) and to act more like a buff for her ready state (which she kinda is because she is a rune, after all). We've found that this change makes her significantly easier to track and play around for both enemies and owners.\n\nPS I like to think that when Aery goes away she's actually returning into your heart though, where she came from. ðŸ’•","replies":[{"poster":"LightIsMyPath","date":"2017-11-13T00:29:35.415+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":7,"body":"You're lying.

However the current iteration makes Aery feel like an extra on hit that pop by every now and then. I early fight she is easier to track and manage but later it gets a bit harder to track where she is heading if not paying close attention. I find it tedious to look away from the fight to see the buff bar when I lose track of her to know if she's ready. Furthermore other keystones have visual 'ready' effect hovering over champions. \n\n\nI understand the clarity issue, well to an extent, however I would like it if Aery had some more presence when idle. Maybe turn into a little foxfire the size of the Comet and Guardian Runes; though in hindsight it might be confused with comet.\n\nAnother option to satisfy both ends of this ( clarity VS feel good ) would be to use existing tech to make Aery hide when near enemies/combat and walk by your side when just strolling around the rift. When entering combat Aery will do the return animation and disappear into the buff bar unless she is interrupted to dive to an ally/enemy. With this iteration, player get to feel the \" I have a cute pet following me around yay!\" but when clarity is important, she goes into combat mode \"returning into your heart\" between summons until she can idle and prance around again. \n\nQuite frankly I want a champion with a perma pet. Something like Orianna but rather than an inanimate object an actual pet. Daisy and Tibbers are fun and all but usually you don't care for them; you summon them to combo and harass but once that's done you have them tank towers. Having a companion to fight alongside with and protect each other is a fun play style. Some might know a Hero that fits this idea which also means I might never see something like this in League, which is sad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"the weeaboo","date":"2017-11-14T04:03:16.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh.
