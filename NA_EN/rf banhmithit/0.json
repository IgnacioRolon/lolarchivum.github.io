Every time I try to start a match ( after the champion selection) an error shows up and said that cannot find the file d3dx9_39.dll. I went to the Riot Games File and check, AND THE FILE D3DX9_39.DLL WAS THERE. I try to reinstall and restart league client many times and it won't work, even my computer. There nothing to do with the internet connection, the computer, it's just that something wrong with the files. This installation of mine is a bit different from others that I am not the authorizer of the computer, it's a school computer, I got through the admin password and downloaded it legally, is there anything to do with that???. Please help me, thank you!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-11T02:54:45.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmm my first guess is that your user on that school pc might not have admin rights to allow League to run the way it needs to. Try to get those setup with the [**permissions guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions), and you will probably need to reach out to your school's IT people to get that done.","replies":[]}]}
