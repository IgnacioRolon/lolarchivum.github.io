If you are queueing for ranked, you are playing to win. Stop with this mentality of \"just go out and have fun\". No. This is ranked. If you just want to casually enjoy the game that's precisely what normals are for. But as soon as you click the  \"accept\" button when a ranked queue pops, you had better be giving 100% of your effort to winning the game. \n\nAlso the fact that you need to play to \"keep placement\" makes me think that your plat. Congrats. But this excludes you from the real issue: it's freakin' hard to climb when you're virtually guaranteed to lose a percentage of your games to premades.","replies":[{"poster":"Serika Zero","date":"2016-04-26T16:08:35.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"sry, dynamic q is made for casual games\nand if you would check my profile (euw account), you would see that I've only played like 5 heroes.
