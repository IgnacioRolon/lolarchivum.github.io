By the next season or sometime in the future, it was removed. Could someone please tell me if they reset like elo's do at the start of every season or it was just a glitch. I see people with the same teamwork crest/badge in some loading screens and it always makes me think of the one I used to have. Thank You.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-04-22T22:04:11.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor emblems aren't permanent.  You'll have to stay consistent with receiving honor, but it will eventually go away per the [honor system guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751854-Honor-System-FAQ).  It's really cool that you had one before, though!  Good luck and go for another!","replies":[]}]}
