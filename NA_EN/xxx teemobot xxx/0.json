The amount of pressure and anger that i have held back over the years is unbelievable. 95% of the games consist of me int he jungle at the 15 min being 5-0 while 2 of the other lanes is always 0-5. ( don&#039;t even begin talking about &quot; oh well your jungle go gank &quot; no f*cking sh*t) I Never start or induce or catalys or join in or erect an argument how ever you wanna say it. According to my team its always my fault. Why do i get a 14 day ban for saying nothing and for doing well? why not the R*tards that flame and feed?
