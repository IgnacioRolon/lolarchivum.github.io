I pictured Franky from One Piece. Two year time lapse in mind, as seen in the picture included.\r\n\r\nThis guy is not directly similar to Franky, but I just pictured him as to what the Champion would look like in game.\r\nOnto the abilities of... \r\n\r\n**Franky**, the **Combat Engineer**!!!\r\n\r\n**PRIMARY:** SUPPORT / **SECONDARY:** FIGHTER\r\n\r\n**STATS:**\r\nHealth: 576---->2034\r\nHealth Regen: 8.4---->21.2\r\nMelee: 150\r\nDamage: 56---->89\r\nAttack Speed: 0.633(+0---->40.5%)\r\nArmor: 24.6---->76.3\r\nMagic Resist: 31---->52.3\r\nMovement Speed: 335\r\n\r\n**PASSIVE:** **Engineer's Talents:**\r\nFranky has no resource, only cool downs, but with that, he gets two passives:\r\n**Tool Box:** Franky has a cap as to how many Generators he can place on the map, with the cap increasing as he levels up.\r\nFranky can place up to 4/5/6/7/8 Generators at Levels 1/5/9/13/18. This will be seen as his resource bar to Allies and Enemies. \r\n**SUPER-CHARGED!!!:** More attack speed with more nearby allies within 1000 range, up to 16%\r\n\r\n**Q ABILITY:** **Resource Pod**; ***STATIC*** *Cooldown: 25/23/21/19/17 Seconds*\r\nFranky can order a Resource Pod to a target location that deals initial damage upon landing, and continuously slows any enemies within a radius around the Pod. Additionally, the Pod will heal allies within a radius, gradually increasing over the duration of the Pod's active time, then decreasing as it reaches the end of the duration.\r\n**Resource Pod:** Franky can launch a Resource Pod within 1250 range of himself, and within a .25 second Cast Time and a .75 second delay, the Pod lands dealing 20/30/40/50/60(+10%(Levels 1-2)/20%(Levels 3-4)/30%(Level 5) Total AD), and after a .75 second delay, the Pod emits healing nanobots, that heal allies for 2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/20(+1% per 1% Missing Health)(Base healing increased by Franky's Level) per .5 seconds. The Pod lasts for 5(Levels 1-2)/6(Levels 3-4)/7(Level 5) seconds, and the healing increases by double the base healing is at 2.5(Levels 1-2)/3(Levels 3-4)/3.5(Level 5) seconds, and then decreases back to its original values, then stops healing at 4.5(Levels 1-2)/5.5(Levels 3-4)/6.5(Level 5) seconds. The Healing Effects will occur within a 180 radius, will apply a 25%/30%/35%/40%/45% slow to enemies within a 180 radius, and grant sight in a 500 radius, and block movement within 65 Radius. The Pod will also have a health bar equal to 50%(Levels 1-2)/62.5%(Levels 3-4)/75%(Level 5) of Franky's Current Health. After the time is up, or the Pod is destroyed, the Pod disappears into the ground. The Cooldown of this Ability will not begin until the Pod is off the Field.\r\n\r\n**W ABILITY:** **Semi-Stable Generator**; *Cooldown: Listed in Description Below*\r\nFranky can place a Generator that acts as a ward, and will explode if a Champion gets too close to it, lighting them on fire and granting sight of those caught in the blast. If this ability is cast on a Turret, it will deal damage instead.\r\n**Semi-Stable Generator:** Franky can place a Generator on the ground within 650 range of himself, take .6 seconds to arm (Turning invisible after 1 Second), lasting for 3 minutes, and revealing an area within 750 range upon placement. Any Enemy Champions who walk within 75 range of one or destroy it via Auto-Attacks will cause the Generator to explode, being dealt 10/15/20/25/30(+10% Bonus AD) over 3 seconds, within 300 range, and are additionally revealed over 3 seconds. A Generator will have Health equal to 125(+25x Franky's Level)(+50% Bonus AD). Franky can have up to 2(Levels 1-2)/3(Levels 3-4)/4(Level 5) Generators stored, and can only have as many Generators as **Tool Box** allows placed on the map. A Generator will come back to his storage every 22/21/20/19/18 seconds.\r\nIf cast on a Turret, it will instead deal 75(+25x Franky's Level)(+50% Bonus AD) Magic Damage to the Tower.\r\n\r\n**E ABILITY:** **Static Shield**; *Cooldown: 15 Seconds*\r\nFranky will passively have bonus Armor and Magic Resist and Movement Speed. However, activating this ability will lose the passive, give the target temporary bonus Attack Speed, and will give an Attack Damage Bonus for 3 Auto-Attacks, or for the as long the shield is active, as well as giving the target bonus Armor and Magic Resist. This Ability's passive will come into effect once this ability is off Cooldown.\r\n**Static Shield:**\r\n**PASSIVE:** Franky has 5/10/15/20/25 Armor and Magic Resist, and will also have 4%/7%/10%/13%/16%(+7.5% Bonus AD) Bonus Movement Speed.\r\n**ACTIVE:** Franky will give a nearby Ally within a 750 radius an electrical shield that will absorb 75/110/145/180/205(+70% of Franky's Bonus AD) damage, grant them 5/10/15/20/25 Armor and Magic Resist, as well as granting them 20%/25%/30%/35%/40% Attack Speed, and giving them an Attack Damage Bonus lasting for either 3 Auto-Attacks, or until the Shield is destroyed/lost, equal to 15/25/35/45/55(+7.5% of Franky's Bonus AD) and apply a 20% Slow for 1.5 Seconds. The slow does not stack. The damage from the bonus will be taken as magic damage. The Shield will last for 6 seconds.\r\nIf the Shield is cast on Franky, he will go from 150 Range to 450 Range, and will revert back to 150 after he uses 3 Auto-Attacks, or the Shield is destroyed. His attacks will also apply a 15% Slow for 1 Second. The slow does not stack.\r\n\r\n**R ABILITY:** **Engineer's Pride**; *Cooldown: 140/110/80 Seconds*\r\nFranky will disable use of all his abilities, but will gain access to temporary Q/W/E spells that will benefit his Mech, but may take away some of Franky's stats to do so. Cooldown Reduction does not apply to the temporary Q/W/E spells.\r\nFranky will summon a Mech that will fight alongside Franky for 30/37.5/45 Seconds. In addition, Franky will be able to control where his Mech can go.\r\n**Engineer's Pride:** Franky will summon a Mech within 600 range of himself, deal 75/150/225(+30% Total AD) upon release in a 285 radius, and apply a Stun for 1.25/1.5/1.75 Seconds.\r\n**PASSIVE:**\r\nFranky will gain 50/75/100 Health per 10 Seconds when this skill is off Cooldown.\r\n**MECH'S STATS:**\r\nHealth: 1000/2250/3500\r\nDamage: 70% of Franky's Total AD\r\nOn-Hit: 10% of Franky's Total AD as Magic Damage. Mech's Auto-Attacks can't critically strike.\r\nAttack Speed: 0.725\r\nArmor: 35/55/75\r\nMagic Resist: 35/55/75\r\nMovement Speed: 350\r\n**DISABLED-Q:** **Healing Nanobots**; *Cooldown: 60 Seconds*\r\nFranky will activate a Healing Command, giving his Mech 40/60/80(+1% per 1% of Mech's Missing Health) per Second for 5 Seconds.\r\n**DISABLED-W:** **Overheat**; *Cooldown: 60 Seconds*\r\nFranky will put Mech's engine into overdrive, causing it to spit flames in a 170 Radius every Second for 6 Seconds, dealing 100/150/200(+25% Bonus AD) Physical Damage.\r\n**DISABLED-E:** **Electrical Overload**; *Cooldown: 60 Seconds*\r\nFranky will transfer 30% Movement Speed and 40% Attack Speed to give his Mech 20%/30%/40% Increased Movement Speed and 20%/30%/40% Increased Attack Speed for 5 Seconds. Mech will also have his On-Hit damage increase to 20%, instead of 10%, and attacks will spread to enemies within 300 Range, and will take 30% of Mech's Damage as Magic Damage from the spreading electrical bolts. Mech will also have a 25% Slow for 1.5 Seconds. The slow does not stack. This effect also lasts for 5 Seconds. Franky's Movement Speed and Attack Speed will return once the spell's effect's duration has finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n--_\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-10T23:56:29.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting concept!  Here are some notes-\n\nFor ability rank scaling, the reader will assume that it has 5 ranks, and you can cut out a lot of clutter in each ability by just using something like 10/20/30/40/50% instead of using () to denote ability rank.\n\nI like the pod drop idea a lot.  I'd increase the radius pretty dramatically (huddling around something that's not much bigger than melee attack range seems restricting) and I'm curious why you have the healing values change twice over its duration.  I can see it getting stronger/weaker at the end but to have its high point in the middle and then go back down again seems odd.  Is there a particular reason for this?\n\nI think the generator cap should be tied to his W, and not his passive.  Having two passives seems a bit odd, especially when the generators are so firmly related to his W.\n\nI like the Azir-esque sacrifice of generators to deal bonus damage to towers- helpful for a team-centric support.  However, giving a champion an infinite supply of free wards, that also deal damage to people who get too close, is incredibly strong.  Make sure you are thinking about what other ramifications an ability like this has- namely the fact that Franky can now opt out of building a sightstone, freeing up a slot in his inventory and allowing him to hid mid game power spikes more quickly than any other support.  I would probably tone down the volume of generators he can place, or how quickly they regenerate.\n\nHoly shit, his E is bloated with so much power!  This ability is nutso in both its raw stats and the volume of things that it does.  The fact that he loses the passive stats, but can then cast the ability on himself, also seems odd.  I would really cut back on this Rube Goldberg-esque ability and think about 1-2 iconic things you want the ability to accomplish in relation to the rest of his kit.\n\nHis ultimate is very interesting... it's basically Tibbers, except instead of a bear, he summons {{champion:68}} ?! That's neat.  Disabling the rest of his abilities for the duration seems really weird and restrictive, though.  As an engineer, I'd argue that he should summon the mech for HIMSELF.  He jumps inside of it and his abilities change for a few seconds while he runs around in mech form.  He gets a new shield/health bar that has to be destroyed before the mech blows up, then he jumps out and  resumes his regular play patterns.  Player choice is important, so casting R again should cause him to hop out of the mech instantly.  It would sit there and time out like normal, and could be damaged by enemies during this time, but he could also hop back into it if he wanted, and it could be healed by his drop pods, too!  What do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-12T14:21:30.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I came up with a small snippet of what that Yordle Polymorph Marksman could have with his abilities:\n> Dart, the Carnival Prankster\n\n>Passive: Crack Shot: Every fifth auto attack deals bonus magic damage to an enemy and in an area around his target.\n>Q: Windup Bumper Car: Has no cast time. Places a bumper car at his current location. Press Q again to launch. The longer the car is left to charge, the farther it goes, it moves faster, and deals more damage. Explodes on the first enemy hit, and deals AOE damage, with DOT for a few seconds, and a slight slow that decays over 2 seconds. Passively grants bonus On-Hit damage based on ability level, and stacks up to 3 times after not damaging champions or minions/monsters.\n>W: Rusty Nail: On the next attack, deals bonus physical damage. Resets AA timer. Nail also causes DOT for a few seconds. If enemy is affected with E, then Nail will deal true damage, and end E’s effects. Passively grants additional bonus damage to monsters initially and over time. Every AA refreshes the On-Hit and DOT duration. DOT duration is 3 seconds, and starts 1 second after the initial On-Hit damage.\n>E: Suspended Target: Dart places a balloon on a target in a line skillshot that slows them based on their missing health, and Dart will deal bonus magic DOT to the target if the balloon lands. If cast on an ally, will speed them up. Cannot be cast on minions, but can be cast on monsters. If not popped by W, effects will end, and then the balloon will explode after a few seconds, dealing AOE damage, and will fear the target, but not those around the target.\n>R: Top Prize: Dart marks an enemy with a bundle of balloons, slowing them dramatically. During this time, Dart deals bonus damage to marked target, and is also immune to CC from anyone but his marked target. Casting R again causes him to take a focused stance, and shoot a quick barrage of bullets, pushing him back, but dealing massive damage to the marked target. Bullets will ricochet to surrounding enemies in an area, but the bullets can be intercepted, however, but still apply the ricochet effect. Ricochets up to 3 times, and prioritizes champions closer to the last hit target. Applies lesser and lesser slows to enemies hit by subsequent ricocheting bullets. Passively grants bonus movement speed that builds up over 6 seconds, and is lost when taken damage. Refreshes after not taking damage after 5 seconds.\n\nI'll make an actual post on this with some numbers, but this is what I have so far.\nWhat do you think?\n\nPS: How are you able to get upvotes on your champion concepts, when it seems that I get downvotes on my concepts?

Is he meant to be a marksman?  I really like the idea of a crack shot yordle kid who uses pop guns at the local fair but thinks he's a total badass.\n\nI think you missed a huge opportunity with the bumper car!  I like where you started going with it, but a DoT and explosion don't do it justice!  Why not make it work like Janna's Tornado?  The longer it charges, the faster and further it travels, and when colliding with enemies it literally BUMPS them ~200-400 units to the side.  Like Draven's Stand Aside, but on crack.\n\nRusty Nail... I get what you're going for with the balloons but why couldn't he just shoot the balloons with his pop gun(s)?  I'm thinking something similar to Duck Hunt.\n\nAnother carnival trope that I think could make for a fun ability-\n\nA passive that works like the hammer and bell thing, where if he hits hard enough, the bell will ding and he gets a prize.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2015-01-12T22:18:36.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that sounds better for choices.\nThe DoT thing might've been too overkill in my first concept, so I'll tone it down quite a bit.\nI originally called \"Rusty Nail\" \"Spiked Bullet\", but I couldn't really call it a \"Dart\" because that's what the guy's named.\nI tried to make him a marksman, but I guess as I went through it, I felt like he could also be a true jungling marksman, but maybe just get rid of the DoT thing because that's too much like Teemo and Tristana, and we don't need more of them.\nFor some reason, everytime I thought of a new ability for this guy, I kept hearing the Christmas Story line repeating in my head: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"\nI'll put these suggestions into account and make a champion concept post for this soon!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Lutzburg","date":"2015-01-12T22:23:30.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mordecai7562,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=EfnhnVYM,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2015-01-12T22:18:36.856+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, that sounds better for choices.\n> The DoT thing might've been too overkill in my first concept, so I'll tone it down quite a bit.\n> I originally called \"Rusty Nail\" \"Spiked Bullet\", but I couldn't really call it a \"Dart\" because that's what the guy's named.\n> I tried to make him a marksman, but I guess as I went through it, I felt like he could also be a true jungling marksman, but maybe just get rid of the DoT thing because that's too much like Teemo and Tristana, and we don't need more of them.\n> For some reason, everytime I thought of a new ability for this guy, I kept hearing the Christmas Story line repeating in my head: \"You'll shoot your eye out.\"\n> I'll put these suggestions into account and make a champion concept post for this soon!\n\nGreat, really looking forward to it!

Thanks so much for the feedback!\nThis is like my second concept so far, the first concept I did back when the forums were still around, and the concept was basically where she could summon people to help her fight in lane... Which now is basically what Azir is! Except Riot did a much better job and made him less complicated than my idea.\n\nThe pod was something I thought of that would give something to give up: offense and CC, or defense and healing. \nSince he is resourceless, I wanted something that would create a decision during the laning phase and create some windows of opportunity. \nYeah, the range is mostly something I thought of that would create a zone where if it was used for healing, then there would be a small spot where people had to stand to get the most out of it, without being able to chase and still get the healing.\nI mostly looked up stats and ranges and scaling and base numbers from existing champions and such, just to get an idea of what was balanced in Riot's eye, and not have uber strong base numbers for a Support.\nThe healing values I made it so that it would give some sort of risk: if I stand here and get the big healing, I might be seen as an easy target.\n\nI wanted an ability that wasn't too much like Teemo, but since the generators only do so much damage over 3 seconds (only 30 at max rank) there isn't really much to worry about if you step on one.\nI always see people complain about how the sightstone gives such crappy stats, for what it is, and doesn't really give anything else. And if Franky needs the AD, he kinda needs the items and the health, to give the benefits later in the match.\n\nI wanted something like Janna, but also I wanted him to have some sort of *RELIABLE* CC out of his ultimate, that way he wouldn't be like Sona currently is with how she only has her R to reliably stop people and turn the fight around. Yeah, I probably should've thought about the E more, but the range amplifier on Franky himself when self-casted was an after thought, and I thought it would be pretty cool if you would start shooting your target while slowing them, and then you'd be able to throw out the Pod to slow them more, with a more hittable target. I guess the AA buff is the one thing that is the iconic thing about the shield, but I have no clue where to go with that.\n\nHis R... That one had the biggest change. Originally, I was going to have the three spells change to one spell, similar to Sion's passive, and give his Mech a decaying speed boost, with a decaying speed deprivation to Franky. After I thought about it, I saw that since his Mech can be more than just Tibbers was: \"Imma use my ultimate move- BEAR HUG!!! Alright now he's just gonna punch you repeatedly and show you some manners\". I wanted some sort of interactivity with the player and the ultimate, and have the decision: do I use the ultimate to stun them, or do I throw out my two more offensive spells first before I have to wait 45 seconds? Once the ultimate is out, it's gonna stay there for a while.\nPlus if there were spells that made the Mech gain different bonuses, you'd feel like you were actually sending out another teammate that could help out for a little while, but Franky himself would lose his supporting qualities.\nAnd as I was typing out that last sentence, I immediately thought of Riot's comment on how oppressive Yorick currently is. :I\nI guess the Mech-Suit is probably the better route.\n\nBut mostly, since most of the Melee supports are Tanks anyway, I wanted him to be more of a fighter and *feel* like a fighter, who could also do something from a distance and not put himself in harm's way, since people would have to build AD on him to make all of his spells stronger, instead of just going straight for the health and armor.\n\nThank you so much for the feedback! I'll try to make these changes and/or probably move on to that Yordle Marksman with the Polymorph :P","replies":[]}]}]}
