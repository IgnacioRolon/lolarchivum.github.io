I do agree we're seeing a bit too many %health damage items, but in this case with Bloodrazor's effect it's back AD, so champs relying on hybrid damage to pass defenses are taking a heavy hit.

It also skewed the balance on champions that used the item heavily to the point where its primary abusers had to get nerfed such that they can't live without it, the most prominent examples being Shyvanna, Xin Zhao, and Master Yi.\n\nBloodrazor is a much healthier alternative to Devourer in the jungle because it allows for more interaction between the jungler and the rest of the map. Your jungler no longer has an excuse for powerfarming the jungle outside of their ganks being completely awful, and allows for better balance among a lot of junglers.\n\nThat said, the idea of the phantom hit wasn't necessarily bad. It was a cool idea, but because it was ungated once you got Sated Devourer left some severe balance problems, not to mention that some champions that would normally like the idea of having the phantom hit and couldn't jungle got alienated out of the item. Having the phantom hit be the reward for stacking Guinsoo's solves both problems in addition to solving the overall cost-efficiency problem that it had before.","replies":[{"poster":"TonyTonyMordecai","date":"2016-04-20T20:00:33.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points, I agree with that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rain NT","date":"2016-04-19T21:35:31.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol so youre losing attack speed until you stack up to atleast 3, thats kinda tilting but that item is hella strong if you stack it though.
