For now, all I can say is keep focusing on being positive in game; it's good that you recognize where you went wrong, and if you keep trying we're sure that climbing back will feel like a breeze.\n\nFor now, I recommend setting goals for yourself like first Unlocking your Honor level if it isn't already, and setting precautions for when you feel yourself about to be negative in game (one good way of keeping yourself from flaming is to mute players and then drag chat off screen. Works wonders, I tell ya'!).\n\nYou'll be back to Lv 2 before you know it as long as you keep your H-game on from here forward! :D","replies":[{"poster":"xxxXFANXxxx","date":"2017-11-12T17:19:47.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure \n3 months after im still honor 0 even tho i played alot games, got some honors\nthen i got note that im honor 1 but that never happened \ni went to profile and saw im still lvl 0\nthat was like month ago.....\nIm still honor lvl 0 \n\nMY HONOR IS IN BUG FOR SURE","replies":[]}]}]}
