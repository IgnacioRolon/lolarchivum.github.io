I have never changed my password in the 3 or 4 years I made my original account (this one I'm using right now is a side account, rarely ever used).  I tried to make a ticket through this account and they told me I needed to log out. So I did. But when I was trying to give them the email to send the response to, its linked to this account. So it kept saying that I sent the message from this account even if I logged out, and it got redacted. So I after trying to send two more tickets, I made a new email. Now if I try to check up on the status of the ticket (link given to me via new email) it says that no longer exists. I have no idea what to do. I just want my old account back. Its not like there is even anything good on it. I'm just B1 with a handful of skins. And no one has been using my account in the past day so I don't think its hacked? I would just like some information on how to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-14T02:59:58.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Account recovery tickets are handled entire via email from your end, so you won't be able to login to the support site to check the status.
