Because that recently happened to me and It said this &quot;you have intentionally fed in these games&quot; it showed one and in my match history as well it only shows 1, so im confused, if a one time thing is a 14 day ban worthy then shouldn&#039;t you receive a warning. If it is I would love to know for future tense and ill proudly serve my 14 day bans with no complains, But if its a one time thing how come my other teammate in my game didn&#039;t get banned aswell? when you look at his match history it shows more than 1 intent game. Id love to know more thanks, If a riot user can explain more better that would be good to, i dont want to get the wrong cognitive if because of right now i feel like thats an unjust ban but if its in the rules ill serve it proudly.

We take trolling seriously, and each game you troll ruins the game for 9 other people.\n\nSince you asked, I did a manual review of this case. I'm going to escalate it to a perma-ban based upon the combination of intentional feeding, trolling, extreme hate speech, and your penalty history. Your chat logs contain language that is absolutely unacceptable in any setting. Our players have said time and time again they don't want this type of thing in League. You can re-log to see the new reform card, which includes chat. You are welcome to open a support ticket if your disagree with my call.\n\n> But if its a one time thing how come my other teammate in my game didn't get banned aswell?\n\nYou are held accountable for your behavior.
