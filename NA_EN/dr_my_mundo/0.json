I am with Bell Canada and I brought up the issue with them and they sent me a replacement modem because they believed that was what was causing all my issues... Turns out it isn't.\r\nI have come to the conclusion that it must be something else so i'm here seeking help. I have done everything on my end to try and fix this issue but i'm out of ideas at this point.\r\n\r\nMy current experience in games is my ping stays at a steady 35 then spikes to 50 then up to 100-600 then drops down to 35 and rinse and repeat for the rest of the game. It has made my hobby impossible to do and I need some help!!\r\n\r\nTy, Dr My Mundo","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-22T03:56:42.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These sorts of issues are most often caused by an issue along your network routing to the servers. Since you've already had your modem replaced, that's probably not a factor here. Before we take a look at your network routing, I'd like you to work through our [**connection guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to ensure all your local settings are properly configured for League.\n\nLet me know if this caused any changes for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr My Mundo","date":"2017-02-22T23:14:40.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing has changed for me.
