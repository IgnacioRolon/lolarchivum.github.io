Oh, and her self-identification has nothing to do with it. Salesmen is gender neutral. Just like when someone says \"The dawn of man,\" well, they don't ever mean just those things with the dangly bits between their legs, they mean all of mankind...all of humanity. \n         On a similar note, the Star Trek Captain's Oath change from \"To go where no MAN has gone before\" to \"To go where no ONE has gone before.\" Good job, you \"avoided sexism\" or whatever....only problem being that man, here, referred to humanity as a species. If you are out exploring and you find other species, clearly some ONE HAS been there before. But if this is the outmost limit to where humanity has explored, then you are truly going where no MAN has gone before.","replies":[{"poster":"Señor Karthus","date":"2015-11-29T06:17:44.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are the one missing the whole point.\n\n1st- This discussion ends when you know a person/character identifies as a gender. So there is no need to discuss about gender neutral pronouns/words. Illaoi is a woman. So the correct title should be \"saleswoman.\" No need to use a gender neutral form for a person/character that identifies as a certain gender. So your whole comment is unnecessary. \n\n2nd- We could talk about gender neutral language, but it is absolutely offtopic. And we would go on and on about how sexism and centuries of patriarchy shaped many languages so the male form is always the default form and how new ways of thought consider the introduction of actual neutral forms like certain languages already have. \nBut as said this is offtopic and has no place in this thread.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DoctorWolf18","date":"2015-11-29T23:56:07.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want to use that gif again now.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Solaxo","date":"2015-11-29T10:33:13.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=drbob2012,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=4m9Ac34i,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-28T17:08:22.984+0000)\n>\n> Actually a new wave of politically correctness is sweeping where you aren't supposed to distinguish between man and woman in job titles (everyone is a waiter not a waitress, actors not actresses, etc.), so you can disagree with doing that, but your correction here is technically wrong in the current meta of formally correct English language.\n\n\nJust because America has bs political correctness doesn't mean the UK or Ireland has it.
