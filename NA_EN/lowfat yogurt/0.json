It has only started doing this recently. I have been in the loop since early on so this is rather new to me. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and looked up other fixes, yet I don't use a laptop and the programs mentioned that need to be disabled I do not have. Old client works fine, just wondering why this happens and how to fix it, as well as if it's possible it would be an issue for when we switch to the Alpha Client.\n** _It doesn't need to be fixed if the client will work fine after the switch but it would be nice._**","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-10-20T04:03:07.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. I've only seen this happen with Lenovo Y700 laptops. There may be a similar app running in the background that was causing issues on the Lenovos. I suggest taking a wack at [performing a clean boot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting#wq3) to ensure this isn't the case.\n\nLet me know if that changed anything.","replies":[{"poster":"lowfat yogurt","date":"2016-10-20T23:56:10.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the clean boot and one of the apps is certainly the cause.
