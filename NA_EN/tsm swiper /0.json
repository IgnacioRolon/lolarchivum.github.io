I have been playing league since mid-season 3 and have enjoyed almost every second of it. I enjoy watching LCS and other pro events, I enjoy watching Riot content and keeping up to date with the patch notes and so-forth. Basically I have a lot of passion for this game. Now that's not to mean I do not get royally frustrated (we all do), but this is a great game that keeps improving certain aspects often; yet leaving others... basically unattended.  Or at least that's what it seems like to an outsider trying to look in without all the details and necessary information.Now, I primarily play ranked solo queue and started in bronze back in s3, and steadily but gradually climbed and improved over the years and am now mid-plat in season 7. So this message primarily pertains to what I notice in solo queue, which is where people are most passionate about improving their own skill and being competitive.  Now I know what you're thinking \"oh we shouldn't listen to this person they're probably just coming off a tough loss and ready to blame riot\", that's only partially true. I have just come off a couple frustrating losses but this is not a blame-game type message. If you are bored by now I don't mean to keep you waiting; I'll get to the point:\r\n\r\nIn my 3 and 1/2 years of playing I have noticed the following in regards to negative players (this includes every negative player you can imagine troll, feeder, flamer, rage quitter, negative-attitude, etc.)  : The only one I have seen less of due to the \"community clean-up\" is flamers. Toxic players. Every other type of person that ruins the game, especially intentional feeders, has stayed stagnant throughout my steady years of playing. I think it is time to not shift our focus but rather start doing more to identify and punish people blatantly ruining the game. I am very aware it is harder to catch a feeder than it is a toxic flamer because of evidence (chat logs), but the signs are all there in the open. Usually a feeder will have already argued with someone and then just runs at someone with really no sense of regret and with the sole-purpose of \"getting back at someone\". \r\n\r\nFor toxic players we have a mute button. I love it, use it all the time, even though I feel I shouldn't have to since communication is a vital aspect to winning since you have to rely on four others. But what do we have for feeders? Nothing. We can mute people if they are being toxic and the problem is solved just about as good as it can be. We have no defense against feeders in-game. Which is why I think the identification of feeders and trolls needs to become better, and the crackdown of these players needs to be set in-motion as soon as can be.  It really doesn't make sense the people being punished the most are people just typing rather than those who directly influence the outcome of the game by giving free kills, taking cs from you, and just literally making the game that much more difficult to win. The number of these inters and trolls has honestly stayed stagnant in what I've seen over the years. That should not be the case, especially since we know Riot grows their company by leaps and bounds each year. The commercialism is very apparent with the constant releases of skins, video content, and other revenue funnels.  Yet the priority of keeping quality of life good in-game really isn't there. I have taken a sample-size of data over the last week of playing and throughout about 11 out of 29 games there was a player that either intentionally fed, trolled, or rage quit (this number does not include toxic players). These were all ranked games and a little more frequent than 1 in 3 games had someone directly ruining the game on either my team or the other team. How have we allowed this to happen and why do players think its okay to do this? I don't have the answers. I just wanted to share you guys what I've noticed and I strongly feel we as a community need to take a stand an urge Riot to do more in the way of removing this type of behavior from the game. Quite honestly I think the reason feel they can do this and have no problem doing it is the fact that it is easier to get away with in the current state of the player-behavior report system and the way it works. It seems like the majority of player behavior cases are only identified through chat-log. So the first step in getting rid of more and more of these players that int or troll is to track in-game behavior movements and patterns over several games and learn to identify these players. Thanks for reading and hopefully this sparks any sort of community or Riot progress towards weeding-out all of these players trolling, feeding, and rage-quitting; or at least sparks further discussion. \r\n\r\nBest of luck on the Rift !","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T03:44:18.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just make sure you're reporting any toxicity/inting/feeding in the post game lobby. Reports *do* hold their weight, and without them we won't know anything went wrong. Always make sure you submit those reports or we can't take action.","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Swiper ","date":"2017-10-24T03:57:06.428+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I am very aware of the report system. This comment is almost completely off topic. I am suggesting a re-vamp of the system on how to remove these players and reform them. Clearly these people that choose to ruin games will stop at nothing with the way the current report system works. Your system primarily just relies on chat logs or very blatant behavior. Its those ones that are staying just barely under the radar of the current system that remain untouched running freely through games ruining game-play and morale.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-24T04:19:41.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Them staying under the radar is precisely the point. We can't directly change players attitudes, and we can't take any action on players without some kind of proof of what happened. The way you can provide proof is by hitting that report button. If nobody ever reports, of course they get off scott free!","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Swiper ","date":"2017-10-24T05:01:46.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reading the last sentence of what you just said.  Do you really think thats right? The tone in that comment makes it feel like you guys are fine with anyone trolling, oh, but as long as they go \"under the radar\" as you say. You guys made the \"upgrade\" from the tribunal a while back and should consider an update to player behavior management going forward. I'm honestly stunned with that comment, with the exclamation point at the end making it seem like you are elated people run around ruining games if no one reports them; what kind of message are you sending to your most passionate player base that only want to climb the ladder?","replies":[{"poster":"usul1202","date":"2017-10-24T19:53:24.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like you're ignoring what he says. they're looking for stuff, but they cant manually check every single interaction, so they ask for reports, so they can update. like the recent thread where a player threatened to int if someone didnt say a banned phrase. the player did, and got banned. came to the boards asking for help, got unbanned, and now tantrum is updating the system to find that kind of situation. Riot is a relatively small number of people, they cant predict every form of trolling, so they ask for reports and have the boards so players can contribute ideas. (and not just scream at them about how things are wrong, with no specifics or solutions)","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Swiper ","date":"2017-10-25T00:44:03.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I am really not ignoring what Broporo has said. Yes it is difficult to catch those that don't make it blatantly obvious they're ruining the integrity of the game. That is understandable. I guess you must not have read the latter half of my 3rd  paragraph but there I say \"I don't have all the answers\". I guess I left certain things out like the thing I am really wondering is will Player Behavior monitoring ever change in any way in the future for the better? And when can we expect these changes. Also, really not screaming at them which the equivalent of that on the internet is capital letters in succession which I did not use so not sure about that one either. The real take away from the post is the fact that feeders/trolls/rage-quitters are and always have been a major problem in League. It utterly ruins the game as well as wastes everyone time since it is not fun and doesn't improve anybodies skill. The fact that this has been a problem so consistently and for so-long, and according to my sample-size happens once in every three games, is pretty outrageous. This situation I just explained now makes me wonder if it will ever get better as long as the game exists and that is the true purpose of this post.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
