To see if it was just the one item or not I bought Rammus and then purchased his Guardian of the Sands skin which was at a 60% discount ( not a skin I wanted but it was the second-most desirable out of the ones there ) and found I was able to purchase it with no issues. I then tried to buy the Firecracker Jinx bundle again only to receive the same error and rebooting did not help the issue. Image below related...\nhttp://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s466/Epheamenne/League%20of%20Legends%20Bucket/LunarRevelShop2016Error_zpsyndx1fnj.png\n___\nI was really hoping to buy the Mafia Jinx/Jinx bundle before it was replaced in my shop by this even better bundle with the Firecracker Jinx skin. It seems as though I will sadly miss out. I&#039;ll submit a ticket now regarding this issue but I know Riot tends to respond faster to threads and hopefully they can come up with a fix before other people encounter similar issues.\n___\nIf Riot wants to recreate this bug, what happened with me was...\n\n* I logged on in the A.M. to find my shop had the skins, as shown [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/JkHV34sE-what-does-your-lunar-revel-2016-shop-look-like) ), on sale.\n\n* I logged out after a few games to return later only to find my shop items had changed; Firecracker Jinx/Jinx had replaced Mafia Jinx/Jinx at the same discounted price and Earthrune Skarner/Skarner had been replaced with Bloodmoon Akali/Akali at the same discounted price.\n\n* I decided to buy Firecracker Jinx before Jinx as a champion had been replaced and attempted to do so. I then found the error.\n\n* I then thought about trying to buy the Akali bundle but decided I didn&#039;t want to spend that much money on a champion I didn&#039;t want to play at this time. I instead decided to see if my shop was working by spending under 400RP on a Rammus skin. I was able to purchase the Rammus skin I didn&#039;t want but will be sure to enjoy given it actually looks pretty cool and Rammus will be my first tank champion since returning to the game.\n\n* I tried to buy the Jinx bundle again only to find it still was not working. I then rebooted and tried again only to face the same error.\n\n* I then waited 10 minutes and tried again to get the same error. I then filed this report; hopefully in the right place.\n\nThis is the best I can do as far as offering information on how to recreate my issue. I hope it allows you to find a fix before others face similar issues to myself.\n___\nBest regards,\nEpheamenne.\n___\n**UPDATE:**\nI decided to buy the Akali bundle ( I neither owned the champion or skin and it was one of the \"updated\" packages just like the Jinx bundle ) just to see if it would indeed work with her ( given she was the other updated champion bundle in my shop and I had yet to buy an assassin ) and found I was able to buy her. Having spent this RP does mean I won't be able to buy the Jinx bundle even if my issue is fixed ( I'm exactly 60 RP short now ) but figured the investment might be worthwhile given it would give me information to add onto this post that could possibly aid in finding some sort of fix.

The skin you want to buy is currently on sale in the normal store\n\nor\n\n2.) The champion of that skin is currently on sale in the normal store (this only applies if you don't own the champion)\n\nSo, in your specific case, you aren't able to buy Firecracker Jinx from you Lunar Revel shop because you don't own Jinx, and Jinx is currently 50% off in the normal store.\n\nThis is the same issue that people had with the personal Snowdown Shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Epheamenne","date":"2016-01-29T04:10:50.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really hope that isn't the case; if that is true I'd be unpleasantly surprised.

It is unfortunate that I had to learn this way but now I know for the future. Since this is indeed the case don't you feel the error message shown in my screen shot seems a bit out of place? I feel a different message letting players know that the item can't be bought in the special event shops ( given this also happened in Winter Snowdown according to Zombiemaster ) would be more appropriate. Maybe something like \"This Champion and/or Skin is already on sale in the standard shop; please buy it there.\"\n\nI'll reply to this post again once I get my ticket back and let you know how things turned out. Hopefully what happened here can somehow benefit the community. \n\nBest regards,\nEpheamenne.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-01-29T18:55:52.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey again! \n\nI'm not sure how the error messages are determined/put in for Your Lunar Revel Shop (I work on the skins, but the store is another team).

It just stated that they \"we are working hard to get it fixed\" and that they had no plans to announce any progress in that regard to avoid \"confusing/disappointing\" players like myself. I was then told that I should get the free promotional skins from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and given links to do so. It was about what I expected but hopefully the department the support agent was assigned to decides to eventually change that weird error message into something more sensical.\n\nThank you for everything Katey,\nEpheamenne.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epheamenne","date":"2016-01-30T03:23:40.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I just want an Annie skin without fire. I love Annie ( I did before I left League and now that I've returned and am starting over again I still do ) as a champion but I don't really think she's a good fit with fire. Brand is a great example of a fire-based champion who actually burn things while Annie does what, give people heat stroke? She clearly fails to burn them and that is why a skin with some other type of attack ( cosmic attacks, maybe water with Udyr being a giant seabear or shark, etc. ) would be a big hit: the skin would make more sense than the default champion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"0DESTROYERZ0","date":"2016-01-29T03:54:25.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only good deal in my lunar revel shop was 70% mafia jinx.

That said, I did buy two new skins and a champion ( Bloodmoon Akali/Akali and Guardian of the Sands Rammus ( only to find information about the bug Riot could use ) that I'll hopefully be able to enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"0DESTROYERZ0","date":"2016-01-29T04:10:11.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is my parents don't buy me rp, so I was gonna use this 1 app I have to get me 5 dollars worth of riot points. there is nothing else valuable in my lunar shop besides blood moon thresh, which I don't really have a taste for","replies":[]}]}]}]}
