These three game chat logs landed me a ban. You can infer what i had to deal with from the logs themselves. If my \"bannable content\" is a 1 out of 10, those with me in game were easily at an 8 or 9 out of 10.\r\n\r\nHow do I appeal? I didn't even curse. There has to be some method of disputing the auto-system of banning people. If this REALLY IS bannable language, does this mean I basically have to talk in game like a Care Bear, no matter how bad, or how much trolling, or how much feeding is going on?

Of course, it was on World of Warships, but it carries over into all MMO's.  The PERCEPTION, due to data protection laws, is that nothing gets done.  In all actuality, something MAY be done, but because no one hears about it directly, and no one sees it directly, the PERCEPTION is nothing happens.  I would, however, point to this forum specifically and say that PLENTY happens.  Whether or not that is a good happening depends on which side of the keyboard you're on.  Indeed, there is a large controversy over the interwebz at this time as to whether or not auto-management is a good thing and to what extent.  Would a mod care to weigh in on whether or not that video is worth posting?

It's a form of harassment/verbal abuse bullying to gang up on someone, regardless if they're being a toxic person. Needing to constantly tell people you're muting them does nothing, you literally feed the troll by saying that alone, and is also flaming. You don't NEED to type anything at all.
