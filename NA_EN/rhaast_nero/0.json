FIRST OF ALL %%% could be mean plenty of things SECOND I didn&#039;t insult, I didn&#039;t have any toxic behavior of any kind and the only chat log i got punish for is clear I only typed &quot;%%%&quot; and good bye , thats all i typed in that game so I think u should revert this and fix the automatic feedback beacuse like if u are going to suspend me 2 weeks for this after trying to be nice for the last 2 months and hoping to get honor back plus this means i cant get the end season reward which i sweat and spit blood for these last months , then u get scrubs all day that flame insult are still there with honor 5 , like be serious? I &#039;d actually expect this suspension to get deleted beacuse this honestly is the most stupid uinfair thing I&#039;ve ever seen. \r\nI have nothing to say but &quot; nice chat log suspension riot&quot;. \r\nI hope u can revert the situation beacuse this is amazingly stupid. \r\nWith this system i could simply play with all premade person and report the first guy typed something weird , he get automatic punished , thats just stupid , and thats what happened beacuse yes i got report for no reason ( beacuse i typed %%% ) from 3premade man . \r\nSo once again I expect a fix for my account suspension beacuse this is beyond stupid. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of what %%% could mean i would also attach this , got from an English Dictionary , so yes that&#039;s the worst stupid chat log punishment i&#039;ve ever seen i&#039;d like if u take care of it and might fix the situation beacuse like i said this is beyond stupid , and by the way those 2 definitions are only 2 out of plenty i&#039;ve found.","replies":[{"poster":"Chermorg","date":"2017-10-11T11:03:12.687+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":4,"body":"You used **hate speech**.
