First you have to disable the DVR feature as Targons Blade told. Afterwards you have to change some video settings ingame. Instead of \"Full Picture\" you have to take \"Borderless\" in the window mode. I am not sure whether this is the right description because I am not the best english speaker :D  but i hope you know what i mean. Now i have about 200 FPS and I think this is okay for a GTX 1060...","replies":[{"poster":"BlueEye","date":"2016-12-30T13:07:45.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for your help, but the problem is still there :I \nmaybe I talk with the support >.>","replies":[{"poster":"The Blue Jelly","date":"2016-12-30T14:37:00.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be G-Sync.

It is a bit better. I have now about 75FPS but it still drops sometimes to 40 drops, but it is better. I looked some youtube videos and i saw that i should have about 200-300 fps so it seems that there is still a problem. Do you have any other idea? \n\nWhat i tried is to uninstall the actual graphics driver for gtx1060 and just let Windows10 install the driver. With this graphic driver i have FPS betwenn 300 and 400. With this high fps it is hard lagging but when i limit it to 80 or 120 FPS it is really stable without lags. Maybe there is some problem with the NVIDIA graphics driver? \n\nI would be so thankful when you can help me. It is my new notebook and its sad that lol isnt working like it should. With ARK (really a challenge for graphic) i have absolutely no problem, so I don't know why LOL makes such problems..\n\nThank you for your help :)","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-12-28T21:48:13.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..
