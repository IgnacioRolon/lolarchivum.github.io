However you can get a sad black tire animation, when this occurs, me, as the owner of the skin, in game, can&#039;t see the tire animation but the gold chest animation, while my teammates can see the black tire animation.\r\nI can press B as many times as I want to check it and I can&#039;t manage to see the tire animation, but my friends do see it.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-08-01T23:10:26.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya! \n\nI just loaded up with him and I was able to get the tire recall animation to play while playing as Deep Terror Thresh.
