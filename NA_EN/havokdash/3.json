Lost a game because we were getting pressured in Bot lane. We asked jungle for help. And all WW would say is &quot;Soon&quot; (one of those &quot;jungle doesnt start till after 6&quot; players)\r\nWe struggle to hold onto bot lane and get pressured with no help from jungle. Bot lane is eventually lost. We are losing by double digits (something like 2 v 15). Bot lane is completely gone. \r\n\r\nAnd then our jungle pulls the self-rightous sh*t &quot;Face your shit&quot;\r\nrefusing to surrender and telling us to &quot;use the challenge&quot; \r\nMeanwhile he gets over 7 kills while the rest of the team barely hangs on or goes negative. And tells us we need to use this as &quot;a learning experience&quot; telling bot lane (which he never helped) we need to &quot;Face your shit&quot; as if it is our fault thier jungler ganked, they pressured, and yet ww never once came to help. And then when the score was around 6 v 23 and the enemy was knocking on our base. WW refused to surrender. In post game went on this moral speech about how us getting our ass kicked and wanting to accept when a match was lost was &quot;Defeatist&quot; and &quot;you need to learn how to handle yourself on your own&quot; &quot;I did this to teach you a lesson, to better yourself&quot; \r\n&quot;Handle yourself on your own&quot;? On a Team game? \r\nThats like playing a chess game where one side has all the pieces, but the other side has the Bishop and pawns missing &quot;Oh you have to learn to win this game on your own&quot; \r\n\r\nYeah its happening more and more. These people who are so convinced they are above thier team that they get to hand down &quot;challenges&quot; to thier teammates. Climb off your god damn High horse. Its not your place to dictate what challengers or &quot;learning experiences&quot; your team faces. \r\n\r\nRIOT needs to do something about stopping this &quot;Yolo Solo&quot; attitude. This idea that League is 5 SIngle players all on thier own, they just happen to be on the same match. That One player is superior to all the others. I am really getting sick of listening to these coddled children who thinks the whole world revolves around them. That rather than work as a team, the &#039;team&#039; is just there to prop THEM up. \r\n\r\nIf you dont understand how a team game works, and you just want to sit there and issue &#039;decrees&#039; to your team from on-high (because you are so far above your team, its not like they are your EQUALS or anything) Then get off a team game and go play a single player game, maybe you can go play checkers with yourself, that way you can have all the pieces to yourself and tell yourself just how AMAZING -YOU- are. \r\n\r\nAnd yeah, If I see you in game and you act like that,  I WILL let you die. Thats not me griefing at all, I am not like that. Thats me helping to teach you the Humility of defeat. :) So use it as a challenge. Good luck getting fed without a support to keep you alive.

As much as I TRY to think of this as a team game. There is no getting past that Riot just needs to Burn the summoners code. It is outdated, ignored. laughed at. Thought of as a joke. People are more concerned with how great they look solo and are happy to screw over the team for PERSONAL greed. As a support I have tried to get teamplay going when I see it, but more and more I am learning the only way to get anything done is to just let the team die and focus on yourself. I tried being a team player, apparently I was fooling myself. \nPeople are too greedy, self centered and wrapped up in how \"Totally OP\" they are. Sometimes goals intersect, but I am seeing the best way to win is to look at your team as disposable. Riot Even seems to push this idea with the whole \"Solo Carry\" notion. Where One player is ABOVE the rest, and everyone on the team thinks they are THAT player. SO they sit there and talk down to thier teammates, look down thier nose at thier \"Trash team\". \n\nI changed my goal, started going jax support, and started winning lane by ignoring my adc who often (rather than actually trying to win) is more concerned with throwing the biggest and loudest in-lane tantrum possible. \n(I had a lucian who threw a complete fit and abandoned lane because I, as support, had a whole...whopping...amazing......... 3 CS!. Yep he ditched his lane and ran mid because I had 3 minion kills) \nThey will kick and scream and swear, call me a troll and tell people to \"/all report the troll\" while the ignore minions and completely stop playing the game entirely because they cant control everyone and everything in the match. \nSo yeah, I am playing more solo, building my own builds. Playing my own strategies. WInning my own way, playing my own champs. \n\nI repeat: Burn the summoners code, its done its work, Now its just a relic laughed at by the new season of players and those who have played long enough to see the truth.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jo0o","date":"2018-01-14T12:16:37.481+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've died 15 times in bot lane, a gank isn't gonna help.

For one reason or another, you can't count on the jungler to win lane for you. \n\nLooking through your match history, I strongly suggest reading some guides on the champs you play. You seem to have wildly different builds in each game, and while improvisation in the face of different challenges is good, virtually all champs and roles have \"core\" item paths you'll want to follow. Doran's Ring is bad on supports, since the main point of the item is the mana return from killing creeps. Similarly, Relic Shield and its build path generally aren't used on ranged supports.

While your jungler could have done that its not their job to baby you. They need to farm and ward and help the other lanes. I will agree that you do need to learn how to hold your own they took it too far. However its not entirely their fault. Warding is your part as a support. If you dont take out enemy wards and or ward yourself so your jungle can sneek in and help you out that's not their fault its yours.  I will generally provide a good amount of vision for my top and mid and part of the bottom river. I expect the support to ward near their area. Because hell I main supports and that's what I do because I am closest and its my job to look after my adc (and myself) and warding is apart of that.  Its partly your fault that you got ganked. But its also your junglers fault if they are  not keeping the river warded and or keeping tabs on their jungler overall. \nI don't ask anymore out anyone than I would out of myself. \nAlso what time I choose to gank should be up to me. I might feel I need more items or I might need to get my ult first if the enemy has a tanky support because if I go in I am more of a liability and I will hurt your lane more because not only will they now be higher in cs but now they will also have gold from my death. \nThere is a cost benefit analysis when it comes to a gank. One wrong misstep can really fuck a lane over and or your team. \n\nYour jungler had a semi good point but his execution was terrible... leaving you high and dry was not a good idea but I don't think its what cost you the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mobile Phone","date":"2018-01-14T12:16:15.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: My bad thought u was on red team so i had the kill map flipped lmao mb about that, but both you and lucians lane deaths both look like from pushing up with no vison whatsoever. then the lane deaths which nothing to really say about that ","replies":[]}]}
