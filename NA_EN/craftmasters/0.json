But has anyone else gotten absolutely shafted by the new system so far? I just got my first level up reward, and instead of getting anything amazing or even any meaningful progress towards the next champion I want, I got shards for {{champion:32}} , {{champion:19}} and {{champion:55}} (the cheaper two I already own). So, between the 9 games I played since the update (two first wins of the day, and one bot game), I ended up with 180 Blue essence, and a champ shard I can take apart for another 630 if I want to say fuck it to getting a slightly cheaper champion (which seems to be the only point of this system). Honestly, I wouldn&#039;t mind it all if I could at least reroll shards into permanents still. Would give me a reason to actually keep the shitty two around.","replies":[]}
