I was so blind with excitement that I just instinctively picked the choice with green coloring, as green typical is a good thing. Is there anyway I can get this back? I feel like not having a second confirmation screen as well as the green coloring on the disenchantment makes it very easy to disenchantment a skin shard when very excited about it. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-07-21T15:09:34.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"There currently isn't a way to restore disenchanted content or additional confirmation windows beyond what's already present.  I know that you were excited for the Kitty Cat Katarina shard, and with luck you could find another!  The skin is also considered [Legacy](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins), so it's possible for the skin itself to return via the store as well.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDapperDoctor","date":"2016-07-22T01:39:07.341+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like I was robbed of the skin due to the coloring system and the single validation system. I hope this is fixed soon for others' sake as well as my own. Due to this, i feel like there should be a way to refund skin shards and other hextech items. If there is not one already, there should be a documented history similar to the store purchase history. It doesn't help that this was the first useful skin I could have had from hextech crafting. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. I can't hide my disappointment, but thanks anyways!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Leftish","date":"2017-09-30T21:25:09.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NERCRO!\nBut I just did the same thing.
