If I get a leaver buster for this I'm going to be upset. Like wtf like that should be simple. Add an option in the launcher like jeez. This is absolutely foolish.

Kinda hard to adjust your settings if you can't even *see* them. \n\nIf you navigate to your League default install directory, go into the Config folder, and then open the game.cfg file, you should be able to see two settings called \"Height= Width=\". Change those to match your current monitors resolution and you should be good to go. \n\nIf something goes wrong there and the config files don't seem to be working correctly anymore, feel free to delete them and that should force a reset!","replies":[{"poster":"15yrsOldKiddo","date":"2017-10-20T15:00:21.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what if the game.cfg file is completely empty?

Im not a riot support member, but if the config file is blank, you can simply hook up your desktop to 2 monitors of different resolution (your current monitor and your tv if you have an extra parallel-port to VGA cable). IF you have a laptop, even better! use an HDMI or VGA cable to hook up your laptop to a single monitor. ALT + TAV out of the current black screen game you are in, and press the F4 key. This should bring up several options from the side of your screen. select the \"Duplicate\" option. If you now return to your game, although the screen will be the size of the smaller monitor you have, leaving black bars on the sides, it WILL return to default proportions and you will be able to play again. Sorry, its a bit convoluted but it worked for me :)","replies":[]}]}
