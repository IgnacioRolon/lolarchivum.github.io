Pre-juggernaut rework and pre-DFG removal, maybe, but he currently has no AP scaling that I can see. \n\nThat point aside, I understand your point. The thing is, Fiddles can be reliable. An off-meta, opposite scaling build is super unreliable on the most part, since a large majority of them are not intended as the playstyle of the champion and therefore have much more fatal flaws compared to normal builds. The reason why they sometimes work is because the opposing team does not know those flaws. Fiddles doesn't really rely on his opponent not knowing how he works. It can definitely help him, but it isn't his only asset. Fiddles is a lot more like Amumu, succeeding more than usual because people don't play correctly, since they don't understand the champion's capabilities, but a decent champion in his own right.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-05-11T03:57:58.394+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champion updates are chosen based off how much value we think they'll add to the game, not based off whose turn it is.
