They don't take into account the role of champion, or the strengths and weaknesses of the champion, and win rates can fluctuate strangely. Some champions can have high win rates due to mostly being played by those who actually focused on trying to learn them, while others that are more popular have a massive amount of new players trying to play them and dragging the win rate down. Can't base much of your evidence from it.\n\nSecondly, your way of countering a champion is by counterpicking. Which is true for nearly every champion in the game, and attack speed slows affect every ADC to some degree. Kalista is hit as hard by it as you make it out to. Her passive on her W is great for amplifying your damage on your opponents, and her Rend applies descent damage and a pretty strong slow. She can kite even when affected by frozen heart with ease, especially when she has damage based on % of max hp of her target.\n\nYou didn't define her weaknesses from the weaknesses of most other champions, who also have more weaknesses on top of them. I have played her, and she isn't that difficult to play. I did it at 45 FPS. If you have any more weaknesses that you think make her not require a nerf, feel free to say them though. I'm sure there genuinely are some somewhere. But if you need to dig that deep for a single weakness that doesn't span across most of her entire role, then it still proves my point that she would require a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Vreivai","date":"2015-05-07T16:15:48.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=stuartk11,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=BN4sT4QU,comment-id=000400010000,timestamp=2015-05-06T20:52:50.330+0000)\n\n> Some champions can have high win rates due to mostly being played by those who actually focused on trying to learn them, while others that are more popular have a massive amount of new players trying to play them and dragging the win rate down.

The champions with the lowest win rates also tend to have some of the lowest pick rates. By your reasoning, they should be relatively high because mostly only people that main that champion are playing them. And while, yes, some champions do have a depressed win rate in normals when they're on the free rotation, there's usually not a mass of players who have never played them before playing them in solo queue, except maybe when the champions just dominated a professional game for the first time (and even then not anywhere near the degree you see in a champion's free week).\n\nGenerally, what affects a champion's solo queue win rate are three factors: champion strength (yes, I know, it's fucking surprising, but how strong a champion is actually does affect how often they win), ease of play and how well they fit into the solo queue meta. This is why Amumu perpetually has one of the highest win rates despite never being seen in the LCS: he's really easy to play and he's amazing in the chaotic teamfights that usually dominate solo queue.

Kalista needs to auto to have mobility. Let's see... fewer rend stacks (her main damage source), fewer jumps, fewer autos and she is short ranged enough to often be in the aura.

I could mention that some champions such as Vayne suffer hard from it aswell, and Twitch getting hit by the passive from his ultimate easily. Kalista can still kite a tank with frozen heart with much problem. I assure you.\n\nAlso, you say that my post had nothing in it. Did you read every point where I directly countered what you said? Like what you are supposed to do here. Win rates don't account for a single feature of the champion. Heimerdinger had a win rate of 59% not long ago. Does this make him OP?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"aperson1","date":"2015-05-06T21:25:21.957+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because a champ is frustrating to play against despite not being OP doesn't make them immune to changes; in fact, it necessitates them. That's why reworks exist. Nerfs, in the meantime, can reduce frustrating champions play-rates.\n\nIn all honesty, this is a really light nerf. Yeah maybe Kalista is no longer able to kite a Righteous Glory'd Volibear with Q on, but no other ADC could anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GuiltyGecko","date":"2015-05-06T20:41:32.903+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"So happy.

So like, that's a really inefficient item to build if you're worried about being kited by kalista.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariel the Cruel","date":"2015-05-06T23:55:01.769+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"*{checks boots}*\n\n{{item:3009}} Swifties.
