This week Riven is free. I think I already own her but I am not sure. That doesnt really matter. I picked riven top because all the other lanes were taken. I was going to go rek sai top because I was having fun with that but I saw that riven was free and decided to pick her. When I got into the game pretty much everyone just said &quot;WTF Riven&quot;. I thought it was a joke and just ignored them. It did tilt me a bit I guess but thats my own fault. The reason I am posting this is because throughout the rest of the game my team would not help me. Even after I lost lane ( which was my fault ). But it was obvious that they were trolling me. The other team would focus me and my team would just stand to the side and let me die. Things like that. I ended up feeding and everyone reported me. ( I think). Everyone said to report me and that was the end of it.\r\nI didnt post this for any specific reason. I just wanted to know what people thought about this and if this happens a lot to people when they pick riven. I know people hate riven but not this much?","replies":[]}
