Reaching lvl 15 allows me to fully customize my runes since i unlocked everything ( first and second path)\r\n\r\nSo i created the first rune and its ok.\r\n\r\nThen i clicked the \"create new\" button in order to customize the second one. I chose the \"first path\" but after that it seems i got a bugged window which shows all my runes ( preset+ the 1 customized before) with an \"x\" button on the top right. It seems like the pop-up for the rune creation is open but its kinda \"invisible\" exept for the \"x\" to close it.\r\n\r\nI did a manual restoration of the client through the settings but nothing happened.\r\n\r\nCan someone help, please?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T03:28:12.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's test something to see if this helps really quickly. Do a config reset using the steps below to see if that pushes through a reset (keep in mind you'll have to setup your runes again if this works as well as any custom keybinds and such).\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"MBkourin","date":"2018-01-23T11:39:12.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI followed the steps but it changes nothing.....","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2018-01-23T21:14:14.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm alrighty. Since a repair and config reset won't work, it must be something else messing up within the client.
