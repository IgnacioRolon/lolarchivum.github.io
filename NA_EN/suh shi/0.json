BUT FOR REAL, i want to do other things while people do their dumb bans. I have lost 20 lp total now just from it not popping up and me being habit tabbed out in champ select. Please, hotfix this and make the champ select actually pop up when it is your turn to do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Lemons22","date":"2016-01-16T09:11:10.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you know?
