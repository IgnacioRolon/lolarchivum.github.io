[Logs and context included.]","subforum":"Player Behavior","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"There are many &quot;I was unjustly banned&quot; posts on the forums. This is similar, minus two things. FIrst, I was chat banned, not actually banned, and two,  I have my chat logs for you to analyze. I added small sections of context and explanation for the logs to provide an insight into my thought process.\n\nI would like some other opinions from the boards about the severity of my comments. Furthermore, I would like to hear your opinions on whether they are justified. If they are not, please explain to me why, and offer some ways to improve.\n\nI do not want to become permabanned, as I have invested quite a lot into this game. Hence, I ask for your input.\n\nI feel as if a chat ban for one bad game I had on a bad day (school is immensely stressful) is worthy of ruining my honor progression and restricting chat. I provided some insight into my opinions in those small comments under the sections of chat logs.\n\nFinally, I was considering putting a ticket into riot support concerning this chat ban and its reprocussions. Please inform me if I should or should not do this.\n\n\nGame 1\nLeviathanTQ: lee\nLeviathanTQ: i have no manna\nLeviathanTQ: it has 6 health\nLeviathanTQ: and you fucking herald\n\n--- This was me being frustrated at Lee for  using herald and starting a fight when the tower literally had 6 HP and I had under 10% mana. This does not break the rules because the swearing is not being used in a derogatory context such as &quot;fuckhead&quot;. Moderate swearing is allowed, as per the rules.\n\nLeviathanTQ: dont ever be alone\nLeviathanTQ: please\nLeviathanTQ: stay with ztra at all times\nLeviathanTQ: or galio\nLeviathanTQ: JHIN\nLeviathanTQ: STOP BEING ALONE\nLeviathanTQ: Youll never die if youre with someone\n\n-------This is me telling my ADC to stick with someone because the other team had a fed Zed. He repeatedly was trying to solo split and was refusing to listen. The capital, &quot;JHIN. STOP BEING ALONE&quot; was timed about 5 minutes after I first asked kindly and politely. Keep in mind refusing to communicate is a bannable offense.\n\nLeviathanTQ: says you?\nLeviathanTQ: lmao\nLeviathanTQ: fortnite is bad PUBG\n\nLeviathanTQ: ZYRA\nLeviathanTQ: DO SOMEHTING\nLeviathanTQ: OTHER THAN WALKING\n------- This was directed at my teammate that literally watched me die whilst having full mana, health, and ultimate ready when the fight was in our favor.\n\nLeviathanTQ: ff?\nLeviathanTQ: get ready to contest baron\nLeviathanTQ: STOP FRONTLINING\nLeviathanTQ: JHIN\nLeviathanTQ: BACK THE FUCK OFF\n\n----There are a few things to note here. FIrst, the &quot;ff&quot; was in all chat, so it was not directed towards my team nor was toxic in any way. Second, Jhin repeatedly walked directly into the enemy team on the front line, and I was pinging him at first to back off. He did not listen at all to the pings (again, I cite the failure to communicate being a bannable offense) so I had to get his attention in chat. Again, note that moderate swearing not directed at someone in a derogatory way is allowed per the rules.\n\nLeviathanTQ: BARON\nLeviathanTQ: BAROIN\nLeviathanTQ: you two fucking suck\nLeviathanTQ: honestly\nLeviathanTQ: worst fucking botlane I have had all day\nLeviathanTQ: fucking splitting top\nLeviathanTQ: when there IS A BARON UP\nLeviathanTQ: YES YOU WERE WITH JHIN\nLeviathanTQ: I WAS PINGING AND SAYING BARON FOR LIKE 40 SECONDS UNTIL YOU FUKCING LISTENED\n\n--- This is the most controversial part of the chat logs. It looks bad on the surface, but please allow some context. I was calling for baron because the enemy team had 3 bot, and our Jhin and Zyra were topside alongside with me. This was the perfect baron opportunity. Per usual, I started pinging help at baron, but both Zyra and Jhin refused to listen. So again, I had to take to chat to get their attention. This proved catastrophic, as they did not come until it was too late and then Baron was stolen from us. That is where I said they sucked. After that, Zyra denied being top lane, to which I replied she was there with Jhin the whole time for an extended period of time.\n--- Now I admit, it was an insult at their in-game performance, but please keep in mind the context and the fact that it was an isolated incident. I immediately regretted the decision, and I knew I was starting to get too heated, so I toned it down and became constructive to make up for my behavior there, as shown in the next segment.\n\nLeviathanTQ: I want ot win this game\nLeviathanTQ: So please listen to us\nLeviathanTQ: defend hard\nLeviathanTQ: dont overerxtned\nLeviathanTQ: JHIN\nLeviathanTQ: nice flas\nLeviathanTQ: flash on F?\nLeviathanTQ: keep defending\nLeviathanTQ: dont overextend\n\n---- Here, I was constructive and told them I wanted to win the game just like them, and if they also wanted to win, they should listen to what I and my duo partner were saying (he was saying the same things as I, I don&#039;t have his chat logs, though.) Note the part about the flash was directed towards the opposing team in all chat as a joke and as friendly banter, not toxicity or flame in any manner.\n--- My realization that I was being toxic and decision to start being constructive instead is evidence towards an inital knee-jerk reaction and then reform. Thus, it is only fair that my previous actions be discounted when it comes to whether this was ban worthy.\n\nLeviathanTQ: Look at your fucking map\nLeviathanTQ: when you pslit\nLeviathanTQ: split\nLeviathanTQ: Lee\nLeviathanTQ: what the fuck are you doing\n\n-- Lee started to intentionally feed in the bot lane. He would knowingly afk push the lane into 3 opposing enemies. He did this two or three times in the span of 5 minutes. This was clear intentionally feeding and I was, justifiably, upset.\n\nLeviathanTQ: everyone on this team sucks\nLeviathanTQ: not afk you fuckingdumbass\nLeviathanTQ: reprted\nLeviathanTQ: report my jungler for being toxic please\n\n--- This is the second controversial part of the logs. Again, allow for some context. The &quot;everyone sucks&quot; comment was stated in all chat after my team lost a 4v2 without me (in their favor). This is my second questionable statement in the game. I do not have an explanation to excuse this incident, but I urge you to look at the greater picture and think, &quot;is that phrase alone worthy of chat restriction?&quot;\n\n--- After that, Lee started to hardcore insult me, calling me names along the lines of &quot;fucking dick&quot; and &quot;douche&quot;. I am not sure of the language exactly but they were obscenities directed at me. That is where the &quot;reported&quot; comments in all chat come into play.\n\nLeviathanTQ: can we stop focusing the tanks\nLeviathanTQ: kill cait, brand, and zed need to die\n\n-- More constructive, team playing shotcalling.\n\nLeviathanTQ: nj\nLeviathanTQ: I literally said gj\nLeviathanTQ: asshole\nLeviathanTQ: reported :)\n\n--- Before this point, I felt bad at my actions. I knew my sour emotions had gotten the best of me, and I tried to make up for it again by complimenting Lee after he got a pick on the other adc. I said &quot;nj&quot; to him after he got the kill. Then, being the rude person that he was, replied to me with an obscene insult, &quot;fuck you&quot; was the wording I believe. That was completely uncalled for. I had literally complimented him, trying to raise his spirits, and he insulted me. He also said, &quot;reported. Enjoy your ban :)&quot; in the chat, so that is where my smiley face came from.\n\nLeviathanTQ: defed hard\nLeviathanTQ: dont leave base\nLeviathanTQ: jhin\nLeviathanTQ: what did I just say\nLeviathanTQ: DONT LEAVE BASE\n\n--- More constructive shotcalling towards the whole team. I was trying to &quot;play to win,&quot; as the honor description states. The Jhin remarks were towards my adc who, again, refused at all costs to listen to my team&#039;s pings. He was halfway down the botlane when we had super minions in our base and we were pinging for help. Again, refusing to communicate and work together is a bannable offense.\n\nLeviathanTQ: this team makes me want to fuckign die\nLeviathanTQ: honestly no macro play\n\n--- These were stated as our nexus was being merked. This is a very common practice and is not severe enough to constitute penalty. Again, swearing in moderation that is not directed as an insult is allowed.","replies":[{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2018-03-29T05:43:50.776+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">LeviathanTQ: you two fucking suck\nLeviathanTQ: honestly\nLeviathanTQ: worst fucking botlane I have had all day\n...\nLeviathanTQ: everyone on this team sucks\nLeviathanTQ: not afk you fuckingdumbass\nLeviathanTQ: reprted\nLeviathanTQ: report my jungler for being toxic please\n...\nLeviathanTQ: asshole\nLeviathanTQ: reported :)\n\nNo. The context doesn't matter here.

You'll notice it encourages positive team communication, but doesn't require it. The sort of communication you were using there was not really positive, encouraging, team-building communication, but rather leaned more towards blaming people or telling them what to do -- I can reasonably see why someone would not want to engage you in conversation.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LeviathanTQ","date":"2018-03-29T13:50:40.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Djinn,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ei9Hq6lO,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-03-29T12:30:18.013+0000)\n>\n> This is actually a bit more borderline than you think, as you&#x27;re using it to emphasize the negativity and stupidity of his action.

Isn't that a little extreme? I understand toxicity shouldn't be in the game, but a few lines of frustration directed at someone who is actively ignoring the needs of the team AND was being insulting towards me in a single game? Say one negative thing about someone and that justifies a penalty? If that is the case, then I seriously think the system is too harsh, especially considering the punishment system is entirely automated and does not take context into account.","replies":[{"poster":"The Djinn","date":"2018-03-29T15:16:43.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LeviathanTQ,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=Ei9Hq6lO,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-03-29T13:50:40.440+0000)If I had typed nothing else other than that last quote you had, that that would be justifiable for a ban?
