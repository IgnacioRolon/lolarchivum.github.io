After stunning a target with Tongue Lash, their stacks of An Acquired Taste are reset\n2.) After Tahm spits out an enemy champion, that champion has a debuff (maybe called Unsavory or something?)for 4-ish seconds. This debuff prevents stacks of An Acquired Taste from being applied, and makes Tongue Lash's slow decay over the duration. \n\nIt's punishing enough to be caught by Tahm's Devour, but to be perpetually in his grasps is unfair. I think my proposed changes would give Tahm's enemies some breathing room after he's caught them.","replies":[{"poster":"HaugheyPuck99","date":"2015-11-20T19:21:53.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see where you're going with that first suggestion, but that would hurt his kit waaay too much. Usually you have to use the stun to be able to catch up and eat someone after you got the stacks on them, but having to reapply the stacks again? That's hitting someone 6 times before you can eat them.  And if he decides not to use his Q for the stun when chasing someone to eat them, then that just adds a penalty to him for getting max stacks on someone because it discourages him from using his only ranged ability.\n\nI like your 2nd idea though.","replies":[{"poster":"Valexfor","date":"2015-11-20T21:23:42.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think his first point is actually quite good, as Tahm, you shouldn't use the stun to eat the enemy, that lacks counterplay since the stun is so easy to land, you should instead use the slow (it's more than strong enough) to apply the 2nd stack and the hit and devour, that would have soem counterplay since the devour is a point and click skill. The problem with Tahm is that his kit is just an unstoppable chain, unliky other champs with similiarly empowered skills, he doesn't need to choose between which one he wants to use, he can just use both of them. If he would have to get either the stun or the devour, he would be way more balanced and fair.\n\nThat said, you are correct too in that during the stun, you won't be able to apply again the 3 stacks before the enemy can escape, you usually will have the time to hit him twice then he would bea able to get out of range if he's good and, while later in the game you would have q off cd or maybe be able to stack him thanks to the bonus AS, early game it might be a bit frustrating to see an enemy escape with 3 stacks, but that would still be unable to justify the ability to chain stun + devour, since that doesn't have any counterplay and qss isn't an acceptable counterplay by itself (like for any champion that's countered by it).","replies":[{"poster":"HaugheyPuck99","date":"2015-12-04T15:51:17.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, being unable to apply the 3 stacks again most of the time is why I think consuming them would be a bit too heavy of a nerf.

I saw one suggestion by a Rioter (can't remember who) that said maybe just make it so that he doesn't get the shield on his E until the end of the animation.
