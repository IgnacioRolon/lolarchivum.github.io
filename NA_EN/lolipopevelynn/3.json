Shouldn't you be messing with the CDR or the mana restore mechanic instead?\n\nThe CDR and the mana restore are both functioning competently, and they would be hard to adjust in small increments. We don't have to target them just out of principle. The AD is just as important to the item's functionality, and it is too low for the item to do its job. The item can get low amounts of AD as a small improvement, and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\n>Also, have you considered that maybe the Ghostblade rush is stronger, not because the item is better but because the component is better?\n\nBoth are true. Ghostblade is a superior item when it is completed, and it has a better buildup. It has everything going for it but 4-6 item scaling. That justifies a nerf, and the item's cost-efficiency when completed is a perfectly reasonable target.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashen Rider","date":"2016-06-07T22:57:00.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still use the two armor buff to J4 from last year as a meme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Defended","date":"2016-06-07T21:34:10.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=frVmRo4K,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-07T20:53:41.853+0000)\n>\n> We think Ghostblade&#x27;s a bit strong in terms of raw stats and IE/ER are a bit weak.

The components are just better, giving you more gold efficiency. And the +20 armor pen is just better early-mid game because Last Whisperer isn't a mid game item anymore, so Ghostblade is just simply a better option. The meta is very mid-game right now, making crit less effective. For critical strike to be worth getting, you need about 50-75% crit, and enough attack speed and attack damage to make it impactful, which you just can't get enough early. The armor pen on Ghostblade is also amazing on adc's considering most ad's only have around 40 armor depending on runes. If you want to push IE as a more popular item, then you need to make the crit more meaningful by either giving it more crit, or more damage, and 5 ad just isn't enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HadesBlades","date":"2016-06-07T21:10:08.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=frVmRo4K,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-07T20:53:41.853+0000)\n>\n> We think Ghostblade&#x27;s a bit strong in terms of raw stats and IE/ER are a bit weak.
