You only get the full armor effect against enemy targets that are level 18, meaning its going to take atleast 30-40+ mins to get the full effect, and this is assuming the game is even. At that point people are stacking resistances...\n\nEven against an ADC and with two lethality items you are piercing 40 of the 60 armor he has from GA ALONE. Now add the armor he gets from runes/masteries, abilities, lvl scaling, and etc. Its not that broken of an item...","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-02-05T01:30:50.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What part of \"15 lethality is still 10 armor pen at level 1\" do you not understand?\n\nDuskblade had 10 armor pen.

Maybe not read? Riot specifically said IN PATCH NOTES that 10 lethality = 6 armor pen lvl 1 and scales to 10 at lvl 18. its still going to scale to 15 armor pen at lvl 18 if its 15 lethality. \n\n\nREGARDLESS of how you look at it, lethality is a BLATANTLY NERF compared to old armor pen until lvl 18. And at lvl 18 its a non factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Pnakotic","date":"2017-02-05T03:58:54.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.veldin.com/index.php/lethality","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Skill Tank","date":"2017-02-04T17:04:04.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, new precision actually grants much more armor penetration at lvl 1 than season 6 precision, so in new patch precision + lethality marks actually does give about the same armor penetration as season 6 flat armor penetration marks + lethality.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-02-04T16:40:33.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"MF is a bad example because you can't really counter her ult with items...","replies":[{"poster":"singiel38","date":"2017-02-04T16:42:36.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you can stun her.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreadlocks","date":"2017-02-04T16:50:48.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still a bad example for this guy's post.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SaltyKracka","date":"2017-02-05T03:15:16.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's _getting_ fed as fuck because Lethality's a broken-ass snowball stat.","replies":[{"poster":"The Great Divide","date":"2017-02-10T06:42:23.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And because Miss Fortune's kit in general isn't terribly healthy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Salron","date":"2017-02-10T07:05:42.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Duskblade gave 10 armor pen from level 1 to 18\nNew Duskblade gives 15 Lethality, 60% of 15 is roughly 10, so you get 10 armor pen at level 1, scaling up to 15 pen at level 18\n\nNow factor in the fact that by the time you finish the item, your enemies will be above level 1\nNew Duskblade effectively gives more pen in all scenarios, so quit talking out of your ass\n\nThere is also far more lethality in the game than there was armor pen if we're talking raw numbers\n\nOLD:\n20 pen ghostblade\n10 pen duskblade\n19 pen from runes\n3 from masteries\n52 total\n\nNEW:\n20 lethality Ghostblade\n15 lethality duskblade\n15 lethality edge of night\n24 lethality runes\n8.5 lethality masteries\n82.5 lethality total\n\n60% of 82.5 is 49.5\nYou dont finish armor pen items when enemies are level 1\nlethality is an objectively better stat at all stages of the game","replies":[{"poster":"The Lost Marbles","date":"2017-02-10T07:30:43.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yàsuò,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=gzj9shdQ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-02-10T07:05:42.568+0000)\n> \n> OLD:\n> 3 from masteries\n> \n> NEW:\n> 8.5 lethality masteries\n\nPrecision gave 3 + (0.3 x Level) armor penetration, not just 3 flat, which is 8.4 at level 18.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King of Mongoose","date":"2017-02-10T07:16:55.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver 4 stop talking, lethality is viable now","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lost Marbles","date":"2017-02-10T07:15:16.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duskblade is the only outlier here, to my knowledge. _(Well, that and Edge of Night existing.)_\n\nPrecision seems to be roughly the same values, and even if it does give a bit more lethality than it would've given flat armor pen, it's not a huge enough difference to cause this big a fuss.\n\nLethality reds grant 1.6 Lethality.
