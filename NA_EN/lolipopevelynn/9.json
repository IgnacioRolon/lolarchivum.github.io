We were behind for most of the match, except for dragons. All they wanted to do was TDM mid. And despite the other team losing bot lane hard, they nearly won the match several times because they had a fed Riven and a fed Annie thx to Jax and Viktor.\n\nIn team fights we would just get destroyed because of all the CC (Riven, Annie, Maokai, and Morgana is a shit ton of CC). But they just couldn't comprehend that and screamed about how I wasn't helping and were going to report me, despite the fact that ever time we tried to team fight it was just a route.\n\nSo I muted them all and went to split push. This was the 44 minute mark. Elise wrecks towers with maxed W btw. We're talking Jinx-level tower destruction. I pushed in top, then mid, then bot, and then got a double kill in their jungle, which forced the rest of their team to come bot, allowing my team (what was left of it because half of them were dead again) to finish. 8 minutes. That's how long it took me to push all 3 lanes and win the game.\n\nAnd then I got flamed in post game chat by our shit-tier Jax that fed Riven on how Elise can't split push or wave clear. Fact: I had more CS than anyone in the entire game. I had the 2nd highest gold count in that game. I had the least deaths in the game. Got an S rating.\n\nIn bronze your team cannot be counted on to do anything like ward, apply map pressure, help secure objectives, just hold their lane, or even have any idea how any particular champ does or does not work well. Dragon may as well not exist for many teams. You can get a Penta and they'll just sit in lane farming instead of secure Dragon or Baron. And this is all assuming you don't get an intentional feeder, afker, rager, disconnect, etc.\n\nSo yeah. If your team doesn't know what they are doing and just want to TDM vs a fed Riven supported by never-ending hard CC, fuck them. Go gates. If you're winnig the team fights, then sure you can push mid as a group.
