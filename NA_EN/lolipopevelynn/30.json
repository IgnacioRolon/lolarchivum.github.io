He can heal off you and keep you under the tower. \nHe'll Q you than E you so you can't hit him again and finally w to stop you from running out.\n\n\nForce him to miss his Q so he'll push lane, he's easy as hell to gank.  Hit and run style of game play pisses him off,  Gank him if he over extends.\n\nIf you chase low health Darius into a bush he's waiting for his Q to get off Cool down to heal back up and turn it around, stay away from the bush and try to use a skill shot into it if you can instead.\n\n\nHis Passive is op, don't try to all in him at level 1 I can't tell you how many times people thought they could win because they had ignite.\n\nThat +5 stack of bleed is no joke that's 45 damage a sec for 5 secs that gets refreshed every time he hits you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bulletproof Car","date":"2015-09-06T08:21:15.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i love any champ that counters riven","replies":[]},{"poster":"BattleOxe","date":"2015-09-06T08:19:45.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people don't now how to play vs him and let him stack passive 5 times.
