Fizz already his his fucking Q and E to get to targets and kass has a flash on a 1.7 sec CD.... as a matter a fact, those passives would be so much better on a melee that actually needs it like {{champion:36}}{{champion:32}}{{champion:14}} , you know, the champs that DONT have 600000 dashes and jumps. and ya, im also talking about {{champion:157}} {{item:3046}} . can dash through minions and rush PD and pass through units even further. its ridiculous when you really think about it. meanwhile im force to ult on {{champion:14}} just to get passed a 500 acre long minion wall.

Trying to run away from a {{champion:91}} as {{champion:61}} just to get betrayed by your own allied minions blocking your path.\n\nMinions: \"hmm, ori wants to run from that talon guys, should we move out the way? what do you think boss?\"\n{{champion:45}} \"nah, let her die\"\nMinions: \"oki!\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hhaavviikk","date":"2017-04-10T16:23:58.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"losing top lane because your fat champions freaks out trying to pass through 4 minions walking forth and back spazzing it, the feels","replies":[]}]}
