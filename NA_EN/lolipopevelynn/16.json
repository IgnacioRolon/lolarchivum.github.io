Her shots aren't so easy to land, but with practice (and hopefully less than 200 ping), you'll get a hang of it.\n\nMany people banned her because people regularly ban newly released champions, as they either don't want to vs something they're not familiar with, or they don't want someone who is inexperienced in the champ to try it out for the first time in their match. Lots of people want to play her, because newly released champs often feel over powered on release, and because she's paired with a lovely 1000 experience mission (which I have still yet to complete lol).","replies":[{"poster":"Audiomancy","date":"2017-12-13T16:48:17.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"So... you're upset because a burst mage burst you down?","replies":[{"poster":"DoktorKaiser","date":"2017-12-13T20:17:38.919+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Burst mages burst with their ultimate not with a 2 second cooldown ability...","replies":[{"poster":"Audiomancy","date":"2017-12-14T04:21:08.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, you can get about 8 seconds on {{champion:99}}'s.
