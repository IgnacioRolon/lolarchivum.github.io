Sure you can say that the look wasn't 100% accurate , but, I mean, Annie is a really REALLY old champion who hasn't really ever had a fidelity update and still has some of the cartoonist design of the oldest characters that doesn't entirely fit into the new universe.\n\nIt's like when you watch a movie remaking a show or book or whatever that was set a few decades ago and the new actor and character design don't match the original, but the heart of the character is the same.  After a short time you can just look past the differences and you DO see the new character as being the same character.

I totally think a vu would totally be epic, although you could probably get away with just changing the base skin (making a it into \"traditional Annie\") and I'd probably still change some elements from the new cinematic, which color wise is quite grounded in reality and might look bland on the rift. I'd try giving her outfit some nods to the old look while updating it, like maybe bring in the stripped socks from the \"a twist of fate\" cinematic, or add a backpack or something to what's in the new cinematic, etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"rtbf225618241","date":"2018-02-02T23:26:42.157+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not to mention that Annie isn't a sadistic maniac who loves roasting people alive.
