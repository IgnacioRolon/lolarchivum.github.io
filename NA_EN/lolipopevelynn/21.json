Now those items atöeast delay(often even deny) the burst so they can use the lifesteal even vs burst.(themn surviveing the burst is not only because of the lifesteal-items anti burst mechanics, they just get soooo much protection shoved up their ass from everythere, it's rediculous)\n\nOverall, Lifesteal is a kinda bullshit mechanic, as it increases survivabillity based on DPS, so if you deal more damage, you also get harder to kill. This causes it to be a very snowbally stat that also only feels good on champs that can reliably get really high dps.\n\nI hope they try replaceing it with effects similar to current warlord, maybe even with less scaleing, so tanky champs with less damage can make use of it aswell while dps champs don't hyperscale with it.\n\nBut as it looks, Riot just takes a comblicated root and instead of getting rid of GW **and balanceing lifesteal in a scenario where it can't be easily reduced by 40%**, they add GW to thornmail. THen probably everyone will get thornmail to deal with the absurd lifesteal, which causes riot to nerf thornmail 'cause it crowds out other choices' and lifesteal once again is an issue, just that we have another hardcounter items vs the likes of Aatrox that are intendet to drainrank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tusutaki","date":"2017-06-29T15:31:14.447+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lifesteal is good because the defensive items got gutted.
