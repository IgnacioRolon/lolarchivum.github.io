Diana's biggest weaknesses are swain Annie and vlads pretty annoying too. She is tragic pre-6.

I'm a level 5 Diana and usually beat the crap out of Zed.

My whole point is, it really doesn't matter, I'm just explaining the fact that she's NOT over powered... At all.\n\nNo it has her listed as Fighter / Mage. What makes her a fighter you ask? Let's compare her to a very popular fighter {{champion:24}}. They both have empowered autos on their 3rd attack. Jax has leap strike which jumps to an enemy and deals damage, sound familiar? His ulti increases his magic resist and armor and Diana has a shield in place of that. Jax has a aoe stun, Diana has a aoe slow / knockup. Neither one of them have escapes if they commit with their gap closer and they want to get off as many autos as possible. \n\nNow let's compare {{champion:131}} to an assassin that's closest to her... {{champion:245}}. Now Ekko also has an empowered 3rd auto but only if he's attacking the exact same target for all 3 attacks but it then goes on cooldown for a few seconds. Basically saying \"don't stay and keep autoing\". Unlike Diana and Jax he wants to nuke a SINGLE TARGET with his passive and not just try to get off multiple autos on anyone around him. He has 2 escapes helping him get in and out of fights pretty easily after he's blown up his target and even has a slow. Now Ekko does have a shield but its also associated with his stun. If he doesn't get the stun off he can't sit in a fight like {{champion:24}} and {{champion:131}} can. That's why they are Fighters, they go into a fight and FIGHT. They don't leave after they blow 1 person up. Ekko is an assassin, he goes in blows someone up and then has the means of getting out of there. He has to wait for all his cooldowns to deal damage while the FIGHTERS, don't.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SnugglePuggle94","date":"2015-10-25T23:44:21.917+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"No. She is one of the most balanced in the game right now.

Garen? Just because a champion can build tanky and do some damage doesn't mean they're op. Tbh they probably snowballed and got fed. I play Diana religiously as my #1 main and all you have to do is deny her and shut her down trust me cause I've been in those game where I go 1/6 against my lane opponent because they realize the importance of stopping Diana early game","replies":[]},{"poster":"TyroneWatermelon","date":"2015-10-26T15:38:48.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't think she is too overpowered,but the skill she takes to play is garen tier","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Scott Free ","date":"2015-10-26T17:17:02.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats just dishonest and you know it.
