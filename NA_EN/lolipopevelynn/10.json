There is no evidence that Whistler was in any danger - strolling along, whistling as he goes after he shot a guy shows he wasnt in fear of the streets of Zaun. \n\nEkko had to make a choice - revenge or be at his dying friends side. he chose the latter, though he was fully capable of choosing the former. he would not be unsuccessful in his revenge if he decided to seek it, but he knew he would be unsuccessful in saving his friend. he consciously made the decision not to seek revenge, running past the Whistler one last time (knowing full well that Whistler shot his friend) to get to his friend. \n\nthe decisions you make define you as a person. you can have all the best thoughts in your head, but if you act opposite to them you still arent a moral character. Ekko isnt perfect; he has impulses for both loyalty and vengeance. but when he can only choose one, he chooses loyalty. THATS his merit. he makes the honorable decision when push comes to shove. His friend was going to die anyway, but those last 60 seconds by his side were more important to him than taking revenge on the person who did it.","replies":[{"poster":"Conncept","date":"2015-05-23T00:31:10.481+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your first point is your own assumption, and a completely misinformed one at that.  There is no federal law stating any such thing, because according to the constitution, such laws fall under the rights of the state governments, so if any such law did exist, it would be declared null and void as being unconstitutional.  What we do have are state laws concerning the issue, and they vary from state to state, and in fact, half the states have laws specifically stating that you are permitted to defend your person, property, and those around you from any amount of harm to the point of permitting deadly force.  And the majority of the remainder allow for use of deadly force, barring you have no other means of defense or escape. And its a statistical fact that those states have both lower crime and lower rates of fatalities from gun violence.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter if Whistler was in any real danger for two reasons.  First he was dealing with an unknown, as soon as he perceived any amount of danger he had the right to defend himself, and his perception were more than reasonable considering the kid was trying to steal a firearm off him, that the kid could have immediately used on him. Was the whistler supposed to wait to see if the kid had a weapon or intended to use his, in which case, he would have been the one shot and killed?  That is a completely ridiculous expectation of someone who is in a situation where they may lose their life to a mere moments hesitation.\n\nSecond, he did not instigate the situation, to say whistler is responsible is victim blaming, the person responsible for the danger, and therefore the end result of that danger, was the kid.  By stealing he directly and deliberately created the situation in which the confrontation involving the firearm was a possibility.  And while it is sad that he suffered consequences much heavier than fit his crime, those consequences are still his own fault, he had the first opportunity, ability, and principle responsibility to prevent what happened, and he didn't.  Ideally he should have only suffered a consequence befitting his crime, but the only way such 'fairness' of punishment befitting crime, is within a system of law and order, which didn't apply because the kid was working outside that system.  If we can say anyone killed anyone, that kid killed himself; or one could make the argument that, being a child, those responsible for him did so, in this case being Ekko.\n\nAnd that isn't what happened in the comic from what I saw, his Z-Drive was damaged by the firearm, forcing Ekko to make that decision. Had his ZDrive not been damaged and he had just been able to kill the man quickly, Ekko appeared to have every intention of killing the whistler just for defending himself against his friend.\n\nBy decision or intention, Ekko appears to be nothing but a selfish violent thug who won't accept or deal with the consequences of his actions, not unlike real world gang members.  He may be sentimental and caring towards his own, but doing what is right by those you care for and no one else is a bare pittance of morality.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-05-23T04:25:41.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"you are completely wrong on the first point. I agree that there is no federal law dictating this, because criminal codes are the states jurisdiction. However, my statement is correct because no state allows the use of deadly force **unless you are immediately threatened with the use of deadly force or serious bodily harm against you**. Its not an assumption. its a fact. if you wish to disprove me, please name me the state that allows the use of deadly force in response to anything less than a perceived threat to your body. No state would allow you to shoot a robber that poses no physical threat. \n\nThe \"stand your ground\" states allow the use of deadly force in any situation you are threatened with deadly force or serious bodily harm. The ones without the \"stand your ground\" laws allow the use of deadly force only when you are threatened with deadly force or serious bodily harm, **and** there is no reasonable alternative available to ensure your safety. \n\nTheres a slight exception inside your home, but thats irrelevant to the comic. \n\nAt the moment of the shooting, its hard to explain what would happen (legally) and what went down (in the comic). We just dont know. \n\nBut we do know how Whistler responds after he shoots the kid. You are correct - it doesnt matter if Whistler was in any real danger or not. However, his perception matters a lot - \"he got what was coming to him\" is different from \"i thought he was going to hurt me\". It also has to be a reasonable perception - Whister mentioned that the kid was trying to \"lift\" something off him and thats why he shot him; the kid didnt threaten Whistler to provoke the shooting. Finally, whistling as he was walking away after shooting the kid shows extreme amounts of disregard for human life, as well as his emotional state at the time; nonchalantly whistling as he was calmly walking away is different from freaking out and running away. \n\nIts funny you mention victim blaming, because the general sentiment of victim blaming is \"They got what they deserved\" or \"they were asking for it\". It seems to me you are victim-blaming the kid; \"those consequences are still his own fault, he had the first opportunity, ability, and principle responsibility to prevent what happened, and he didn't\" is EXACTLY what victim-blaming is. Who is the victim in the story - Whistler, who gets to walk away, or the kid, who is dead? \n\ni dont know where you got the idea that the kid was working outside the system of law. He was working in the system of law, just on the criminal side. If he got caught, he would go to jail (petty theft is still a misdemeanor, so < 1 year in jail). Thats still working in the system of the law - the law would punish the kid as it saw fit. Whistler was working outside of the law - killing someone over theft is VIGILANTE JUSTICE. Whistler was enacting his own justice, not waiting for the system. \n\nEkko, in the reality where he seeks vengence, was also operating in outside the system of law. But as i keep saying, on his last rewind, he decided not to seek vengence. . \n\nLastly, Ekko was hardly _forced_ to make a decision. He was given an ultimatum. We saw how easily he sought his revenge on Whistler before his Z Drive went off for the last time. But we also saw the kid, dying alone. Ekko, in his second to last run, had every intention of killing the Whistler. But in his last run - the one that actually counts, the one that cant be altered by his time machine, the one that everybody will remember - he doesnt kill Whistler. He chooses to be with his friend.\n\nAgain. Intentions dont mean anything if you dont act on them. You can have great intentions, but ignore them. You can have bad temptations, but ignore them. \n\n(and before you say he killed Whistler and then joined his friend, it took him 90+ attempts to get to his friend in 3 minutes. His friend was always dead by the 4 minute mark.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ebonmaw Dragon","date":"2015-05-23T06:53:49.584+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChaoticPinecone,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=oI1AYAh0,comment-id=00040000000000010001,timestamp=2015-05-23T04:25:41.345+0000)\n>\n> you are completely wrong on the first point.

Can you not learn for yourself? Incapable of reading or even doing a google search?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law\n\nThey are recent laws, but if you look up their history, courts have treated most self defense cases with similar precendence since the inception of our country, with the further you go back more and more states considering it implied under the right to bear arms.  State lawmakers just took the opportunity to move them from precedence to practical law to avoid any more things like the Ferguson trial.  \n\nAnd in those laws \"the individual honestly and reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary to prevent the imminent death, great bodily harm, or sexual assault of himself or another individual.\"\n\nDid you notice that the reasons for using deadly force do not end with preventing of imminent death?  You are ONLY required in the majority of states, to have a reasonable perception of danger, any danger, in order to use deadly force, you do not have to be in an equal amount of danger, you are permitted to protect yourself from any amount of danger by any means you have available to you, and are not required to run instead of defending yourself should that be an option.\n\nTry educating yourself instead of enforcing your opinion as law.  You are wrong, you have even been wrong, for the hundreds of years that self defense was treated as such prior to these laws being formally adopted.  This is a modern contrivance that didn't even require a law for our more practical predecessors, it was accepted as common sense, no one should be required to allow a person to endanger their life to the greatest degree, before being able to defend themselves or those around them.\n\nAnd don't childishly put words in my mouth, I never said he 'got what was coming to him', that implies he had morally done something equal to what happened to him, which you know just as well as I, that I specifically denied.  He did nothing to deserve being shot.  What I said, was that what happened to him was the direct result of a casual/effect relationship which he, before and more than anyone else, had the responsibility and the means to prevent, save perhaps the person who should have been taking care of him, Ekko.  Right had nothing to do with it one way or the other, the situation itself was wrong, and someone had to suffer the consequence, and the kid drew the short straw.\n\nIn addition to that, there is no logical connection between who did and did not suffer consequences and who was the victim.  You are appealing to emotion because you do not have any means to back up your claim in any logical manner.  There is a difference between being a victim and victimization, one was the target, the victim, of theft from another person.  The other suffered the consequences of that theft.  However, the kid was not 'the victim' of the whistler because it was not the whistlers intention to kill him, it was not his intention to have any victim at all, and had the kid never attempted his robbery, the whistler would have walked home with that gun in his coat without harming a single soul.  Had the kid not come across the whistler though, he would have presumable found another person to rob, another victim.\n\nAnd what on nonsense are you going off about?  You claim that intentions matter with your argument?  Okay, lets observe their intentions.  The kids intention was to steal something which did not belong to him and he had not earned, and which in his hands, would have been dangerous, potentially to the point of death, for the man he was stealing it from.  The mans intention, were simply to prevent his death and theft of his property, and he chose to do so by the means which would most surely assure his safety.  So once again, it comes down to that harm, if intended by anyone, was intended by the kid, and the situation was his fault regardless of the consequences or how fitting that consequence was for his actions.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-05-29T18:22:53.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol. i shall try for one last time to educate your ignorance.\n\n stand your ground STILL ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO KILL WHEN YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER. ive said that before in this thread.

The law blatantly states 'bodily injury', it doesn't matter if it is the danger of getting a being bruised and beaten or getting shot in the face, if you are in danger of bodily injury, or even non-bodily injuries in the case of rape and molestation, you are permitted to use deadly force.  \n\nAnd you want a list of states that allow the use of deadly force against theft?  Okay.\n\nAlabama\nAlaska\nArizona\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nIndiana\nKansas\nKentucky\nLouisiana\nMichigan\nMississippi\nMontana\nNevada\nNew Hampshire\nNorth Carolina\nOklahoma\nPennsylvania\nSouth Carolina\nSouth Dakota\nTennessee\nTexas\nUtah\nWest Virginia\n\nThe laws of these states clearly state that committing a crime is already a reasonable expectation of violence, and that the citizen is not required to prove reason, the courts is required to prove otherwise.  And there are far more on top of that whose only stipulation is that you perceive danger and have no reasonable and safe method for escape, regardless of what the criminal is doing.  Sorry, but if you believe they have a gun, or are going for a gun, like the kid was in the comic, you have no 'safe' method of escape, it is a ranged weapon which even at a small caliber can easily penetrate most common materials.  Life is not an action movie, you cannot dodge bullets, the enemy is not going to conveniently fire at your feet or the wall behind you, and you cannot find cover behind plywood benches or sheetrock and 2x4 walls, anything save the walls of a brick or steel building will most likely be pierced by deadly gun fire, and you will die from running away or struggling.\n\nOkay, for a lie like you just attempted to pull in your claims of responsibility vs consequences, you must be a lawyer, albeit a poor one.  Whistler stated the kid got what was coming to him not for trying to steal from him, but specifically for trying to steal a firearm off his person, with which the kid could have killed him.  In the whistlers eyes, he perceived someone trying to kill him, and the reason he perceived that, was because of the kids actions.  And you're dang right, if someone tries to kill me, and they die doing it, I will logically conclude that they got what was coming to them by dying whilst attempting to commit murder.  *We* can say that the kid didn't 'get what was coming to him' because we speak from a third person perspective, the whistler has no such perspective, nor would any person defending their self.\n\nAnd for your final, yeah I have looked death in the eye, multiple times actually. I grew up under circumstances where you had to do things like hunting and fishing and the type of dirty work a prissy like you would never consider, just to survive.  And such work came with multiple life threatening experiences, and you know what you do after them if you're healthy?  You laugh, you go into shock, you grow numb, and you laugh.  I haven't had a single family outing where the story hasn't come up of the time me and my brother were nearly buried alive from a rockslide on the shore of glacier bay, we got away by jumping in to the water, which also nearly killed us, since glacier bays water is actually well below freezing point, and causes hypothermia and seizing in seconds.  Its an interesting thing, but when doctors were asked which medical show was most like the real thing, they said Scrubs.  Don't know if you are familiar with it, but its a comedy that frequently makes lite of death of every kind, because that is how a sane person handles experiences like that, they do not brood they learn to laugh and blow it off, or they don't survive long.","replies":[{"poster":"ChaoticPinecone","date":"2015-05-30T18:41:27.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you listed states. give me the caselaw and the penal code - i gave you the relevant law (directly quoted and everthing), you just game me a list of states.

I agree that there is no federal law dictating this, because criminal codes are the states jurisdiction. However, my statement is correct because no state allows the use of deadly force **unless you are immediately threatened with the use of deadly force or serious bodily harm against you**. Its not an assumption. its a fact. if you wish to disprove me, please name me the state that allows the use of deadly force in response to anything less than a perceived threat to your body. No state would allow you to shoot a robber that poses no physical threat. \n> \n> The \"stand your ground\" states allow the use of deadly force in any situation you are threatened with deadly force or serious bodily harm. The ones without the \"stand your ground\" laws allow the use of deadly force only when you are threatened with deadly force or serious bodily harm, **and** there is no reasonable alternative available to ensure your safety. \n> \n> Theres a slight exception inside your home, but thats irrelevant to the comic. \n> \n> At the moment of the shooting, its hard to explain what would happen (legally) and what went down (in the comic). We just dont know. \n> \n> But we do know how Whistler responds after he shoots the kid. You are correct - it doesnt matter if Whistler was in any real danger or not. However, his perception matters a lot - \"he got what was coming to him\" is different from \"i thought he was going to hurt me\". It also has to be a reasonable perception - Whister mentioned that the kid was trying to \"lift\" something off him and thats why he shot him; the kid didnt threaten Whistler to provoke the shooting. Finally, whistling as he was walking away after shooting the kid shows extreme amounts of disregard for human life, as well as his emotional state at the time; nonchalantly whistling as he was calmly walking away is different from freaking out and running away. \n> \n> Its funny you mention victim blaming, because the general sentiment of victim blaming is \"They got what they deserved\" or \"they were asking for it\". It seems to me you are victim-blaming the kid; \"those consequences are still his own fault, he had the first opportunity, ability, and principle responsibility to prevent what happened, and he didn't\" is EXACTLY what victim-blaming is. Who is the victim in the story - Whistler, who gets to walk away, or the kid, who is dead? \n> \n> i dont know where you got the idea that the kid was working outside the system of law. He was working in the system of law, just on the criminal side. If he got caught, he would go to jail (petty theft is still a misdemeanor, so < 1 year in jail). Thats still working in the system of the law - the law would punish the kid as it saw fit. Whistler was working outside of the law - killing someone over theft is VIGILANTE JUSTICE. Whistler was enacting his own justice, not waiting for the system. \n> \n> Ekko, in the reality where he seeks vengence, was also operating in outside the system of law. But as i keep saying, on his last rewind, he decided not to seek vengence. . \n> \n> Lastly, Ekko was hardly _forced_ to make a decision. He was given an ultimatum. We saw how easily he sought his revenge on Whistler before his Z Drive went off for the last time. But we also saw the kid, dying alone. Ekko, in his second to last run, had every intention of killing the Whistler. But in his last run - the one that actually counts, the one that cant be altered by his time machine, the one that everybody will remember - he doesnt kill Whistler. He chooses to be with his friend.\n> \n> Again. Intentions dont mean anything if you dont act on them. You can have great intentions, but ignore them. You can have bad temptations, but ignore them. \n> \n> (and before you say he killed Whistler and then joined his friend, it took him 90+ attempts to get to his friend in 3 minutes. His friend was always dead by the 4 minute mark.)\n\nwhy the hell do you keep bringing up US laws? not only is zaun nothing like america, but it is 100% lawless... the only ones keeping it in check is cait and vi who are from piltover.

If you go back to he comic, Ekko probably would have mugged the guys right there if he was more like Jinx.

Ekko said it himself:\n_\"I sent him out to get food. He only wanted attention. I wasn't even hungry.\"_\n It was Ekko's fault his friend was going to die, no matter what route he took to get to him, it would always end the same. Ekko felt like he had to take responsibility somehow. He avenged the death of a child who would die on the streets of Zaun. And though, yes, i will admit, it does sort of paint him like a murderer, he did it because there was no other option, not enough time to save his friend. If you were approached by the same situation, would you the boy's killer walk away without a price?\n\nAnd sorry for the huge mouthful, i tend to go overboard.

If you go back to he comic, Ekko probably would have mugged the guys right there if he was more like Jinx. But keep in mind, the kid that Ekko saved was **unarmed.** Around the dying boy, there was nothing near his reach that could have been use as a weapon, and i highly doubt that a boy that young and small would try to rob a grown man with only his fists.\n> \n> Then, when Ekko went back to punish the rude gentleman, he didnt do it because, \"This guy's an asshole, lemme wipe him out real quick.\" He did it because there was no time left to do anything else, and he did kill the guy to avenge his friend.
