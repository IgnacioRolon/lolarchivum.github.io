I hate when people build a fucking chain vest and think they have 1 trillion armor. You were squishy. I know that's hard for you to accept, but when you rush a bloodrazor and the only item for def you have is a titanic and a chain vest and you suddenly think you can tank nukes then that is on you.\n\nFYI, that rengar was up an entire item over you, which included BC to shread whatever little armor you did build.","replies":[]}]}]}
