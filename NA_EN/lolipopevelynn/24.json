I still remember being able to wave clear with a fully charged janna tornado, and how riot nerfed that to the ground because it wasn't \"interactive\"\n\nand while I respect that decision, I must also respectfully disagree. Playing AP Janna back then allowed me to approach the game differently, instead of focusing on playing 5v5 team death match in mid lane, I could play more strategically as I forced the enemy team to fight on my terms as we forced different lanes to towers and whittle them down via attrition.\n\nYes it might be a less _active_ or _exciting_ method, but was still a legit method nontheless, and the enemy still had the ability to engage us at any time should they ward smartly and flank properly.

Not really. Do I still hate the entirety of his being? You bet. So I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that while riot should definitely aim to prevent a champion from being toxicly oppressive, (like when a champ is just straight up over powered) riot shouldn't be too worried about it being 'unfair' for some players as that's just the nature of being on the losing end of the stick. It sucks, but sometimes you gotta take yer medicine.\n\nAlso, there is the danger that overly focusing on the receiving end will result in the champs feeling very \"same-y\" for those playing them.

It's been a year and a half, and Zyra and her items have been nerfed/buffed like 6 times since then. Mid balance was not considered at any time.\n\nMaybe we can prioritize this over 2018's annual Ryze rework. Prioritize it over fiddling with lethality three times or reworking AD itemization for the third time in a season and a half. Or reworks that end up as reverts (Kog, Vel), or reworks that turn into resource black holes (Malz, Fizz, Kindred, Caitlyn, Leblanc).\n\nThis is Rito's \"it would cost a raid tier\" response.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperLuigiLXIV","date":"2017-10-03T19:22:24.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, Riot can't even keep their word within one set of patch notes.

Your rank 3 W will clear a caster minion wave. To give you an understanding of how mu.ch damage it does.. oriana needs to Q W Q to clear a wave when morgana can just W it.\n\nOh, and your R benefits for you keeping the leash on your enemy. Meaning, you have to stay in range and avoid dying while its active. Again, better in solo lane as you only receive damage from a single source, as opposed to 2 in the bot lane.\n\nSo, by this we can see that.\nHer passive is for solo lane.\nHer W is for solo lane.\nHer E is for solo lane.\nHer R is for solo lane.\n\nThat's more than half of her kit.\nAnd regarding \"mid being largy roam based\". Did I mention a single W can clear caster minion waves at lv 3 W? (that's lv 5 morgana)\nYou can roam much easier than most mid champions because you clear waves super fast, and from range, and you don't need to be in lane by the time the minions die loool.\nSo, yes, Morgana is very good at roaming as well. And very good at ganking too.\nYou can just walk close to the enemy from behind them using your black shield on yourself, now they can't cc you and ult them. Wait for ult to end almost end and trow a W under the enemy, and after they got stunned land a snare.\n\nShe also has spell vamp, meaning, she will be on high hp when roaming.\nThe only reason morgana is mostly played bot lane is because she used to counter the meta. She was an anti meta pick.\nBack when bot lane was: blitz, thresh, leona.\nAnd this community has a large amount of sheep in it, and they can't think for themselves, so, they stick with their slave masters that played her support in lcs => MORGANA BEST IN SUPPORT ROLE!!!\n\nEven when most of her abilities work better in solo lane.\nedit:\nmeanwhile, downvoted to hell\nmeanwhile, support morgana has lower win ratio than mid morgana.\n\nsry snowflakes, reality isn't on your side ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Jerry SeinfeId","date":"2017-10-02T10:19:19.333+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Her ult is not beter in a sololane.
