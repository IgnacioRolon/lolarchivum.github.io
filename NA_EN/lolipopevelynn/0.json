Q: No more Varus clone charge-up, but a single skillshot that gets extra lenght when W is activated.\n\n3. E: As the E would be pretty oppresive at massive range, lets make it point´n´click dmg, with a much smaller range. Upon reaching the enemy it markes him.

Passive: The same as now. \n_Or we could make it, so he additionally gains armor for building AP! It would also thematically fit him perfectly. A magic gets stronger the more magic it accumulates. And his quote \"Flesh and Blood... sooo fragile~\". Can´t think of anything better than that._\n\n\nWhat do you think? In all seriousness. Please, what do you think about the idea? I know it´s mainly pre-rework Xerath, but LoL has greatly improved scince a kit like that was oppresive.

As someone else said you have to go just below the surface to differentiate those champions. There are undoubtedly a lot of mages that are lacking in niches but \"AOE spell damage and CC\" is just... what a mage is. You may as well say \"I'm a ranged character who autos lots and has a steroid - who am I?\", then say that every single ADC is the exact same champ - while ADCs typically lack in differentation, Sivir is NOT identical to Jinx.\n\nVel'Koz is... honestly somewhat hard to give a niche to, I'll give you that. He's quite decent against tanks but occasional true damage doesn't make a tank buster, and otherwise he's just a standard poke mage.\nZyra's a zone control mage thanks to her plants and Stranglethorns, she's a DPS mage thanks to her plants, she's a counter-engage mage because her kit is quite strong against divers (I can't think of many other mages who specialise in counter-engaging) and her synergy with Liandry's makes her one of the better anti-tank mages. Lots of things you'd want her for.\nSyndra's the premier single target burst mage in the game. If she was usable right now she'd be picked for the ability to snowball the laning phase and assassinate priority targets, in exchange for a poorer teamfight.\nBrand I'd consider lacking, though he works well enough with Liandry's to be anti-tank.\nCass had a horrendous rework but has one of the most specific niches in the game as the mage ADC. If you think she's generic then... is there any mage that you think stands out from the pack? She seems anything but generic to me.\nMalz = single target mage assassin, pool makes him exceptional against tanks and his suppression makes him really good at making diving the backline as a single threat undesirable. Anti-assassin tank shredding mage.\nZiggs = sieging mage. He is impossible to push against and difficult to defend against.\n\nI absolutely agree that some mages need to be changed so that they stand out from the crowd. \"Why pick Vel'Koz when you can pick Xerath or Lux?\" is the type of question in the mage class that needs to be answered. But to say that every mage with AOE damage and CC is impossible to distinguish from every other character with that is ridiculous. Would you rework every assassin if I said they all brought high damage and mobility? Probably not.\n\nDon't give every mage in the game a stupid gimmick just because if you describe them in the absolute vaguest of terms, they sound similar. Many mages have a niche - even most of the mages you listed do. You don't need to give Syndra some stupid \"does more damage against the enemy's hero\" mechanic for her to have a unique reason to be picked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kneel on Ice","date":"2015-08-16T00:28:21.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}}  Zyra needs more mobility speed {{champion:134}} less CD on her E and i dont lnow what {{champion:161}}  needs cause i dont play him :c","replies":[{"poster":"Boomerangbro","date":"2015-08-16T00:42:19.229+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want to nerf Syndra!
