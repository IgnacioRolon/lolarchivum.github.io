This post is not asking. Only stating, if there was a means of sharing the battlefield whether enemy of ally, then and along with having showcased the ability to perform in excellence or magnificent with a Champion in allowing me to witness and learn of a Champion, then I could gift the skin to you. Fact! Nothing knew when I reward for awesome showcasing of Champion abilities by gifting people I have never met. If I decide to continue on with next month then would be a trend of now then 4 months in a row.\n\nFrom: FuryofThornsRedo","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKOBODO","date":"2015-05-29T23:04:46.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe something like this: Once every 6th months, you get a stack. You can use a stack to trade a regular non-legacy skin for another regular non-legacy skin that isn't new. You can only do this a number of days equal to your stacks. Stacks are applied retroactively, so if you've played for, say, 24 month, you get 4 stacks, and another stack in 6th months.\n\nI doubt Riot will implement this, I think they want people to buy multiple skins for the same character.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FreeLanternRides","date":"2015-05-29T22:54:59.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you should be able to do it at least once, but i have never heard of it happening or any talk of it before now.
