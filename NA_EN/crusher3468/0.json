When I was connecting to the game I couldn't connect while curse was open so my team remade the game. Now I have a 20 queue time for the next 5 games because I didn't realize my curse was keeping me from connecting. I was just wondering if it is possible for you to remove the wait time because I wasn't purposely trying to AFK but if you can't that's okay.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-20T18:01:51.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We don't support third party mods because we can't be sure of the outcomes they can, like in this case.  It sucks that you weren't able to connect, but having a timer for that long suggests a long history of leaves.  Even if it wasn't intentional, leaving still causes a negative experience for others.  An account wouldn't recieve a [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) after just one game, but many.  The only way to remove the LPQ is by playing without issues.  I hope that helps clear things up!","replies":[]}]}
