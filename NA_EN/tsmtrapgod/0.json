But irelias E used to stun enemy champions when they had equal hp, IE when they were both full hp. I played a lot of irelia so I remember this being a thing quite assuredly from past seasons. Stunning people walking into bushes and such. But I can't find the patch notes where they changed the health from being equal or less hp to only if you have less hp. I can find the old wording from previous versions of riots description and even the wiki hasn't been updated yet. \r\n\r\n--- Old wording: Irelia pierces the target enemy, dealing them magic damage and slowing them by 60% for a duration. If her percentile health is **_equal to or less than her target's_**, she stuns them instead.\r\n\r\n-- New Wording: Irelia pierces her target, dealing 80 (+0.5AP) magic damage and slowing them by 60% for 1 second(s). _**If the target has a higher Health % than Irelia**_, she stuns them for the duration instead.\r\n\r\nSo my question is this, does anyone have the reference for when this change went through. Because my buddy swears by his life that the only reason irelia seemed like she could do this before was because a minion would agro you mid jump and hurt you, and that is crap. This isn't a rant about buffing Irelia, I just want to know when riot changed this because I can't find it in any patch notes. Thanks guys. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Irelias Equilibrium strike was changed and there is no record of the change in patch notes.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-22T21:53:31.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmmmmm I think this was actually always like this\n\nV1.0.0.105\n\n** Equilibrium Strike (E)**\n\nIrelia's attack balances the scales, dealing damage and slowing the target.
