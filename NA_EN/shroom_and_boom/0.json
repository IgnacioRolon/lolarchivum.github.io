Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, ARAM all give me 30-98 FPS, yet when Ascension begins and everyone is at the shop area I recieve decent 45 fps right but it is when we begin to teleport onto the battlefield I get this drastic frame drop. It really is pissing me the hell off. I know it's this new patch 7.10 problem and I'm asking you guys at riot to get on with clearing up this MAC issue bug along with others reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Bot","date":"2017-05-20T14:52:48.927+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also experiencing this issue on my Mac :-( I never used to lag in Ascension, but now I do with significant FPS drops, making it really difficult to play well.

To start, downloading the [hextech repair tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367) and perform a repair to fix up any of those files.  Make sure that your frames aren't capped as well through your in-game video settings.

If you have some time, run through our [FPS issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting) guide as well in case of other applications or settings causing these drops.
