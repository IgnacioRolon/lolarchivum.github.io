He's a melee champion just like Katarina and your abilities are actually quite similar. \nThe two main differences between Talon and Katarina are that Talon uses mana while Katarina is resourceless, and Talon is meant for destroying one target while Katarina is meant for destroying an entire team at once.\nTalon has a couple of slows in his kit but that's about it as far as crowd control goes. \nUse your abilities every chance you get, try pushing the minion wave and forcing him to use his W to clear it. This wastes his mana and makes him easier to fight.\nWhenever he uses his ultimate to try and engage on you, shunpo to your tower and it will either put you out of the range, or make him teleport with you to your tower (if you time it right). \nYou can't really outdamage him in lane because all of his damage is really quick upfront burst, but you can force him to blow his mana pool, get your jungler to gank, and either force him to back or kill him then. \nRemember to roam a lot to get fed and try to win the game from snowballing other parts of the map.","replies":[{"poster":"3oMaRa2001","date":"2015-05-29T16:25:16.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thnx bro","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Casi Y","date":"2015-05-29T19:27:57.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It helps to keep up with his MS as any Talon matchup is very positioning based. Consider going for MS Quints if he might do that too. Or putting a ward about 600 range behind where you'll be freezing the lane so you've always got an escape with your E.\n\nRemember that Talon can't do that much to you after he's blown his burst combo. Don't forget to trade back as well as you can after he's jumped you.\n\nBesides, it's of course about mana, ganks, roaming... at least he doesn't have a silence for your ult anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-05-29T16:35:15.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kat WAY out ranges Talon by using minions.
