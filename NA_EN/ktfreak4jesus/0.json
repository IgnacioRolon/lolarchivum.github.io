Can't submit ticket.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm trying to get my PBE account recovered because its disabled for some reason and I need to submit a ticket to riot support. The problem I'm having is... in order to use the recover account option the website forces you to sign out and then fill out the form. BUT when I go to submit it the damn website makes me login in order to post it and completely gets rid of what I type up.\r\n\r\nSomething else I've noticed. My account on pvp.net and the boards seems to be very different from the account on support.riotgames.com. It even uses a very old email. What is up with this?\r\nAny help with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Morgana","date":"2017-11-08T00:12:49.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried submitting the information through a different browser perhaps? Clearing your cache and cookies may be a good idea as well. I can't go over the details of your account over boards, but if you're still not able to submit that ticket let me know. I'll see what I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"KTfreak4Jesus","date":"2017-11-08T17:05:19.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried 3 different browsers..
