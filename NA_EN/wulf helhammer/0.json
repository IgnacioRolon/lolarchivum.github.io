This only added to a complete mindfuck that this psychological thriller has delivered beforehand, but luckily the popularity of the show has blown out of proportion and the studio was able to release the ending alternative to the last two episodes, called *End of Evangelion*.\n\nBy itself the scene is... cheesy and confusing.

Some people are extremely focused on singular characters and wish to see something about them every once in a while.\n\nFor example, I'm a Brand main, with a soft spot for Leona, Shyvana, and the other Demacians. All I know about my favourite champion is that he was imprisoned by the Demacians and he knew more about the Institute of War than the summoners let him tell to the Journal of Justice. That was years ago. Any hint on Brand's development, or even Demacia in general, would be great. That's the sort of periodical insight we've been missing since the JoJ.\n\nKeep up the good work.

So thoughtless towards players who main him in ranked. So intrusive when Riot had made such a big deal in the retcon about lore not interfering with gameplay.  Why did you think that it was the only way for the event to work? I'm not looking forward to future lore events now. I'm only apprehensive towards what 'great, new idea' Riot will have for delivering lore that arbitrarily restricts players. That's what I will remember about this event.

In my opinion, that doesn't detract from the experience, that makes it SO MUCH BETTER.

It was an awesome change of pace to League in many ways, but this statement is scary to me. What constitutes cool to the lore team may or may not be cool to the people playing these champions.\n\nLets say they have a Piltover event where Jinx Caitlyn and Vi all 'die' in an explosion. I would be out my two best ADCs and my most played jungler. True that I would have 123 other champions to play, but even if they were only disabled for a week I would effectively be banned from ranked for that week. That is not immersive, just annoying.\n\nAnother perspective to look at it from is a new player. Players from the level ranges of 5-20 have not yet played enough to have a diversified champion pool. Any newer player with a champion the lore team has disabled for the 'cool factor' now might have a significant portion of their champion pool disabled. Hardly an incentive to keep playing if they find Riot will just take away their champions for no better reason than lore they have not yet played enough to be invested in.\n\nThis kind of thinking also disregards the financial aspects of lore disabled champions. Skins cost money. At any point in Riots history when a player acquires a skin it is done so with the knowledge they will have access to it from then on with the standing exception of being when a champion is selectively disabled due to a game breaking bug.\n\nIs Riot now saying they will take away our ability to use products we have paid for because they believe it enhances their story telling? That is not something I am comfortable supporting as their are many games (read nearly all) that would not make this kind of statement.","replies":[{"poster":"RiotJaredan","date":"2015-08-02T21:45:42.495+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just to be clear: I wasn't referring to disabling champs at all.

We swung for the fences a bit, and took some risks. I'm very proud of the fact so many Rioters were willing to do that and have fun along with it—though I understand some players disagree and are displeased by what happened.\n\nThere will definitely be more of a full answer than I can provide you right now as we (Events team and Riot) respond to questions arising from the event, including the one you mention.
