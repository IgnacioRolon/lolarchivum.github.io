Although, my concentration was more in line with numerical methods to differential equations, I did take quite a few statistics courses.     \n\nI would be very interested in understanding their methodology here.  But it appears to me that they have a data-inundation and use completely arbitrary means to interpret it.    \n\nLet's be quite frank here about Morgana.  She received some buffs she didn't need, but NONE of the buffs were particularly good.  In fact, the buffs didn't do anything to change her play style or strengths.   So claiming that Morgana is \"op\" now is actually absurd.  Either she was always OP or she is not OP now.  You simply cannot say that a minor movement speed buff to her ult and some HP thresh hold scaling on her W suddenly broke the champion.  \n\nI've one tricked her for 10 years.  Every season I have a 60% win rate as Morgana in any role I play.  Well, its always a bit higher mid than support, but it averages out to 60%.  Anyway, this year, after her buffs, I still have a 60% win rate.   \n\nIf these buffs were truly that powerful shouldn't my win rate have gone up substantially?  Do you think after 10 years I just can't figure out how to press W correctly?  Anyway,  I realize this is just anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt.  \n\nBut I suppose you could argue that these buffs pushed her over the edge.  Well then cause and effect ought to dictate that you simply revert the buffs you gave her in 9.5.  This isn't complicated. \n\nWhat I suspect has happened with Morgana is the following:\n\n* Morgana's ban rate went up because her pick rate and suspected pick rate went up.  Meaning players expected to see her more because of the rework. \n\n* Her pick rate went up due to the visual update\n\n* Her play rate mid went up because of the visual update.  \n\n* Her win rate marginally increased in support, but skyrocketed mid because of a meta shift. \n\n* A meta shift was caused by the crit item buff which reasserted ADC dominance.  \n\n* Morgana's E is very good late game, and because adcs can now carry the game again a utility mid like her is viable.  \n\nNone of this really has anything to do with Morgana.  You would see Morgana's win rate drop if:\n\n1.  You prevented ADCs from being the end all be all of late game carries.  Especially Vayne and Jinx who dominate games really hard with the protection that black shield gives. \n\n2. You reverted the unnecessary buffs that you gave her in 9.5.   \n\nFinally, I'll even address the issue of Hecarim.  \n\nI played hecarim quite a lot in season 8.  He isn't any stronger than he was in season 8.  In season 8 he could still 1 shot people with predator, ghost, E.  The champion is the same god damn champion he's always been.  But he's in the spotlight now so people are bitching about it.  \n\nOh, and conqueror is busted on Hecarim, but you guys seem to be unable to balance that rune.  Maybe that's a sign it should be given a dark harvest treatment.  \n\nSo there we go.  I figured out the balance issues for you. It's a combination of group psychology caused by seeing a champion repeatedly buffed in patch notes or receiving an update, and a very big meta shift.  \n\nYou're looking at this from one dimension.  You're seeing all these champions on your little spreadsheet and you're thinking they're independent of one another.  That's not the case.  Consider taric sona.  Twitch lulu.   Vayne Morgana.

Bias in balancing works against that goal and devalues League as a respected competitive game. It also threatens its longevity even if imbalances may in the short term be fun to abuse. \n\nFun isn't an objective or permanent thing either. It's relative. I may at first have more fun with a popular OP champion but I'd value the game more and probably have more fun overall if I could completely trust that balance is fair, objective and in a nearly perfect spot.\n\nI remember this argument being used to not nerf Lee back when he was clearly OP for competent players.  It's pretty laughable and has no place in a balance discussion. Imagine if Blizzard used that as an argument in SC2 for not nerfing or buffing certain races. People trust Blizzard's balancing exactly because they'd never consider such a thing. In fact, they actively removed dozens of units from SC2 because they didn't add enough strategically or were potential balance issues. Even if a champion is popular and thus most players playing it are not good (keeping the win rate down despite the champ being OP), ignoring it is basically looking the other way to what would be correct balance. \n\nStill, seeing what's in store for 9.9, balance is going in the right direction.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tahminatrix ","date":"2019-04-26T18:50:55.573+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like playing a game of \"Where`s tahm kench\"\n\nUntil you look at the FAR LEFT BOTTOM corner by himself.

While this could be speculation at best what other reason do champions like Vayne and Riven being absolute terror's on the rift get to go un-nerfed for so long. The reason that they sell skins does not seem too far off. \n\nLest we not forget that popular champs do get preferential treatment.
