Its INCREDIBLY JANKY.\nWhen I try to launch the normal production client, nothing happens.  HOWEVER, if I try to launch the PBE client then switch back to the live prod client, it will launch.  I can actually reproduce this too.  Please look into this.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-08T21:45:58.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm... that's pretty weird.

How did the steps in the connection guide go?\n\nI tried turning off my firewall and turning it back on.  No luck.  I also changed my DNS server to the suggested 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.  Then flushed the dns.  No luck.  The stupid thing is that I can access the PBE with no issue but not NA live.\n\nAlso I ran the hextech tool.  I have the Lol logs if you are interested.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-11-13T22:18:52.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd actually recommend attaching those logs to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our tech specialists can take a look at continue to work with you on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Para","date":"2016-11-14T18:57:57.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7BZ1Mn81,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-13T22:18:52.627+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d actually recommend attaching those logs to a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) so one of our tech specialists can take a look at continue to work with you on this.\n\nAlready did.  Also the PBE client/live client interaction turned out to be a false positive.  I have like only a 10% chance to launch the live client each time I click launch.  It is quite frustrating.  I wish the new live client would come sooner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TMG Cone","date":"2016-11-08T07:12:56.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=7BZ1Mn81,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-08T02:30:27.407+0000)\n>\n> These definitely sound like symptoms of a poor connection to the League servers.
