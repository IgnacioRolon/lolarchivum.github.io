I&#039;m a relatively new player, but I have been playing a lot of Ryze recently. In my opinion, Ryze does do a lot of dmg, but due to the cast range, he has to put himself in a really dangerous position. With recently Talon getting more popular, I&#039;ve had a quite a few games playing against Talon. If not careful, Talon can easily delete you lvl 6. So, I think Ryze is kind of a high risk high reward kind of champion. By nerfing the dmg bonus on his E, it will probably weaken him alot since he needs to kill the opponent as fast as he can so he doesn&#039;t get killed. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Sharpio","date":"2017-02-17T09:28:47.867+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, if ryze gets nerfed, a lot of people are happy. His laning phase is boring, his 2 second point and click root is complete BS, and his constant shields and movement speed are ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"grug","date":"2017-02-17T09:12:34.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"his late game just got 20% weaker.\n\ni predict his winrate to drop sub 40% l0l.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zezockary","date":"2017-02-17T11:08:26.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are having issues against Talon as Ryze why wouldn't you build a frozen heart?","replies":[]}]}
