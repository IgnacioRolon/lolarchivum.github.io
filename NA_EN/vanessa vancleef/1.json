Kinda like I'm some demented gardener.\n\nBut, I also find myself not carrying for any other resource.\n\nI don&#039;t really see a point in gathering rocks or leather to craft items/upgrades when the moment I set out to use them about 10 upgrades will fly out of a nearby horse&#039;s ass.\n\nWhat is the point of crafting weapons/armor when you can&#039;t walk 10 feet without tripping over some?\n\nYou have a limited number of potions so crafting additional ones and making them less ass is key to success.\n\nYou&#039;ll probably want to upgrade your fortress to make it prettier too.\n\nKinda strange that only half the crafting system seems actually useful.","replies":[]}
