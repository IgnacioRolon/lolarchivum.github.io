But after you released invasion mode etc. , somehow they aren't working anymore. So i thought, maybe it's a hardware problem. So i went on overwatch to test it and use MB4 as i usually do for melee hit and it worked, so it's not a hardware problem.\r\nI tested also on LoL client and went to the key-bindings menu outside of game and i could smoothly bind MB4 and MB5 to item slots with no problem, but as soon as i get in game, those buttons do not work and i can't bind them from the in-game settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-12T17:37:42.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you on Windows 10 and was it recently updated around this time?
