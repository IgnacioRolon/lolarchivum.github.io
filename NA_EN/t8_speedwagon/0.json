So i wanted to ask, why not use this useful yet simple tool more frequently to get opinions on many other questions such as reworks, skins, lore, music, art, esports etc.? \r\nIn my opinion, the client is the only and true way to gather those who really care about the game just because they have to use the client to play, am i wrong?\r\nSo that people from reddit or other social platforms do not have to bring up crusades or things like that just to represent an opinion that from that portion of the community care about and thinks that it needs to be discussed.\r\nTo bring up this suggestion in a fair way, i must explain its cons which could be:\r\n\r\n- The survey system could be too invasive and may annoy people that are casual players who don&#039;t really care about if Swain tranforms into a parrot of a crow but actually want to have some fun without even thinking too deeply into the game mechanics.\r\n\r\n- The survey system could be abused or biased by people themselves: &quot;oh yeah streamer X said that champion Y isn&#039;t good right now so i blindly trust him and will vote on the next survey so that this champion can get Z change&quot;. By this i mean people who vote X because many others voted the same answer, in this way people might lose their own perception of the problem examined and will answer mindlessly without even putting a reason behind their choice which could ruin in a not intended way the game itself.\r\n\r\nIf this whole thing was already discussed somewhere or even several times, i&#039;m sorry, didn&#039;t mean to make a spam topic and feel free to ignore this.

I can't imagine its high if they've already been fed up enough to leave, and if you ask me why i quit a game several months ago and i actually take the time to respond i probably couldn't give you an honest or meaningful answer from memory. In fact over time my answer would probably have changed because if it was a game I enjoyed at one point then my brain wouldn't want to place blame on the game I loved, instead making up a reason that seems more justified in hindsight. If i look through my steam library i can find several of these where when i think about it i quit the game for valid technical or design reasons at the time, but i still look at them from time to time and go \"why did i quit that game?\". It takes me some time to get over the fact that the game wasn't as great as i remember it. It had flaws, even if i convinced myself that i quit for other reasons. \n\n(The games i'm thinking about as i type this is Civ 2-5 if you're curious.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LOSINGISMYPRIDE","date":"2018-01-04T02:04:28.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you did it in the client ? because i didnt receive it .

My problem is that \"once in a while\", for instance, i also main lb but i never received the survey and i wanted so much to participate to give my feedback. When talking about lb rework i always feel reluctant to post on boards because people tend to prejudge the topic and downvote making the topic sink in the abyss of the boards passing unviewed. \nBut lets not go further in that direction.\nWhat i mean is that i think surveys should be \"open\", not selected by riot, not totally i mean. Riot should choose the question to discuss through surveys and people can choose to join the survey or not.

You **have** to be selective to ensure your survey population is as representative of the whole as possible. It wouldn't be a valid statistical sample if they sent it only to all LB mains, or even if they sent it mostly to LB mains (unless their question is \"how do LB mains feel about X\").\n\nFurther, if you give people the choice to join or not, then they would suffer from response bias - i.e. they'd get a ton of extreme responses as extreme opinions are more likely to be willing to answer a survey about it. If it's a few question long in-client survey that pops up on the side, people from *all* opinions are more likely (but not guaranteed) to answer - giving a more valid representation of the opinion of the community as a whole.\n\nWhen making big changes Riot considers the game as a whole - including players from all walks. The surveys they conduct will be representative of this - including players from all walks.","replies":[{"poster":"Sparkle","date":"2018-01-04T03:35:53.549+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good answer, and all true.

I wanted to know what you thought about it and if it's a thing you at Riot had considered (since you were discussing that argument I suppose you are informed about it), and if it had particular cons I failed to consider or simply was a matter of taste/easier to balance as I suspect.\n\nBack to the topic, maybe you have a point.. but what letting the players request the perma-survey thing then? Think of it like PBE: one had to specifically request an account and have their request approved to help with testing and pre-game feedback, you could allow us to help you giving permanent feedback to the current game in every topic needed. \n\nAlso, I feel RNG behind surveys can skew results as well.. for example I got a survey about Evelyn, which I completed the best I could and expressing what I would have liked her to become, her strengths etc.. But I am not even a jungle player and I was not playing Evelyn from a huge amount of time, and, no matter how good the rework would have been, I would have not be interested in seriously picking her up again cause my roles were stable. Had that particular survey be directed to an Eve main it would have certainly be more productive then on me! (And I will be {{sticker:sg-shisa}}  if I happened to get the one for Eve but when the time comes miss the one for Morgana, one of my most played and favourite champions).\n \nPS: Keep staying with us, even when we are in disagreement communication (real communication, from you guys using normal worlds and explaining your position not the \"everything is flowers\" kind of communication that comes out sometimes)  makes all things feel better/more ok  even when we don't like them. \"Veterans loosing ip on runes\" \"guys we need the income from selling champion\" is totally alright in my book.
