A friend of mine had not received the most recent poro icon despite meeting the requirements for them and she has sent a ticket to Riot with the problem. She got a response saying she should of received it the 23rd but still has not even though she tried to contact them again. I also tried to send one for her. It's her favorite icon and I just wanna make any chance I can to get her the icon since she really wants it. Thanks to anyone that replies.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-09-27T17:22:24.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've pushed the deadline to the 30th, as we're still in the process of getting these out.
