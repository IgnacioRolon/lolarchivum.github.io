If they buff him a little he becomes incredibly bad for the game as a whole.

One of the reasons they stopped his entire Q knocking enemies up was to cut \"extraneous\" power (or power they felt was not core to the champion) but they didn't give him a compensation buff. Long story short, they had to dumpster Aatrox like they had to with old Poppy and old Sion.\n\nAs for the rework Yorick and Urgot are the most in need. In the Mid Year update they're reworking mages, followed by (most likely according to Riot) assassins.

The community does not know balance (#redditknowsbalance)\nThe point of this whole fiasco is that sated devourer was a huge balancing problem and was unhealthy for the game because of it's play pattern. Either you were bronze and wouldn't stack it until 25+ minutes or you were cowsep and would stack it in about 12. It was too inconsistent.\n\nAs I said, maybe they will buff it and it does seem a little weak at the moment, but it is far easier to balance than sated devourer.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akali is SO HOT","date":"2016-04-29T01:41:29.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Of course Bloodrazor isn't good compared to Sated because Sated is so horrendously broken on him","replies":[]}]}
