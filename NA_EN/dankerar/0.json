I've played this game almost 2 years and it's always happened. I notice it happen to enemies more often, but I've seen it happen in my favor a few times.\n\nThere's actually 2 bugs related to this issue (one could be seen as more of a gameplay mechanic than a bug, but works kind of counterintuitively)\n\n1. If you kill an enemy under turret very quickly, the turret will often not aggro you at all. This can be seen either as a bug or a game mechanic intended. In my opinion this shouldn't be part of the game either and I see it as an exploitable bug - people will dive you knowing about this bug and another player might think it's safe and suddenly they get dived, die, and the other player continues to attack turret unscratched.\n\n2. Sometimes you are casting and basic attacking multiple times under turret, and the turret will not aggro you AT ALL. Sometimes you can continue this for several seconds until the player is dead and never get aggrod. Sometimes it won't aggro you at all during this entire battle, other times it will not aggro for 4-5 seconds then suddenly decide to aggro you halfway through the battle. Usually once another player has aggrod the turret, or you have left the turret range and then returned, the turret will seem to go back to normal aggro behavior.\n\nI've noticed this bug more in bots, but I've definitely seen it happen in PVP Normals. It seems to happen more frequently when there are multiple people diving a turret, and the first 1-2 randomly won't get aggrod but the 3rd one will even though the other 2 attacked first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WingsofGulgazor","date":"2015-01-07T20:48:31.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also think that sometimes the range of turrets has been targetting people further then it's actual range.

I've seen quite a few people die from shots that seemed like it was out of range though it might be that I really just don't know the range of turrets but it has been seemingly been doing that.\n\nNo, I've noticed that too. What seems to be happening from what I've seen is that the range of a turret increases a little for targets that have drawn their agro. So they normally have 775 attack range but if you've drawn fire from them then they will still be able to hit you if you are within, say 1000 range of them (Rough number, but you get the idea) but once you leave that range then it's attack range goes back to normal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phantasm X","date":"2015-01-08T00:40:58.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as the turret fires the shot before you are out of range, that shot will follow you out to an infinite distance.\nEven if you flash, the shot will still follow you.
