We should be able to fix this pretty easily with a few steps, but we need to make sure to follow these steps to the t.\n\n**1)** It is necessary that you make sure you have all available [**Window Updates**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104#wq1) on your computer.\n\n**2)** Before we start the migration process, I strongly urge you to **uninstall** any antiviruses that you have. Popular antiviruses like [AVG] (https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en_US&urlname=How-to-uninstall-AVG), [Avast!](https://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility) and [McAfee](https://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331) can interfere with this process! You can always elect to reinstall it after the client has been patched.\n\n**3)** To force the migration process, head into your C:/Riot Games folder and locate the **LeagueClient.exe**(it will have the new Beta Client Icon). Delete this!\n\n**4)** Then, click on \"lol.launcher.admin\". This will start the migration process. Let this run to completion (when the Beta Client patches fully).\n\nLet me know if that works!\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/2a6964d91df85aa39513839816a722ca.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrawlicSnake","date":"2017-04-29T01:11:42.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry nobody has answered yet. I'll try to help but i'm not the best. When you say open the game, you mean when you double click the client and you get that error? When you get that error is there a black screen or something?","replies":[]}]}
