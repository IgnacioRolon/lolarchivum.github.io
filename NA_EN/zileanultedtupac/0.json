The closer you get to plat the more you lose. I don&#039;t consider my self some sort of a pro player or smth like that, but i consider i am good enough for plat 5. But i can&#039;t get past gold 2. Like i barley get gold 2, then start losing until gold 3 20lp and then get around gold 2 with 50 lp. Same story. Losing, winning, losing. But only when i play with plat players. Is there any way to get into plat without luck? Like a game can&#039;t be carried against fed mid laners/adc&#039;s when u don&#039;t play assasins. Even if you do play some sort of a broken champ, like rengar or yi or smth, a fed vayne will delete ya. Can you please give me advice? ^^ I reallly like playing top and i am a darius {{champion:122}}  main, but after min 30 you get instakilled if u are the frontline against very mobile champs.

But here comes darius' disadvantage. 1.He is slow af. So i either kill the top laner, base and then walk bot then tp to lane or either kill the enemy top laner and tp bot. Both cases i lose cs and xp because i lack mobility. 2. After min 30 or 35, he falls. Hard falls. Even tho if u manage to shut down the carries your adc is either mentally damaged and starts throwing and their adc is back into the game or u get spancked in a teamfight due to the lack of as and inability to stack. Any suggestions on any champ that mastered will win your games in both early and late game?

Maybe watch higher pro players with their kits and playstyle and try to mimic their actions? If you main darius then there really shouldn't be an issue with hitting that early game damage hard on the enemy top laner.","replies":[{"poster":"ZileanUltedTupac","date":"2018-07-08T11:14:19.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that' s why Darius is still S tier. It's really easy to win lane, zone the enemy not to cs and things like this. But as soon as the game hits min 30 all they have to do is chain cc you. Darius isn't that tanky tbh and really kiteable. That is why rn i am trying all top champs to see wich one is better to hit late game with it. In high gold- low plat there are a lot of throws or ppl don't focus objectives hard enough. I am trying nasus to master since i can rely on myself to take towers inhibs and hard split. But, again, my team likes to hard engage in 4v5's and if when losing the teamfight they blame me for not helping after i told them to peel or to fight when they send 2-3 people against me since 1 ain't enough. Thank you very much for the advice, if u have any suggestions of what champ can win early and late game hard i'll be listening!","replies":[]}]}]}
