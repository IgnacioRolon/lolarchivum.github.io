The rest of your post is fine, but I would recommend submitting a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the date, time, and player name/region they're on. Also, providing screenshots will also help. Basically, the more information you're able to provide the better it will help them look into the matter for you.
