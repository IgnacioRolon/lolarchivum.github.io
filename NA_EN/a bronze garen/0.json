Maybe 1-2 feeder in 5 games and i think that's a reasonable RNG. The key to winning those games is keeping the morale up. Especially be good towards the feeders so they won't tilt. Trust me, give those feeders a calm mind and you'll win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AeroWaffle","date":"2020-01-18T04:13:34.325+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player A is the cause of their own losses a majority of the time.\nPlayer B is usually **not** the cause of their own losses.\n\nPlayer A will lose more than Player B. Player A will lose ELO until they are matched with/against people who have similar problems with their own performance. If Player B continues to influence games in their favor and plays better than average they will raise in ELO until their \"better than average\" is just average for their rank.\n\nDoes having bad luck and getting a lot of bad teammates have an effect? Sure. But adding more punishments for playing poorly is not going to change that. You're still going to occasionally have the bad luck to be matched with teammates that happen to do poorly. Sometimes in consecutive matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Upgrades","date":"2020-01-18T03:41:33.082+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats a good way to significantly decrease the player count overnight instead of fix feeders overnight \n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CharDeeMcDenniz","date":"2020-01-18T02:08:33.044+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A Bronze Garen,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=gnYtEsev,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-18T01:36:25.465+0000)\n>\n> tl;dr - Penalize Queue Time for people who are significantly decreasing a team's odds of winning whether intentional or not **based on poor performance thresholds.**\n> \n\n\nyou want to punish players for not being good at the game? are you nuts?\n\nno, in no way, shape, or form would this fix ANYTHING ever, much less over night","replies":[]},{"poster":"PresBushDid711","date":"2020-01-21T22:44:05.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They has to be a troll post, in your last couple days you have these scores:\n4/12\n5/10\n1/9\n4/13\nIn back to back games 1/8, 1/7\n\nI don't even think it's even an argument to \"get gud\", how about getting to a 1.0 kda first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele II","date":"2020-01-21T22:37:36.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would require an impossible to achieve matchmaking system that somehow knows everyone is gonna play at the very same level so that no one could possibly get outplayed really hard unless they just werent trying or didnt care.
