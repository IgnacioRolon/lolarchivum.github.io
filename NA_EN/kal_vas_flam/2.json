My testing method is pretty simple: I take out a wave with my abilities and take a turret shot to see how much it blocks (since I can see I have a shield but can&#039;t see exactly how much shield value I have at the time). When I do it normal it blocks around 1/10 of what it should be blocking. When I auto-refresh HP it blocks the proper amount. \n\nSometimes after building my shield it will only block 5 or 6 damage, which makes no sense considering the minimum should be 10. If I have 700 HP the shield should be 80 HP strong when maxed out, but it&#039;s only that strong if Auto-Refresh HP is selected...\n\nAnd no, I'm not taking minion damage or any damage from any source until I take intentional turret shots.

I know that sounds confusing but Overheal is ment for other champs healing you.  What ever your passive is doing you must not forget that it's only 30% as strong (And another 30% as strong for aoe).  At most I'd wager you are gaining a single HP every tick on Tormented Soil with how reduced the healing is.","replies":[{"poster":"Kal Vas Flam","date":"2017-11-15T21:16:44.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This appears to be what was going on. The HP auto-refresh must actually just be a huge heal constantly on your champ and that was why it was working with it. It works with Morg's passive too but it just doesn't have much of an impact until you get some AP, which makes sense. It's probably worth it for late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Selegun","date":"2017-11-15T21:30:07.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see that working.
