Can be outdueled by some of the other splitpushers\n\n{{champion:75}}  STRENGTHS: Tanky, auto attacker with massive burst and late game scaling. Has the most incentive to split push to stack his Q. Inescapable duelist and counters all other auto attackers with his whither. Can solo towers late game \nWEAKNESSES: Vulnerable to multiple man ganks because he has no escape, slow wave clear \n\n{{champion:48}}  STRENGTHS: Splitpush trundle should rush {{item:3074}}  and run attack speed runes. With hydra and good attack speed his wave clear is massive, best duelist in the game, it doesn't matter how far behind he is he can still successfully duel once he gets lvl 6.  Can builds tons of damage and still be tanky, counters tanks and can be uncatchable with his pillar. \nWEAKNESSES: Can be kited to hell and back, can be counter built with {{item:3165}}, pretty bad late game unless building damage. \n\n{{champion:11}} STRENGTHS: Good duelist, highest dps in the game has true dmg and massive attack/movespeed. Hard to catch and good waveclear.\n\nWEAKNESSES: Squishy, vulnerable to CC and can be counterbuilt with {{item:3075}}  \n\n{{champion:24}} STRENGTHS: Kass junior according to trick2g, insane mobility with his 3.8 sec 700 range leap. Triforce user with good mixed damage.  Some of the best attackspeed scaling in the game, excellent late game, excellent duelist.\n\nWEAKNESSES: Bad autoattack animation until you get attack speed.  Ult doesnt work on towers, projectile speed of his leap is extremely slow, takes a long time to recover if defeated in lane. \n\n{{champion:2}} STRENGTHS: Splitpush olaf should rush {{item:3074}}  and {{item:3153}}  Absolutely stupid sustain if building dmg, olaf can heal for over 400 hp per strike while having over 200 armor full build. This makes him an excellent duelist and a good counterpick to other split pushers like nasus. Snoballs stupidly hard when building dmg and ofc CC immunity when diving\n\nAlso perhaps the best waveclear of any champion built full tank, 2 axes clear an antire backwave\n\nWEAKNESSES: Horrendous auto attack animation with super low range, extremely high skill-cap for a bruiser. Abilities cooldowns will be inefficient with max CDR, low mobility so it can be hard to catch ppl, worst late game of any popular split-pusher when building tank and surprisingly squishy \n\nto be continued....","replies":[]}
