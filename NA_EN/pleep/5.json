I think he was over confident on Hecarim. But either way, he is always the subject to constant ganks because they know he is the weakest link. Games where he can farm up, he will be at best a wall to protect the backline. He's target banned in every match, and constantly camped. They specifically know he has a weak champion pool outside of Maokai, Sion, Lulu and Rumble. They need a new style of player in there, because Dyrus as a player isn't bad skill-wise, he just doesn't fit into the play style the rest of TSM do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trylobyte","date":"2015-05-08T12:19:29.873+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dyrus is generally a solid, reliable top-laner, but I suspect the strategy of 'Camp Dyrus' has really hurt him.
