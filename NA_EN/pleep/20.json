Why get {{item:3071}}  on trundle for 25% arpen after 5 hits when you could get {{item:3035}}  and reduce their armor by 35% instantly? \n\nThats why no one builds the item, last whisper is just better in almost every situation. Except for champions that have AEO, like garen and can reduce the armor of multiple ppl at once or champs that are stacking tons of arpen like talon.\n\nIll probably build the new black cleaver on trundle though","replies":[{"poster":"Venowolf","date":"2015-04-19T21:21:56.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are wrong, Last whisper reduce the armor only by your attacks, Black Cleaver, cleave the enemy armor for 5 seconds, so all your teammates can be benefit and attack, so a Wukong Ult destry the armor of all enemies for 5 s, Last Whisper is instanly and don't have the \"cleaved effect\" so, Black Cleaver is more for utility that LW.","replies":[{"poster":"pleep","date":"2015-04-19T21:33:22.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Venowolf,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H2M4j5fR,comment-id=00020000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-19T21:21:56.249+0000)\n>\n> You are wrong, Last whisper reduce the armor only by your attacks, Black Cleaver, cleave the enemy armor for 5 seconds, so all your teammates can be benefit and attack, so a Wukong Ult destry the armor of all enemies for 5 s, Last Whisper is instanly and don't have the \"cleaved effect\" so, Black Cleaver is more for utility that LW.\n\nYou are arguing stupid semantics.

He just gave you a perfectly valid argument. Compare one person stripping away 5% of the enemy's armor with each physical attack for a maximum of 25%, increasing the damage of the rest of their teammates, to ignoring 35% of the enemy's armor for whoever has that item. If you're the only AD, that's one thing, but if you're Yasuo mid, top lane is Garen, jungle is Rengar and ADC is... well, an ADC, then every single one of them would have to build last whisper to benefit from the armor penetration, compared to only buying one black cleaver. If you're building any armor penetration, it's usually because the enemy has a tank, and you're probably focusing him at that point.\n\nNot to mention that Black Cleaver gives more damage and gives HP, flat armor penetration, and cooldown reduction, things that the Last Whisper doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"pleep","date":"2015-04-19T23:47:47.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lost R,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=H2M4j5fR,comment-id=0002000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-04-19T23:39:54.246+0000)\n>\n> That wasn't stupid semantics.

I fully understand how BC works and i fully understand how LW works. Most people agree that LW is better for single target auto-attack champions for the reasons i mentioned.  If you have a different opinion cool, but what venowolf wrote is not a valid arguement","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GloriousKaiser","date":"2015-04-19T23:41:06.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:58}}  I think these champions can stack the passive fast, and benefit greatly from the phage passive.\n\nRiot doesn't like Talon because his ability to instantaneously, outright kill anyone who has a small health pool far surpasses the likes of Zed, Leblanc, etc.\n\nAlbeit, his weaknesses now prove too much for guaranteed hits but the point stands, he can instagib WAY faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vIbvdOwbko","date":"2015-04-19T04:46:47.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk.\n\nI almost never see Black cleaver on him anymore.
