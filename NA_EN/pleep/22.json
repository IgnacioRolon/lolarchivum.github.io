Outside of elo hell all u have to do to win a game is crush your lane and direct your team to objectives and teamfights. But in silver the game feels so much more luck based, either you win no matter what or you lose no matter what.\r\n\r\nI think something is wrong when i player rolls gold 4 and 5 but can't get their smurf out of silver for like 150 games playing the same champs.
