Like was done with Ahri \n\nThe reason i say this is because he is way too binary and doesn't really fit well with with the direction riot seems to be taking the game in. Compared with the other midlane assassins: {{champion:157}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}}  talon is lacking a combination of skill-cap, mobility, outplay potential, UTILITY and  lane presence pre-6.
