And Why I Cost The GOAT the game.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] General Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":13,"body":"If anyone speciated game 1 of the battle of the century you know that Baconstripz 100% deserved to win that but he lost because i fed. Its as simple as that.  If anyone wants to know exactly how the mighty pleep was brought so low this is what happened from my perspective:\n\nFirst off I don't think that my loss that game was caused by mia belle volpe, he zoned me off some CS sure, but as a melee mid that is to be expected. I lane talon with a 10- 20 CS deficit in most ranged matchups  so that is not a problem for me. \n\n1. The first  mistake i made was not buying {{item:3077}}, on my 3rd back  this left me unable to waveclear and my opponent was able to shove wave after wave into the tower. \n\n2. Second, if you guys saw the part where i was spam pinging on amumu  and nobody responded that made me  rage completely.  I would like to see the replay and know exactly why my team didn't react  but from my perspective it made no sense.  Thats when i went on full blown tilt. \n\n3.  I normally use 19 arpen runes,  which scale hard even when u fall behind. Since getting a little higher in mmr i have switched to something a little bit better for lane but fall off harder if i don't get fed. As a result i have absolutely no idea how to play from behind. Its either i get fed and carry or fall behind and am utterly useless for the rest of the game. \n\n......This is my version of events, and the way i feel things happen. But as they say a dancer doesn't see his back, so i would appreciate feedback from anyone who spectated the game to tell me what exactly they thought i did wrong. I want to learn from this lel","replies":[]}
