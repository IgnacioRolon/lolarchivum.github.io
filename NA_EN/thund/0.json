So i noticed that the back animation for Pool party Rek'Sai is bugged, if you recall at first nothing is wrong but once you learned W and burrow yourself in and out in your recall instead of eating the frog you stay still, this only happens when you W yourself and your recall animation will not work properly.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1vbaApLZqI","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/W1vbaApLZqI/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pool party rek&#039;sai&#039;s body/sculpture? is broken. Instead of having 1 snorkel on 1 side and the little bracelet on her left side. she has 2 snorkels and 2 bracelet. Riot please fix this, i bought this skin and i am kinda disapointed.\r\n\r\nI found this vid on youtube displaying another bug that got fixed since then. But if you pause and look at reksai she has 2 snorkels and 2 bracelets, this is still a bug for me, however if you own this skin and dont see this bug, please write so in the comments :)","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2015-12-19T02:27:12.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thunderboy,\n\nThanks for the report!
