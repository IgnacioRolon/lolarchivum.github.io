In the vast majority of games in Diamond, it's the worst player who decides the game; sharing your advantage with them does nothing, because they aren't playing well enough to use it.\n\nAlso, bot lane being 0-2 while you're up 6 kills virtually never happens. More likely you hit level 6 and your bottom lane is 0-4 or 0-5, you're maybe 1-0 or 2-0 at best, if you're dominating your lane.

It's nowhere near a matter of meta if you ask me and it's definately nothing that requires systematic changes from Riot's side. The game's popularity has resulted in it being a casual game for many players so there's no room for much practice or self reflection. Even in high gold to low plat (medium tier) there's most of the time that one player that got fed in lane and the rest of the game revolves around them while there's no planing ahead for objectives or organized plays.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mob Piru","date":"2018-03-08T22:08:43.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i blame those death timers....","replies":[{"poster":"FCJAAAAGOOOO","date":"2018-03-08T22:10:11.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is is that death timers being at 0 still probably won't help a losing botlane protect their tower from falling before 7 minutes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"saltran","date":"2018-03-09T21:54:14.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cry more pls.","replies":[]}]}
