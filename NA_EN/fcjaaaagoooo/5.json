It makes you resent your teammates as you compete for resources with them and their failures have disproportionate impact on you as this game unlike Heroes of The Storm for example has the concept of a fed lane.\n\nIn Heroes of The Storm, no matter how many tiems a bad Jaina (mage) dies to a Valeera in her lane (assassin), that Valeera will never become a raid boss for the rest of your team to face.\n\nAnd what's more, as unskilled as the Jaina is, it won't be a snowball disadvantage as Heroes of The Storm passively gives you power spikes much more frequently so you are caught up to the opponent for much of the match or at worst at a slight disadvantage. It all comes down to how well you rotate, and how well you teamfight, not about amassing unsurpassable advantages against a lesser skilled foes and making the rest of your enemies pay for their deficient team mate.\n\nThis game:\n\n1) Splits XP the more people in a lane.\n2) Splits gold\n3) Makes you resent kill stealers as a person KS'ing you is the difference between whether a roam is worth or not compared to AFK farming your waves since gold income is an active endeavor far more than a passive caught up mechanism.\n4) It doesn't matter if a jungler finally ganked the top lane you were farming under turret 50 CS behind the opponent if you didn't get the kill, you're still in the same crap state, that's how much a difference an assist makes vs. a kill. Assists need to be more rewarding, or kills need to be brought down to the levels of assists in xp and gold payout.\n\nIf this game was much more diligent about passive catch up gold and XP to keep matches more even instead of total stomps, the game would be less wretched for most people.\n\nYes, in league with some champs you can 1v9, but the flip side to that is that bad players and trolls can drag you down far worse as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T09:36:21.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is accurate, the game mechanics do promote individualism, but to what end is this point? It remains a team game, where the sum of the team is multiplied by how well they cooperate- that is, to build an effective strategy against the enemy and execute it.\n\nI notice that players with a strong lead tend to try to push their lead, often times exposing themselves. The good ones just take advantage of mistakes (which happens all the time) while preparing for the next step to winning. I believe that the problem in that case is not that there is a raidboss, but that the team isn't doing what they need to win. That skilled player was doing a favor for the losing team in capitalizing on mistakes.\n\nInversely, having the unskilled player on your team is at worst a roadbump. Look at it this way; if you're skilled (of course!) then there is a 4/9 chance you'll have an unskilled player on your team, and a 5/9 chance the enemy will. So the presence of unskilled players at your rank is actually a slight statistical advantage.

It’s at best a version of the meme that says “if I were faced with a disadvantage in game, I would simply, not be faced with it”. \n\nIndividualism is an anti-social behavior. In League’s case it has the specific consequence of pitting you against your team even when you’re reliant on them to win, and it encourages you to blame your own shortcomings on that of your teammates and draw false conclusions on situations like whether enemy champions are overpowered, or your teammates were deliberately feeding. Saying the game should evolve to mitigate this aspect isn’t unproductive. League players have a specific reputation of being some of the most unbearable in the gaming world, and I don’t think that’s a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightsky Pirate","date":"2020-01-25T16:22:17.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not \"skilled enough\", its \"strategic enough\".

Tristana wins mid lane handily, but decides she will split push all game long when the enemy team has a nocturne+fiora in their comp and we lose the game since she throws all that lead trying to win the game on her own instead of taking those leads with her team and crushing teamfights (we won every single teamfight she actually was in, but that rarely happened and her selfishness cost us elder dragon after we had captured every previous dragon and turned the game around for the enemy team).\n\nThis game is filled with people who only care to win their lane and try to 1v9. It does not encourage teamplay whatsoever.\n\nIn Heroes of The Storm this would never happen because there is never a point where an enemy Vayne or Jax or Yi gets fed 12 kills by deficient players early and they can just 1v9.
