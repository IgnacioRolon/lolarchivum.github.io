It's to wholly portray just what queuing into ranked is like right now on your own for those who either are unfamiliar with ranked or are having trouble climbing.  Assuming you aren't a smurf and therefore your team has a less likely chance of having a smurf than the other, you will always be on the short end of the stick.  **And therefore you must always play LIKE you're a smurf in ranked in order to actually climb.**  No ifs, ands or buts about it - if you aren't ready for anything, don't queue into Ranked.  It'll be a waste of time.  Don't waste a higher-ranked friend's time in Duo Queue either.\n\nI myself should have taken a long water break before considering queuing into that ranked game as I was zoning out and awestruck at my new loss streak right after a 7-game winstreak, thinking \"surely my luck will change\".  That is no excuse.  The shame is on me in that I wasn't at my peak nor playing with an optimal mindset going into that or the two games before then, yet queue'd up anyway.\n\nBe at your peak in every ranked game you play.  \n\nNo exceptions.","replies":[]}
