So why not True Armor?  Why not include a stat that can help counteract the sheer amount of DoT&#039;s and on-hit effects in the game?\n\nX True Armor would mitigate X incoming damage, post-resistances, every single time any amount of damage is taken. \n\n**However, True Armor wouldn&#039;t have to be busted like True Damage currently is:**\n\n* There wouldn&#039;t be much True Armor on any individual item - say, 3~5 True Armor on items that have it \n* If items that have True Armor have too much synergy, True Armor could simply be a Unique Passive\n* **True Armor would be strictly on non-tank items only**, and only possibly on a tank/juggernaut item in the form of an active or upon a certain condition being met\n* If True Armor is too powerful against creeps/objectives/etc., it would be halved rounded down versus non-champions or even simply do nothing against non-champion damage instead; alternatively, non-champions could have X True Armor Penetration (lol)\n* There would be NO &quot;%Health True Armor&quot;!  **EVER!!!**\n* Champions that are all about melting people with DoT&#039;s could get their lategame mechanics buffed to compensate.  They&#039;re mostly fairly linear anyway (Teemo, Brand and Malz for example; main them or not you have to admit there isn&#039;t much to any of these champions!).\n\nRiot would love it as it wouldn&#039;t counter crit marksmen or melee hypercarries since they do so much per hit the mitigation would be laughabe!  It wouldn&#039;t make games longer either because it would be on only OFFENSIVE ITEMS!  True Armor (or whatever they want to call it) could even be in runes of aggressive rune pages to replace bad/broken runes or even in the form of a shard!","replies":[{"poster":"Bob the Toastr","date":"2019-01-23T07:16:21.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had me until here:\n> True Armor would be strictly on non-tank items only\n\nIt amazes me that even in the state they're in people want to shit on tanks even more.

Heck they'd probably wind up rushing at least one of them every game.  Even a smidge of something like True Armor on a defensive item would make them immediately so obscenely tanky from the get-go.  Even if it were on the likes of Locket or a defense-oriented support item, every tank ever would just start rushing that item.  It'd be a no-brainer choice for all of them as well as sustain juggernauts, just like crit marksmen's ever-problematic {{item:3095}} right now.\n\nDamage-oriented champions, or even skirmishers/bruisers, on the other hand, would love the option of this stat.  True Armor would make many of them actually more sturdy than paper mache in this burst meta and actually potentially encourage a meta built around longer exchanges and teamfights which everyone loves.  Giving it to tanks willy-nilly would push that overboard and create the Tank meta again which we all...yeah.\n   \nTanks could still buy a true armor item eventually, but rushing any of them would (and should) be a clear pain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GreyfellD","date":"2019-01-23T05:07:43.456+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think this is a great idea, I've been wanting Riot to implement an item against True Damage for a long long time.
