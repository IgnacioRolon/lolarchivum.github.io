I would really like to play but I don't think it would be smart to in these conditions. Here is what I have.\n\nSpeedtest.net results: 12ms ping, 15.95 mbps download speed, and 2.26 mbps upload speed.\n\nComputer: Asus E5-571 laptop with i5 core and  something like 1.7 GHz up to 2.7 GHz with turbo boost. \n\nIn game:  Generally I have about 60 fps and 72 ms. But it jumps up throughout the game.\n\nNow I don't know computers real well but I would think that I would have enough power and internet speed to be able to play LoL without lag but I constantly have lag spikes throughout the game. Basically when abilities are used and during team fights I lag out for a few seconds at a time. And At times I feel like I am affected when last hitting minions. Now it's not just every once and a while but constantly throughout the entire game from start to finish.
