When I play alone I get 20 FPS and in team fights I get almost 4. Playing on an HP laptop and all my setting are on performance settings. Any suggestions to fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-19T15:47:07.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These drops in frames can happen if you have outdated drivers or bad game files, regardless of the in-game settings placed.

I was playing fine with 100 fps but ... i entered a game and i saw that my fps are 20... I was freaked out :P I tried to fix it with Malwarebytes and i removed some threats, then i restarted my pc but my fps was the same... The whole time on the game i am having around 20-30 fps and i cant play... I think its riot fault and i will wait for the next patch. I hope riot will fix some bugs and also i hope we will be able to play the game again because it is really hard to play a game with 20 Fps xD","replies":[]}]}
