Something like Kindred where, we dont know if she&#039;s real or not because she&#039;s based off of a fairy tail told by others, could we be playing champions who are &#039;recreated&#039; in the rift from their past history/tales of them and what not? i just thought it interesting since, because of the way time and space seem to work in the Rift, it makes me believe that they are just &quot;Figments of their ideals&quot; when they were alive. Just a thought i had recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2016-11-14T20:43:58.150+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"He didn't kill them.
