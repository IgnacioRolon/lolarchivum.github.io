{"poster":"mi ramfan","date":"2014-11-14T18:50:07.432+0000","title":"@Morello: What would you think of a CC effect that disables movement abilities?","subforum":"Gameplay","up_votes":63,"down_votes":10,"body":"So this thought came to me earlier today in the middle of an exam and it kind of screwed over my score. \r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of talk about mobility creep lately with the coming release of Kallista, arguably the most mobile AD carry in League of Legends history. At the same time, we've experienced the recent release of Azir, whose ultimate prevents enemy movement from passing through it.\r\n\r\nWhat if we added a mechanic on thematically fitting champions that would prevent enemies from using any spell that causes them to move, Flash exempted? \r\n\r\nWhat this would do would provide some counterplay for less mobile champions to more mobile champions by allowing them to restrict the mobile champion to their normal movement rate. This would allow the team with less mobility to either prevent enemy engagements at inopportune times or make it easier for them to catch out a group of enemy mobile champions. \r\n\r\n#Mechanics\r\n\r\nThis CC would require some interactions to be programmed in order for appropriate counterplay to be maintained. \r\n\r\n* Flash, Teleport, and Recall are NOT considered to be movement spells for the purposes of this CC. You may Flash while unable to use your Champion's gapclosers, and if this CC is applied to you by a non-damaging ability while you are recalling, you would be allowed to finish the Recall so long as you did not take damage. \r\n* \"Unstoppable\" spells are NOT affected by this CC. For example, Malphite's ultimate, Jarvan's ultimate, and Vi's ultimate would all still be castable during this CC. \r\n* If this CC is cast on someone while they are mid-gapcloser, their gapcloser will be allowed to finish as normal. For example, you couldn't cancel a Leona E with this CC once she was already in motion. \r\n* This CC is cleansed by Mercurial Scimtar, Mikhael's Crucible, and Cleanse like a non-displacement CC, and is reduced by Mercury's Treads. \r\n* This CC does not affect displacement spells cast by unaffected champions. For example, somebody who has this CC applied could still click Thresh's Lantern, be pulled in by Kalista's ultimate (but be unable to dash until the duration of the CC ends), and be knocked back by an Alistar headbutt or pulled by Blitzcrank.\r\n\r\nLet's see what this effect would have when added to a few particularly-fitting champions: \r\n\r\n{{champion:22}} (Frost Shot)\r\n\r\nThis addition requires a small change to Frost Shot's mechanics in order to retain counterplay: \r\n\r\n>Frost Shot\r\n>Toggled On: Autoattacks slow enemies by X% for Y seconds. Additionally, the champion Ashe has most recently attacked with Frost Shot active cannot use movement abilities. (Does NOT proc on Volley)\r\n\r\nWith this change, Ashe would gain a massive buff to her kiting ability in the mobility metagame. Currently, Ashe can kite immobile champions like Udyr but has no way to deal with champions like Zed, Jarvan, and Vi by herself. With this change, Ashe would become able to prevent one assassin or bruiser who is within her range from jumping onto her, but she would still be unable to protect herself from multiple attackers or attackers who get the jump on her. \r\n\r\n{{champion:27}}  (Mega Adhesive)\r\n\r\nBy preventing enemy champions from dashing out of Mega Adhesive, Singed would gain a much needed buff that would help him survive in top lane against the likes of Renekton and Lee Sin. Placing Mega Adhesive on top of the enemy laner would give Singed time to poison minions and potentially escape before his opponent leaves the spell's area of effect. Additionally, this change would buff Singed's late game as well by making him easier to engage with in the late game. Counterplay to this kind of engage still exists because of Mega Adhesive's poor cast range and the potential to escape the area of effect before Singed reaches an enemy for a fling. \r\n\r\n{{champion:91}} (Cutthroat) \r\n\r\nTalon was toxic as hell with a full silence because it was impossible to trade with him or escape from his burst. However, having only a massive, miniscule duration slow on his E left much to be desired. Giving him the ability to prevent gapclosers on his E instead of the slow would make him more effective at his role while still allowing enemies to fight back when he jumps onto them. \r\n\r\n{{champion:113}} (Permafrost) \r\n\r\nWhile Sejuani packs amazing teamfight initiation and ganking, her damage potential leaves much to be desired. Her main source of damage comes from her W, which requires her to stick to targets for an extended duration to deal its maximum damage. With so many enemy gapclosers and her Q's long cooldown, Sejuani must choose between using Q to get in range, or using Q to stay in range, neither of which bodes well for her in a meta where almost no other jungler has to make that choice. If the Permafrost active prevented the enemy from using gapclosers for as long as the increased slow lasted, she would have a much easier time getting her W damage off. \r\n\r\n{{champion:77}}  (Bear Stance)\r\n\r\n>Bear Stance\r\n>Activation: Udyr gains X% bonus movement speed for 3 seconds.\r\n>While Active: Udyr's autoattacks stun enemies for 1 second and prevent them from using mobility spells for 2 seconds afterwards. This effect cannot occur more than once every Y seconds. \r\n\r\nUdyr's problems have grown as the game has grown more mobility-based, because while his damage in melee range is extremely high, his ability to actually reach melee range is limited at best and he has no way to stay in melee range while DPSing. This ability would increase Udyr's ability to deal his damage after catching an enemy while not actually making it any easier for him to catch enemies. \r\n\r\n#Counterplay\r\n\r\nObviously, with any CC effect that limits movement, counterplay is a concern. This type of CC would have more counterplay than most because unlike a full silence, the affected target is free to fight back, and unlike a full snare, running away is still an option. Instead, this type of CC allows the target to choose to use Flash/Cleanse, run away without the ability to use gapclosers, or fight. \r\n\r\nFor gameplay reasons, some spells would have to be nerfed in order to compensate for the addition of this mechanic. However, I feel that the benefits of adding this mechanic outweigh the risks that come with adding it to the game. \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading. I know this idea sounds a little weird, but I'm confident that it could be really effective at curbing mobility creep if implemented well. \r\n\r\nWhat champions would you like to see this effect on?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaleidos","date":"2014-11-15T04:37:11.329+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why bother making an entirely new CC?

However, I do see some potential problems:\n\n1. This debuff targets a specific group of champions, and has no impact on others, making this potentially difficult to balance around. If this effect is too prevalent and too powerful, this could render mobility champions unplayable.\n\n2. Many mobility champions also gain a buff or do damage as part of their dashes (i.e. Katarina's Shunpo). This disable would reduce combat capability of these champions.\n\n3. Is this actually necessary? Stuns, silence, suppression, and roots already accomplish this task (and with a little more oomph too). \n\n---\nAnyways, onto champions mentioned:\n\n{{champion:27}}{{champion:91}}{{champion:113}}  I like this idea for these champions. It gives them a good way to initiate or zone, without being too OP (in my opinion).\n\n{{champion:22}} I don't think having this status effect on her frost shot would be very healthy for gameplay. It would either be totally abusive with her able to keep it permanently applied it would either need to have a lockout window where it can't be applied to the same champion for some short duration. The first case would just not be fun to play against, and the second would require a lot of skill and un-fun decision making to use effectively. \n\n{{champion:77}} I don't really think Udyr needs this. His movement speed is his Achilles heel. He has the ability to cruise around the map and his short cd stun gives him a lot of utility. Giving him this ability on top of his stun would remove a significant amount of counterplay against Udyr.\n\n{{champion:59}} (someone else mentioned him) I don't think J4's ult needs this. Being able to escape his ult gives rise to strategic gameplay for both teams.\n---\n\nOther champions I think this might be interesting on:\n\n{{champion:131}} Adding this effect to her vacuum ability (and maybe increasing its range) could open her kit for other changes, and allow for some interesting tactics.\n\n{{champion:60}} This might be interesting to add to her rappel, if she rappels onto an enemy champion. \n\n{{champion:28}} Maybe on her ult? This is more of a food for thought suggestion, I don't really think she needs it.\n\n{{champion:30}}  Putting this on his Wall of Pain could be interesting.\n\n{{champion:75}}  Put this on Wither, and increase the cooldown to compensate.\n\n{{champion:133}} Vault (as Quinn only)","replies":[{"poster":"AbodyHUN666","date":"2014-11-15T01:59:11.634+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus W would be a little too much, the end of it already feels like a snare, and he doesn't really need a second rotation of it to catch you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"manbearswine","date":"2014-11-15T00:58:06.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's best to place it on champions who need it,instead of things which it sorta fits thematically,so I would focus on off meta immobile squishies.\n\nviktor gravity thingo would be good,possibly an added debuff to brands e/etc.(generally placed on reliable parts of those champions,and definetly not on something with as much mobility as elise,this is supposed to shake the mobility meta,not help elise establish dominance)","replies":[{"poster":"Tarreb","date":"2014-11-15T11:37:07.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do think some degree of thematic flair is necessary between debuffs and their associated abilities. The presence of a coherent theme leads to clarity and understanding of a champions capabilities. Brand is a champion I feel has a pretty clear and consistent theme: his abilties cause an additional source of damage by setting the target ablaze, and if the target is already ablaze, they get a bonus effect. This steers his gameplay into trying to land combos onto his target to achieve the greatest effect. When playing against him, this theme indicates the method of counterplay: keep aware of his skillshots. That being said, I don't really know where on Brand's curret kit this debuff would fit in.\nQ: Already has a stun\nW: This is the ability that would benefit most from a target suffering the debuff\nE: I guess it could maybe fit here.

Elise is kind of in a weird (read: bad) spot at the moment, and this change would likely do very little to change that. Beyond that, I don't actually see a problem with a high mobility champion like Elise having the capability to apply this kind of debuff. Putting an anti-mobility ability on a mobile champion would still help to \"shake up the mobility meta.\" Personally, I think it would be kind of interesting to see Elise have a greater focus on hunting down some of the more elusive champions, and I think it would fit her style. She's a spider (at least part of the time), and spiders trap and hunt relatively nimble insects. \n\nFinally, we must remember the goal here isn't to nerf mobility (and the champions who rely on it) into non-existence, the goal is to create interesting and meaningful gameplay. Additionally, we don't need a Rock Paper Scissors style of power balance where immobile beats anti-mobility beats mobility beats immobile. This leads to purely reactive and limiting choices, which results in an even more limited meta and less fun.

If Viktor simply drops it at an enemies feet with their dash available, they're probably not going to get stunned. But used tactically, it is still incredibly effective. If an enemy is forced to dash, it leaves them open for follow up attacks by Viktor or his teammates. If Viktor waits to place it after the enemy has dashed, it's gonna be harder to be avoided. But the trap doesn't have to be simply laid at the enemies feet. It can be placed around them to force them in another direction, prevent them from chasing or retreating, or give them the Sofie's Choice between eating the stun or something else. The trap is still effective against mobile champions, depending on how it is used.\n\n> > Onto Elise.

Mobility is incredibly strong and I personally believe my LOL experience would be better if there were ways to combat said mobility creep without resorting to more mobility as a counter. Unfortunately, I feel like it's unlikely for Riot to adopt this CC.\n\nHere's the main reason: Riot is all about clarity (and perhaps simplicity). You mentioned Zed in your Ashe example. So with this new CC (I'll call it *cripple*) he can't use his shadow **teleport** (from his W). But he can still use his W initially to get the shadow mimicking portion. I can visualize many examples where players can't understand why they couldn't teleport back to their shadow. Then they rage and complain to Riot about the bugs (you know the playerbase here).\n\nNotice how Riot has been getting rid of silences recently? It's weird, especially for new players, when you can run around and auto and do everything normally except for casting spells. From what I understand, Riot does not like silences because it's this ambiguous CC that confuses players. \n\nNow imagine an even more ambiguous CC such as *crippled*.

When Assassins, (The most thematically fitting for silence) have it, anyone who can't shut them down early enough has little chance to fight back once its click- you have no damage while i 100-0 you.\n\nSoraka for instance is an example of Riot adding more silence to the game, and in truth Silence is not ambiguous at all. Anyone who has ever played an RPG should understand the concept of silence and the Chat bubble ... symbol relays this well enough. Overall Riot is not against Silence as a form of CC, but rather believe that it is better to delegate it to utility characters like lulu and soraka since in the mid lane, there is no counterplay to having both high damage and stopping your opponent from doing any while you do that high damage.","replies":[{"poster":"OyddAWqJ5r","date":"2014-11-14T23:18:35.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Riot has been removing silences from the mid lane since they **encourage** little to no counterplay in a lane where all damage is determined by abilities.\n\nI believe you mean **discourage**.\n\nEdit: Grammar fail, misinterpreted.","replies":[{"poster":"AnomalousChimera","date":"2014-11-14T23:59:03.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.

If there's a champion that is running up to you in clear vision 9/10 times you can peel/kill him before he gets to you just because of how supports and range work. \n\nMost times you die to an assassin it's because they get to you from the side or some angle where you couldn't spot them until too late, So this CC becomes great against bad players but useless against someone who knows how to get the jump on you by controlling vision.\n\ne.g. Fiddles jumps on you from the side, will that CC help you? Rengar gets on you, Ghostbladed Talon appears from side and pops ult...basically, you need to pre empt the gap closer to actually use this CC and if I can pre empt it....a stun/snare/root is 10x more effective. \n\nAlso, the fantasy you have of Ashe 1 v 1 ing guys with gap closers is EXTREMELY toxic to this game. When ashe was strong back in s1 she was the sole reason that xin zhao and other cancerous bruisers were created, and then those bruisers were the reason cancer Vayne and super adcs with ms were created and here we are now. \n\nADC is a team based role that when offered protection, can pump out a RIDICULOUS amount of team fight damage. ADC's 1 v 1 ing bruisers/assassins is not healthy for the game in its current states because they are already ridiculously strong in team fights. When Vayne is ahead in a game, tell me how good it feels to play anything in that game? You can't kill her in team fights because of her stealth, she kills your tanks and in split push she can 1 v 1 all your assassins and bruisers. A world in which even the least mobile of adcs (Ashe) can beat bruisers with gap closers means that the ones WITH mobility will literally become unkillable.\n\nDoes this mean I hate ashe? No i love her, I feel she's what adc's should be about, positioning and timing strategically rather than Korean APM mechanics. The reason this game has shifted to Asian dominance of late is not because Koreans have some superior strategy or brains, it's just that they are naturally more gifted in hand eye coordination and speed.
