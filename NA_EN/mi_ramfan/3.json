That is, top laners who were stronger/more oppressive than Renekton in lane would get nerfs, while top laners who were weaker than Renekton and needed help would (in theory, though not really all that often in practice) get buffs. This decision became known as the infamous \"Renekton bar\". \r\n\r\nNow, in the year ~~2015~~ 20XX, Riot has decided that the jungle will be balanced around Lee Sin, Jarvan, and Vi. Any dedicated jungler who is weaker than the three will be buffed, while any jungler who is stronger (heh) than the three will be nerfed. \r\n\r\nWhat changes does Riot make to the other dedicated junglers to put them on par with the new balance?","replies":[{"poster":"aGentleGrabnFist","date":"2015-02-06T16:06:20.081+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shut your gosh darn mouth.
