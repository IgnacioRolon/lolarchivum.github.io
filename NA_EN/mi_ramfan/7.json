We already have Lucian and Vayne when it comes to tragic Demacian figure - Fiora should represent the epitome of finesse and nobility. She is both defined by her skill as by her arrogance. All those who have doubted her inevitably met her blade, and she could always back up her words.  She is educated, snobbish, but also a fencing genius. She definitely has her place in Demacian politics; she has pride and poise. Even her fighting discipline alludes to the idea that she is a fighter within the royal court more than a soldier. \n\nIf I were to draw a parallel with another League character, then I'd say Fiora is diametrically opposed to Leblanc. While the leader of the Black Rose is a schemer who betrays and acts from the shadows, Fiora faces her enemies head-on. No games, no tricks, just skill and honor. \n\n*That* is who Fiora is.","replies":[{"poster":"Azertazan","date":"2015-02-07T18:02:50.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I see more of a dichotomy and tension between Talon{{champion:91}}  and Fiora {{champion:114}}.

What makes her more of an assassin than a powerful duelist is that her dueling potential is almost entirely reliant on her (R)-Blade Waltz. If you are a Fiora and have it up you can 1v1 anyone, however if you do not you're pretty much dead in most situations. Fiora is supposed to be the grand duelist and yet she isn't so grand without blade waltz.\n\nYes her W-Riposte can give her great dueling potential in addition with her attack speed steroid E-Burst of Speed. However these two skills alone do not make her a powerful duelist at all, but rather compliment the fact she can dish out sustained damage. These skills do not allow her to do what duelists do best which is outplay in any 1v1 scenario. Riposte can have the potential to outplay, but at the same time not really.\n\nCompare this ability to another great duelist and split pusher Jax.  Jax is a great duelist and as good if not better than fiora in this respect due to his skill E-Counter Strike. Unlike Riposte is pretty much nullify's EVERYTHING being thrown at Jax AND stuns the enemies! Fiora's Riposte only blocks a single auto attack or empowered strike (Like a Nasus Q for example); and while that is useful in key moment sin a duel where certain spells can turn a tide... it's not reliable at all.\n\nAll fiora gets from W thats reliable is more guaranteed damage from a passive effect. Jax imo is the Fiora that can be in team fights even without his ultimate and by definition IS the GRAND DUELIST. His passive does what fiora's E does, his E is a better version of her W and his W in both passive and active form make his dueling potential ridiculous. What Fiora needs is to be less akin to an all in assassin and more akin to a duelist like Jax.\n\nTo do this she needs to be able to respond to many attacks at many intervals, given resets and given the tools to out play anyone in a 1v1 or even a 2v1 scenario at the expense of her assassin like qualities, that being invulnerability from blade waltz.

I am actually scared that if you change her to much or some core components this might change. So in my opinions i would not change the core components which make her what she is. However you can add things on top of her. \n\nFiora core components are in my opinion:\n(Champion wise) That she is not girlish but rather a strong, determined, smart and sharp young woman who knows what to and when to do it. She thinks things through and after she takes a decision there is no going back. She is pretty but she puts more focus into athletics than makeup.\n(In Battle) If you decide to go in with her in the right moment there is no getting out anymore(you used Q two times). Then you in the heat of the duel and if you press the right buttons in the right time, riposte just about when they are about to empower their hit and burst of speed when their CC is on cooldown, then you are supposed to win every duel by a lot. Fiora is second strongest melee DPS (after Trynda) after all.\n(In Battle) she has no CC and escapes but really high DPS.\n\n\nFiora bonus components or things which can be added in my opinion are:\n(Champion wise) She gets a background and a reason why she is this strong of a dueler. Second strongest DPS when compared with other champions which are mostly gods, just feels a little unfitting. I think you need to add something there as to where she breaks out of a random fencer and becomes something more.. What more i don't know myself, it could be actually something mysterious where no one knows what. But she has to be lore wise someone can can kill gods with raw power and precise skill.\n(In Battle) Her ulti in a team fights is a little boring in the sense that you just press R and you have to pray to the RNG gods that something good happens even if you are a skilled player. On the other side she will make it a Penta even if you are really unskilled only by being feed. Thats something which has to change on her. Her Ulti should keep her a dueler but with her ulti you are not dueling only one enemy but rather two-three enemy's. She gets mobility to jump from one to another (dodging some skills when doing right), and something in that direction. She gets empowered like Riven does. That would bring them a little closer.

The lane sustain is welcome, but I don't know how fitting it is for a *duelist* to have this kind of passive. Especially since she's so squishy. In an actual 1v1 fight its not really going to do much unless you either kill them quickly or trade and run away.\n\n\nMake her Q a skillshot dash like renektons. \n\nDo something with riposte, I don't know what. I really like riposte as it is, Many a time have I outplayed someone using it, but something just feels wrong about it. Maybe if she deflects an attack instead of doing damage it shreds their armor, opening them up for a burst?\n\nE- No idea what to do with this. This is as good a steroid as any. \n\nR- This thing just needs to be either completely changed, or be more reliable. If I ult Leblanc I'm basically just killing myself, because of her stealth negating most of the damage. I'd honestly like to see it be something like Legion commander from DoTA. Forcibly dueling someone for a while. Perhaps removing both of you from play for a while, making you both un-targettable by either team then fighting it out?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tofutime","date":"2015-02-04T22:18:40.055+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't think sword art online should be her inspiration.

One skill idea I was tossing around in my head for a while was making Riposte a very short duration spellshield (like, less then 1 second), but reducing the cooldown to 2 seconds on a successful block, so that you were rewarded for fast reflexes while still leaving some counterplay to her opponents (bait out her spellshield or use your CC in her vulnerable window).","replies":[{"poster":"Cuix","date":"2015-02-05T00:20:22.556+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I just chose GIFs from it because they're flashy and do a good job of showing off what Fiora should be doing (parrying your attacks and then cutting you to pieces with her sword).\n\nReally?

High ELO. \nI disagree with your current pictures. \n\nYour TL;DR says she should \"primarily be a duelist and not ulting in teamfights.\" \nI agree. \nThat is exactly what Riot did in their latest patch on Fiora. They gave her ult less Multi-Target Damage and more Single-Target Damage. In my opinion as a Mid/Top/Jungle player, there are very FEW champions that counter Fiora in lane. She is such a strong duelist and 1v1 champ, that it always requires the enemy jungler to shut me down.\n\nThe major problem I see with Fiora is the stigma against her. Out of 50 games, I probably get about 2-3 ganks.\nAs a Fiora player, you must always prove yourself to your teammates first.
