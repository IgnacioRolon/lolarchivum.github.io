Ever since then, instead of just opening the client, it opens the old launcher saying that the client update is coming soon where the launch button brings me to the new client. After the initial update, my desktop icon changed to the new one and everything but now its back to the old icon and brings me to the old launcher. Can't seem to fix this, reinstalled again today and it did nothing. help","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-02T17:28:02.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Installer goes up to the last version of the legacy client, and not the current version.  We're technically in the last phase of the updated client transition, so at some point should ever continue to go well, old files will be removed and we'll just have the new client.    Something sounds really off, though, if you keep getting the old launcher into the new version.\n\nI would recommend using the HRT to do a clean uninstall instead.  This will get rid of anything that could be causing this miswire, and redownload the game again.  I hope that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"SiIIyRabbit","date":"2017-08-02T20:54:52.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I feel like the HRT is what messed me up in the first place but I'll try that again, it's just bothersome reinstalling so many times because it takes so long {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]}
