My Teemoing shop this year contains skins from ZERO CHAMPS I OWN and three of them I HAVE NEVER PLAYED ONCE in my life.\r\n\r\nReally glad I got such exclusive offers- every single offer costs more than the skin does by itself because I have none of the champions. Absolutely ridiculous how dense the system can be to the point where none of the offers I get are from champs I own or have played.","replies":[{"poster":"InvisaBishh","date":"2016-10-24T01:51:08.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay...
