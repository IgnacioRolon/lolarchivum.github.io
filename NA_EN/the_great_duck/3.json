There's different playstyles that work. Can you IMAGINE a random mastery element being added in there like in League? That doesn't create diversity, it DESTROYS it. At least in the old rune page system you were given different flat or scaling stat options that affect your laning phase vs your late game. Maybe you'd take extra armor for an all AD comp or more health and magic resistance for those AP matchups. The mastery system, across all seasons, was ass. It was either 21/9/0 or the same keystone like 80% of the time for a single champion. Leave diversity to the champion design, which will make things a LOT easier to balance in a healthy manner without indirectly nerfing or breaking others who use the same keystones. See *Aftershock*, *Fleet Footwork*, etc.\r\n\r\n* You know that feeling in league when you die 1v1 or because of a cancer gank against a broken/overpowered champ that makes you scream \"why riot didnt nerf.\" To be down a kill in gold and have the enemy back and tp buying something broken giving you no chance of winning lane and having you sit at turret for the next 15 mins hoping your teammates do well but they don't and you're 50 cs down against an Irelia who can 1v9 (WHOM YOU'VE BARELY TOUCHED IN YOUR PBE when even your strongest, highest elo players, including pro players, have OFTEN talked about how disgustingly busted this champion is, and you're twiddling your thumbs wondering what went wrong and why the game has gone downhill in recent months.)\r\n\r\nGranted Fortnite is a different genre. However, it is also F2P, and FUN 2 play, especially when weapons are moderately well-balanced and the biggest rewards have real risks. A user holding a weapon only a class or two below will still have a very reasonable chance of winning a gunfight, provided that user is a lot more skilled.  Which kind of brings me to the ranked experience in this game which, only very recently have you FINALLY decided to address players' desires to take their SKILL into account when it comes to LP gains and losses. Like honestly, what the f*ck. Unless you are a smurf playing ranked at least two tiers+ above your elo's average skill level, good luck to you. The weakest player truly decides the games. Your bot lane Trist could start the game 5/0/2 but it doesn't matter when their Udyr's sporting {{item:3047}} {{item:1419}} and SHREDDING her after running in at like 800 movement speed. And that man took like 9 autos and was still alive and kicking. I played my ass off that game as a support, only to have 17 LP deducted. I could've played like absolute ass like the enemy support, only all she had to do was mash her buttons now and then and get hard-carried. It's utter bullshit, and only NOW do you think about addressing it? F*ck that. \r\n\r\nFortnite's a game simple enough to explain to a newbie and can play casually or competitively with and have a good time. I can't do that in League anymore. There's like 100 ideas to explain, which will change like every two weeks. so unless you've got the game knowledge and experience, you won't understand how impactful every patch note will be on the champions it touches upon or doesn't.\r\n\r\nI've played since season 3, but after giving this game a chance, it's pretty much my main game to play with friends and solo. Instead of fixing Rift, you're patching ARAM. F*ck this game.","replies":[{"poster":"UnboundHades","date":"2018-06-23T05:07:48.203+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your comparisons are garbage and wouldn't work even if league and Fortnite were the same genre of game","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirLucsean","date":"2018-06-23T05:15:21.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry about Fortnite, but it has left a bad a taste in my mouth.

League &gt; FortNite\n> Playing with friends in FortNite = Fun. Playing League with friends = Fun. FortNite == League\n\nIf League's still your main cup of tea, be my guest. What I don't understand is what makes League much fun anymore, solo or with friends. The games are decided in the first 10 minutes, making a couple mistakes will lose you lane most of the time in which it's almost impossible to come back without your jungler's help. Back then if you were behind, farming under tower was much safer and splitpushing was effective (without a Rift Herald) so as long as you timed your farming right, your team won't spend much time skirmishing without you and you could get back into the game. But when getting caught once virtually means a quick death, it's too risky to do that anymore. Good luck playing a tank and trying to catch up. Your only option is to sit with your team and hope they make a good pick so you can farm assists but until then, you're starved of gold completely.\n\nI don't know dude. If anything, League's more catered to casuals with its faster pace and instadeath, instant-gratification rewards and gameplay. There's hardly much time to make tactical decisions or work around positioning in team fights that last like 7 seconds. League of tanks was cancerous but at least there was more time to back off or assist your carries rather than have them blow up if they don't have two Janna shields on them. And at the same time they made it a lot harder for new players to understand the game because of the overabundance of items, constant updates and new champions with like 8 unique passives on them. They got rid of a lot of fun champion artwork and VOs like Gangplank, reworked useful counterpick champs like Galio into busted characters that didn't get real nerfs for months, and while I know doing some % dmg nerf across the board isn't a bright idea, Some damage nerfs should be on every patch, rather than buffing damage on anyone.\n\nRiot could care less about all of us most of the time. I understand they're a business but I mean when they start preying upon all of you through cheap gimmicks and shoddy balance work and try to buy you out with some random God King skin to sweep their bullshit under the rug and hope you don't notice, it's despicable. The game was successful before and definitely a lot better received by both casuals and competitive players. A lot of streamers dropped the game. High elo players with more experience than any of us.

If your argument Is that Scuttle is riots first terrible change you have not experienced enough of this game. Not everything released is healthy or fun, some times a meta dicks really when if your dedicated to a playstyle. Its gonna shift again how ever, it does so every year and you adapt to it, have fun playing the way you want, or you quit if you stop having fun (do this! take a break, Burn out is real, your gonna find it in most games but mobas stand out). One perk about league being FTP is ya can keep an eye on preseason and midseason to see what ever it was you liked has returned to the gameplay.\n\nRisks are good, You fuck up and you learn more. You nail it and its a positive experience. I mean this next bit here, League wouldn't exist if riot did not take risks with their game. They changed how Mobas Played. The pregame stats via runes and mastery's, The separation of Kits into Ad and Ap, Moving away from a copy and paste cookie cutter port of WC3 old ass map editor and all its inherent struggles (turn speed, jungle camp stacking, denying farm, etc) And the abundance of skill shots, this is what separated leagues gameplay, their F2P model is what built up its player base so rapidly, but the time sink folks into its gameplay is all because riot takes risks.   \n\nFor the record if the day ever comes when they don't, when they are to worried about losing casual players, or just maintaining #s of people on the servers, when Riot gets to scared to make a risky change, that's when it starts to die for me. No change made is forever in league, that's a core part of the games health, for me atleast.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
