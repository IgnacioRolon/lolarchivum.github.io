I'd rather get the bugsplat errors than be able to join a game, but, when you need your ult or heal or use a ward I literally have to spam the button 10 times before it will work. It is not my keyboard and mouse. I just bought new ones and they do this too. Furthermore, I don't see how i'd have the same Hotkey issue in ONLY this game with BOTH pieces of equipment. \r\n\r\nI tried deleting my config file and restoring defaults, nothing has worked. I found an archived post that had links to \"clean starting windows\" but the links no longer work. It was suggested that it could be a 3rd party program registering these hotkeys. Where can i find this out? I have nothing running to my knowledge. \r\n\r\nRito, please help. I don't want to quit this game I love after like 4 years, but I can't play and let my team down because I can't use my abilities in the middle of a fight.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nZim","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T01:18:57.053+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea this sounds like the config files saved server side somehow got messed up and haven't been able to reset themselves yet. Follow these steps exactly and you'll be able to push that manual reset through.\n\n- Log into the game client\n- Navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\\n- Delete the folder named **Config**\n- Go into a practice game and verify that settings have saved properly. \n- Leave game to sync settings","replies":[{"poster":"Zimlem","date":"2017-10-04T17:38:01.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked for about 10 minutes. Soon as i changed my hotkeys from QWER to WERT it's back to bugged. Any other suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-10-04T20:24:28.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like the main problem is that your config settings just refuse to save correctly. Essentially, when you change the settings they don't save correctly so then the next time you load the game, the incorrect settings are pulled from the server again. We save those settings server side so that you can freely change computers and retain all your custom hotkeys and such.\n\nThe only way I personally know of to get those settings updated is by following those steps I listed above exactly. That method forces the settings to save again, so let's try that a couple more times really quickly to see if this didn't work because of some weird hiccup. In the meantime I'm going to reach out to my tech guys to see if they can think up a better way to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"Berenerd","date":"2017-10-08T00:16:54.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens to me.

Unfortunately it hasn't panned out for me. The reproduction rate is so spotty, I don't really understand it. If it was 100%, I'd say its a program or something running on my end. If it was fixed immediately, I'd say it was just a bugged config file. I just don't understand. I've been playing for years with the same setup ( new hardware, but just repurchased the same models ) and I've never had this problem before. Thanks in advance for anything else you can dig up for me.\n\nEDIT: Is it possible in any way it could be a latency issue?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Berenerd","date":"2017-10-14T04:41:52.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, I have found a corollary. Seems it happens when I have team viewer running in the background. (I am not only my family's IT guy but their friends and familys IT guy) If I exit out completely, the files don't get corrupted and I can play non-stop. I am curious if those of you having issues with this are using team viewer or some sort of remote client? @Broporo is this something you can check with people when this is brought up? If its true, there is an easy work around though it would be nice if there was a fix for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zimlem","date":"2017-10-06T00:40:07.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still hoping for a solution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sidernar","date":"2017-10-03T22:22:16.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Starting today this is happening to me.i've done two practice custom bot games and one of them had this. then i played two games and my team had to surrender due to my mouse click game isn't on point in the second one.\n\ndifference is my hot keys die before i even start and Ctrl modifier seems to work for leveling spells. \n\ndropped a ticket,but haven't heard back.","replies":[]}]}
