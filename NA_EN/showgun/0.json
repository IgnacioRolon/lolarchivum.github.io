I was able to find a bit of a workaround though, depending on how complicated your builds are for each lane. You could try having the one item set for Kayn, but separate the lanes into different boxes. \n\nFor instance: put some of the shared items in the first box, then put all of the top lane items in the next section followed by your jungling build. That way, you'll have access to both builds and are free to choose which one you're going to need once you're in a match.","replies":[{"poster":"ShowGun","date":"2017-07-16T16:54:10.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
