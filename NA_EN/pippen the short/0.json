This page will be dedicated towards emphasizing the fundamentals of good League of Legends play and will be targeted at the unRanked-Gold Elo players (or roughly 90% of ranked players on the NA server) who are looking to learn and improve their play. This is going to be like a generic, back to basics kind of page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said I need your replays, which all of us with the BETA client have easy access to, and I really need replays from all over the spectrum. From Bronze to Challenger that way I can compare and contrast, and if I could get a screenshot of the op.gg summary of the match to accompany each replay that would be awesome too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I know, I&#039;m giving myself about a 4 to 6 weeks of prep for this page in the anticipation   of getting a good amount of content to wade my way through and provide you with the best, high quality content I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you can send me your replays to: kohaitosenpaiLoL@gmail.com.  And in the header if you could just put &quot;Replay: (Summoner name)&quot; I would appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-06T01:29:58.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you put a channel link if we somehow had one? or give us a shoutout?","replies":[{"poster":"Pippen The Short","date":"2016-12-06T02:28:09.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=breakordoom444,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=TpUkNUaY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-06T01:29:58.916+0000)\n>\n> can you put a channel link if we somehow had one? or give us a shoutout?\n\nYeah I could do something like that. If you want a shout out in the video or something just put define the \"terms of use\" in the email you send with the replay. And if I accept the terms I'll let you know and use your content provided.","replies":[{"poster":"breakordoom444","date":"2016-12-23T17:00:35.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you need alot of hard carry replays give me your gmail","replies":[]}]}]}]}
