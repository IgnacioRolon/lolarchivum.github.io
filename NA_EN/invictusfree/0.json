But I used to play on wifi with 180-190 ping, without problem, but now it seems that delay is way too big! It's like having 500 ping delay but it says 180, it's really weird. Also, unplayable. What bothers me the most is that I am getting the easiest possible match ups, and most stupid enemy laners right then when I simply can't do much with 0.5-1sec delay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 Stylish","date":"2016-08-25T03:30:36.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While my issue wasn't as severe, for a few nights last week my ping went to 60 from 40 from 10pm to around 4:30am.
