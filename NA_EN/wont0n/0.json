It's problematic since i sort of wanted to get one of the offers from my shop. This has been a problem for about a year now, but i've ignored it since it's not that big a deal and i haven't really needed to contact support for anything.\r\n\r\nI suspect it may be because of my compromised email, the email that i made my account with got malaware'd or hacked by a bot, and started sending spam emails to everyone i've ever emailed, including riot support. Since then i've made a new email and linked it to my league of legends account, but this is the only thing i can think of that could be the reason.\r\n\r\nWould someone be able to look into why i can't log into support? i would send a support ticket, but you kinda need to log in to do that {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-22T23:31:42.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty strange!  I'm curious if your link to the login section is set to another region other than NA?  You can check on your url bar.  No worries, though, because we actually don't want you logging in for an account recovery.  \n\nWe have a more specific [account recovery form](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) for cases just like this, which will allow you to use an email address you have access to.  Fill that out and our account team will get back to you as soon as they can!","replies":[{"poster":"Wont0n","date":"2017-09-23T02:04:18.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i tried filling out one of the forms, it said that my account was suspended???\n\ni have no idea what this means since i'm able to get onto league of legends fine?\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/6c3e77f7c1eed9c92d71993c4f928d2a","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-09-23T15:11:51.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, hit us up directly via email at support@riotgames.com.
