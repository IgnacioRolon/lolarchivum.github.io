I've seen a couple other threads about this issue, so i thought that someone from riot has to have seen it and be working to fix the problem. But after this long, i still haven't gotten that ward skin back! would someone be able to look at it?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-13T04:09:50.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like pretty much everyone seems to be missing that ward (ourselves included) and it seems like whatever file makes it show up in the client just isn't working anymore. So far everyone still has the ward on their account, it just isn't showing up in champ select for some reason. I haven't heard from the Devs about this specifically, but I'm willing to bet it'll be fixed with the next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"VVry","date":"2017-12-13T19:24:35.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for an update!
