Now I finally understand why Riot is going through with this unbanning &quot;experiment&quot; they need to bring back players because they don&#039;t actually have new ones staying with the game when they first join.\r\n\r\nOof.","replies":[{"poster":"MagicFlyingLlama","date":"2018-08-06T00:27:52.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never seen a bot on my team in this game.\n\nThey only exist in _extremely_ low ELO, and they have always been there.
