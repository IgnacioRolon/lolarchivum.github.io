Can be toggled off.\n{{item:3379}} When magic damage is amplified on a champion, half of the bonus is dealt to everything within the aura over 3 seconds.\n{{item:3371}} Critical strikes cause the target to take (15% total AD) true damage over 3 seconds (multiple instances stack).\n{{item:3374}} Abilities deal 8% of their magic damage again over 3 seconds.\n{{item:3382}} Enemies caught in the active radius take the damage again over 3 seconds.\n{{item:3380}} Enemies with max stacks take 5% bonus physical damage as a DOT.\n{{item:3384}} Procs deal an additional (50% base AD) as true damage over 2 seconds.\n\nAs far as power goes, I think Ornn is actually fine. He (and his items) just need to be more satisfying than \"here's some stats\".","replies":[{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-08-28T06:59:22.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mmm i like most of these, that IE gonna have to change tho.","replies":[]}]}
