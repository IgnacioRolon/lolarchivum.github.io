We can also assume this to mean that he was a Shuriman king while he lived.\nLittle knight Amumu is the start of a little story arc. Amumu came back from the dead with no memories, and no knowledge of the world. With this in mind, he went to school with Annie (probably with some illusion magic that he got by having some mage take pity on him). While in this school, he got a role in the school play, which featured the legends of king Arthur. On opening night, he broke the sword prop, and was kicked out of the play. After a couple of months, Amumu had the idea of wrapping himself up and sending himself as a gift to Annie, his only friend. He got re-gifted. Later, he almost became prom king, but lost to some guy with Trump Hair. This defeat drove Amumu into a deep depression, which is seen in Emumu.\nSad Robot was an AI that was made to replicate Amumu&#039;s state of persistent sadness for research purposes. Also, they were allowed to do more to a Robot than to a real (even if undead) person.\nIn Suprise Party, some of the other champions threw a Party to celebrate the memory of Urf. Amumu came to join the fun, but he ran into the table with the cake, knocked it over, and ruined it. He got kicked out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2015-12-26T21:10:06.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love imagining the stories behind the skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Sharjo","date":"2015-12-26T21:19:50.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't wait for the day when we've got the whole setting down so that sometimes we can have some alternate reality skin stories going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Kindlejack","date":"2015-12-26T22:44:59.276+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sharjo,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FkJJecm1,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-26T21:19:50.388+0000)\n>\n> Can't wait for the day when we've got the whole setting down so that sometimes we can have some alternate reality skin stories going on.\n\nThis is something I'm personally very excited about.

It would seem to me that PFE and the Mecha line would be perfect protagonists against Creator Viktor's Battlecast line (even Xerath).\n\nRight now no, we don't have many skin lines that share the same alternate fantasy. However I would really like them to! I think each major skin line should be paired with an adversary so players can write awesome fanfic, play skin vs skin games etc. but there's no reason to stop there. Perhaps iBlitzcrank and PROJECT exist in the same world, but the iBlitzcranks are more like mass-produced private law enforcement while PROJECT are unique members of a cutting edge military experiments? If it's anything like Dominion: Tank Police I could see Officer Caitlyn and Vi rolling alongside an iBlitzcrank unit on Akira-eque motorcycles down the streets of New New Piltover. Compared to them though I would imagine more extreme anime skins like Super Galaxy Rumble and Neon Strike Vi might be what they watch on TV after a long shift.\n\nPulsefire Ezreal, as our very first sci-fi skin, never had any rivals but we have talked a lot about it as he is clearly fighting for the future of all mankind with his awesome tech. I personally think that Eternum would be a good match as they are inspired by the Mass Effect Reapers - beings from the darkness of space come to harvest mankind.\n\nBattlecast is for the most part less advanced. They are Robotnik'd* slaves with engines that spew black columns of smoke from diesel engines. During the tease for Battlecast Prime Cho'gath there was mention of blueprints acquired by 'The Resistance'. It was most likely imagined as a sort of Terminator future where Skynet is replaced with Viktor and there's no time travel to save them. Could be Full Metal Jayce, could be Resistance Caitlyn, could be both. I really hope in the future we have answers for you!\n\n*In the teaser for Vel'koz it describes how Viktor captured Vel'koz, encased his flesh in metal and inhibited the functions/freedom of his mind. Just like a certain Egg-shaped Doctor on Mobius.","replies":[{"poster":"Bioluminescence","date":"2015-12-28T23:05:14.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personal head-canon - DJ Sona exists in the PROJECT universe, and is a trapped/enslaved AI personality being forced to entertain at an illicit nightclub.  \n\nHer VO is confusing enough that I can make out lines like \"What is happening?\" and \"Let me out\" in the nonsense :)\n\nWhat's your opinion on where DJ Sona stands in relation to the other skin lines, Kindlejack?","replies":[{"poster":"Oerbà","date":"2015-12-29T19:25:42.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bioluminescence,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=FkJJecm1,comment-id=00000000000100030000000100000001,timestamp=2015-12-28T23:05:14.201+0000)\n>\n> Personal head-canon - DJ Sona exists in the PROJECT universe, and is a trapped/enslaved AI personality being forced to entertain at an illicit nightclub.  \n> \n> Her VO is confusing enough that I can make out lines like \"What is happening?\" and \"Let me out\" in the nonsense :)\n> \n> What's your opinion on where DJ Sona stands in relation to the other skin lines, Kindlejack?\n\nomg I thought I was the only one who thought so\n\nLike, the triangle she has on her back is almost the exact same as the triangles shared by the other PROJECT skins.
