She&#039;s far too slow after Dark Frenzy was removed.\n\n\n**Demon Shade**\n\nLook, I get what you&#039;re trying to do by gating her stealth to post-6, but it&#039;s not the right way to go\n\nEve has a decent clear speed, a fragile clear, and low early damage. That&#039;s nothing new, but old Eve could at least use her marginal damage to surprise an enemy.\n\nNow, Eve is weak to the point of absurdity until level 6. As a jungler, this is a death sentence. Did you learn nothing from the old Warwick?\n\nEve should be weak pre-6, but you guys didn&#039;t need to take her stealth away to do that; you already did it with the rest of her kit.\n\n**Hate Spike**\n\nEve&#039;s Q, her primary source of damage, deals a grand total of 130/180/230/280/330 base damage with a whopping 195% AP ratio.\n\nDoesn&#039;t sound so bad, eh? Well, look past the pretty number and into how you get it. All of it is insanely conditional.\n\nYou have to land the **entire** spell to get that number. Sounds reasonable, but it&#039;s quite problematic.\n\nFirst, the most obvious case: if you miss the dart. Missing the dart means you only have the un-enhanced hate spikes, which will deal a total of 75/90/105/120/135 (+ 90% AP) damage. This is reasonable.\n\nSecond, less obvious: if you can&#039;t get the hate spikes off. The vast majority of the damage lies in the enhanced hate spikes. If this is the case, you will only deal 25/30/35/40/45 (+ 30% AP) damage.\n\nFor context, the initial damage from a single hit of Teemo&#039;s poison is 10/20/30/40/50 (+ 30% AP) magic damage.\n\nThis is a farily common occurence. The new Eve is extrordinarily squishy, and it&#039;s often pretty damn risky to stay in range long enough to use your hate spikes. The CD between spikes is half a second, and you have three of them. This means that Eve, being as squishy as she is, has to run at you for 1.5 seconds before she can get the full damage off, hoping she doesn&#039;t die in the process. Maybe if the barrage CD was reduced by rank, it would be more feasable, but it isn&#039;t. Instead, it&#039;s only reduced by CDR. Eve should be all about her burst, not spamming at 45% CDR.\n\n The other issue with this is her newfound lack of mobility. Even if she can survive their damage, anyone with an escape can get out of her Q range. Without Dark Frenzy to keep Eve in range, **HATE SPIKE DOESN&#039;T WORK**. Going off of that, she can&#039;t keep up with anybody in a fight in general, since she&#039;s gimped into buying Mobis instead of boots that would actually help her keep up.\n\nThe spell has pitiful damage in the early-mid game. It only gets rolling once Eve gets lots of AP, at which point she&#039;s largely a mute point due to how unlikely it is for her to get the full spell off on a priority target.\n\n**Allure**\n\nI like the concept of this spell,  but it needed a little more brainstorming.\n\nOk. Eve marks her target and... now what? \n\nThere are only three courses of action an Eve can take.\n\n* Hope to tag the enemy with a max range Q.\n* Ult backwards and attack at melee range.\n* Flash for it.\n\nIf she does the first, she&#039;s just a worse version of Elise. In any case, the charm would wear off before Eve can get the rest of her damage off.\n\nIf she does the second, she now lacks both the necessary damage to finish the kill and her escape. \n\nIf she does the third, you&#039;re down a flash on a squishy champion. Since your ult will get used in the fight most likely, this makes you hella vulnerable for a while.\n\nOld Eve would have loved this spell, but it doesn&#039;t work here. The reason is simple: New Eve is fucking slow.\n\nRiot, you seem to have underestimated how important Dark Frenzy was to Eve&#039;s kit.\n\nThat spell, despite how basic it may seem, was the reason why her old passive worked. She didn&#039;t meander out of stealth like she does now, she pounced.\n\nBecause of this major issue with her kit, Eve is all but forced into building Mobis and Protobelt to get to the target initially, even though she&#039;d really rather be buying other items.\n\nProtobelt is fine and dandy, but Mobis are where the problem is. Eve is roam heavy. Mobis should be a strong option on her, but being forced into buying them causes issues with every other active spell.\n\n**Whiplash**\n\nWhiplash is an amazing spell... once you get Lich Bane and Ludens. The issue is that you&#039;re forced to delay that powerspike with a Protobelt to even use the damn thing.\n\nIt suffers from the same issues as Allure: you are too slow to reach the target in the first place. This means you need mobis, \n\nDelaying the power spike would be somewhat okay... if the base damage on this thing hadn&#039;t been gutted.\n\nRavage did 230 (+1.0 AP) (+1.0 bonus AD) damage at max rank. Whiplash, when empowered, does 140 (+6% max HP) (+4% max HP per 100 AP). The flat damage was nearly halved, and the % HP damage doesn&#039;t do a whole lot against the targets Eve is gonna be gunning for. \n\nThe movement speed on the spell helps keep up with her Q, but she really needed it a couple seconds earlier so she could land the damn thing in the first place.\n\n**Last Caress**\n\nFirst off, Widowmaker was a better name.\n\nOther than that, this spell is incredible. There&#039;s almost nothing I don&#039;t like about it.\n\nAlmost.\n\nLast Caress is an incredible spell that is broken by Eve requiring Mobis.\n\nThis spell is Eve&#039;s only way out aside from &quot;kill everything&quot;. \n\nThing is, Eve is really slow after using it since her Mobis are almost always deactivated by the spell, and her Demon Shade is put on full CD by the same thing.\n\nThis means that, unless you went over a wall, the backwards blink is just not enough to get you out. The enemy can see exactly where you are, and they are definitely faster than you.\n\n-_-\n\n**Proposal**\n\nOf course, all these complaints without a suggestion is little more than long-winded whining. There&#039;s enough of that on this website, so here&#039;s something I think will work.\n\n>  **Demon Shade**\n~~Camouflage only at 6+~~ &gt;&gt; Lesser Camouflage from level 1, upgraded at level 6\n\"Lesser Camouflage\": Increased detection range and enemies are notified if you pass over one of their wards. The area revealed by the ward starts glowing red if Eve is there.\n\nThis should give Eve the necessary tools to be a champion that exists pre-6, while not being quite the oppressive shitlord she used to be.\n\n>  **Whiplash**\n>  E no longer gives MS on hit\n>  (New) Passive - Dark Frenzy: Effecting an enemy champion with a spell or basic attack grants 15% increased movement speed for 1.5 seconds. Allure procs this both on application and when the charm is primed. Last Caress grants double the speed boost, triple if a champion was killed.\n\nYay, target access!\n\n>  **Last Caress**\n> (New) Cleanses slows on activation.\n\nSo Eve&#039;s dramatic exit **stays** as an exit.","replies":[{"poster":"Abibyama","date":"2017-10-16T15:21:39.425+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the worst ideas I’ve ever comes up with but here we go:\n\n1.

SUSTAIN.\nNew Eve might be as squishy as ever, but weird as it sounds she kind of WANTS to scrap with people-like Garen, she can bounce back when her HP gets low. if her opponent can't...Well, you see the fork you're supposed to be using. Either they have to flee, or they risk dying. Plus, attrition-style combat means you don't have to 100-0 people, and can save yer ult for surprises.\n2. SPLITPUSH.\nNew Eve...does terribly in teamfights. Even if she does all she wants to do, her best thing is using Ult to clean up if the enemy team is escaping or something. But even if she can't teamfight she actually isn't the worst choice for splitting I think. Passive means simply damaging her won't necessarily force a back, and the stealth makes getting away easy if you have prior warning like knowing the enemy is elsewhere. Granted, she's AP, but Eve's Q does enable a degree of waveclear, and AP does work for hitting turrets.\n\nI think that's the missing piece, so to speak, with Eve. She's more macro-oriented then other Assassins, she might not be able to 100-0 a dude easily, but she can exert quite a bit of pressure on a team's towers/inhibs if she's allowed to.","replies":[{"poster":"Thunderneedle","date":"2017-10-16T21:00:50.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"If you cannot 100-0 a squishy you are not an assassin.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Thunderneedle","date":"2017-10-16T12:41:47.127+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve is so slow T-T\n\nI miss my mach 7 killer queen","replies":[{"poster":"Playful Sadist","date":"2017-10-16T15:38:25.984+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im with you there.

You don't even need to change the cook time, but if Eve is within 600-800 units of a marked target, she can re-cast it to Charm her victim.\n\nThe Charm does no damage (to champions), has a great warning, and the moment even a creep shows up, she has no chance of procing it outside of melee range. She needs a more reliable way to proc it seeing how much counterplay it has for 1-2 seconds of CC. Bloody Lulu can incapicitate champions for longer with a mouse click.\n\n2) Camo remains at level 6. Camoflague needs to stay consistent with any others in the game, none of this ward pinging stuff. It makes camoflague redundant in that case.\n\nInstead, just make the detection radius shrink by 25 units per level from 6. Her camo reveal isn't actually THAT much longer than pre-rework, but at level 18, this would be 300 units shorter (guessing her camo is around 700-800 right now)","replies":[{"poster":"BabygirlsDaddy","date":"2017-10-17T03:56:39.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea for reactivating her charm, but I think to make it fair you shouldn't be able to activate it unless you get closer to the target (which I believe is only fair since you can initiate it from almost the very edge of the screen). I also agree that her abilities are rather.....lackluster.\n\nTo me her Q doesn't do much dmg unless you hit the entire combo off, and I find it very difficult to aim at your main intended target. \n\nHer charm has all drawbacks previously listed, but my main concern is that it feels like it hardly does anything other than make you walk back for a brief moment. \n\nHer E I find to be very useless since it is basically an empowered autoattack, and has about the same range, I believe it would be more effective if it had a longer range and pulled you to the enemy you're hitting, that to me would be much more effective for her combo, and would even make her charm more reliable in and of itself. \n\nI'll admit her passive is interesting, but I agree that her pre-6 camo ability makes her almost useless until then, however I do like that it helps her sustain between fights and clearing. But I believe it would help if it gave you a little MS boost to help you close in for ganks/kills, and last for a few seconds after being sighted or combat is entered.\n\nI personally do not like her ult at all, to me it feels like a Garen ult, but it usually leaves the other champions barely alive and now I'm even further away from them, and I had to waste my entire kit just to get close enough to......not kill them anyway. She feels very squishy, has great burst dmg when you honestly aren't expecting it, but has to rely on almost pure ambush tactics........Which it doesn't feel like many jg's know how to do (especially when you aren't used to the role and/are filling......all of which I'll admit applies to myself). {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rebonack","date":"2017-10-18T16:44:36.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still feel like the whole champion concept is flawed.

She's balanced around heavily telegraphing her entrance with W anyway, and the vast majority of her damage is back-loaded, meaning it's very difficult for her to chunk someone too hard directly from stealth. Camouflage as a mechanic I feel is critically flawed, as it either does very little to actually give counterplay to a champion (i.e. Twitch) or invalidates their stealth to a large extent (e.g. Eve, with Rengar being a mix of both). Either way, the core gameplay of the reveal radius goes directly against the main purpose of stealth, which is to let champions land the first strike and do so undetected, and I feel designing champions' burst patterns around Camouflage has led to some pretty confused design in the past. Eve's new back-loaded damage pattern is good enough that I feel she doesn't need to be detected at close ranges, but Rengar and Twitch are still very much in one-shot-from-stealth territory whenever they get fed.","replies":[{"poster":"RocketRelm","date":"2017-10-18T16:26:41.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe it could upgrade to full invis at lvl 11, kind of how it upgrades to camo at 6 now","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2017-10-18T17:49:49.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could indeed be a viable option, imo, particularly since Eve already falls off a cliff in the late game due to how easily she gets shut down while trying to assassinate priority targets. If possible, though, I'd like to see how she'd operate with full invisibility from level 1 onwards: I feel there's this huge fear that Eve's ganks would be oppressive if she had her stealth sooner, but at this point she's probably one of the fairest gankers out there, even with Camouflage, as everything she does is telegraphed over a very long duration. Moreover, she has plenty of balancing levers in case she does happen to be too bursty (she could be made more dependent on her charm, for example, or the delay on her Q recasts could be increased at early ranks), which is why I think that even if she did happen to be too good with full invisibility at level 1, or just Camouflage, she could still be tuned around it in a way that would still make her satisfying to play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Somebody Love Me","date":"2017-10-16T20:25:59.030+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just want a lower camo radius.

She is the only permanently stealthed champion in the game. She can either hunt down and sneak up on targets for kills, or she can dash up on them. One or the other, not both. She'd be insanely busted if she still had access to incredible speed bursts with her current kit, as that would eliminate her weaknesses. If you're upset with losing Dark Frenzy, run her with Ghost. \n\nIt also sounds like you're playing Eve completely wrong. Eve is not a balls deep, in your face champ. She doesn't come from the front and just blast someone away. She comes up from unexpected angles and freaks people out, using the chaos of suddenly finding her on top of you to land a kill. Her entire kit revolves around this playstyle. If you don't like it, play someone else. Play Rengar if you want the in-your-face assassin who hunts people down.
