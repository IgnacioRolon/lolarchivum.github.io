It's for the most recent players or players that frequently have the bad luck of getting trolls and flamers. As for your additional attempt at an unrelated point. People that are angry at the trolls and flamers should know that there is a mute button and proceed to use it and then try to play as normal as possible. Let the other team know that you have a flamer or troll on your team and proceed to play the game normally. If you start flaming back you're just playing into the trolls hand and making yourself also deserving of a ban.

All the people posting here want is to not have to deal with trolls and flamers and many of them are taking out their anger here rather than in the game itself. I don't know how you keep missing my point but it's that this isn't a real set of death wishes or threats, it's people that are angry and tired of the trolls and flamers. So if you think they should be banned for that then I think your view is a bit skewed in the wrong direction. \nI'll repeat one more time since the first few probably still haven't gotten through to you. I am not talking about death threats and the like being okay on the boards. I'm talking about this thread specifically where they're not serious and it's just for like minded people to complain and come up with things they think Riot could do about it.
