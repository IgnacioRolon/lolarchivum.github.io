Why on Earth would anyone ever play a squishy melee champion with no utility and no safety if they weren't obscenely good at killing people?\n\nPeople need to get some sense of perspective when talking about what assassins should and shouldn't be able to do because posts like this always just end up as \"Assassins need to be comfortably the worst class in the game\". People talk about how assassins should be just damage with no defensive mobility, no in-kit bulk/sustain, no utility and no poke and think that a class with those limitations could ever be worthwhile when you could just pick a mage/bruiser and keep reasonable kill pressure while having other uses/some chance of not feeding horribly.","replies":[{"poster":"deadlychuck","date":"2016-05-04T05:16:55.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the irony of using diana as an example is that she is classified as a fighter/mage, not assassin. \n\nFirstly, assassins can have CC, i never said they couldn't, but half of ekko's kit seems to just be tacked onto the champion for no reason other than to increase his coverage as a champion, without much thought for balance. Where instead they could've added power or emphasis to other parts of his kit, instead they increased it through means of utility, leaving almost no meaningful holes in his kit for counter play.\n\nBack to your reply though... It's not trying to make assassins the \"worst class in the game\". It's about which part of the assassin's kit should be left up the the player, and which should be controlled by champion mechanics. I feel that the damage and assassination of the assassins should be controlled by the champion's kit. It should be easier to full combo on an assassin than say a mage. However, they shouldn't be given the escape from the fight, within the champion's mechanics. Assassins should have reliable damage, where as mages have unreliable damage (skillshots), but range to assist in positioning/escape. \n\nSo take zed for example. If zed engages onto you, as it stands right now and how it would remain, is that if you're a mage or marksmen you're likely going to die, however if you move into a position, say under the tower or near an ally, then the zed should also be very likely to die after having killed you. \nSay you were to just remove the return portion of his ult. Does zed loose any of his assassination potential? No.\nAll he does is lose his \"get out of jail free card\", when it comes to escaping. So it's on the player's back to either plan an escape accordingly when engaging a target in a fight, or be sure to kill the target who is more valuable than themselves in a team fight. If zed saves his W, he could use it to escape the fight, but that would mean he's making a MEANINGFUL TRADE OFF, of escape potential for damage potential.\n\nHaha actually just look at the comment \\/ below, from Tanathalis. He talks about the same thing, overly efficient disengage built into the kits.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nyá","date":"2016-05-03T12:05:13.153+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one of the main problems is that alot of assasins have overly efficient disengage Zed, Ekko, Yasuo ( less so than others but its there ) Leblanc ( Not as bad ) and these honestly are the main ones im referring to. Ekko can dash to his opponent and if it goes bad he can easily ult back out, same for zed. I really think that gives them a very easy life as an assasin, they can just about engage a fight  by them selves and back off instead of picking off carries in the backline after the fight starts.\n\nMaybe if Zed can only R back AFTER he gets a kill with his ulti it might work a bit better, maybe put a short delay on ekko's Ult ( not a channel ) Like after hitting R 1.5 seconds later he goes back so if he dosnt time it right he'll either die or wont get the kill he's going for.\n\nYasuo's dash has less of the same problems because if he uses a minion wave to get to you, he'll have a harder time getting back out with the dash delay.\n\nLeblanc i think is alright, her snare is a pretty big part of her kit and she cant instantly dash away or she wont get the snare, and the dash range is fairly short.\n\n\nI think an example of some assasins that are in better spots are Talon,  Kat, and akali, ( i dont mean based on how there performing in the meta, but more about how there kits perform )\n\nTalon has to to his target which puts him out there and he dosnt really have an escape, his ult stealths him but stealth has a few ways to counter it, and its not a instant blink back to safety.\n\nKatarina has to get a kill or assist before shes able to blink again so if she goes in and dosnt get the kill / assist, she's usually left in a very bad spot with her abilities left on cooldown.\n\nAkali dosnt really get early game dominance at all because of how ult reliant she is which is her clear major weakness, and even after she gets it she cant go super crazy, she has to auto attack in her combo unless shes in a clear advantage which slows down her 100 to 0 Potential by quite a bit unless she picks the right targets, her ultimate is a dash and not a blink so the opponent does have a bit of reaction time to maybe zhonyas or barrier, or flash under tower to put akali in a bad spot, and if there are no enemy minions nearby when akali needs to get out, she cant use her ult.\n\ntl;dr I think risk / reward needs to be seriously redone with alot of the popular assassins at the moment.\n\nThese are just my opinions, I could be wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"HeadHonchkrow","date":"2016-05-03T14:43:34.374+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you 100% except for the part where you call LeBlonk \"Not as bad\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"HazyCloud7","date":"2016-05-03T19:25:04.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the right idea.

If a zed dies for the enemy fed MF, then it's still a successful assassination. It's even more justified with the removal of QSS cleanse of zed ult.

They were given the % damage, a means to more easily kill tanks indirectly. Tanks were initially not intended to be targeted, which is why mages were their counter.
