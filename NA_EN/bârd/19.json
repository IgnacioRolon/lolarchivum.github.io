The mist is souls magicly bound to the to the isles because of the craziness that went on there. With Rakan and Xaya's lore we learned that Zed can contain magic and maybe even souls (based on the threat Zed's acolyte gave Xaya). He also can contain magic on a large scale as we saw with the forest. He also clearly would like to save innocent people (or Ionians at least) as we saw in Jhin's story and probably would like the extra power.\n\nCould be interesting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Placentas","date":"2017-05-07T00:50:42.842+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"-nods head furiously-\n\nI'd rather the void invasion come later though tbh.

With the 6 or 7 confirmed character VGU's I imagine it is going to be quite some time though.

Even something kinda like For Honor where you just choose which faction you were supporting and all of your wins contributes to that region. They could do stuff like give everyone a Summoner Icon for whichever Faction won or whoever that player supported most. I bet an interactive event like that would be really really hard to do from a narration perspective though, because the outcome can be any faction and the course of the event will be unpredictable you are kind of limited to material. If they did do something like this maybe they could have something like the first faction to get to so many points triggers the next event or the faction with the least points after so long drops out and then there is just a story driven final battle, but no matter how they would do it or how cool it would be that would still  be really really hard for the writers and probably take a whole lot of time and resources to pull off.
