Morg can counter anyone, but only if she's better than the other guy (Black Shield has a very long and punishable cooldown). Zilean counters anything... if you make it to 6. So basically only in ranks where ADCs actually know how to play safe when facing a hook support.\n\n> And that's not to mention all the others who can crush Blitz and Thresh (if not Nautilus) by simply avoiding the hooks and wearing them down.\n\nAll the others who are artillery mage supports? Because an enchanter can't wear down an enemy they can't afford to get close to who also gets regular heals from Relic Shield.\nOf course that may change now that Relic lost its heal, but for the last three seasons hook supports have been providing sustain on top of their eat-one-skillshot-and-die kill pressure.\n\n> Second, new Runes didn't solve this.

All I can say for certain is Runes Reforged made the matchup much harder for me, specifically... until I gave up on \"protect the carry\" and learned to abuse the runes to get kill pressure myself.\nWhich is not how playing an enchanter is supposed to work, but hey, Riot won't stop the damage creep so you gotta play the hand you're dealt.\n\n> Do you think {{champion:555}} would have been nearly as OP if he didn't have keystones to abuse, or if the enemy support was running around with 25 bonus armor at level 1?\n\nYes.\nBecause he too would have bonus armor.

Those stats are from *now*, with damage being so absurd that being stunned for a second means you just die. I'm talking the days of old runes when damage was *much* lower.\n4. You do not need to be a healer to be an enchanter. An enchanter is anybody who focuses on buffing their team. Morgana is an enchanter/control mage hybrid. Zilean *was* a pure enchanter, and was reworked into an enchanter/control mage hybrid.\n5. No, not \"artillery mages\". Nami, old Sona, old Taric, and old Soraka could beat these  guys by simply playing well. Nami/Sona poked/traded until they were low on HP. Soraka just sat back there and made sure she wasn't the one who got hooked and then made it impossible to kill her buddy. Taric could out-fight any of the hook supports if they engaged on him and could heal up afterwards.\n6. It's self evident. Enchanters can beat hook supports as long as damage is low enough that they can beat them. The introduction of keystones amped up damage to 11, and then runes reforged did it again by filling the lesser runes with damage options.\n7. Nope. Pyke is awful at dealing with durable champions.
