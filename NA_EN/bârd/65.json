The role was originally called adc and adc is just basically the role of having high damage dps build and has evolved to become a ranged marksman because it is more efficient to keep a champion alive if they are attacking from afar rather than in the frontlines while being squishy. Generally ap champs are usually bursty cooldown based champs rather than dps which is why ap champs aren't regularly played as the role marksman. Although, there are champions who could fit the role such as teemo or kayle as they have auto attack abilities that scale with ap for decent dps much like a marksman.
