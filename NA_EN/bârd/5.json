Once cast you pop up a portal for half a second and catch the first projectile that touches your model.  You can cast it again two more times over the next (duration) seconds.  If you catch three enemy projectiles, you can activate the portal a fourth time to vomit a bunch of damage/CC on medium range target.\n\nPlenty of counterplay both as and against, I would say.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BeatzBoyFTW","date":"2017-07-10T12:48:25.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Tbh, his current ult is nothing more than a spammable \"_I need instant damage reduction_\" ability without using any logic of messing with the targeted enemy's position.
