That's... big.\r\n\r\nI like how his AD is still high, so items like Steraks and Triforce can still theoretically be a good purchase.\r\n\r\n**Passive**\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'll get used to it, but I always feel like \"ok any second now it's going to pop and I'll get a heal\".\r\n\r\n**Q**\r\n\r\nNot much to say here. It's a solid spell, feels nice, but nothing too special.\r\n\r\n**W**\r\n\r\nMorde's new shield mechanic is fine... I'm just not sure it's better than Iron Man was.\r\n\r\nI'd advise changing Indestructible's shielding component to be a passive effect like on live, and have it only have a single active effect in the heal.\r\nThat's pretty unlikely though.\r\n\r\nSince that's probably not gonna happen, something else that could use changing is what you get from leveling it.\r\nPutting points into this spell just feels kinda bad. It's a great value point, but each extra point only gives 2.5% healing and 1 second off the CD.... oh boy.\r\n\r\n**E**\r\n\r\nBeautiful.\r\n\r\n**R**\r\n\r\n* Being able to QSS it isn't very metal. \r\n* Additional ranks only decrease the CD, so it feels  bad putting more points in it.\r\n* Stat stealing feels like a kinda lame reward. I know you aren't going to give us the ghost back, but that would be pretty metal. Having the victim's portrait just seems to be rubbing in how cool a ghost would be.","replies":[{"poster":"Shapiro","date":"2019-05-30T02:01:11.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm very sad they're removing his hybrid scaling.

Nautilus or Hecarim, just sounds like they're trying too hard. I like Mordekaiser's voice, just needed more lines.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"segfaultinmyhead","date":"2019-06-14T07:12:47.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my honest feedback after playing a number of games as and against Mordekaiser. Everything is great except his ult. Let me elaborate... his ult is super fun and game-changing *for the Morde player*. To everyone else in the game it's at best lame and forgettable, and worst it's cancer (if you're the one getting ulted). The problem is, there's no counter play to it. There's no way to get away from him, there's no way to kill him, there's no way to beat him. Game after game, even when I was beating him in lane, if you get ulted, you just have to run around in a circle trying to dodge Qs (good luck since he has a perma-speed boost) until you die). And multiple times I came to help a teammate that was dueling Morde, and then he just ults my teammate and I have to.... sit around following a little red blur for about 10 seconds hoping there will be something to rescue at the end (usually not). Not very exciting. Not very interesting. In fact, it approaches game-ruining, in my opinion. It's this great thrill when you're Morde and you basically get a free 1v1 where you have every possible advantage, but if you're not Morde, it's frustrating and not counterable at all. Although I loved the idea at first, I really think the ult needs to go... it just has no place in a team game.","replies":[]}]}
