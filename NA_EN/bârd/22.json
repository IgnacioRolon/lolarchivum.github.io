A good placed ultimate really decides how a teamfight turn out, she does so much AoE damage and she has one oft he best hard initiations of a midlaner/support, especially with Zhonyas. Already had two 1v4 Quadras with her and carried multiple games hard, i honestly don't see how she's in a bad spot. She has a pretty hard time against assasins so i ban the ones out who can dive easily (Fizz, Zed) and against the rest i just farm and prepare myself for teamfights. Meanwhile she beats so many low-mobility mages because she just plain outdamages them. Her plant AI should be fixed so they don't only attack targets who are rooted but other than that, she's fine. I also don't see how she has low damage. Her base damages and her scalings are okay and she benefits pretty hard from early magic penetration.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zair Umbras","date":"2015-07-06T08:44:34.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only actual issue with Zyra is her plants stop firing at enemy Champions before they leave the circle sometimes. What a lot of people DON'T know is that if you AA a champion, the plants will fixate on it, much like a Malz minion on an E'd champion. That's just how that one works though. The AI on it isn't bad, most just don't realize if you AA a minion after poking with your plant, your plant will automatically focus on the fricken minion, or worse when you drop plants and then AA the enemy TANK so your plants hit the TANK instead of the backline. Rule of thumb, don't AA things if you don't want the plants to hit it. She has 575 AA range, so you can easily hit the target you want if need be. \n\nHer E isn't that bad. It has a very long range and the missile speed actually isn't all that bad. It moves much quicker than a Lux Q or Morg Q.\n\nHer Q does pretty heft poke damage, as she's meant to be a DPS mage, thus the low CD. It's a 5s CD with 210 base plus .65 scaling, spawning a plant that'll do another 20% of her AP.\n\nHer W has free CDR. It used to give 20%, but that had support Zyra far too crazy. She had 30% from just it and masteries (5% in support tree, 5% in offensive). Now she gets 30% with it, masteries, and the support item. \n\nHer R is a HUGE and does a moderate amount of damage, but also steroids her plants and more importantly, knocks champions up. \n\nAll in all, she's fine damage-wise. Her passive is kinda iffy, but so is Fiora's, Kog's, and Mundo's. Best thing she could use is the plant's focusing on a single target thing reduced to 25% instead of sitting at 50%. As is, if you use two plants and they hit the same target, it's the same as only having one plant, which is useless since plants will always target the same target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mandang0","date":"2015-07-06T06:18:40.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Zyra's not in that bad of a place right now, and too large of buffs WILL get her nerfed sometime later.\n\nOf your list, I'd prefer Riot fixed her plant AI first.  I also don't think her E's CC duration is too long - it's the weakest hard CC in the game and you need to put ranks in it to get the duration up from 0.75 seconds.  As far as complaints about her damage, most times I see a support Zyra who builds decently, they're near the top in damage dealt to champions.

Now I wasn't there for it fortunately, but I've heard more than enough stories where she basically had lower cooldowns, higher range, much more damage, and she was just unstoppable with over 63% winrates. She was so bad that 2 days after her release, she was nerfed and repeatedly nerfed after.\n\nCurrently my main issue with Zyra is there is absolutely no reason to not dodge Zyra's abilities with the exception of being ambush. The abilities are ridiculously easy to dodge, and the mana cost is no joke. The cooldowns are pretty low but not low enough to excuse how slow they are. If you want to buff Zyra, take .5 secondds off of her Q cast times and give her Q more damage on top of fixing her plants. The plants should be able to instantly attack enemy champions, if they're attacking minions and an enemy champion steps into the circle, the plant should immediately attack him/her.\n\nZyra's damage isn't that bad nor her plants, but her Q needs a bit more since I know for a fact some Zyra mid laners level up their E, which does a bit less damage over her Q. However nobody can really tell a difference since they're both easy to dodge and don't do a lot of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vekkna","date":"2015-07-06T22:29:15.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've had a lot of success playing Zyra mid and support (until last week's out-of-nowhere losing streak from hell).\n\nThe mana issue is a big deal, especially when you're against a sustain pusher (like Malz) or somebody without any resource to manage. I've started going 15/0/15 to get the added movement speed, mana, and regen from the utility tree.\n\nZyra is also gated heavily by CDR, especially when heading into mid game team fighting. Scaling CDR runes plus the 5% from damage tree gives you a passive 20% over the span of the game.\n\nAnother (controversial) option on mana and CDR is to rank W first for the seed CDR and passive CDR. You won't be doing a lot of damage with Q or E until mid game, but your plant damage doesn't scale from Q/E rank **at all.** In lane, you can safely poke and farm with plants very frequently at a very low mana cost.\n\nThis setup also gives you a lot of added safety in having seeds off CD quickly for vision as needed, which is especially good as support.\n\nSince you don't need the CDR from Athene's, you just build tear right off the bat and let your utility tree do the regen for you. Not having to spend thousands of gold early on for CDR and regen lets you rush Guise and Rylai's early, which gives you enough hp to not be an early/mid game insta-kill on sight for mobile assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phife","date":"2015-07-06T19:27:38.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her damage is actually believe it or not, really really high.
