Very few champs get to 20% health and try to go back in, plus 10% vamp isn't very much as most notice when you try to vamp with only a Revolver.

His Q is counted as 'AoE', so you only heal for a third of its damage and the lifesteal is only applied to the basic attacks damage, not the bonus from the Q... so since his E and W do negligible damage plus his R already heals you for the damage it does, you're not really gaining much on him.\n\nVlad gaining 10% at 20% health wouldn't really be much either. His Q would heal him for 10% of the damage it deals and his E and R would heal for 3.33%. Not... really much. *Shrug* WotA works because it does 15% pre-resists and his E amiplifies that quite nicely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-02-29T04:24:45.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Morde isn't much of an abuse case, and Vlad is getting reworked.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Bearded Bard","date":"2016-02-29T03:17:56.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd consider taking it on a few mages.","replies":[]}]}
