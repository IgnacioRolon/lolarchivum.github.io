(90 second cooldown)\r\nWhile in this form, gain 25% movement speed, become untargetable, and regenerate 10% of your missing health over the duration, at the cost of reducing your damage output by 100% for the duration.\r\nDamage reduction does not apply to spells or attacks initiated before entering wraith form.\r\nIn wraith form, you are untargetable but not invulnerable. Delayed damage can still hit you in spectral form, and projectiles already targeted on you will still damage you (though skillshot projectiles will miss).\r\n(Passive) Dead eyes never blink: Gain true sight of champions in a 550 AOE around you. \r\nPassive disabled while on cooldown.\r\n\r\nA defensive item, aimed to do three things.\r\nHelp assassins stay alive in teamfights.\r\nHelp squishies deal with assassins.\r\nHelp teams deal with stealth champions.\r\n\r\nIt is fairly cheap, so a champion struggling against an assassin should be able to pick it up relatively early, as can an Assassin who is getting shut down by a lockdown heavy opposition.\r\nWhile the passive and active are incredibly powerful, the stats on the item are horrid. As a result, most tanks would probably avoid it, with some exceptions of course (Illaoi, Alistar, and Gnar could all use it without too much of a problem)\r\nCarries would take this item as an alternative to a Guardian Angel (which could use some attention as well), but Supports are actually crazy good with it.\r\nYour damage output is decreased by 100%, but you are still able to cast spells. If you are someone like Soraka, Janna, or Alistar, you don&#039;t give a fuck about your damage output, but 3 seconds of untargetability and healing is great.","replies":[{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2016-06-27T09:49:37.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that active on alistar\n\nwalks in stomps ground knocks someone in your team but you can't do shit about it\n\nsounds pretty frustrating to deal with","replies":[]},{"poster":"Necro Warrior87","date":"2016-06-27T15:05:56.101+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"how about this:\nHelm Of Ostarion: over all cost, 3000\n{{item:3024}} +{{item:3105}} \n+ 300 health\n+ 40 magic resist\n+ 40 armor\n+ 200 mana\n+ 10 CDR\n+ 100 base health regen.\nunique active: dead helm, takes 30% reduced damage and 50% increased healing for 5 seconds. cd: 40 seconds.\nunique passive: gain truesight of champions 500 units around you, cannot be used when active is on cd","replies":[]},{"poster":"sneezing slug","date":"2016-06-27T19:19:42.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're talking about the icon being from DOTA 2 you'd be horribly wrong.\n\nThat's the icon for a Revenent-- a Warcraft 3 neutral monster often found on snow maps.\n\nhttp://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/c/c3/TheGuardian.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071113011029","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2016-06-27T22:46:49.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, I am talking about the name and \"Wraith\" features (The Icon is just something that came up when I searched \"Wraith band\")\n\nOstarion the Wraith King, if you build an Aghanims Scepter, can turn himself and his allies into wraiths upon death.
