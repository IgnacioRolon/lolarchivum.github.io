A young jinx witnessing this broke. Now why would he do this. He was a cutthroat according to singed. He had relations to Gangs in zaun. So there was this lil girl that WW saw and one that resembles jinx and loved tinkering. What if her parents had a hextech weaponry/tools shop. This would also explain her hextech gear.

Insisted he was no longer a monster, but a good man. Ignored the distractions and threaded lengths of delicate hoses throughout his extremities, splicing them with his veins and arteries. The subject remained conscious and screaming for six hours. Very encouraging as he endured significantly longer than earlier failures.
