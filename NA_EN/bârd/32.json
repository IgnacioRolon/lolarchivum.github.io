Riposte is handy for survival and so is Lunge, but it isn't exactly Zed's extreme levels of safety.\n\nIn most cases involving tanky builds: you get to deal more damage by living longer.\nWith Zed: pretty sure he still lives longer by killing things faster. With the backwards mobility on his ult shadow in particular, it's not like Zed is at a great risk of dying and the risk/reward is skewed in his kit strongly enough to benefit from tons of durability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slamurai Jack","date":"2016-02-29T15:46:12.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Zed won't do nearly enough damage to kill anyone in a teamfight ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Hard Engage","date":"2016-02-29T15:58:25.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slamurai Jack,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=fI5iEF2J,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-02-29T15:46:12.474+0000)\n>\n> That Zed won't do nearly enough damage to kill anyone in a teamfight ever.\n\nthe goal is to just kill carries. and by default your carry is still alive because you went in first,  you win the engage just because your carry is still alive.\n\nyou only need 1, maybe 2 damage items to kill a defenseless carry.
