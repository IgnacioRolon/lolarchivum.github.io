Well, Urgot is certainly PART artillery, but being AD is not a quirk. His \"quirk\" is that he doesn't exactly fit into any normal class. Everything is a contradiction. He is a ranged, physical DPS champion, yet is not a marksman. He has artillery, yet likes to dive headlong into the enemy ranks to kill them up close and personal. He is ranged, yet is very durable.

Even though stacking HP isn't his thing, removing his ability to get ANY bonus HP, even if it was compensated with resistances, wouldn't work, since stacking armor/MR gets less powerful the more you get. The moment you locked in Urgot, the enemy would just pick Yi and Irelia, and then you would have no way to deal with them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tobias Brackner","date":"2016-08-09T13:42:17.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"But Bruiser Graves is the biggest waste of his power.\n\nAnd Urgot looks like a fat metal monster, him being squishy always left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I will post some thoughts here. \n\nThe one ability I believe should stay is his R, Hyper-Kinetic-Position-Reverser. Why?\n\nPlease go to where Urgot is on the battlecast link. Notice, he is listed as a SHOCK TROOPER.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/skin-release/battlecast-skins\n\nA shock trooper is one who mobilizes very quickly to penetrate the back lines on an enemy formation. Sometimes armour (tanks) would be used to support such an operation. \n\nAll it takes is 1 second for an Urgot to expose a weakness in an enemy formation and reek havoc on the backlines. This strategy can be very risky which is perfect for a champion who in former life gave very little thought of his own well being in battle. A true Noxian. \n\nTo be candid, Urgot's Q and E were the causation for nerfs and unfair gameplay. Too much range and damage for an ability combo that guarantees too much safety and results if it lands. \n\n**I propose that that Urgot keep his ultimate and some kind of shield. **\n\n----\n\nNow, how is Urgot different than Sion (this will lead into other parts of his kit, I promise)?\n\nSion and Urgot are similar in that they were both physical and fearless warriors on the battlegrounds who wouldn't surrender even at the cost of their own life.\n\nThey differed starkly in reanimation, however. Sion was captured and cleanly executed while Urgot had suffered years of abuse and then a rather grotesque and sloppy cut that tore him in two. \n\nWe see what it took for Sion, some metal fittings, a furnace to enhance his potency, a missing leg sure, but most of him still intact. Thus he can wield his large man-sized axe and crush those like he did in days of old and glory (with some extra benefits). \n\nUrgot on the other hand could not be brought back by necromancy alone. He needed some new body to be fashioned to house the spiteful and resilient spirit of Urgot. In comes Zaun.  \n\nAnd with Urgot being given a new body by Zaun, it only makes sense he would have new tools of destruction. \n\nI feel he should have at least a long range ability and have an auto ranged attack, and the rapid firing of Q is interesting. To me it is far more badass and thematically fitting to think of Urgot as one who will charge in and cause pandemonium. \n\nFurthermore, with a more unifying model, one that causes true discomfort and revulsion, this would be a champion that you would want to keep off your back lines, and he would look the part. \n\nAn undead shock trooper, cybernetically enhanced that causes the normal soldier to become weak-kneed praying to which ever gods they do \"asking how such an unnameable perversion could be allowed to walk the soil\". The wheezing pulp of rotund, carrion flesh, covered in his opponents blood; never stopping, never lamenting his actions, filled with singular purpose, that is, to be a war machine and never let death take that from him again.   \n\n------\n\nHis passive should be changed as well. It lacks interaction for both players and is invisible stats. \n\nSo his Passive and E, or it's functionality should change. No more damage reduction and lock on missiles. \n\nHis voice should be heavily filtered and his model should create a new definition of \"unwholesomeness\". \n\nTL:DR\n\nP \"Zaun...\" - Replace\n\nQ \"Acid Hunter\"  - Keep/Tweak   (Get rid of the scythe, clashes with high tech theme)\n\nW \"Terror Capacitor\" - Keep\n\nE \"Noxian...\" -Replace/Tweak\n\nR \"Hyper...\" - KEEP!!!  (This is one of the most variable, risk/reward/, engaging (for both teams) ability in the game is the reason I love playing him so much).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spideraxe","date":"2016-08-09T14:21:25.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's the Bastion of League, not a tank in the sense of role but an actual tank","replies":[]}]}
