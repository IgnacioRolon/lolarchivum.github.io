I actually really like anime. Future Diary is just... all about shock value and is purposely edgy. It's production value isn't that great, most of the animation is good, but Deus' animation is downright terrible. A lot of tropes exist throughout the entire anime, and a lot of characters fall into the same traps as the manga (Not being interesting, as an example.) Yuno is generic psycho mixed with Yandere. It's boring. There's NOTHING about her character that makes her stand out. The main character is the same as in any other shounen. He's just a total wimp. I'd honestly compare Future Diary to Higurashi and that's not a bad thing, I used to really like Higurashi. But it's basically in the same boat. Predictable tropes and not-interesting-characters with shock value and edgyness everywhere.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vesarixx","date":"2016-06-25T16:21:57.418+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://u.kanobu.ru/comments/images/158ff700-438c-4588-a138-dab0cb6d409e.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zhire","date":"2016-06-25T22:19:49.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"someone doesn't have fun at parties","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stalinium","date":"2016-06-25T20:01:58.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I still have nightmares about Yuno...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-25T11:13:46.122+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yuno it's bad when the damage dealing tank is salty, unless it's about his dead team failing to engage with him.","replies":[{"poster":"macromite","date":"2016-06-25T15:51:41.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"or his alive team.\n\nwhen people hesitate, initiators die.","replies":[{"poster":"Jet Sett","date":"2016-06-25T19:25:23.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I said salty, not reasonably upset.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"zlumpy","date":"2016-06-25T14:51:28.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't it still just be \"ok\"?
