Without it, she can&#039;t do her trademarked one-shot. So, right off the bat everyone who can either block the bubble or ignore the sleep counters Zoe.\r\n\r\n&gt;{{champion:157}} windwalls it, so he&#039;s a gimme.\r\n {{champion:90}} has a built in banshees, so there you go.\r\n{{champion:15}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:114}} can block the bubble\r\n {{champion:41}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:12}} can cleanse the sleep.\r\n{{champion:25}} can black shield it, but she has apply her shield before the bubble lands.\r\n{{champion:23}} can&#039;t stop himself from falling asleep, but he&#039;ll never die from it.\r\n\r\n&gt;On top of those champions, {{item:3140}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3222}}{{item:3102}} {{item:3814}}  and {{summoner:1}} all counter it. Just make sure you&#039;re cleansing the actual sleep, and not the drowsy effect. The two are separate.\r\n{{item:3157}} (and {{champion:432}} by extension) also helps, since you can ignore the sleep, but be mindful that going golden in the middle of a teamfight isn&#039;t always the best plan.\r\n{{item:3026}} also deserves a mention.\r\n\r\nThe true damage on Zoe&#039;s bubble is, well, not ACTUAL true damage. It&#039;s a true damage nuke equal to the post-mitigation damage of whatever attack proc&#039;d it (up to a cap, of course). This means that anybody with stupidly high resistances won&#039;t take much damage from this.\r\n\r\n&gt;{{champion:3}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:201}} have % reductions they can turn on, though Alistar should really be using his to ignore the sleep instead of tank its damage.\r\n{{champion:5}} just doesn&#039;t take the damage at all.\r\n{{champion:33}} Isn&#039;t the best magic tank in the game, but his W does give him an edge for that.\r\n{{champion:54}} would obviously rather be tanking physical damage, but on the off-chance the bubble gets popped by the ADC, Malphite won&#039;t even notice.\r\n{{champion:38}} is here on a technicality. He&#039;ll still get bursted, but I just thought I&#039;d remind you that he has a passive.\r\nOn top of those, you obviously have just every tank in the game, since they just build MR naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\nZoe needs to burst somebody to be useful. If her burst gets negated, she&#039;s not a happy camper. As such, every potential savior gets a spot on the list.\r\n\r\n&gt;{{champion:113}} {{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:3}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:82}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:516}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:5}} have enough raw durability to tank a paddle star without too much hastle.\r\n{{champion:1}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:82}} can bodyblock with their summons.\r\n{{champion:432}} can make the sleeping ally invulnerable, though the timing can be tricky and it often causes more problems than it solves.\r\n{{champion:223}} is better if you want to go down that route.\r\n{{champion:25}} gets another mention. Even if she couldn&#039;t stop the ally from falling asleep, a mid Morgana with some AP can block a good chunk of the Paddle star with the magic shield.\r\n{{champion:427}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:412}} can all apply a regular old shield to the ally. They probably won&#039;t block the whole thing, but you&#039;ll probably do enough to let them live.\r\n{{champion:10}} {{champion:26}} just straight up make it so they don&#039;t die.\r\n{{champion:48}} can displace the sleeping ally to make Zoe miss her Q.\r\n{{champion:157}} windwall pops up here again. Actually, most of the champions who can deal with the bubble can also deal with paddle star.\r\nOn top of those, {{item:3190}} and {{item:3401}} are great. Oh,  and {{item:3222}} again. Maybe you should build it one of these games.\r\n\r\nNext, anyone who  is just damn impossible to hit with skillshots.\r\n\r\n&gt;{{champion:67}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:105}} and every other agile champion in the game is an absolute pain in the ass for Zoe, especially  if she isn&#039;t experienced enough to predict their jukes. Because of this, two {{champion:142}}&#039;s in the same game counter each other because both of them can usually dodge each others bubbles.\r\n{{champion:105}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:498}} {{champion:11}} get honors for being untargetable.\r\n\r\nOkay, moving on from people who counter her E.\r\n\r\nZoe is very squishy and not very mobile. As such, anyone who can get on top of her and burst her is a nightmare.\r\n\r\n&gt;Divers like {{champion:164}} start off the teamfight by killing Zoe.\r\nAssassins like {{champion:28}} kill Zoe every time she steps out of her base.\r\n{{champion:127}} {{champion:90}} just have so much reliable lockdown that Zoe can&#039;t handle it.\r\n\r\nZoe relies on burst damage. She&#039;s great at killing squishies, but tanky champions generally don&#039;t care about her. This is all well and good until those tanky champions are major threats to her team.\r\n\r\n&gt;Any juggernaut fills this role. Also, {{champion:8}}.\r\n\r\nIn the lane phase, Zoe wants nothing more than to go gank bot or top. There are a lot of picks that shut that down.\r\n\r\n&gt;{{champion:101}} {{champion:161}}{{champion:112}} {{champion:163}}  {{champion:115}} {{champion:74}} keep the wave shoved in. Ziggs and Heim might just take your tower if you try to roam.\r\n{{champion:3}} {{champion:4}} also shove the wave in, but are also exceptional at countering her roams.\r\n\r\nBe aware that this is not an all-inclusive list. It&#039;s entirely probable that I&#039;m missing a couple good picks.\r\n\r\nThat said, hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"NineTailedMystic","date":"2018-01-15T12:55:15.092+0000","up_votes":35,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'm still banning her every game I'm mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Bjørnetjenesten","date":"2018-01-15T20:02:41.016+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah every single game actually, even if my mid can first pick it lol.

Zoe on the other hand has no real mobility outside of flash.  This made it so Nid had far more leeway in her positioning than Zoe has.\n\nThe problem with old Nid wasn't just her long range damage, but how safely she was able to pull it off and how much else she had in her kit (mobility, a heal, an attack speed buff, and traps that gave vision of enemies for an absurd length of time).  The only thing old Nid lacked was ranged waveclear.\n\nAlso it was a rework of Nidalee, not a nerf (she gained jungle strength and better engage/assassination potential).\n\nI mean feel free to hate Zoe for deal a lot of damage from range.  Everyone has their personal hatreds (I hate Yas for example, very original).  I'm just bringing up points against your suggestions towards Zoe being poorly designed or her E being too easy to land.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2018-01-16T04:08:27.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

For a while, she was played as a bruiser top.\n\nZoe has CC in the form of a projectile and then an aoe zone to cut off routes, she can pick up a redemption or ANY summoner used by someone, has a mini sheen via her passive, a Diana W, and her ult is great for checking over walls.","replies":[{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-16T07:11:48.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what if Nid couldn't transform pre 6?  Zoe's Q range is nothing special pre-6 anyways.  We have been discussing them with their full kits available up until now.\n\nZoe's W is not reliable enough to really belong in an argument (and I do think they shouldn't have done the random aspect to it) unless you are talking about her picking up SSs and item actives from enemy champions, in which case there is plenty of counterplay available (namely not using them until she can't properly take advantage of them).\n\nAlso Zoe's W damage is much more similar to (but weaker than) Ahri's W.  Yes Zoe's kit has a lot of damage and a fair bit of utility, but the sheer mobility that Nidalee had (as well as that heal to make sieges even easier) is something that should not be undervalued.  The amount of engage necessary to reach Nidalee was insane, especially compared to Zoe (who is also effectively rooting herself for a second every time she ults).\n\nI get it, you hate her whereas I find her extremely fun and refreshing.  While I do believe there are some suboptimal parts of her kit (namely the randomness of her W), I do not believe she is as overloaded/op as you seem to think she is.

Most low elo game 1 or 2 players are carrying the game and the rest are just filler, so win your lane you can carry. Her hardest kill pressure lane counters are Katarina and Fizz. The both have gap close, burst, and abilities that can dodge a straight on bubble she could use defensively on your all in or to force you out of lane herself.\n\n Malzahar is tough to kill in lane for Zoe because you cannot sleep him easily with his void spawn blocking. He will be able to free farm minus a good gank and be just as big as her theoretically once landing ends. TF is also a champion who handles her pretty easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oni Master","date":"2018-01-16T05:09:24.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly certain Yasuo gets wrecked by Zoe. Her enhanced autos go through wind wall for some reason. Also, wind wall CD is like 24 seconds. She could cast bubble like 3 times before it comes back up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RottedApples","date":"2018-01-15T20:35:45.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fizz isn't untargetable long enough to negate the sleep. if he gets hit by the bubble he will get hit by the q.\n\nvlad might be long enough, the other two listed definitely aren't. \n\nYou have to dodge the bubble if you want to dodge the damage, it's that simple.\n\nThe morgana interaction pisses me off. I wouldn't mind if I could still get hit for the true damage if i shielded after the bubble, fizz ult for example will still deal damage if i shield after it hits someone, but it won't knock the target up if i do that, so why do i go to sleep from zoe. These spells basically act the same way, but are treated completely differently.","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2018-01-15T22:23:25.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz and Vlad can pool at the last second to dodge the bubble itself, even if they didn't react in time to dodge normally.\n\nMorgana is a weird interaction.
