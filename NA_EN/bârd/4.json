Well, a Bard question. On the off chance that he'll field multiple...\n\n* How happy are you with how Bard is thought of?\n* From what I've seen, there's a huge skillcap for Bard play, and he's not that newcomer-friendly. He's received small buff after small buff for a while now. How much of a concern is it that in making him more accessible to less experienced Barders, he'll become too strong in the hands of experts?\n* Though it's certainly a plenty weird one, Bard's kit is that of a generalist support. What is it about Bard's design that lets him feel much more impactful than other generalist supports like Sona?\n\nReally great job making this champion. I've had so much fun playing Bard; he's such a flexible and powerful champion. The aesthetic is stellar too. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2016-01-12T06:59:02.390+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm personally really happy with Bard overall, the overall personality his kit/appearance/sounds conveys especially. I do worry somewhat about how his kit can be misleading for newer players to him though in terms of when to collect chimes, when and who to ult, when to E (and when to definitely not E). That does mean that as you describe there's some risk of him ending up too strong at the top end. Given he's performing weaker post preseason changes than before however I think we should be ok in that regard with the small buff in 6.1 which is much more an occasional useability thing than a significant power boost.\n\nIn terms of feeling impactful Bard's power comes in really discreet, obvious ways mainly (XP from chimes being the biggest exception). His high moments, the ult and E especially, are also extremely high, so even if he's not necessarily contributing that much overall when he does get something right it can feel like he's deciding teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"ItemsGuy","date":"2016-01-12T17:40:57.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking about misleading kits and how personality is conveyed, how well do you think Bard performs in his role as League's resident Wandering Caretaker in-game?\n\nWhile he's easily one of my favorite champions, I was never particularly successful with him--I always thought it was because I was getting chimes at the wrong time or not roaming to mid enough to drop a shrine or two for them, but as it turns out, success with Bard requires a...surprising amount of aggression, to say the least (and not really all that much wandering). Stuff like throwing an attack the enemy's way every now and then is actually fine as far as character goes--aside from limiting aggression, is also succeeds in conveying Bard as a generally peaceful dude, since in the context of that passive alone, he's only a threat when his Meeps are around to intervene.\n\nEverything else about Bard, however, makes him seem more like a Wandering Playmaker than anything. All of the successful plays I've seen with him (particularly in the pro scene) involve huge ganks with Magical Journey, set-ups for double kills with aggressive use of his Q, and his shrines are almost exclusively used as a way to help an ally get in a position to finish a kill. Looking at every guide, it's always max Q first, build some offensive AP items, max W last, look for ganks, etc. (even Rioters on the board suggest offensive burst damage Masteries rather than anything that could be used to aid allies); so while I looked at his kit at launch and thought \"ah, I should max W and E so I can roam around the map and make sure everyone is having a good time,\" that was ultimately the cause of me \"using him wrong.\"\n\nI kind of wish his kit [was more about what it says on Bard's tin](http://lolredesigns.blogspot.com/2013/11/champion-redesign-bard-wandering.html), although I'll still play him the way I want regardless and have fun with him win or lose. When I'm Bard, no amount of kills or assists can top the warmth and gratitude I get when I trek all the way into mid or our jungle and help one of my allies get back on their feet.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tobastion","date":"2016-01-12T06:15:17.197+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=49nmeW20,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-12T06:01:54.107+0000)\n>\n> Bard went through a lot of different abilities before we hit on his final kit, including at one point getting briefly iceboxed until we took another run at his gameplay.

Bard getting to stun people for 2.5 seconds from half the map away is really, really strong. It's balanced by the fact that a max-range R takes a long time to land, and the target can easily evade it. Any fixed delay would have to be long enough that Bard can't decide mid lane without having to really leave bot lane. The downside of that is that his very short range ults would then have to have the same long delay, making it way less useful for his own lane, and eliminating all the cool plays made possible by the fairly quick travel time on short range ults.\n\nThis would have broader implications as well. Since Bard would no longer gain much selfish power at level 6 as he does on live, he'd end up with a very strange power curve, with his midgame dip getting even worse, and being entirely reliant on having a good mid laner to be functional. To make the change roughly power neutral, you'd have to buff some other part of his kit, and who knows what effects that would have.","replies":[]}]}]}
