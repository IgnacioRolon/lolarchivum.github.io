You are making many assumptions about his skull.\nYou assume his skull radiates magic. His bones are merely his phylactery when they are complete, they lose the power to sustain him the mortal realm when his body is broken apart. Why would we therefore assume his skull without the rest of his body is capable of radiating magic and or allowing Mordekaiser to come into the mortal realm, when _the very fact that his skull was removed from his skeleton is how he was able to be dispelled from this realm_?\n\nAnd sure, Mordekaiser can use his powers to warp beings. But that requires him to be present. Mordekaiser is a spirit inhabiting his armor. We know he is a spirit because his corpse is kept elsewhere, intact, so he can exist, and therefore he is not a traditional lich like Karthus or a zombie. So since Mordekaiser is a spirit, sustained in the world by his bones being complete, he therefore cannot be present with his skull removed from his body.\nSo Mordekaiser didn't corrupt Thresh, because Mordekaiser had no way of being in the mortal realm without his body being intact. There were _countless_ other dark magic artifacts in that vault, many which actually radiated power and whispered evils constantly. Thresh was corrupted by the sheer amount of evil energy around him in active artifacts, not Mordekaiser, who's skull was a dormant hunk of bone. Mordekaiser's skull without his body is like a toaster you haven't plugged in.\n\nClearly, as a Mordekaiser fanatic, you will need to do further research on your champion to understand exactly how he operates as an undead of this world.","replies":[{"poster":"Mordepool","date":"2018-10-26T23:50:49.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your assumption is  based  much more on conjecture  than mine is.\n\nAlso it fails to account for 1 obvious Question.\n\nIf Morde requires \" his body to be whole\" to assume a physical form\n\nWhere is his spirit if its not inhabiting his Armour?
