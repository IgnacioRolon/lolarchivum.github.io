Right now, Bond of Stone is a pretty big buff, but you don't notice it literally at all. However, this reworked version could be useful on Nunu outside of lane phase or in ganks. It having no cooldown or limit may be just a bit absurd, though at the same time having it have no cd or limit means that the allies that proc it are constantly refreshing the heal, meaning that it doesn't get full efficiency, though his E may be on a low enough cooldown that it doesn't matter.","replies":[]}]}
