The one that new players get before the free rotation (that transition must be frustrating in and of itself).\nThere's also nothing stopping Riot from making him the next champ that gets reduced two new champs from now with Diana.\nI've seen more than my share of new players buying stuff like Aatrox and Rengar just because they looked cool with no idea on their mechanics, so 4800 isn't actually that much when someone wants the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2016-08-13T15:53:58.225+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might be true, but IP cost has generally reflected a higher skill floor; so there's that to consider","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-08-13T16:55:07.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Wut?{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nIP cost is directly reflective of a champion's age/release date, not skill floor.\nMost of the kits back then were simple because of the tech that they had and the starting League audience they were developing.\nA lot of those champs are getting updated, and as one can clearly see from Ryze and even Taric compared to how they used to be they are no longer 'simple' but have the same ip cost.  Same for Poppy, Sion, GP, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"4th3t0s","date":"2016-08-13T19:15:09.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said \"generally,\" not in the a sense that it's the only factor.
