One another note I don't think he needs an increase in damage but a bit of defensive utility smuggled in somewhere. Me doing well with TF is extremely dependent on my lane matchup and that sucks because all the popular picks for mid pretty much hard counter him. It isn't fair that he gets countered by anyone with a gap closer. It's spell that probably on 3 quarter's of the champs in the lol roster. Aurelion has a stun and a knockback and can kite ppl with his expanded W.\n\nLook at it this way, even viktor gets a bit of mov speed and shielding from his Q. A change like that would be great for TF.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SwiftKitten88","date":"2016-03-19T22:45:33.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=d1m9vR6k,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2016-03-10T01:51:41.862+0000)\n>\n> Possibly.

EVERYTHING i have said has already existed on nid before. and ALL if it existed during a stage were she wasn't in jungle and WASN'T considered \"OP\" so don't tell me re-adding them would suddenly \"make her op\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"KazeNekochan","date":"2016-03-10T18:31:24.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=d1m9vR6k,comment-id=000500000000,timestamp=2016-03-10T01:51:41.862+0000)\n>\n> Possibly.
