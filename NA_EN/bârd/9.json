Each of Lux's new icons have an unique color combination. But Gragas's new ones are all magenta outside of his passive and his Q and E especially look the same when they are small or out of the corner of one's eye.\n\nThe art itself looks wonderful, the icons for a champ just need to be more diverse in color.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-02-02T23:26:17.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*still waits for Janna and Anivia icons*","replies":[{"poster":"Maple Crusader","date":"2016-02-03T18:13:35.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Moonboy65,realm=NA,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=kBR25M27,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-02T23:26:17.143+0000)\n>\n> *still waits for Janna and Anivia icons*\n\nHere are custom Janna icons: \nhttp://img3.leaguecraft.com/skins/asset/skin_1442683555_760px_66033_1.jpg%22\nhttp://leaguecraft.com/skins/66033-janna-new-spell-ability-icons.xhtml","replies":[{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-02-03T19:00:50.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"those aren't custom, it's concept art that was made by Aquatic Moon, who also made the Rammus and Tryndamere icons that are currently being used \n\nhttp://static1.squarespace.com/static/534b8e68e4b057a498ded9ac/56710b38a128e6d40ec293ec/567113fe5a56689d05fe5e40/1450251306899/11-+ICONS_2.jpg?format=1000w","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonboy65","date":"2016-02-02T23:31:16.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gragas E tho, it doesn't look like his in-game animation","replies":[]},{"poster":"LOL Spammer","date":"2016-02-03T01:47:09.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ye these are pretty dope.","replies":[]}]}
