Of course there are issues with reapplied stuns and tenacity as tenacity would no longer reduce the duration that the hook applies CC over, just the length of the small chunks of CC.\n\nThat could probably be coded around though where it is a debuff that prevents anything but movement and yanks them towards Thresh every .5 seconds.
