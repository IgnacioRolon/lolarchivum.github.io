Instakill is just outright shitty design, especially in a game that supports the chaotic environment of a team fight.  I mean, what happened to all that high-minded talk about 'promoting counterplay', and 'shifting power around kits', and all that knob gob about 'play mechanics'? You might as well throw all that out the fucking window. I think much of what you suggested is probably workable or appropriate, but job 1 is fix the stupid damage and then bring some of those other points into line.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Votable Jester","date":"2018-01-31T02:50:51.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"30%?

If she goes in for poke, she must ult and be in a position where she can take significant retaliatory damage.  She also tells them where she'll return to, making it extremely easy to land dead skillshots on her during it.\n\nAs for ccing enemies chasing her, she can be good if you assume nobody interrupts the sleep, but even then it isn't significantly better than Lux or Veigar or Syndra.","replies":[{"poster":"Dope Solo","date":"2018-02-02T02:54:11.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I take significant issue with your use of the word 'must' in this context, which is blatantly false. Zoe does plenty high damage in lane pre-6.
