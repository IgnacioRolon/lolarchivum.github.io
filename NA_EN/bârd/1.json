This is perhaps not the place to criticize her kit (though I personally think it's disjointed and full of generic mechanics), but her appearance, VO and even backstory feel similarly boring, and incongruous with what she's meant to be. What we all hoped for with Kassadin's daughter was to have a human experience the Void's corruption harder than any other, and come out visibly changed from it. What we got instead was a conventionally attractive young woman in a catsuit, with a generically friendly/bubbly female personality and a monotone voice. Many players have pointed out how she has no personality conveyed through her VO or story, particularly for someone whom everyone expected to have PTSD (which would be unique), but her appearance is probably the biggest contradiction: by intentional design, she looks sexy to the average player, with the skin-tight suit and heavy emphasis on cleavage, but one of her few defining characteristics is that she's meant to look monstrous to people in Runeterra. Perhaps the devs wanted to create a sexy female champion, but Kai'Sa really wasn't the right opportunity for it, at least not when we're constantly informed of how physically repulsive she's meant to be.\n\nOn that note: what exactly is the difference between Kaisa and Kai'Sa?

In \"The Girl Who Came Back\" she points out that she has seen their fear 'scrawled across the mud walls' of villages... The fearful added the (Void) mark to her name. She says she was Kaisa when the Void dragged her down. In her head, that is the least of her problems with returning to the real world-- the correct spelling of her name. They are pronounced the same, however. As far as her appearance, the way she moves, her hyper-fast R 'Killer Instinct' even her silhouette would instill fear in the people of Shurima, especially for people who, for the most part, have just second and third hand knowledge of Kai'Sa. Seems only fitting that her legend would grow, people would boast of their encounters with her, telling their own versions. Some true, some embellished, some outright lies. But it is young Illi who has first hand knowledge of who she is, what she wants. It's doubtful her parents would believe her, though. To them, Kai'Sa is the monster who almost killed their little girl, before they drove it back into the Void. Hope that answers some questions.

Was there a character/personality concept for her where she was radically different from what she is now, and if so, what caused it to change?\n\nThose are all great questions. There will be a AMA later this week (Thursday) where the whole team can weigh in. As for her character/personality concept, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted a survivor, someone who never quit. But, in reality, even the most determined person can get vaporized in an instant if they didn't possess the skills to survive, or even if they do and just step in the wrong spot. She was raised in the deserts of Shurima and similar to indigenous tribes and cultures had a baseline set of survival skills that she learned. She used those to live day-by-day. But what separates Champions from the rest is the existence of the extraordinary. Like Newt in Aliens, Kai'Sa was able to survive in her new environment, but unlike Newt, she had a weapon and armor. As far as her PTSD, we wanted to show her now, not as she was three years in the Void, with no hope, abandonment issues, anger and loss of faith. She has a line in her VO, \"Let go of the anger. It does not serve.\" In order to survive-- to get back, she only carried the things that would help her. She had worked out those issues during that time. It's important that she is who she is in game-- a hardened survivor and a hopeful ally in the fight against the Void. She should be messed up, angry, resentful and mercurial, but she's worked that out and she is an example of what can be. One of the cornerstones for me was reading about a certain survivor of a horrific trauma and her telling about how she deals with the memory and guilt and the nightmares. She said that it happened, but she wouldn't let it take any thing else from her. Not one more thing. She decided that was it. It sounded heroic and unimaginable for me to comprehend and that stuck with me. That is who Kai'Sa is. She is a Champion, although she wasn't always one, she became one.","replies":[{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-06T21:29:18.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy with her intent.

When reading through her story, my one question to that was: why? Why did she survive where others did not? What made Kaisa, and Kaisa specifically, a survivor, when full-grown, adult Shurimans didn't make it?\n\nThis is also why I personally am hungry for more exposition with regards to how she dealt with her trauma: it is absolutely inspiring that Kai'Sa managed to work through her issues to become the strong, resilient woman we see now, but what I still don't understand is how she managed to do that, presumably on her own. In real life, veteran soldiers struggle with PTSD they experienced from their adult life, and deal with it for years at a time, even decades, even when surrounded by people they love in a safe environment. For me, if Kai'Sa didn't go through a unique and exceptional healing process that allowed her to deal with her own trauma so quickly and so efficiently, I feel it would implicitly devalue or even dismiss the experiences and efforts of these people. As of yet, that part of her story has not been touched upon.\n\nI completely agree that a champion in League is defined not simply by their power, but by their unique personality, and their characteristics that make them truly stand out, even among other legends. To me, Kai'Sa stands out as the most resilient champion in the entire roster: for a person to survive what she went through, and to grow so strong from it, is exceptional. It is because of this that I am so interested in _why_ she is so exceptional, and how that resilience expressed itself since before even her disappearance. Looking through her lore, her VO, her color story, I don't really see that resilience given the attention it deserves, or explained much at all. Perhaps this could be an opportunity for another story, one where we see Kai'Sa at her lowest point and power through to emerge a stronger woman, but this is an essential characteristic of hers, if not her most iconic personality trait: for it to not be made absolutely clear in any of her on-release visuals, VO, bio, color story, or introductory text, I think is a mistake. While I absolutely look forward to the AMA, I feel that if an out-of-game social media event is necessary to properly explain key aspects of a character, then there are critical gaps in that character's presentation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Terozu","date":"2018-03-06T19:06:40.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this way of thinking.

Having no meaningful reactions with any other champion, especially her father, is insane lol. I would expect her to freak out after finding out her father was alive. Maybe being around him is the only time she would show real emotion. Or maybe like Sion's evolving VO, she's quiet and reserved while battling normal champions but gets disturbingly angry and violent when battling void champions, baron and rift herald. The mood dichotomy would be awesome. \n\nIt's sad that you guys are done with the champ since all this feedback will fall into the void lol. I honestly find her really boring from a player experience perspective. Don't get me wrongI think her kit is awesome and she's bad ass visually.

There will be a AMA later this week (Thursday) where the whole team can weigh in. As for her character/personality concept, we knew from the very beginning that we wanted a survivor, someone who never quit. But, in reality, even the most determined person can get vaporized in an instant if they didn&#x27;t possess the skills to survive, or even if they do and just step in the wrong spot. She was raised in the deserts of Shurima and similar to indigenous tribes and cultures had a baseline set of survival skills that she learned. She used those to live day-by-day. But what separates Champions from the rest is the existence of the extraordinary. Like Newt in Aliens, Kai&#x27;Sa was able to survive in her new environment, but unlike Newt, she had a weapon and armor. As far as her PTSD, we wanted to show her now, not as she was three years in the Void, with no hope, abandonment issues, anger and loss of faith. She has a line in her VO, &quot;Let go of the anger. It does not serve.&quot; In order to survive-- to get back, she only carried the things that would help her. She had worked out those issues during that time. It&#x27;s important that she is who she is in game-- a hardened survivor and a hopeful ally in the fight against the Void. She should be messed up, angry, resentful and mercurial, but she&#x27;s worked that out and she is an example of what can be. One of the cornerstones for me was reading about a certain survivor of a horrific trauma and her telling about how she deals with the memory and guilt and the nightmares. She said that it happened, but she wouldn&#x27;t let it take any thing else from her. Not one more thing. She decided that was it. It sounded heroic and unimaginable for me to comprehend and that stuck with me. That is who Kai&#x27;Sa is. She is a Champion, although she wasn&#x27;t always one, she became one.\n\nPretty unrelated, but is Kai'sa's monster skin inspired by Leto II's sandtrout skin from the Dune universe? After all, it's rather similar in many ways, even more so given that they both came from a desert.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chromatic Eagle","date":"2018-03-05T19:34:17.652+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's able to toggle her chest region in game, so I'm sure she can do that in lore.

In her own bio, it literally says: \"she understands that many of the people she protects would see her as a monster herself.\" Kai'Sa is aware of her own monstrousness and how much she's changed.

It is the simplest, most consistent explanation, one largely supported by context. By contrast, your counter to this is supported by exactly _zero_ facts or textual references, is internally inconsistent, and relies on a great deal many assumptions that are themselves not part of the official story.

By this same reasoning, you may very well come up with any other kind of excuse when the spotlight comes and inevitably pronounces Kai'Sa the way literally everyone else has been pronouncing it. The reality of the matter is, there is currently no source to verify your own fan theory that different pronounciations exist, even though there are plenty of audio files for Kai'Sa where there seems to be no difference, and the very fact that we are arguing on whether an apostrophe subtly changes the pronounciation of a name is itself evidence that the difference, if it even exists, would be too small for all but the most nitpicky of lore aficionados to care.","replies":[{"poster":"GreenLore","date":"2018-03-05T15:26:06.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Honestly I don't think discussing this with you will be productive in any way.\n\nI'm honestly not that interested in this topic about how a name is pronounced or isn't pronounced,especially since we'll get confirmation about all of this in a few days anyway.\n\nYou say the names are pronounced the same way,I say you might be wrong.\n\nIts kinda funny how you tell me that I am just posting a \"fan theory\" and how it all is based on mere assumptions,when you aren't any different.\nI admit I shouldn't have stated my initial thoughts like a fact,that wasn't even my intention I just wrote it in a hurry.\nBut you yourself said that the names are phonetically the same,as if that was a fact in your initial post and has since then tried to defend that statement with everything you got...which like I said were mostly assumptions based on things that could be just as well interpreted differently.\n\n\nSo lets just wait for the champion spotlight,where we'll hear the official pronounciation(heck if we are lucky they might even adress the name change).","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-03-05T16:27:08.006+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GreenLore,realm=EUW,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xhxYw7Ta,comment-id=000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-03-05T15:26:06.056+0000)\n>\n> Honestly I don&#x27;t think discussing this with you will be productive in any way.\n> \n> I&#x27;m honestly not that interested in this topic about how a name is pronounced or isn&#x27;t pronounced,especially since we&#x27;ll get confirmation about all of this in a few days anyway.\n\nYou have nonetheless formulated five separate comments and counting on this matter, and have previously shown no lack of interest in splitting hairs purely for the sake of trying to have the last word.

Only the Watchers actually know what's in the Void because they are its masters (even though they themselves didn't create it). In the only rare circumstances where she actually passed through the Void, was when she was \"Rifting\" with her R. Which is why Kai'Sa gets her full body suit that covers her up completely, to protect her from the actual Void energies that could've harmed her in some way.\n\nThe reason why she turned her name from Kaisa into Kai'Sa was because she treated herself as something different than a human, cue to her transformation and bonding with the symbiote suit, which was originally a Voidspawn she'd killed when she first fell into the caverns. Her VO proves this.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2018-03-06T01:31:33.929+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xhxYw7Ta,comment-id=00000006,timestamp=2018-03-06T00:48:06.968+0000)\n> \n> Again, you are not obligated to like every new champion that comes out and you&#x27;re not obligated to praise Riot for doing so, for the sake of them being new and &quot;unique&quot;.

The fact that she turned out differently from expectation is not actually what I'm criticizing; rather, the fact that she went against expectation by mostly just having characteristics we've seen already on many previous champions is what disappointed me personally, a disappointment evidently shared by quite a few more players. \n\nI don't think Riot needed to slavishly obey player expectations here, and I think in general it's usually a good thing to surpass player expectations with something only a seasoned team of designers can bring to life. However, I do not think going against player expectations is inherently good or bad in itself, though when the expectation had a lot of unique things going for her (e.g. large emphasis on physical and/or mental corruption, a hybridized mix of Voidborn and human traits, the potential exploration of the story of a girl who grew up alone in alien hell), and the reality is something less original (namely the fact that Kai'Sa is conventionally attractive, apparently perfectly physically and mentally healthy, not particularly corrupted, and not actually someone who lived in the Void itself), I do think criticizing the official product as a wasted opportunity is justified. You are perfectly in your right to disagree with this, but that does not invalidate that criticism either.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xhxYw7Ta,comment-id=00000006,timestamp=2018-03-06T00:48:06.968+0000)\n> \n> Except that she was not corrupted by the Void because she did not live in the Void.

This is a big difference. You had way high expectations and even if you say you &quot;read&quot; her bio, you still are making the wrong assumptions.\n\nSo first off, that argument doesn't work, because the Void is shown to corrupt people even when they're near an entrance, not necessarily in it or inside the Void itself, and so in a matter of minutes. A Marai grew a third eye after a few weeks of exposure to an undersea entrance, Malzahar got corrupted just by gazing into the abyss of Icathia, and even ascended god-warriors were consumed by the power that emerged from that same entrance. Meanwhile, Kai'Sa spent literal years physically inside a Void entrance. For her to show no visible corruption at all requires equally exceptional justification, one that isn't provided in any of her stories.\n\nBut beyond that, what I'm criticizing isn't even the specifics. One can make up literally any kind of excuse to justify a writing decision; that does not mean that decision qualifies as good writing. Sure, Kai'Sa is now famous for having lived near a Void entrance, as opposed to the much cooler notion of having survived the actual Void, and that is fine. I don't think that makes her character more interesting, however, and beyond that she still feels underdeveloped, to the point of implausibility: no justification is given for how she appears perfectly mentally healthy, for example, when much tougher people who have lived much less horrible experiences have developed PTSD as a result. Similarly, no justification is given for why or how she took the time to keep her face and hair perfectly clean in that splash art. I'm sure you can come up with some personal explanation to handwave all of this, but the end result is still implausible and incongruous with her circumstances, which itself qualifies as bad writing and character design.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Tomoe Gozen,realm=EUNE,application-id=6kFXY1kR,discussion-id=xhxYw7Ta,comment-id=00000006,timestamp=2018-03-06T00:48:06.968+0000)\n> \n> The reason why she turned her name from Kaisa into Kai&#x27;Sa was because she treated herself as something different than a human, cue to her transformation and bonding with the symbiote suit, which was originally a Voidspawn she&#x27;d killed when she first fell into the caverns. Her VO proves this.\n\nOkay, but as I said in the comment you're replying to, the difference between the two names is literally just an apostrophe in the spelling. A Rioter themselves came directly to this thread to specifically say that Kaisa and Kai'Sa are pronounced the exact same way. At the end of the day, there is a clear disconnect between Kai'Sa being treated by the lore as a creature that is considered monstrous by all but a few people, including herself, and Kai'Sa being presented to the player in a manner intended to be sexually appealing and unambiguously positive, and so to a much wider audience. Again, providing an explanation to a point that was not even being debated does not actually justify the value of whatever it is you're defending, much less present it as objectively good.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomoe Gozen","date":"2018-03-06T12:16:47.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Perhaps \"we all\" in this context can be misleading if interpreted literally, but there was indeed _**a general consensus of player opinion, plus a heap of fan content,**_ that all pointed towards wanting Kassadin's daughter to be heavily corrupted.\n\n_This is the problem._\nSince when we were getting \"fan\" champions and lores?\nIt doesn't really matter what fan content dictated. Riot doesn't make champions according to fan wishes and wants.\n\n>The fact that she turned out differently from expectation is not actually what I'm criticizing; rather, the fact that she went against expectation by mostly just having characteristics we've seen already on many previous champions is what disappointed me personally, a disappointment evidently shared by quite a few more players.\n\nWhat is the basis of your argument?\nActual Voidborn champions? Kai'Sa isn't from the Void nor was she ever in it for a long period of time - unprotected. I'll elaborate on your other point of Void-like mutations from even being near a Void entrance below.\n\n>So first off, that argument doesn't work, because the Void is shown to corrupt people even when they're near an entrance, not necessarily in it or inside the Void itself, and so in a matter of minutes. A Marai grew a third eye after a few weeks of exposure to an undersea entrance, Malzahar got corrupted just by gazing into the abyss of Icathia, and even ascended god-warriors were consumed by the power that emerged from that same entrance.\n\nAgain, you and a lot of other people are IGNORING THE FACT that Kai'Sa killed the Voidborn creature after a few hours/days while being trapped in a cavern out of fear that it was going to kill her instead (like everyone else in her village that fell in with her). So she wasn't a seasoned hunter that knew how to deal with such predators, she's gotten lucky, given that she was still young.\n\nAfter that, the Voidborn's carapace \"fused\" with Kai'Sa's skin and it still wasn't something she wanted or knew how to make use out of to survive, hardcore style. The creature itself came from the Void and it stands to reason that if it lives there, it suffers no damage from the Void energies. **Would you say a fish was drowning in an ocean when it was born in it?** This was Kai'Sa's protection as well. Given that her new relationship is defined as a symbiotic one, both Kai'Sa and this \"creature\" benefited from each other in some way.\nIt's not a parasite that lives off its host.\n\nKaisa also probably did not live near a Void entrance, where her village fell at first. That would've meant that the Void-like corruption was going to take longer or that she was in no danger in the first place.\n\n>no justification is given for how she appears perfectly mentally healthy, for example, when much tougher people who have lived much less horrible experiences have developed PTSD as a result.\n\nExcept that her now Void suit gave her a lot of predatory-like capabilities that augmented her own skills and allowed her to bring the fight to the creatures that wanted to eat her? PTSD is a mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event. This also happens when a person feels like no matter how much of a fight they put on, it's no use and they're forced to endure it. Kaisa was definitely a changed person after her \"traumatic\" encounter and she definitely wasn't weak after her \"transformation\". She fought against the Voidborn for years. And when she finally gets out, she's out to protect the world against the inevitable Void incursions and its Voidspawn.\n\nMost of you simply go over the fact that her story could've pointed out to a more \" PTSD, battle hardened veteran with a lot of scars that show her struggle\", and that's where you leave. You don't go any deeper, do any analysis on her environment or a bit of brainstorming on why she is who she is and why she isn't more traumatized by her ordeal. You have some preconceptions on what should've happened but you ignore all the evidence that points out your idea of the events is incorrect.\n\nI would call this lazy complaining.\nNot a single person who had an issue about Kai'Sa ever went thoroughly into her lore (the Void) and tried to get answers to these questions, they all had an idea of a Void champion looking like a Void champion and that's where the entirety of the misconceptions come from. The only connection Kai'Sa has with the Void is her symbiote suit.\n\n>At the end of the day, there is a clear disconnect between Kai'Sa being treated by the lore as a creature that is considered monstrous by all but a few people, including herself, and Kai'Sa being presented to the player in a manner intended to be sexually appealing and unambiguously positive, and so to a much wider audience.\n\nAs what a Rioter said about champion titles, it also applies to this argument as well: \"Many, if not all champions are not aware of how people perceive them or call them\". Kai'Sa might consider herself a monster and maybe a few who've seen her also do (because in her full suit, she does resemble a humanoid Voidborn). But her title \"the Daughter of the Void\" doesn't sound monstrous to me. If this is her title given to her by the people, her own perception doesn't really align with what the most of Runnaterrans perceive her as.","replies":[{"poster":"HeresyUntoFedex","date":"2018-03-07T07:19:47.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> \n> *Would you say a fish was drowning in an ocean when it was born in it?*\n> \n> \n\nNo, but melding a giant fish into your body will not save you from drowning.\n You need to get real, the void suit makes absolutely no sense even by cheeky fantasy logic.

Since Kai'Sa reads to us like a pretty normal-looking human, we are of course going to be confused when other characters and even herself treat her appearance as horrific.

When a Marai dove towards the Void entrance at the bottom of the ocean, he became corrupted enough to grow a third eye in the space of a few weeks. Similarly, Malzahar's exposure to the Void seems to have turned his brain into a Void heart, also giving him the appearance of a third eye. His Voidling minions also have three eyes, and even Vel'Koz has three mini-eyes over his main central one. From what the story says, Kai'Sa spent literal years in the Void entrance, including a significant amount of time with her head and face unprotected, which should have been more than enough to alter her appearance. Giving her a third eye at the very least could have been an easy way to make her appearance much more unnerving, and so in a way that would call back to what we know so far about the Void. Right now, though, her presentation does not lend itself to that at all, and I feel even explicitly aims to make her sexually appealing to the player instead, in stark contrast to how she's meant to come across in the in-game universe.","replies":[]}]}]}
