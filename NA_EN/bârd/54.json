I didn't buy him until this year and then they changed the passive on me. I'm okay with it though, it seemed weird that he would have a supportive passive anyway. Was his old kit including more support abilities?","replies":[{"poster":"KyojiTakajo","date":"2017-07-05T15:13:05.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His old kit was basically the same in concept. Turrets didn't have a laser to charge up and just did their basic attack, you couldn't aim your rockets and it would be a lock on to any target within a certain range, somewhat like old Soraka Q. His old E was still the grenade but I believe all it did was blind or stun if you hit with the center. His R was an upgrade to all his abilities for a short time, his turrets attacked faster, W did more damage, E traveled faster (IIRC).","replies":[{"poster":"SanKakU","date":"2017-07-05T16:20:47.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I see, so it look like his update was a decent one then on the whole.

His old passive worked on turrets, and that was its use: he could heal his own turrets and even rift towers and this was to augment his sieging capability.
