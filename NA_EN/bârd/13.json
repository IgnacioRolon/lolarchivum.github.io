There is little to no communication as to how much Armor/MR a target has in game right now outside of looking at their statline. Contrast this to a unit that stacks Health, where there Healthbar actually visually changes. It would be cool if we could accomplish something similar for Armor/MR.","replies":[{"poster":"Teridax68","date":"2015-08-11T00:43:21.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a gameplay designer, what would you think about yellow/purple contours to health bars that would get more intense as a target would increase their armor and MR, respectively? This is definitely a question better-suited towards an artist or visual designer, but as a player and tester, would you think this would give clearer feedback as to a champion's resists?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotRepertoir","date":"2015-08-11T01:32:29.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something like that seems like the best place to start, but as you've noted, an artist or UI expert would be best suited to figuring out the best solution.
