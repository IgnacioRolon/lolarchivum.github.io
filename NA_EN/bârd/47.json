Resurrected allies cannot cast their ultimate abilities.\n\n**E: Rend**\n\n*Unchanged*\n\n**R: The Pact/Fate's Call**\n160/140/120 second CD, 100 mana\n\n**The Pact**: The first time Kalista uses this ability, she uses it to choose an ally anywhere on the map. Designate them as your *Oathsworn* for the remainder of the match. Cannot be done in combat.\n\n**Fate's Call**: Kalista calls upon the power of the pact.\n\n* Self Cast: Kalista calls her *Oathsworn* to her side, wherever they are. Can only be done while the Oathsworn is out of combat with champions.\n* Oathsworn cast: Kalista steps through the mist to join her *Oathsworn*. Can only be done while Kalista is out of combat with champions.\n\nWhen a champion is transported by *Fate's Call*, they are rendered invisible and untargetable for 2 seconds, but are also pacified.","replies":[{"poster":"Wordz8 for Jesus","date":"2019-11-12T13:33:09.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I have an idea that would be simpler than a whole rework, just a buff, that isn't to her skirmisher solo style nor 2v2, just her zone threat.\n\nI was thinking increase the duration of the Rend stacks remaining in targets to 6 seconds, while she isn't basic attacking them. \n* Compare Xayah's feathera on the ground\n* (admittedly Xayah can't refresh the duration, other than putting down new feathers)\n* I'd be fine with the duration only applying to only non-champions too.\n* (Actually just to be safe could also exclude Baron &amp; Dragon, since Riot wants to nerf her objective control)\n\nand give Pierce, an execute/bonus damage against non-champions\n\nGoal:  {{champion:429}} she stacks up on minions and gets some damage threat zone control.\nThese buffs would open the window of time of her threat existing longer.  \n\nHow this could go badly: Pros use Pierce to steal enemy jungle camps faster.  \nOr the window might be too big, since don't have to get minions as low, nor auto to refresh killing the trap set up minion.\n\nBut I am trying to aim this at low elo.  For the people who have trouble figuring how low a minion has to be to Pierce through onto an enemy, and those that have trouble timing when Rend will expire, but in that cause consistency might be better.\n\nEdit:\nI guess this is increasing her boom opportunities, rather than power.
