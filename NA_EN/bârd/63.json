In this case, sightstone. Even if you never EVER place a ward, you still get the added health bonus from its direct stats. Corrupting potion, refillable health potions, control wards, etc all require you to activate them to get any use at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mysticman89","date":"2017-09-02T03:43:49.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kinda surprised he can't change trinkets.\n\nHe's not meant to be able to get potions to stop infinite sustain, but I don't see why trinkets should be stopped (since changing trinkets resets their cooldown anyway).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roaming Noman","date":"2017-09-02T03:17:45.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can other starting items be built?","replies":[{"poster":"Bârd","date":"2017-09-02T03:40:18.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.
