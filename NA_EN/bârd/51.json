A random jungler could come out at any moment from any number of fog of war places and there isn't much a support can do about it. Now how 2 people going into the jungle to ward together? Fat chance.

It's a tedious process of warding probably not so useful places just so you can safely ward more useful places, but it at least can push out your ward line slowly but surely.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PaladinNO","date":"2017-01-30T19:34:04.452+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Expect the spawn of dragons every 6 minutes today\" ~ Forecast {{champion:40}} \n\nI haven't seen ANY of these dragons in all of my 6428 ARAM games.
