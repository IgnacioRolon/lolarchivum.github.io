There is a delay between being devoured and being able to jump out however, so if you're not seeing an immediate exit you'll need to click again a bit later.","replies":[{"poster":"exe3","date":"2015-07-17T08:30:34.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe there needs to be more indicators for when you can and can't escape. In my experience it's honestly felt really unresponsive to the point where i'm convinced it's majorly bugged. An indicator even pops up but then disappears and I have no idea what's going on. I just wish I could get out immediately, so much trolls when one eats you when you don't want him to. :(","replies":[{"poster":"John JJ Schmidt","date":"2015-07-17T14:20:05.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Tahm, he gets a range indicator when he's able to spit them out.
