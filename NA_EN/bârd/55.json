The problem is that dodging a skillshot requires a player's attention which removes their ability to focus on other things, the punishment for not giving that attention is grossly disproportionate to the cost on Nidalee's part.

Ping EVERY mia.  Also, putting a pink ward in your botside river brush pays HUGE dividends in low elo especially.  People just don't check that little bush.  It gives your laners a heads up if she is moving bot though river.  The tribush at the botlane is a little more problematic because you cant ideal ward it yourself because its too far away.  Additonally, my general rule of thumb is if I am mid lane and my laner is missing, if I cant take the tower, I am just going to head bot lane as 9 out of 10 times that's where their mid laner is along with probably their jungle and they are going to need all the help they can get.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"j j","date":"2015-03-16T15:16:11.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yuki Akuma,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zona0NV3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-16T05:00:58.619+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:25}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:31}}\n\nAll of which get out roamed by leblanc gg.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jarrito232","date":"2015-03-16T12:32:07.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":10,"body":"Le Blanc.
