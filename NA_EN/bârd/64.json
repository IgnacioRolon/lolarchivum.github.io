Filler name &quot;Darkin&quot;\r\n\r\nMelee/ranged\r\n\r\nMelee auto attack is him slashing his wings\r\nRanged auto attack is a pulse of black energy from his palm. Think dark iron man.\r\nManaless. Uses &quot;shade&quot; as a resource\r\nPassive, Bleak skies:\r\n After having not taken or dealt damage for 6 seconds, he flies out of reach of enemy melee champions and enemy skill shots. Minions cannot target him, and enemy ranged basic attacks/target abilities are only effective at half range. While flying, he also ignores terrain and gains move speed. Casting an damaging spell while flying will have an extra effect and cause him to land. Clearing wards does not cause landing.\r\n\r\nThink mobis on steroids.\r\n\r\nQ, Black wings/Black Gauntlet:\r\nToggled on: Darkin turns his wings into enchanted obsidian, granting a shield and movement speed on activation. While his wings are black he is melee and has a furor effect, as well as 2 seconds off the cooldown of bleak skies. Activating while flying also grants stealth.\r\nToggled off: Darkin coats his arms in a layer of enchanted obsidian, granting attack damage on activation. While his guantlets are equipped, Darkin is ranged, his basic attacks have half their damage replaced with magic damage. Activating in flight causes his basic attacks to deal an additional 10% true damage for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nW, Ominous storm:\r\nSends a cloud of obsidian dust to a target location within 2500 range. This cloud takes 2 seconds to reach its target at max range. Enemies inside have their resistances reduced, take magic damage and are slowed. Enemies inside the cloud cannot see what happens outside of it, and vice versa. Allies in the cloud gain resistances, and are healed for an amount equal to the damage the cloud has dealt. The cloud lasts 7 seconds If cast while flying, Ominous storm appears at thee target location and as a trail around yourself for 7 seconds. \r\n\r\nE, Black Hawk:\r\nDarkin flies in a straight line, up to 1500 range or until you hit a wall. Darkin moves quickly, but cannot alter his course. If he has black wings enabled, He deals physical damage and stuns the target. If he has black Gauntlet enabled, he deals physical damage and jumps back from the target. Casting in flight causes an explosion of obsidian shards on impact, dealing AOE damage and shredding armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nR, Obsidian Crag/Blot out the Sun:\r\nIf Darkin is in Wings mode, he circles the skies in a target area within 3000 range once, before crashing into the ground, spreading an obsidian crag to the entire area. While standing on obsidian, Darkin enters Bleak skies 2 seconds faster (stacking with the buff on Wings), and enemies take physical damage whenever they take a step due to sharp obsidian spikes and treacherous terrain. If cast while flying, enemy champions are taken to the center of the crag.\r\n\r\nIf Darkin is in Gauntlet mode, he fires Dark energy into the sky of a target area within 3000 range, causing reduced vision in the area. After 1 second, a wave of daggers falls through the entire area, dealing physical damage and rooting everyone hit for 0.5 seconds for each dagger that hits them, up to 2 seconds. If cast while flying, a second wave fires after one more second.\r\n\r\nProbably not the best idea for a kit, but the point of this thing is to get riot thinking on the next of the Darkin.\r\n\r\n{{champion:266}}  is lonely\r\n{{champion:432}} is not darkin, but I would love to see that skin.","replies":[{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2015-05-01T06:55:44.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"FYI aatrox is the sword not the person so it wouldn't make sense to have darkin wings as a character unless the wings somehow are not fully attacked to darkin\nI have an idea!\nwhat about a darkin adc\nAaron the Darkin Bow (pronounced A-A-Ron the As are stressed so you pronounce the vowel so don't pronounce the name as Airin)","replies":[{"poster":"Neamean","date":"2015-05-01T07:32:07.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aatrox is not the sword, that is only a theory\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw","replies":[{"poster":"2000boxes","date":"2015-05-02T20:21:43.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wow\ni've never seen this before\ni only watch cartoonetwork and disney channel so i didn't know this was already a joke i just call my friend A-A-ron sometimes\nand it's pretty odvious aatrox is the sword\nwhy do you think it is called the Darkin **Blade** \nand the lore even hints at it when it mentions the sword as a living being\nand if you look at aatrox's crit animation, the sword gets all wiggly and stuff","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2015-05-02T22:45:14.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sword being living and it being Aatrox are two different things.

I do think the Darkin will be tied into LoL alot more, some really interesting pieces are already set out as fairly common knowledge\n\nCurrent Champs who can POTENTIALLY be Darkin:\n\nVarus- bloodlust, and living weapon (bow)\n\nBrand- Similar to Varus, possibly spirit invading his mind (Varus bow may be a result of the darkin spirit invading his mind/body), states that the being the possessed Brand is ANCIENT, gained BLOODLUST. Both Varus+Brand consumed and transformed by fire\n\nJax- Could also be a magelord (look @ Aatrox lore), saved some of the magelord because he thrives on battle and Protectorates winning outright would put them in total control, limiting battle. So the theory is Aatrox saved some of the magelords (Jax race listed as Unknown and no champ appears close to him physically, 3 fingers purple, and 2 abilities seem to use MAGIC to enhance his attacks (Empower and Grandmaster's Might) and Aatrox may have implanted one of the remaining Darkin spirits in Jax so that he can eventually seek revenge (more battles for Aatrox).\n\nNautilus- Similar to Varus/Brand normal human, falls into black liquid (similair to the Pit of Pallas) and then after he is changed into what he is now gained bloodlust towards the sailors that abandoned him.\n\nTryndamere - Direct contact with Aatrox, seemed to have infused the bloodlust into Tryn, skin Demonbnlade Tryn can be a fully corrupted Tryn with his sword eventually molding into his arm. Also the Aatrox quote to Tryn \"Tryndamere...my greatest creation.\" Hints that Tryn has been changed directly by Aatrox, possibly turning him into a Darkin.\n\n\n\nSide note: This is not done by me but by Redmercy and some looking @ reddit posts. If you want to see full credit for the video please watch this \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ75ChovsJM\n\n\nPersonally I see the Darkin as a race with amazing fighting power, who become corrupted/infused and seek vengeance, leading to the appearance of bloodlust. And once vengeance is done I believe they become more corrupted and lose all their humanity (demonblade Tryn) becoming a creature of battle and bloodlust.","replies":[]}]}
