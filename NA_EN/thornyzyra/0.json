I understand that it's easier to summon plants out because it has a longer horizontal line but if you add an outer circle range to the original old circle Q, it would also be easier to summon plants out too. I know this is a bit too much to ask but after the Q  rework, I never feel satisfy using her Q, not just because its damage is lower, but its wonky rectangular shape. I do see a lot of Zyra players feel the same way like I do so I hope you re-consider this. Thank you for reading.

At 30 minutes a support Zyra may be around 200 AP while mid Zyra will probably be around 400. If Deathcap ever becomes a legitimate option that would be in the order of 550.
