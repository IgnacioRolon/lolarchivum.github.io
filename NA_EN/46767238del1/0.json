A bad or slow connection could have caused a hiccup.  After it ran for a while, it may have finally been able to catch up and finish applying the patch.  I recommend using our [connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide to optimize your connection and prevent a slow down like this happening again.
