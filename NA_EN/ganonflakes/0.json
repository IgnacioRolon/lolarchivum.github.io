I've tried opening up Wireshark and trying to find packets that were taking an oddly long time between hops but didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Now I'm also going to say I only have a basic understanding of how the protocols work so it's a very real possibility I missed something less obvious. It happens usually a couple times a minute where ping goes from 20 to 150+. I saw that there was an issue on EU servers but I'm on the NA server. So I'm coming here to find out what my next step should be in resolving the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-23T00:48:15.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not familiar with Wireshark, but it sounds like you are having some packet loss to me.
