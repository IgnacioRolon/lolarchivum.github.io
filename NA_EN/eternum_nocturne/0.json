In the screenshot you can see each item block is named (even those above the item sets in the image are all named), and there is my personal consumables block that is the exact same spelling as the one with the control ward.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-12-14T03:52:05.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea but it looks like that block above the control ward is named the exact same thing as the control ward block.

I have the same problem and it was even more acute. I had done some item sets, one of which really included this Control ward item. 2-3 weeks ago I estimated that not only it was spamming in the item sets that I've created without the ward, but some sub-tables of mine included items from other item sets, sometimes appearing in all or almost all item sets that I have done(for example I have done a list of all Ornn items and all of them started to appear at all my item sets) I found out that if I delete all item sets ( ! :/ ) that contained the Ornn's items and the spamming potions, in some cases some item sets, created from Recommended with almost no my changes, such spams disappeared. But this Control Ward item NEVER disappears and I don't understand why. Pls, RIOT, it's confusing as i have to search my sets and I hit on a subsection with an item usually far not so useful in most my matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pugs n hugs","date":"2017-12-19T02:55:55.233+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Domesdos","date":"2018-02-25T21:46:58.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same bug for me as of patch 8.4\nIn addition if I name a custom category \"Situational\" it always gets renamed to \"Situational Items\" ingame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gary B Enkelis","date":"2018-02-07T23:21:39.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have this issue on the current patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coudu31","date":"2018-01-17T19:55:39.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nilio","date":"2018-03-26T09:04:37.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this still a thing?! patch 8.6, still happens... cmon...
