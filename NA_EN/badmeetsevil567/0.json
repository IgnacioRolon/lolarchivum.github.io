Also...\r\n\r\nYour game is already struggling to retain its player/viewer base. Now you decide to alienate your customers with your morally repugnant, hypocritical, leftwing identity politics. \r\n\r\nPlaying LOL is a waste of time anyways. Knowing that Riot has gone full social justice warrior, openly discriminating against people at their events, and presumably within the company itself, I feel like I can easily step away from this game with no regrets.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re a talented Rioter, I suggest you dust off the resume, and abandon this sinking ship. Riot announced that they are going reevaluate language, and of all the words they could have chosen to make this point, they highlighted- &quot;meritocracy.&quot; They&#039;re not even hiding their approach. Your talents will not be appreciated at Riot Games if you do not fill some diversity quota. Prepare to be passed up for promotions as the leftist &quot;Diversity and Inclusion&quot; officers seek to settle the score against whatever identity group they decide you belong to. Also, should a workplace conflict arise between yourself (the member of an out-group) and a co-worker who belongs to a preferred victim group, it is virtually guaranteed that you will be railroaded and smeared. \r\n\r\nGet out of there with your reputation intact.","replies":[]}
