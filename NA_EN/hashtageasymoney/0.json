It will happen on someone else's pick. The timer will run down to zero but then never go to the next pick. It will sit at zero for about 30-60 seconds then it will say everyone has left the room. Following that I'm returned to \"assemble your party\" with a nice punishment for \"abandoning a game during champ select\" the most recent disconnect I was not given a notice that I was disconnected just returned to \"assemble your team\" I have lost a significant amount of LP from this and now have a half hour punishment queue. Is this another one of those things I just need to wait 2 weeks for riot to fix or has anyone had any success finding a way around this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2016-07-22T16:37:37.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the timer in champion select runs down to 0 and is unresponsive, it's typically caused by a disconnection from the server. The server stops receiving a response from you, but it continues going on with the champ select. Because your client is disconnected from the server, it doesn't show what's going on next. There are a number of local or ISP network configurations that could cause this to happen, but our [connection guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) covers the most common solutions. \n\nLet me know if you still see issues after running through those steps.","replies":[]}]}
