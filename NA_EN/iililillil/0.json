I understand the fact that Kayle is balanced for higher elo, but down here in low silver games its basically a guaranteed win if the Kayle knows what they are doing, because its pretty challenging to force the end of games in low silver no matter how ahead you are... I just played a game where my team was ahead in gold for literally the entire first 34 minutes of a 38 minute game. From 10 minutes to 30 minutes we were ahead by 4k - 10k gold. We tried, but we just couldn't siege and force the end of the game. Maybe our Zyra played too cautiously, ending the game with 0 deaths.. Maybe we should have splitpushed more.. Im not sure. That is why I'm silver, I guess.. What I do know is that the enemy Kayle got shoved out of midlane early and disappeared into the fog farming everything he possibly could, while his team got bullied in every lane and his towers fell. And then, suddenly, Kayle joins the fights with 2.5 attack speed with damage coming from Aflame (the passive that does waves of true damage) that is reminiscent of the fountain. After being irrelevant and arguably useless, Kayle hits level 16 and suddenly does more damage than everyone, and there is absolutely no counterplay. My overall team KDA was 44/31/65.. The enemy JG ended the game 0/12/7 with literally 0 dmg to turrets and 8.5k dmg to champs in total.. But because Kayle managed to hit level 16, none of that mattered. It felt like the win was stolen from us by Riot's balancing crew. It was like watching a teammate AFK or having my computer crash while my team is up 8k gold.. Just take your hands off the keyboard and mouse, GGFF, there is nothing that can be done.\n\nI have seen games like that over and over, playing with and against Kayle. I have won and lost games I didnt deserve to, because Kayle is ridiculously overpowered in low elo.\n\nAm I the only one that sees Kayle become an absolutely bonkers, unbeatable champ after level 16?","replies":[{"poster":"FioraWillCarry","date":"2019-05-02T20:01:15.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I played a bunch of Kayle games recently in Silver and every single win I got is because my team won it. Went from Silver 4 to Silver 2 completely on the luck of better teams. Not one of those games did I really do anything to win. The teams would have won even if I afked. Then of course came the losses. If I can't do anything in winning games I don't have to tell you what happens in losing games. \n\nI mained old Kayle to the tune of 1.5 million mastery points, her being by far my best and most played champions and after playing this new Kayle, I have no choice but to completely drop her. This new Kayle is utterly useless. I don't see how anyone can carry with this champion. Now I have to find a new main I click with like I clicked with her. I'm kinda stuck on Fiora atm but she has way too many frustrating weaknesses. I would really like old Kayle back if I'm to be honest.\n\nAnd if you're losing to Kayle in Silver, I really don't know what to tell you. Kayle is just a free win whenever I see her on the enemy team because most people try to play her the way they play other champions. Other champions can trade, contest waves, assist in ganks etc. Kayle is too weak to do any of these things effectively. The correct way top play her is to sit back and soak xp while getting whatever meager farm your opponent allows you to get until you get ranged form. Silver players will almost never do this because it's too boring. They will try to fight or contest waves at some point and they will die. Many times, they would do this multiple times until they're like 0-4. Laning against Kayle is about the best thing that can happen to you in Silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"69stonedstud420x","date":"2019-05-02T17:10:19.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she was auto win all the kayle players wouldn't be low elo.  Honestly,  Low Elo players don't see the whole picture of what is and isn't good in low elo yet,  because if they had that level of understanding or even mechanic proficiency without that level of understanding they wouldn't be there.
