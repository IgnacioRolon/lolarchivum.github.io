I already tried reinstalling the game altogether, checked all security and firewall settings, even made sure my connection was ample to patch, and it is now saying that an unspecified error has occurred which probably means I dug myself further into a hole. If anyone knows a fix or is willing to help that would be much appreciated, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-12T16:55:19.015+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the reports everyone!  There seems to be an issue with players failing to patch, and I've forwarded the details to interested parties for review.  In the meantime, take a few moments to go over each step of the [permissions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions) guide to troubleshoot.  This will help rule out possibilities with potential changes in security settings that might be preventing game files from being accessed.\n\n\nI'll let you guys know if I get any updates or find any issues with our patching servers as well.  Hang tight!\n\n> **UPDATE @ 10:53am PT** In some cases, [reconfiguring your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) may resolve the issue for some players.  Updates are also being offerred on the [service status](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#na) page.  I know a few are moving their clocks back, but do this at your own risk.  Doing so may run the risk of unforseen issues with your OS as well as getting into a game.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Rædwulf","date":"2017-08-12T17:01:27.890+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi there Porocles, I tried these 2 options and they both worked for me, maybe it will help you guys identify the issue, Cheers for being so fast to reply.\n\n1.Open your LoL installation folder, open CONFIG Folder, open ''LeagueClientSettings.yaml'' with notepad and you will see that under the line ''global'' there is a region line, modify that to a region other than yours, open the client, close it back, modify the file to your original region.\n2.Or just open the client through the lol.launcher.admin.exe in your LoL installation folder, let it patch, change the region, close and reopen to change it back to your region.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-08-12T17:04:37.569+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this info!
