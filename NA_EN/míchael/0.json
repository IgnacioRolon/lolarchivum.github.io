I did participate in the impact challenge and i am currently sporting the icon from that event. Is it also an added bonus that you get the all stars icon for free? just to be sure i wasnt going crazy i went on a seperate acc i have that didnt participate in the impact challenge and it had its ranked rewards but not the all star icon","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-10T17:51:41.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The All-star icon is for participating in the voting, and there's no bonus or other way to receive it.
