I am very very impressed what has changed in the game. The biggest change being Team Builder Que...this takes away the BIGGEST annoyance the game had which was who goes where, who called it first &amp; so on. This makes me want to play the game again. All the other changes I've noticed are great as well, the graphics upgrade looks really great.. nice &amp; polished &amp; the changes to summoners rift are fantastic with dragon &amp; the look in general. Great Job riot! I was once a hard core player &amp; I just may be again =)","replies":[]}
