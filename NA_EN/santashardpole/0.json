I have asked so many rioters this and all they reply is sometimes people have bad games sometimes its just not their day. Like legit no get off my back and penalise these idiots if you are going to penalise me for flaming them because muting them does not make me stop seeing they rubbish game play. Leaving the game I am penalised with leaver buster so please get your things together and make a reasonable punishment for those who deserve it not for those who've tried yet nothing comes about of it.\n\nLegit spend so much time in this game but all I feel like I'm getting is getting smacked by a brick wall whenever I am penalised for no reason or because a team mate isn't cooperating then I get punished for either afk or flaming.\n\nAlso please do not reply that I get matched with people who play like me cause that's absolute rubbish because I never afk on purpose nor do I ever feed on purpose or purposely throw the game cause I don't like my team","replies":[]},{"poster":"EvilDustMan","date":"2017-03-03T22:01:27.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Tantram,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=EyIjtUxh,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2017-03-03T21:59:05.593+0000)\n>\n> feeding = intentionally giving kills to the other team\n> afk = doing nothing.\n\nFair enough, I guess I would have been harsher.

Also at one point someone was DDOS'ing me and openly admitted to it on my twitch channel. I screen shot this persons conversations with me and sent them to riot so they could remove my 30 min queue and dishonorable standing. And they refused saying there was nothing they can do which is honestly bullshit because we all know you can, you just wont. The riot support agent advised me to contact my Internet provider for help with the ddos but the thing is that wasn't what I was even asking him to dooooooooo he was deflecting my question to irrelevancy I'm not slow I have the online I fixed my ddos problem I asked you to fix my league problem but let me guess \"there is nothing you can do.\" So even after providing sufficient evidence to my problem and how it wasn't my fault they still did NOTHING NNNOOOTTHHIINNNGGGGGGG.
