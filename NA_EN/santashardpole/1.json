I usually report it as unsportsmanlike but i'm not sure if that's the best way to categorize it. \n\nAlso someone who constantly picks fights irrespective of any form of context (wards, enemy strength, etc...) can be hard to distinguish from intentional feeding sometimes. For example the 3/3/1 top laner might flame the 0-5-2 mid laner a bit, and then proceeds to silently pick 7 bad fights in a row and i can't tell if he's inting to get back at the mid laner out of frustration or just bad at teamfights.
