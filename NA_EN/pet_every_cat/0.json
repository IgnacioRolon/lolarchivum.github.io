I've never heard of anyone's keys and chests being removed. all my skin shards and champ shards ect are still there , just the chests and key frags are gone . i thought it would come back after my punishment was over. i'm eligible to earn loot again also but my loot never returned ","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-31T16:43:21.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat restrictions do not remove hextech content, just prevents you from earning some after a game.  I looked into your case and don't see anything missing.  In case you are on the updated client, you could be having a syncing issue.  Just swap back to the legacy client and back.\n\n-  On the login screen of the open beta updated client, look for the \"Launch Legacy Client\" text at the bottom.\n-  Or create a shortcut directly to the legacy client in your League Installation. Just look for \"lol.launcher\" \n\nHope that helps clear things up!","replies":[{"poster":"Pet Every Cat","date":"2017-03-31T18:08:25.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i pretty much only use the legacy client , i have too many problems with the Alpha client (mostly due to my toaster of a laptop). my first game after the punishment i got the message in the post screen about how you can't earn loot so i went and clicked on my loot just to check it out and that's when i noticed they were gone. i tried logging in then out again (legacy client) and nothing was there. then i tried going into the Alpha client and nothing was there. i figured it was just part of the punishment and they would return once i was eligible to earn loot again but they're still gone. I'll try logging in and out again i guess but i have done so a few times already. thanks for looking into though","replies":[{"poster":"Pet Every Cat","date":"2017-03-31T20:44:44.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still not there no matter how many times i log in and out and on which client","replies":[]}]}]}]}
