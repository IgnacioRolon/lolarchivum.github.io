Bull shot pulls are getting annoying at this stage, especially when getting pulled is such a big deal.\n\nAlso fix the fact Thresh is still tethered onto you even when you block it by spell shield, meaning he can still fly to you even if the spell shield is popped as it seems spell shields only blocks and root and drag but not the hook itself. I think it's a bug (hopefully it's not intended).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geauxx","date":"2017-07-12T06:23:23.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No counter? \n\n{{champion:25}}","replies":[{"poster":"Takazaki","date":"2017-07-12T06:52:41.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}}  wants to get hooked \n{{champion:201}} can stop all hooks\n{{champion:53}} better at roaming\n{{champion:40}} better at peeling\n{{champion:43}} has an arguable better engage/disengage with stronger shielding and more damage\n{{champion:89}} locks down harder\n\n\nwow its almost like thresh is the jack of all trade and master of none!\n\nthresh is outclassed by any other support when it comes to one given thing, but that was the idea. he is only considered **the best support** because with skill he can overcome that inherit weakness. making his success based on the player and how capable the enemy team is with dealing with him. he is the \"slayer\" of supports and IMO there is nothing wrong with him functioning as such as he brings interesting an dynamic game play\n\nunlike other supports who either just brick wall you or bully you into submission","replies":[{"poster":"chipndip1","date":"2017-07-12T07:34:05.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona sucks in general\n\nJanna ONLY peels, and thus she can't make a lead well, which is more important now that games end at around 30 minutes on average.\n\nKarma doesn't have better engage or disengage than Thresh.

Janna kinda peels off anything he does, but he can just hook Janna herself or roam, leaving Janna to just float around.

Anyways, you can dodge hooks until you're blue but he has two other powerful CC abilities. Blitzcrank can hook, but he can't peel, and it doesn't set up an engage as much as it does a pick. Thresh can shield, and peel, and whisk someone away. CY@ Janna, Braum, Blitzcrank, Bard, and others. Thresh can become a considerable brawler if bot lane comes ahead, because falling behind isn't already challenging enough. Now you have to fight a brawler with more CC than just about anyone and an ADC. Need a tank? Thresh can do that. It's ridiculous. He's not OP, just about everyone else is subpar in Solo Queue if proficiency levels are equal compared to him. Anyways the point of this thread wasn't to ask for nerfs.
