He singlehandedly counters every mage in the game basically, can terrorize marksmen too, and can outburst other assassins.\n\nNot fun to play against is very subjective and definitely hard to \"balance,\" but it boils down to \"Nothing you do will be effective enough to stop Yasuo from farming, and becoming strong enough to kill you or your team 1v1 no matter what.\" Not being able to impact your lane simply \"Because Yasuo\" is toxic, laning against him puts a bitter taste in someones mouth, and breeds hate for everything that he can do.\n\nPeople tend to hate on champs because they have mechanics that are just broken. Yasuo is constantly running around, has dashes, but for some reason gets a broken ass \"fuck you button\" known as Windwall just to ignore even more skillshots so he can farm in peace... He dosnt have to dodge skillshots like others, he just blocks them, then when youre stuffs on cooldown he dashes you.... FUN ISNT IT!\" Should he mess up and actually get hit... no big, free shield for sustain..... cause.... more fuck you, passive fuck you in the shields case.\n\nFace it, everything Yasuo does is designed to thwart any and all attempts to harass him to get him low, and then make a kill play against him. While at the same time he has a kit to quickly approach and injure his enemies. This makes counter play against a good Yasuo so narrow as to be nearly non-existent. Its this narrow window of attack, while he has free farm the rest of the time, a huge threat zone of YOUR ENTIRE minion wave that makes laning against him a pain people have trouble tolerating.\n\nYasuo is also really popular, so that kinda helps shed a little light on his power... oh, yeah no just Yasuo lovers only right? I mean Vayne was declared the uber META ADC and only every game everyone played in the last 1/3 of this season had someone trying to dickride the most META ADC... so dont act like people arnt/havent been doing the same with Yasuo and his popularity. You know what really makes a champ popular, winning games with them when they have an oppressive kit with too much kill power, and tons of safety bolted on top.\n\nYou want a \"reasonable\" discusion? Then start with acknowledging that there is a lot of hate for the champ, and trying to figure out why, then discuss either solutions for one to aleviate the frustration in the game, or fixes for the champ because theyre broken.\n\nEither way, deeming people unreasonable and therefor of no substantive opinion so you wont be forced to give your own substantive opinions is... unreasonable.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lugg","date":"2015-11-08T06:45:23.662+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":9,"body":"Yas is already too strong.

I've had some time with him on the PBE as well and can confirm it's not that much better. You don't have access to the new passive until at least your first back, and even then it'll be unreliable until you finish a shiv.\n\nYeah, you get 100% off of two items, but that's not all too different from how it is on live. Hell, with the lowered damage on most of the items he builds, he's certainly taking a hit to go along with those indirect buffs. Honestly, it feels more like his mid game power spike is more noticeable because of the mastery and Shiv changes, but it largely evens out by end game either way.","replies":[{"poster":"LankPants","date":"2015-11-08T10:52:13.660+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":3,"body":">Yeah, you get 100% off of two items, but that's not all too different from how it is on live. \n\nHe gets 100% crit for 3300 gold, you only need SS and a Cloak.

You can get 96% for 6700, either way it's still double what you'd need for 100% on the PBE. \n\nDenying that this is a massive buff is just wrong.\n\n>Honestly, it feels more like his mid game power spike is more noticeable because of the mastery and Shiv changes, but it largely evens out by end game either way.\n\nOutside of Bronze mid game is more important than late game.

I run 17% crit (2x from passive) in my runes, as well as lifesteal, and Brawler's Glove is still pretty suboptimal.\n\nNow I'll compare numbers. On live, buying Shiv + cloak will, on average, make his Q deal 100+Base Attack x 2 x 0.75 (x 0.8 to account for 80% crit chance) damage before mitigation. On the PBE, the crit is a flat 100%, that turns into 100+Base Attack x 2 x 0.75. At level 10, that will be 216 and 270, respectively. Now knock off 33% of that off of a measly 50 base armor and that difference shrinks down to 33 damage. Your auto attacks are at ~115 and 144, which shrink to ~77 and ~96 after armor.\n\nHonestly? I'm not very impressed by those numbers. They're something, sure, but they don't look cataclysmic. Worst case scenario?  They mess with Yasuo's AD growth because the balance team guys want to push crit chance and weaken Infinity Edge and they don't seem likely to mess with either Shiv or IE's crit numbers.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FakeGravity","date":"2015-11-08T17:21:50.337+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss playing old morde against him \n\nSeeing him use wind wall against my E just to take damage anyway since isn't a skill shot is priceless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spoofghoul","date":"2015-11-08T13:26:04.613+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean yasuo gets 60% crit from {{item:3087}}  alone, just get {{item:1018}} and you sit on 90%. \n\nWhen you first arive in lane Yasuo is manageble but already frustrating to play against as soon as he gets {{item:3086}} the bullshit starts.
