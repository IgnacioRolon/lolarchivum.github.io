Do you have to like make one or is it just your account info?","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-06-06T03:25:17.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When someone gets invited to join the PBE servers you'll get an email letting you know you were accepted as well as the steps to set up your PBE account. Since those signups are closed right now, you probably won't be able to get in even if you do find an acceptance letter in your email. I don't have any more information just yet, but you can keep checking the [**PBE status page**](http://status.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/#pbe) for when signups open back up!","replies":[{"poster":"Mãtthew","date":"2017-06-09T02:12:10.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info :D","replies":[]}]}]}
