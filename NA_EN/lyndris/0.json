Now don&#039;t get me wrong lane/jungle distribution is perfect... but I enjoy the fact that TT does not force you to play in such a way that is deemed acceptable. It&#039;s you, your team and skill/knowledge. I&#039;ve won without tanks, without AD(with a mundo on the other team was not very good but still). Now i&#039;m not saying i dislike SR just they way it is played now... Or  perhaps always has? It&#039;s just my two cents and preference.\r\n\r\nI may even start ranked(which i don&#039;t do in any game) (even if it is just to get away from the bots)\r\nIf you would like to add me, do so always looking for relaxed players looking for a fun time! (i&#039;m not TT exclusive)","replies":[]}
