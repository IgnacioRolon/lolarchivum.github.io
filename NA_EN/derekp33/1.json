Once that was done I went to run League of Legends and it wouldn't work because stuff had gotten deleted from the reset so i deleted everything that i could find and I reinstalled. everything was running perfectly but right when i get in game (when we are all by the nexus closed in) the game just freezes and my laptop makes a loud buzzing sound. Ive tried reinstalling several times and ive ran tests on my computer and it says that nothing is wrong with the computer. I always freeze right after the game loads. What do I do to fix that? Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-08-31T21:10:22.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game freeze and buzzing could be an issue caused by a recent Windows 10 update.
