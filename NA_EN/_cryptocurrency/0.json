Intentionally feeding or trolling is reportable.\n\nI recently had a game with a ryze support, but I could tell he was new, because he was really cooperative and happy... but he got smashed so hard it almost looked like trolling. I think he was new to ranked, and I believe the number of instances and the length of their ranked career should be taken into account. While I am talking about bronze/silver and not diamond, to every level of play it's supposed to be about the same skill level ratio. I've seen those funny bloopers with master tier players totally screwing up. We are human beings, with a  myriad of ailments and afflictions that could reduce our overall performance quality. I played a game as WW jungle, went 12/1/13. Then I played another game as WW and went even. Then I played a game as panth vs a Swain thinking I could burst him down.... and I learned a very important lesson in matchmaking that day.\nThe point is, I didn't get mad at Ryze feeding. I just sighed and resigned myself to playing it out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-29T07:13:28.104+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you just *really* have a bad game. Maybe your connection decided to start acting up after the game started, maybe you're just barely making the wrong decisions or are getting outplayed and it's snowballing, maybe your lane opponent is far better than the rest of your team's opponents, or you are getting 4v1'd constantly with no help.

If you look up their account and they are like an Ezreal main ( as in, they climbed from Silver to Diamond playing nothing but Ezreal ) and then suddenly started playing a bunch of champs they dont' do well with, and then played Ezreal and went 0-10, then I'd think maybe they were boosted. If someone has only a few games or no games with a champ and they feed then I usually assume they were auto filled and were just playing something that they actually thought might work but failed with.","replies":[{"poster":" Cryptocurrency","date":"2017-03-29T07:39:31.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the auto fill excuse.

That's probably why you're being down voted. The OP is probably down voted because Riot has already stated several times that bad performance is not reportable.\n\nOP is very specific, asking if you can report a 0/10+ score based on an assumption that they are either boosted or inting, and providing no clear evidence of wrong doing. The score alone is not reportable. And the boosting or inting is nothing more than an assumption based on what the OP wrote. There are valid reasons to have a horribly bad game (roommate started downloading bit torrent, serious lag or computer problems, etc.)","replies":[]}]}]}
