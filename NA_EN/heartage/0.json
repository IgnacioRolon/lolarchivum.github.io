Great. I am so glad i bought the master pass with real money, so i have to wait 1 more week than all of my friends in order to get the same content we ALL HAVE PAID FOR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-03T17:52:52.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a screenshot?
