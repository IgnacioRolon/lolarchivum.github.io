I was informed on the login screen that I could find the reason for my ban if I checked my Email. When I did check my email I was unable to find any email from Riot informing me of why I was banned.\r\n\r\nI sent in a ticket to riot about the issue and am waiting to hear a reply back.\r\n\r\nI checked my account information and found that my email has been changed to a 163 email. This is obviously not my email I signed up with and when I went to try and change my email it informed me that a verification is being sent to the new email that I never changed to. The same thing happened when I attempted to change my password back as well.\r\n\r\nI was never given an email from riot to even request a change to begin with for my PW or Email. Yet now all my information has been swapped over to a new email and pass without my confirmation.\r\n\r\nI have found that other users have been having the same issue as of yesterday with the same email being used to steal accounts. I have provided a link to another issue that a user faced identical to mine with the same culprit.\r\n\r\nPlease riot, help me out. I love your game and I spend a lot on skins cause I love collecting. I would love to play with my friends again, so please help a girl out.","replies":[{"poster":"Naon","date":"2017-07-17T14:23:06.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-07-15T20:33:05.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can help!
