I have yet to get it. I would appreciate actually being rewarded my icon since it costs real money.\n\nAdded: In fact when I look at my purchase history to look for my gift I sent a friend, it's not even there. I gifted Swain to a friend for the RP cost but it's not even showing. It did deduct the RP amount from me.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-11-04T16:10:26.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The evil pumpkin icon as well as the other teemoing icons are still being sent out.
