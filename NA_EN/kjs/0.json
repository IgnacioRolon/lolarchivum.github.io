You never expressed illicit disapproval of Azir being classified as a Marksman in you previous post by the way.\n____\nI asked that question because the message I got from the previous post was that TF shouldn't be named as a Marksman because it's misleading when Azir is named a Marksman and Riot seems okay with it.

AD TF's range ability (Q) isn't going got deal any damage so TF can only rely on his 525 range to deal crits and physical damage. He's probably disadvantaged here. But again, Marksman does not mean ADC according to Riot so I'm digressing heavily on this point.\n• He's squishy. \nEvery ADC, if you want to compare him to them, is squishy and so is Azir and Kayle and Teemo early in the game. \n• He has no instant escape.\nA number of ADCs have weak/no escapes Kog'Maw only has his Ooze for its slow to help him escape and that's not even a real escape.

No escape my ass. \nAzir has his E to escape/disengage, if soldiers are well placed and used it shuts down ganks quickly and post lvl 6 he has his ultimate great for cock blocking entire teams. \nTF, comparatively, has his stun to help him escape and if he's quick enough, he can use his ultimate to escape. \n\nMarksmen ≠ ADC","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olath Quortek","date":"2015-10-01T02:22:28.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol... see it's funny... because Graves, Draven and even Urgot are \"Marksmen...\" XD And maybe we could argue whether or not these champions are marksmen in either their gameplay or thematic but my point is that there is enough inconsistency (especially in secondary roles) to allow for this.

Secondly, they reset your autoattack timer. So the more AD you have, the more they increase your dps. That's not the case for TF - whether he has 100 or 1000 AD, his W only increases his dps by the flat amount of the bonus spell damage (and % of AP if he has any).\nFor example: You autattack 5 times in a given time, so you deal damage equal to your 500% AD.\nBut then you throw in an additional ability in there. As Wukong, you use your Q. First, that one attack deals 110% AD, but also it resets your aa, so let's say you make 6 autoattacks in the same time instead of 5. That's 610% AD + the flat bonus damage from Q. Garen deals 640%, Nasus 600%. Compare that to 500% AD from only autoattacks.\nNow, if TF casts his W, it doesn't reset his aa timer, so he still has only 5 attacks, and so he deals 500% AD. Same as if he didn't use any ability at all, except it gives him flat bonus damage. Therefore, his W doesn't actually scale with AD.\n\nIn other words, if you removed all flat bonus damage from abilities, Twisted Fate's W wouldn't increase his dps at all (unless he built AP), whereas Garen's W and Wukong's Q would.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-10-01T19:00:55.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're digressing. \nI never said they were exact same abilities.\n\nYou said he doesn't have AD scalings because W is an autoattack when champions like Wukong essentially have the same autoattack modifying ability.
