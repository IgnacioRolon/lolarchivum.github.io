There may be other issues with your network like packet loss, or maybe even a change in the routing your ISP takes to reach our server.  I suggest running a [log reader](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader) to get an overview what what's happening exactly.  You'll also get a set of instructions specific to your case to get this fixed up.  Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
