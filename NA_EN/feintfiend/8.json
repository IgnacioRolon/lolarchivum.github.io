She's supposed to be high skillcap yet she maintains a high winrate and a ridiculously high playrate.\nWhat irks me the most is Riven players will never admit how disgustingly unbalanced this champ is, they just flash on you the second they hit lvl 6 and kill you while CC locking you with her stun and knockup.

I would say something like 80% in favor of Riven. Riven needs to miss her W (which will never happen), OR Fiora needs to time right the W against the Riven's insta-stun, with her Parry (Riposte) Which also might never happen. Also, just for the lols, go check Fiora's W cooldown and Riven's W cooldown.\n\nBasically we have here a mind game, where the Riven has two Aces on her hand, her W and her 3rd Q, while fiora only has her W, and needs to play around her own passive hitting vitals against a very mobile bunny. Without mentioning, that once Riven hits 6, she gains a burst damage aoe button that is instant cast and is hard to miss.\n\nYeah, no. Fiora cannot win that. Riven can also aim to exhaust Fiora's mana pool with small trades. The Fiora player needs luck, freeze close to tower, and penalize Riven through RNG passive procs at the correct vital angle.\n\n---------\n\n{{champion:126}} Not sure after the base damage nerfs, probably in favor of Jayce as long as he can keep the Riven down. The bad thing about this match-up is that Jayce requires Muramana, and that, makes his early vulnerable. Jayce is a natural bully against melees, but remember that Riven defies the mana rule, the cooldown rule, the movement price rule, among other rules. I don't know why Riven is allowed to have hard cc and mobility for free. No costs anywhere, just semi-gated by cooldown.\n\n--------\n\n{{champion:122}} Window to win. Requires to keep the Riven down, 60~70% in favor of Riven i would say. The counterplay key is Darius E, he can cripple her combo, will require timing, Jungle assist too, if he happens to lose early. Cause that's what a good Riven would aim for.\n\nThe mind game, is that you either, take the riven W or straight on cancel it with E, cause she can't Q-auto and E away as fast, but then again, her CC is back up faster than your E. Most of the trades will be tanking the damage and retaliate afterwards. She will try to go in as much as possible once your E is on cooldown.

You do not have to be a Darius main to know how to play Darius properly. Lets just agree to disagree at this point because you are talking about a 100% ideal and perfect condition scenario while I am talking about the likely scenario in which you will actually be able to trade/kill because no one who knows how to play the game is going to get into auto range of Darius and are even super cautious about his apprehend (E) range.\n\nThe ONLY scenario this would work in is if you are being ganked or if you flash. The only other scenario this makes logical sense in is when you have phage + boots. \n\nI've played a lot of Darius. I do agree that your perfect combo if they are bad enough to get in melee range is as you listed, but is not very likely and I imagine you only see this in low elo play.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeyphel","date":"2019-04-10T09:45:39.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that is why I said that I would only start combo with E when champion is ranged or there is no other way to engage them. You can perfectly do the full combo if you have flash or ghost and good timing. You say most people know that Darius is dangerous but I keep doing the same strategy and most people fall in it. I let them trade me and let me around 60% hp pre-6 and they would start to play agressive (melees only). When they realize, I am already doing my full combo and they mostly die. It is just a matter of confidence. I try enemy melee champs and give them some confidence to make more agressive movements.
