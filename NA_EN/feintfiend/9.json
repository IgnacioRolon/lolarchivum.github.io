She rushes CDR in her build. Whether spear, cleaver, or deaths dance, she's going to have 20-40%cdr by mid-game, meaning that by minute 15 she's E'ing every 4 seconds. Spacing out about a second between each Q (perfect amount of time for an auto and attack-like move) and her E she can hop infinitely. That IS spam. The Idea that you can play around the cooldowns of a champion whose longest non-ultimate cooldown is going to be around 7-8 seconds by this point (her W, and Q if she wastes all three charges up front) is kind of ridiculous. Most top laners aren't going to have the cooldowns themselves to abuse that window. Darius and Fiora can but surprise surprise they are some of the few matchups that are considered 'tough' by most riven guides and even they come down to skill. This also kind of throws a wrench into your \"Trades mobility for damage/durability\". Especially given that she builds pretty much raw AD with some HP thrown in and her shield having an AD scaling along with its low cooldown Riven can become extremely durable especially when ahead. If she's spacing her cooldowns out and getting her auto attacks in between spells like she should be, she's not going to be left without tools very often. Now, a Riven that blows all of her CD's just getting to the opponent isn't going to live very long once she gets there but that's the players fault for wasting CD's.\n\nNot to mention that most champions that can outpoke her are absolutely bursted by her combo. Gnar absolutely detonates long before he can transform if she manages to jump on him. Jayce can ult her away the first time but there's a strong possibility of him being dove pre-level six.\n\nAnd let's talk about late game. Let's talk about a 1.5-second shield on a 3.5-second cooldown on a champion with a knock-up and stun (also on only a 3.5 second CD) that leaves you about a .75 window where she is unshielded and not CC'ing you. This shield that has a base stat of 215 (Janna's, for comparison, only shields 210 at max level) with a full 100% bonus AD ratio, meaning that at a minimum it's shielding for 435 (Assuming a cleaver, spear, Hydra, GA build, which is nowhere near the highest AD full CDR build available to her). 435. That's not a small number.

Remember when you actually had to think about whether or not to use your ult instead of just spamming it with a Blitz-Q cooldown?  Max-CDR Zed can have his level 3 ult up like every 36 seconds or something gross like that, same with Rengar, and guess what?  Both champs buy Lethality items (that give CDR for some reason).","replies":[{"poster":"nargnargnarg","date":"2019-02-22T06:28:03.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in the day she could hit 40% with just brutalizer and ionian boots that gave 10 and 15 cdr.\n\nThe remaining 15 cdr was obtained at level  1 from runes and masteries","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Anime Fizz","date":"2019-02-20T15:42:37.594+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":46,"body":"https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/platinum/plus/champion/Riven/\n\n49.9% wr 13% pick rate\n\nSo broken guys, its easy to make up numbers i know, but the highest WR riven has got in the last year was 53% on the last patch before they re-reworked ER into shojin, which dropped her WR by 3% because its much worse.\n\nAnyways, OP is using false data/numbers, where are the mods to remove this thread?","replies":[{"poster":"feintfiend","date":"2019-02-20T15:49:29.828+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":23,"body":"The fuck are you talking about?\nhttps://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/8.22/diamond/plus/champion/Riven/Top/\nEdit: This one is recent\nhttps://u.gg/lol/champions/riven/build/","replies":[{"poster":"Anime Fizz","date":"2019-02-20T16:06:04.741+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":4,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=feintfiend,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zp5yRAxZ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-02-20T15:49:29.828+0000)\n>\n> The fuck are you talking about?\n> https://lolalytics.com/ranked/worldwide/8.22/diamond/plus/champion/Riven/Top/\n\nWe are not in 8.22, so good luck trying to use outdated data to prove your point.","replies":[{"poster":"feintfiend","date":"2019-02-20T16:09:20.014+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":11,"body":"50% winrate 13% pickrate (highest top) for a supposedly high skill champ those numbers are way too high.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-20T16:53:59.904+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":7,"body":"Give her an Enerby bar.","replies":[{"poster":"General Esdeath ","date":"2019-02-21T02:33:10.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Warlord Rhinark,realm=EUW,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zp5yRAxZ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2019-02-20T16:53:59.904+0000)\n>\n> Give her an Enerby bar.\n\nThey had an idea like this before with Edge iirc and every big Riven main tested it and came to the conclusion that it made her more balanced for low elo but in high elo she was too strong","replies":[{"poster":"Warlord Rhinark","date":"2019-02-21T06:54:27.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AngusBoomPants,realm=NA,application-id=3ErqAdtq,discussion-id=Zp5yRAxZ,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2019-02-21T02:33:10.360+0000)\n>\n> They had an idea like this before with Edge iirc and every big Riven main tested it and came to the conclusion that it made her more balanced for low elo but in high elo she was too strong\n\nI fail to see how.

Also because she prioritises CDR and has low cooldowns she has much smaller punish windows than other champions.\n\nSaying all that she is definitely on the stronger side of things at the moment due to runes and items, so probably needs some light nerfs to compensate but the OP lying about her winrate shows this is just a kneejerk overreaction. If you look at all the champs listed by the OP, all of them when strong have high pro play presence except Riven, and when Riven is picked it is normally as a counter pick on red side. This is partially because what she brings isn't always suited to the meta in pro but also because she has a lot of bad match ups and her weaknesses are exploitable by a team that knows how to play around them (That and you need a lot of practice to be able to play her at that high of a level).","replies":[]}]}
