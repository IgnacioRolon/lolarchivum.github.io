He is intended to, as are many of his compatriots in the Juggernaut Sub-class. The way to beat him to pick characters that can dart around him, run circles around him. People that can get in, do damage, and get out quickly before Darius can really retaliate all that well.\n\nExamples: {{champion:92}} , {{champion:23}} and many more.\n\nOthers that can beat him are ranged top-laners, such as: {{champion:133}} , {{champion:150}} and of course, the one and only {{champion:17}} .\nThese champs can give Darius (and really any other immoblie melee champ) a severe thrashing, as they can use their range to kite him all day long.\n\nBy denying him the ability to snowball via his strong early-game, you GREATLY reduce the threat a Darius can pose. Now that doesn't mean you can get cocky, because any Darius player worth their salt CAN turn things around if given the chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fízz v2","date":"2018-07-23T16:39:49.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"50-70% pick ban in pro play makes me want to say that he is lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kelg","date":"2018-07-23T16:22:42.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's not really.
