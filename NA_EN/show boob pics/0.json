Not to mention the taskbar icon looks terrible, and theres a loading screen to get into the client now, and the support page has a new theme that Riot is trying to go for. \r\n\r\nThe new theme looks like a preschooler made this. I've always said that Riot thinks they are running a day care with this game, and they are literally just proving my point with these changes. \r\n\r\nNo one wanted this. No one wants this. It looks terrible. When you unveiled your new logo I did not see a SINGLE positive comment, across the league website, or twitter. \r\n\r\nIt is not too late to scrap all of this.","replies":[]}
