And it says I need to purchase it again.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So today was another day for me to go back to playing LOL with my friends, the usual. I would choose either mid or top. HOWEVER, since top was taken I decided to go mid Talon. AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZE, he's not on my champion select. So I thought maybe it was a glitch, and it would go away after the game. No, when I checked the store it said Talon was not owned by me. So then I checked the purchase history to see if for some reason someone might have hacked my account and returned him. NOPE. Any else having this issue? I really enjoy league and I want to continue enjoying it while it lasts.\r\n\r\nP.S I got Talon as a gift from a friend a few months back. (IDK if this has to do with anything)","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-01-21T21:21:58.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked into this for you, and it doesn't look like Talon is unlocked on your account.
