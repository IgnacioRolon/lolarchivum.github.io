Cinematics themselves take alot of time and are quite expensive to make.\n\nAll in all it would make more sense for riot to create cinematics to promote new releases/skinlines. Lore cinematics are very rare and will probably stay that way for a while sadly. The only one's we've gotten are ryze's, jinx' music video and i think the amumu one is lore based. That said they could pick up the whole \"rough animation\" thing they tried again like with darius and mf. \n\nNo character in this game would function better to explore runeterra than runeterra's prodigal explorer obviously.","replies":[{"poster":"Jeddy017","date":"2019-10-04T03:53:28.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> All in all it would make more sense for riot to create cinematics to promote new releases/skinlines.
