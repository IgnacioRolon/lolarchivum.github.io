Since almost beta. I have been a 3s player ever since I started and I still am to this day. Riot, i get you dont care about 3s, but we your players do. So when you get matched 1v3 because your teammates are bots or 1v1 and see who can get fed faster, or even one time we were 3 vs all bots, the play experience goes right into the ground. If I wanted to fight bots I would play Co-op vs Ai. Now i get your busy with the 10,000th {{champion:51}} skin, but could you take 5 minutes to fix it? Its real simple. Make a captcha when you queue up for 3s. That would pretty much eliminate the bot problem. Personally i wouldn't mind doing a captcha pregame so I have 0 bots. It wouldnt be hard to implement and would take like a day of 3 employees programming. I get cracking down on the programs is useless, as more would pop up. But just please, something this simple could make a huge difference. Sorry if I sound angry, I am just a passionate fella. Sincerely, A Loyal Fan.\r\n\r\nPS if you think \"just play ranked\" is a solution, its not. If you want to play a new champ and dont wanna lose Elo, then you can go casual queue. I should be allowed also.","replies":[{"poster":"TheViper7911","date":"2017-07-10T08:44:12.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Its not worth any expense to solve the issue.

Changes in a software product or business logic cost money. This isnt being ran out of a basement. Whatever money it would cost isnt worth it for riot.

Kill the demand kill the supply, just let the smurfs make their smurf accounts. Could be like when you have to select how experienced you are at the game and have a smurf account option and let that bypass waiting till level 30. Of course add a tool tip explaining what smurf account means so newbies don't select it out of ignorance","replies":[{"poster":"Tree Jesus","date":"2019-09-17T10:19:29.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BTW the issue is even worse now. I made a smurf account recently and the first 10 levels were HELL. Every game was at least 3 bots and now bots are programmed to throw games. They roam from lane to lane running it down in order to lose the game quickly. As you still gain XP from a loss. Now I'm stuck waiting in 10 minute queues to play norms at level 10 just so I can have a smurf","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Conphucius","date":"2017-09-11T04:05:43.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously dont think this will work as if there was a captcha before/during champ select or on the loading screen that would cause a game to cease if there was a bot, NO GAMES in low elo or levelling would ever start due to the shear amount of bots that there are.....","replies":[{"poster":"HuffleCrush","date":"2019-06-05T21:02:29.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Giving a draft option for 3v3 would solve it.

I only play the 3v3 because summoners rift is way too time consuming. Just give us a draft option so we can control for bots please!
