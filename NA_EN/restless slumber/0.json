Items in order {{item:3124}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3151}} with {{item:3006}} for your boots. Get fervor as your keystone and only look to fight when you have your guinsoos at 8 stacks. When even or ahead you destroy people with ease. The only problem I have found with this is that you need a hard engage support for when you get your 8 stacks. So I recommend pairing this green guy with this guy{{champion:53}}.\n\nBest of luck in your games and tell me if you enjoy the op Koggles.\n\nEdit: apparently it was a glitch that liandries was procing on his w, so replace with either a void staff or bortk.","replies":[{"poster":"Live2LetDie","date":"2015-11-18T02:29:46.428+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog is beast late game.
