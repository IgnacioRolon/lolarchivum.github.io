Here's my experience:\r\n\r\nOver the last 2 days I was marked as \"leaver\" just because my pc (or the server) crashed after an alt+tab operation. I couldn't even re-log in as fast as necessary to join the game, because the match got already closed.\r\nThis kind of process happened a lot of times during last 2 seasons, so that now I am flagged with leaverbuster after the slightest sign of leave from my side. No matter how good I try to behave, the crash is always around the corner and I am going to get marked as \"leaver\" sooner or later.\r\nAs a result, I am basically unable to regain my originary status, because a single crash of server or of my pc makes my status drop again to Leaverbuster with a 20 minutes queue. And no, I don't have problems with WIFI settings or hardware.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, probably applied to my case, this doesn't represent a corrective tool, but just an obstacle. \r\nI'm talking to you Riot: if it wasn't for all the money I spent on skins so far, I would 100% had shut down my account one season ago.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n- a very disappointed customer","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-10-31T16:53:44.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're having issues with your PC, but [leaverbuster](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) treats everyone equally regardless of intent.

There's nothing worse than being down a man; even a feeder might change his tune, but not having a 5th is just downright intolerable.\n\nI appreciate how leaver buster works.\n\nYou yourself admit this has happened more than once to you. It's not a single event that's flagging you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grim Reaper 8","date":"2017-10-30T23:14:10.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"system sucks the worst ever created","replies":[]}]}
