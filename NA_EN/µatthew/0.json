I can upgrade my abilities with Ctrl+Ability, but I can't actually use any of the abilities with hotkeys. Most of the time, I can fix the problem by leaving the game and restarting my client, but recently that hasn't been working all the time. This has been a problem for me for a couple months, but it has been getting worse lately. It use to only happen in the first game I play after opening the client, but now it will work for one game, and the next, it won't. If anyone has a solution for this, or even an idea, it would be much appreciated! Thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"µatthew","date":"2017-02-06T15:56:14.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was trying to find solutions to this problem else where, but they are all very outdated. One suggested deleting the input.ini file, so a new one could be made. I did this and when I opened the client to play again, my hotkeys worked no problem. Waited a bit and opened the client to play again, and my hotkeys didn't work again.","replies":[{"poster":"Targons Blade","date":"2017-02-10T02:37:19.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you delete the file while you were logged into the League Client?

I tried deleting the input.ini file and the PersistedSettings.json file and got no results from that on the first custom game I tried. Then I tried editing the input.ini file. In my copy of the file all the ability and summoner spell keys were set to \"0\" so I changed them to \"[q]\", \"[w]\", \"[e]\", \"[r]\", \"[d]\", and \"[f]\". The next custom game I loaded into, I was able to use my hotkeys!\nTo test the theory that the settings in the input.ini file should be the ones I listed above, I tried setting a few of the variables in the file back to \"0\". If I was correct, the hotkeys for spells set to 0 should not work and the hotkeys set to the appropriate key should work; however, when I loaded into a custom game, all the hotkeys still worked.\ntl;dr\nThe solution posted here did not work for me.\nI noticed the input.ini variables were all set to zero and tried changing them.\nHaving a variable set to zero definitely does **not** cause the associated hotkey to fail, but changing the values in the input.ini file worked for me\n\nAlso... I've only tried a few custom games with this solution. Due to the random nature of this bug, I may not have a permanent fix","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nomad Wanderer","date":"2018-02-04T05:09:42.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Targons Blade,realm=NA,application-id=osqw6G4M,discussion-id=QkEeYnNA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-10T02:37:19.931+0000)\n>\n> Did you delete the file while you were logged into the League Client?

Randomly, my keybinds just fail to be there. quitting the match, and relogging instantly gets them back in. I don't understand why / how it happens. it seems random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nevimus","date":"2017-12-16T13:19:52.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue, and I know this is an old thread, but no. It doesn't work. The hotkey issue happens at random. I tried this fix months ago, and nothing. I figured I'd just keep reconnecting every few games and it would be fine. I just got out of a game where it didn't work at all. My friend has this happen to him every-so-often as well, so I know that it isn't my computer. It happens regardless of whose wifi I'm on or if I use an ethernet cable, so it isn't the connection.
