DON'T CLICK IT","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alot of people I know have recently been sending me links about a \"Riot easter point event\" either intentionally or via having their accounts compromised by a bot. Regardless I think this is something that needs to be known should people not realize it but this is a SCAM.\r\n\r\nI have been playing league for quite some time and cannot remember a time when Riot has done a free RP event for sharing something as simple as a code. There are also multiple signs that this is an unofficial, not Riot supported page.\r\n\r\n**1) The footer for the fake site does not contain the same information or structure that is used by Riot.**\r\nRiot Forum footer:\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ee45fa2a4d8144c6d15f1434ed9ff3e8.png\r\n\r\nRiot home page footer:\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ee45fa2a4d8144c6d15f1434ed9ff3e8.png\r\n\r\nAnd here is the footer for the \"events\" page:\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/da171e50c24fb72523f5484584f9220b\r\n\r\nObviously there is a bunch of information missing, images, links and even a google ad. Which you will never see on a Riot page.\r\n\r\n**2) completely obvious but the URL's are different, Riot web pages always begin with the same structure.\r\n**For example \"http://region.leagueoflegends.com/en/...\" for example the URL for the Project skin page is \"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/skins-project/\".\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons I won't share the full link to the scam riot points page but the start of it begins with \"http://riotpoints...\"\r\n\r\n**3) If you ever open the link up on mobile (which I hope you don't) you will notice that the site does not scale.**\r\nIt is not responsive aside from the header which even then does not collapse the navigation. This is rather big (for me anyway as a designer) since Riot imo does a very nice job on making every aspect of their website to respond well to screen size changes.\r\n\r\n**4) Lastly, every link takes you to EUW.**\r\nIf you happen to click on any of the links after visiting, which I advise against. You will see every region link goes to EUW by default.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this will help people, I would like to assume many of you probably know that this is a scam but there are probably still many people who are gullible and will click and share this to get free Riot points.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood luck on the Rift and stay safe!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-12-07T18:00:54.227+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for helping to keep community safe!
