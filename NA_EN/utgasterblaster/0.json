It revolves around fifteen champions at a time and if you use anything but them, you typically are at a steep disadvantage or your just plain lose due to inefficiency. \r\n\r\nEvelynn\r\nAzir\r\nIvern\r\nKalista (still)\r\nKog&#039;Maw\r\nRengar\r\n\r\nThese champions and plenty more are basically just crappy versions of more meta champions.\r\n\r\nYasuo\r\nOrianna (Barely)\r\nRakan\r\nTwitch/Vayne\r\nCaitlyn\r\nKha&#039;zix/Shaco\r\n\r\nYou play a competitive game like this, whether in blind or ranked, to do well and have fun. You cannot have fun or do well when using a champion that is outdated and at a disadvantage. They are just outclassed by others and simply have no reason to be played besides &quot;Fuck it, let&#039;s do something weird&quot; or &quot;I have a weird urge to play this champ&quot;. This usually ends in you not doing as well as your main, which is probably a meta champion, and you never play them until the next urge. \r\n\r\nThe Meta is way too strong in this game. You can outright just lose because you picked a lower tier champion, and in a game like this? That is bad. It&#039;s not hard to change numbers around in coding. Literally would just need tweaks here and there for balancing but I suppose Rito is too busy looking at the next event, skin or champion to bother fixing the older/unusable ones.\r\n\r\nI win games just fine on certain champs but struggle on others simply because they don&#039;t do enough in their kit. I just want a fun, balanced game; Instead of the top heavy farce this is.","replies":[{"poster":"Death by Glamour","date":"2017-06-20T15:10:47.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"orianna has been meta since season 3...\n\ntwitch is stupidly strong\n\nivern is still one of the best junglers\n\non hit kogmaw is way under the radar atm","replies":[{"poster":"UTGasterBlaster","date":"2017-06-20T15:21:09.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bottom list were replacements of the top list.

Today I spent a game of Rek'sai top vs Yasuo. I was owning him until his Phantom Dancer. He instantly starts out-damaging me with just that vs my Rav Hydra and simply auto-wins. The fact that an assassin item has both tank and assassin elements and basically makes Yasuo, a super meta champion, a god, is a problem. Yasuo is too strong and needs a nerf soon. He's played almost every game and does well no matter what or who is playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Darkone7001","date":"2017-06-28T17:55:44.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think he is ultra busted, because I'm really bad and win lane against him with kled most games. But I do think his kit is way to overloaded, he has an answer for literally every situation and has 2 really strong passives, when he gets ahead he gets ahead hard, but I tend to be able to shut him down early so hes useless late game, I would suggest champions like heimerdinger, Darius, Kled. (These champions almost always win lane against him for me) I just all in him at level 2 or 3 and snowball my lane, but I know not everyone is good with these champs, that's just the only advice I can give, and frankly phantom dancer is a tad to op, its made adc and some assassins very hard to deal with. Yasuo just needs something tweaked or removed like one of his passives or a cooldown increase on his dashs, it just gives him way to much flexibility and outplay potential. Not overpowered, just overloaded, That's my opinion anyways. {{champion:122}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:74}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
