When recalling, the Voidling that he turns into a Poro-Voidling isn&#039;t showing up exactly as it should. It&#039;s a pure blue colour, instead of the purple that we see elsewhere. The Voidling pets that are spawned are the same however. Only the Voidling within Snow Day Malzahar&#039;s recall animation is a pure colour.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-02-22T19:50:46.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report!
