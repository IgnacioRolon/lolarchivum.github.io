Her voice is extra loud even if sound is turned down to 1 and also lags my FPS every time she appears on my screen.","replies":[{"poster":"moonstones","date":"2016-07-12T20:43:12.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lanapeed! \n\nThanks for the report! I've been playing this skin quite a bit (and against her a few times), and I haven't noticed this. I can poke around and see what may be going on. :) Would you mind giving me a copy of your DxDiag? \n\nyou can grab it by - \n\n* Press [Windows Key] (that is the key on the left side of the space bar, between ctrl and alt) + 'R'\n* Type dxdiag in the search bar and hit 'Ok'\n* The DirectX Diagnostic Tool will open. Press the \"Save All Information...\" button.\n* Choose where to save the file (for example, your desktop).\n\nThanks in advance! :)","replies":[]}]}
