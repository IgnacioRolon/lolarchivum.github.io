I had to revert to the old client due to how laggy it was (and I'm on a brand new, top of the line computer, and I'm very close to the server, never have connection problems to games etc). The lag he's talking about in champ select can be particularly bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Youngster1013","date":"2016-11-18T20:50:13.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is definitely not the internet connection, because I tried to use my really good 100/100 wifi which was expensive and still it doesn't work.
