Now they are nerfing her because she does her job and they were all \"Oh shit, she actually does it well\" (her last line of nerfs were literally because she was shutting down mobile fighters). All they need to do is increase her Q cooldown and mana cost. The reason she is so strong and does so much damage is because her Q is up every 3 seconds due to her main build path easily hitting the 30-40% CDR mark. The ability itself doesn't do that much until you get hit with it 3 times before your second rotation of spells comes back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Papa Andrei","date":"2017-01-18T01:04:46.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her kit is designed as not a tank or fighter but as an \"Anti\" to tanks, squishies, and mobility.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-01-17T06:23:03.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because Riot hasn't realized that giving a tank with hyperscaling defenses an AoE %HP 2 part nuke was a horrible, horrible idea.

You're not going to spin that in any way that people would actually want to play against. You can say it'll be less DPS, but it'll feel worse. Not only that, her Q will be pretty crap in comparison. You'd shift so much power onto her E that she becomes absolutely reliant upon it for anything worthwhile in terms of damage despite it being more conditional than her Q. Riot tends to not want champions to have to put all their eggs in one basket, especially not when that basket will come with a stun (of decent 2s duration), flat damage, and percentage damage on top of that. That ability would end up being deemed overloaded pretty quickly, and they wouldn't be wrong. That would be a terrible move. \n\nNo, what they should do: just nerf her damage overall.

Imo the %damage from a tank should be avoidable so that their burst can be played around. Putting %heald damage on her E instead of her Q only makes it more reliable and harder to play around (and you'll get Poppy to max E first). \n\nSion's is a great example of %health damage on tanks. There is noticeable counterplay to his shield bomb. Poppy just has an easier time landing both ends because of her wall stun or because people forget to walk out of it (possibly due to creep block).","replies":[{"poster":"WoonStruck","date":"2017-01-17T17:00:38.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poppy would still max Q first for the same reason Maokai maxes Q first. \n\nMaokai would be cancer if his %HP damage was on his Q.\n\n_______\n\nYeah, %HP damage on a point and click CC isn't the healthiest, but its healthier than what poppy currently has.

If you're going to hit her laning, hit her earlier phases so she can't roll as quickly or easily. Don't make one of her abilities overloaded just because it would change her damage pattern because that ability now becomes incredibly hard to balance thanks to the parts of it involved, being flat damage, %hp damage, and it being a potential point-and-click CC that reapplies the flat and %hp damage. That's not something I think anyone wants. \n\nRaise the cooldown on her Q, make the %hp scale with rank, or maybe just nerf the %hp damage altogether, but don't just move the %hp damage to another ability and make it unnecessarily overloaded.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Looknook","date":"2017-01-17T17:56:39.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't Singed targeted flip also %HP?","replies":[{"poster":"Ralanr","date":"2017-01-17T17:57:33.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed is also weird and I can't discuss his role as a tank in general.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fishlord","date":"2017-01-18T01:19:13.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Anidan","date":"2017-01-18T01:21:06.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do... do you not realize I don't even play League right now?
