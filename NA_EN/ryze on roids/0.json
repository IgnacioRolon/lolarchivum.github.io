To any of the support mains who don't have their heads stuck 5 feet up their asses, I respect you. It's only the tumors that I am about to talk about next that I cannot stand. \r\n\r\nSupport mains, support mains. Where would league be without you? You're really the backbone of our team, aren't you? Why yes indeed you are. Some of the best players in the world are support players! Thresh is one of my favorite champions as well. However, there is a certain class of you people that really makes me amazed at how thick someone's skull may be. Who are these people I talk about? Support mains with a god complex, or essentially, entitled supports.\r\n\r\nNow what do I mean by these \"entitled\" supports?\r\nThese supports are essentially supports who uses the excuse of them being a support as a kind of safeguard so that they are unable to be blamed for literally ANYTHING that happens to them in the game. \r\n\r\nWho do these support players tend to play?\r\nThese players tend to play enchanter champs {{champion:267}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}}  from what I noticed. They use the fact that enchanters are not made for doing damage in order to avoid being flamed, whereas if they played a full damage support such as Zyra or Brand, they would be accountable if they did absolutely no damage. It's not to say that all the enchanter mains are like this, but most of the supports who are entitled tend to play those champions.\r\n\r\nThese entitled players push the blame of the entire game of everyone BUT themselves. If the toplaner fucks up just ONCE? GG, open top our toplaner sucks. If the midlaner fucks up just ONCE? GG, open mid our midlaner sucks. If the jungler fucks up just ONCE? GG, open jungle (though I suppose that doesn't make sense) our jungler sucks. If the ADC dies even ONCE? GG open bot our ADC sucks. Buuuuuutttt.... if you die once? Or screw up some kind of mechanical play (whoopsy, you're a Janna player so that's literally impossible unless you're an inter)? Nononononono, it's STILL your ADC's fault for not being able to cover you. It may be your midlaners fault for not roaming your lane even though your midlaner is an early game LeBlanc against a Talon with tiamat. Perhaps it's your toplaner's fault for not tping! Oh, but you didn't even have any wards, did you? Oh, but he's taking ignite instead of tp? As a Pantheon??? Still his fault, you know what I mean? See, in these player's eyes, nothing that happens in the game is their fault. Let's say the team with this entitled support is on the red side and the midlaner shoves hard and then places a ward in the blue team's red side. He has vision of raptors and near the end of red buff. He SEES the level 6 Eve and he VERY, VERY clearly pings on the botlane itself careful pings. He even says in chat that Eve is red side. Stupidly, this entitled support would STILL try shoving a lane as fast as possible, even though his ADC (who is actually probably a competent fucking player) pings him to let the wave push towards them because they actually know that Eve is nearby. So then let's say this support players go to control word the tri, and the Eve MAGICALLY appears and then all of a sudden the support dies. These players, EVERY SINGLE GOD DAMN TIME, will SPAM ping their ADC for not following up on them in a 2v3 as an early game god damn Vayne who is probably not even level 6 yet. \r\n\r\nThese types of supports make the game unfun for EVERYBODY. Not only are they quick to blame literally anyone for any mistake, they will somehow find a way to completely mitigate anything they do wrong. If they miss a skillshot like a Janna or Nami Q at point blank range on an enemy they know has no flash that may or may not be an immobile god damn Jhin, they'll probably blame it on the \"hitbox\" of the ability, and not the fact that they blow dick. But again, if let's say an Azir only gets 4/5 of the people on the enemy team in an otherwise perfect shuffle, HURDURDURDURDUR, THIS AZIR IS TRASH LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. These supports might not have any vision on any part of the map (most likely due to the fact that the enemy support are vastly superior to them in every aspect of not only the game, but in real life too). They'll blame the jungler for not being able to take jungle objectives like dragon when they're the primary reason that the team has absolutely no sight anywhere. Seriously, you might as well  be holding up a sign that says \"I'm a fucking retard, please shun me\". \r\n\r\nOverall, these support players tend to be the ones who ruin the game for everyone the most. Honestly, I'd rather play with an 0/10 Yasuo than play with any of these motherfuckers. They flame, troll, and don't even know that they're probably the least functional humans on their team (that is, if they even are human). These probably also have the least brain  cells and also the least chromosomes in their genome. \r\n\r\nBut in reality, again, not all supports are like this. Actually, the large majority of supports are fine. It's only these select group of people that are a problem. So really, to you functional supports, congratulations, you guys are cool. But to you pieces of shit who ruin everything for everyone, do me a favor and learn how to play your role.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR : If you've got your head stuck up your ass and you play support, uninstall.","replies":[]}
