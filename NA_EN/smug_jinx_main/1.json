If I could get a response so I could understand what is going on, that would be very appreciated. Also, I am not sure where to post this so I hope I got it right.","replies":[{"poster":"Broporo","date":"2017-05-18T22:56:26.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In your case, I'm guessing that the client isn't able to get a solid connection from our servers and isn't able to load your personalized shop. If you do own all the currently purchasable skins, \"Your Shop\" will still load but with no skins to choose from. The shop won't glitch, it just won't have any options for you to pick. \n\nI'd suggest checking up on your [**network settings**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) to make sure you can get that shop data to load. Hit me back if that doesn't work and we can take a closer look.","replies":[]}]}
