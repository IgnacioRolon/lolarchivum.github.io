Kog is a really, really high risk champion right now. So if you plan on playing SoloQ with him it might be pretty difficult. Quinn can go top or mid right now. I don't think she is the best pick-up either but you can do more with her.","replies":[{"poster":"Luker22","date":"2014-02-04T22:47:58.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alright thx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kermit666","date":"2014-02-05T04:38:13.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you enjoy playing with either of these champions specifically? If not, maybe wait for a different sale to get an ADC you're comfortable with.\n\nKog'Maw needs allied help for protection, he can become a hyper carry but only if he survives to late game. Quinn was fun to play during free week and has better roaming, and vision to hopefully escape beforehand vs AoE slow for Kog.\n\nI doubt you are enjoying their specific skill set, but rather ADC in general (else you'd know which one to get). So then you should think why not wait for Jinx, Lucian, Caitlyn, Ezreal to go on sale. Jinx has no escape but great tower destruction and good range too. The other 3 all have some sort of dash skill to cross walls quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowNinetails","date":"2014-02-05T02:47:30.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Quinn because IronStylus.\n\nBut for real, though, Kog is much more of a risk as he's exceedingly slow with no escape mechanism. He needs a whole team to be built around him much in the same way as Yasuo. In #yoloqueue, you're not as likely to find that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blind Trooper","date":"2014-02-04T22:59:48.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is free right now, so I would highly recommend trying her out before you buy her. She's awkward and not for every adc, certainly, but if you can perfect her, she is a lot of fun and definitely different from every other adc.\n\nKog'Maw is more typical \"stand waaaay back and right-click to victory\" but he will teach you the importance of positioning more so then almost any other adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Minehead","date":"2014-02-04T22:56:55.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, {{champion:96}} would be my choice.
