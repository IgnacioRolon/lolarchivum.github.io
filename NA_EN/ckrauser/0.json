These profiles can be linked directly to the game's exe so I don't have to manually switch the software profiles each time I switch games. The problem is whenever there's an update, the link to the exe breaks and I have to relink it. This isn't very time consuming and more of an annoyance more than anything, but my question is: is there a way to link to the most recent client release easily?","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-04T23:47:56.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really curious as to why the software has to modify game files for effects, for example I know other brands that can save profiles through their own software.  We don't support third party applications or in cases of running into issues like this.  You'll have to reach out to the support team for those brands to see if they can help.  Good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Ckrauser","date":"2017-02-05T07:53:58.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for responding!\n\nAs far as I can tell it's just looking for the exe to know when it's running...? It's not modifying the files in any way. A solution I think might work would be a shortcut always named the same thing that pointed to the most recent version of the client. \n\n\nTo better illustrate, here is where the game sits right now:\n_C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\solutions\\lol_game_client_sln\\releases\\0.0.1.161\\deploy\\League of Legends.exe_\nOn updates, the whole '0.0.1.161' folder gets renamed, which messes the programs as they are still trying to find the old path. If there was a shortcut like I mentioned the programs wouldn't have problems as the shortcut name wouldn't change.\n\nIn order to achieve this on my own I might just end up having to make a shortcut point to a batch file, which can then send it to the proper release using parameters to get past the ever changing 'release folder' (0.0.1.161) name... \nDidn't want to muck about with that but I guess I'll have to go there =/","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-02-07T16:56:08.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This all sounds pretty messy, and I can't imagine not running into problems.
