I decided to gank mid and i didn&#039;t end up ganking due to safe playing on the enemy mid. Right after i leave the enemy flashes in and kills our mid. From this point on my team starts flaming me and telling me that i need to never play league again and to never gank. I muted my team. So i proceeded to farm all game long, only to unmute my team after a while had gone by. I could see that my team was typing to the enemy team, telling them that i was stealing lane farm from the mid laner, (pushing the lane) and that i need to be reported. My team was going to report me for stealing lane farm... so i got reported by everyone on my team and the enemy team, and now i cant use the chat but for the 5 messages i get. What report is there for having a bad game??? Because obviously riot games is not doing enough to actually make sure the problem players are getting stopped from using chat. I have never, EVER been affected by the chat restrictions, and suddenly, 4 years into playing, i can&#039;t talk to my team because a group of players decided that i needed to get reported. Clearly riot games doesn&#039;t even check if the report is valid before they get you restricted from chat. God forbid a 4 man premade decides that they want to report you just for fun.  I literally got chat restricted because i muted my team for flaming me. I am outraged, and i feel bad for riot games, because they have made a system that is more flawed than i&#039;ve ever seen and hurts honest players. This is the only problem that i have ever had in League Of Legends and as a loyal player, I expect an answer and an investigation. I will continue to play this great game, and I hope that riot games cares enough about the average player to explain all of this to me, because i clearly don&#039;t understand where riot has gone with all of this.\r\n\r\n                           Thank you\r\n                                             alexchop","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-06-14T22:34:41.558+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Clearly riot games doesn't even check if the report is valid before they get you restricted from chat\n\nIf you feel your chat-restriction is not justified, please post the 2 games provided in your in-client reform card, and I'll take a look.\n\n> God forbid a 4 man premade decides that they want to report you just for fun.\n\nIt only takes a single report to trigger a game review. Additional reports or premades do not increase the likelihood of review. Additionally, your team was not a 4 man premade.\n\n> I literally got chat restricted because i muted my team for flaming me\n\nYou can never be punished for the behavior of others. Your punishment is only related to your own. In this case it was related to the thing you said in chat.\n\n> I expect an answer and an investigation.\n\nI'm happy to look at this with you.","replies":[{"poster":"alexchop","date":"2016-06-14T22:50:57.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry tantram im not sure how to do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Tantram","date":"2016-06-14T23:04:28.888+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Login to the client, and you will be presented with an in-client reform card.
