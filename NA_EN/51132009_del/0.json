As an alternative, what would be the best way to get this account perma banned so i cant access it anymore? This game is way too distracting and addicting, it has to go. What if i posted it for sale? would that get it perma banned? Would be faster than waiting a ridiculous 15 days, the outcome is the same anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2017-03-21T16:54:01.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can certainly understand wanting to take a break and focus on other things, and it's totally fine to just leave the as it is.
