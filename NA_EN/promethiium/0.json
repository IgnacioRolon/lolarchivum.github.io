Players have to decide to either ban him or play him because they do not want to face him. I feel if his passive life steal was removed he would be far less of a hassle to the lower Elo players. Unless there is a full rework in the making for him I think this could be a decent way to pull him back from being a priority ban/pick.","replies":[{"poster":"The thigh guy","date":"2019-03-21T18:49:48.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh the fix to him is the same fix they should apply to Draven.

Why do you think there are constant patches to champs that almost never see play? Was this post was just so you could be on a forum, because my reasons are to try and get the low elo area to be more enjoyable to a larger population of the game so they don't quit and move onto something else.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgotten","date":"2019-03-21T17:59:46.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your reply is too emotional.

There is no hate to the champ just a hope for the meta to not be based around whether he should be played or banned because he is such a late game carry. Like i responded to the other post, his Passive states \"Nasus drains his foe's spiritual energy, giving him bonus Life Steal.\" So by that he should not heal at all from hitting minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgotten","date":"2019-03-21T19:09:02.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fabulous Velour","date":"2019-03-20T04:56:03.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's really the only thing that allows him to survive in lane early on, when he's weakest.
