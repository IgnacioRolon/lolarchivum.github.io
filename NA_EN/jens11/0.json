Unless my resources haven't updated, I see you have 2 losses and your series isn't over yet.  I don't see any queue doges either.  You should still be going through your series, so it's strange if you received a failed notification.  My advise would be to just keep going, you're still in this!","replies":[{"poster":"Jens11","date":"2017-04-01T00:10:03.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My profile says I have 68 LP and that I'm no longer in a series.

To clarify, you still lose and gain LP during your series.  You lost 2 games in your series so far which brought you down to 68 LP.  Hope that clears things up, but let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Jens11","date":"2017-04-01T21:06:05.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the assistance with this.

I only have 2 games lost in my match history under \"Ranked Solo/Duo\" and it said i lost the series.
