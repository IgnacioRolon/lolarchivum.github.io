This technology has a much larger impact than just giving loss forgiven, including:\n\n- Reduced LP for winning teams\n- Disabling of Ranked Queues\n- At times, disabling of the login entirely\n\nThis is not enabled on a per-game basis, and cannot be retroactively added unfortunately.\n\nLoss Forgiven cannot be given for situations such as yours mainly because it leaves it open for abuse. Imagine a team is getting trashed and someone decides to leave the game, meaning the other 4 people on the losing team do not lose LP as they are given \"Loss Forgiven\". As you can imagine this would be abused left right and center, so unfortunately there's no system is places to account for this at this time.","replies":[{"poster":"What Is Smite","date":"2014-12-07T02:24:46.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the contrary with the new Leave Buster System they added, it is more viable now to do that to ranked games as you can end up with a perma ban if you dodge too much. I doubt that players who will try to abuse this will put in the extra effort to make hundreds upon hundreds of accounts just so that they can climb the ranked ladder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"8985365471881L2","date":"2014-12-07T00:51:43.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when do you ever receive loss forgiven for an AFK? lol","replies":[{"poster":"rare based chum","date":"2014-12-07T00:52:51.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't it make sense to not have a loss go against your account if there are an unbalanced number of present players?","replies":[{"poster":"FedAsFuk","date":"2014-12-07T02:11:22.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no because again it would be abused to the point where nobody would ever drop LP because of loss forgiven","replies":[]}]}]}]}
