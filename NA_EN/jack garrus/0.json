And from here I asked myself: is the same for Steam games? That is, the same scenario, if steam closed the games I bought tomorrow I could lose them forever and still not have the right to compensation. I know that in the US Steam has added in its contractual terms the fact that you can't do any class action against it: is this thing true? Would it also be in europe? If it is like this I think I will stop buying games on these platforms and return to the old dear cd rom","replies":[]}
