I decided to buckle down and get to gold, so I am only playing champions where I really excel.  I start doing really well and win my lane in every game.  Then after I win about 5-6 games, I going on a crazy losing streak and I was always curious why this happenend.  I always thought you were matched based on MMR so when you join a game you would theoretically have a 50% chance of winning, but increase those odds if you do well.  That is not the case.\r\n\r\n&quot;Each player is assigned a number that represents his skill level (MMR) which is determined by the outcomes of his previous games. With this matchmaking rating, the system will attempt to assemble two teams as fairly as possible to create a game wherein both teams have an equal chance of winning.&quot;\r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide\r\n\r\nThis means if you are doing really well at an individual level they will place you on a team with players that haven&#039;t been doing as well; therefore, decreasing your chance of success.  Instead of placing you on a team with a 50% of getting players with similar skills, they place you on a team with worse skills than you because you have been playing well.\r\n\r\nThis is why is so damn hard to rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"zepdrix","date":"2017-08-19T07:27:54.537+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"No you're misunderstanding how that works.\n\nLet's say you're in Gold 5 (1500 MMR)  but you're on a nice win streak.\nSo maybe your MMR is around a Gold 2 level (1700 MMR).\n\nTo make the teams fair, you will often be placed with a bunch of Gold 2 players,\nbecause that's where you fit in best.\n\nThey don't pair you with a group of opponents on your same level and then balance that by giving you crappy teammates.\n\nThat's not how it works.","replies":[{"poster":"RogueWill","date":"2017-08-19T08:06:29.257+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not much better when you have to be several ranks higher in order to get to your real rank or lose a few games so the system can reset itself.

That's my real rank and since there is no more rewards up until challenge (that is way out of my league) and suddenly having 2 jobs have cut my free time more than what I though it would then I stopped playing as soon as both ladder went into gold. My proms into gold were actually against plat because my MMR was so skewed (also the system dropping me from G4 into B2 from the reset didn't help much either). The games were actually balanced as it was my actual level (instead of the stomping I could do in silver) but it added a few extra games that I could have avoided if we had a single ladder system instead of two ladder working together. Having 80% win rate for around 30 games in silver is not really a wining streak, is just playing outside your real rank.\n\nDid I climb? yeah I did, in relatively short/average time. (80 game for solo and 150 for flex since I was playing solo on both modes) but if my rank had truly been around low gold I would probably have had to double that amount of games to counter the stupid system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MysterQ","date":"2017-08-19T08:25:23.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze2 in Flex and climbing with 80%+, suddenly my opponent's had a Gold top lane (vs my bronze) and a Plat mid (again vs my bronze).\nAnd I know Flex rank is different from solo/duo.
