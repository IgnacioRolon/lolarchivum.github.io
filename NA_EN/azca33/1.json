Even small updates.","subforum":"[ARCHIVED] Help & Support","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the last several months, patching has been a nightmare for me.  For a tiny update, it takes about an hour or more to complete.  \r\n\r\nRight now, I have been updating for the last hour and I have been stuck on each percent for 5-10 minutes.  Today's update is tiny too!","replies":[{"poster":"Porocles","date":"2016-10-19T17:30:43.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scanning and updating files can take a bit of time, and will vary depending on the specifics of your PC.  For example, if you have a slower hard drive or even connection then it can take a bit longer.  Unless you're specifically getting any errors, it's best to let it be.  Closing it out midway could cause the process to restart and scan for file corruption.  Hang tight until it's done!","replies":[]}]}
